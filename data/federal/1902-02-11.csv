Mr R EDWARDS,-Can the Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House what amount of money has been expended by the Government of Victoria in trying to establish the beet-sugar industry in this State ¥",14

IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION AGT. Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,- I understand that some Italian immigrants, who probably started from their homes before the Act which prohibits men from coming here under contract could have been known to them, have recently arrived here. As. their case seems a hard and-difficult one, I wish to ask the Prime Minister if, under the circumstances, some executive action could be taken to lessen the harshness of the operation of the Act.",14
2,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"It must not be forgotten that the Government have not interposed obstacles in the way of persons who booked their passages or otherwise altered their positions before the 7 th August last-the day upon which the second reading of the Immigration Restriction Act was movedcoming here. The passing of the measure - the assent to which was given on the 23rd of December-was , in itself, notice to the world of the new conditions. I - am aware that there may be cases of hardship, notwithstanding that those facts, which were in themselves strong notice; not only to persons living at a distance who proposed to come here, but particularly to the shipping companies, with whom it rests whether people shall reach our shores at oil. I am quite prepared to take into consideration the representation which the honourable member has made, but I shall nevertheless be very much impressed with the fact that the introduction of certain classes of immigrants largely depends upon the. shipping companies, and I told a deputation from the principal shipping companies which waited upon me before the measure became law that the companies had already had sufficient notice. There are, however, cases in which it may be possible to observe some leniency towards wliito immigrants in consideration of the circumstances under which they shipped.' Those cases must be dealt with with discrimination, and upon their particular merits. X cannot make any promise as to any particular set of persons or number of men ; all I ' can do is to endeavour to administer the law in the spirit of justice, so that no hardship shall be imposed upon individuals, apart from those who surrender themselves to be imported under contract.

Sir PHILIP FSTSHi-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The bookkeeping clauses are the difficulty. The Postmaster-General has not been able to see his way to the adoption of a uniform stomp without seriously interfering with revenue of smaller States. On consideration found that the difference is greater than was at first apparent. i DUT Y ON JEWELLERY:",15
4,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, uppn notice I. Is it a fact that before the introduction of uniform' duties of customs and - excise, States allowed jewellery in use to be imported for repair without payment of duty, on a bond being given by the consignee to secure the return of the jewellew within a stated time ? 2. Does the'Minister not consider that such import? for repair and return are not goods ""passinginto another State"" within the spirit and meaning of-section 02 of the Constitution Act, and that the transaction involves no loss of revenue hitherto or properly receivable ; and, if such be his opinion, will allow such goods to pass from State to State withable out payment of duty on security being given by bona, or otherwise, for their due return when repairs are effected, or, in default, payment of the duty ?",15
5,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are asfollow :1. Yes. In some cases. Full information has been wired for to the different States. 2. It is considered that the goods are goods passing into another State within the meaning of section 02; but the Government has under consideration proposals for meeting the difficulty, and will shortly announce their decision. OVERTIME-CUSTOM S . DEPARTMENT. PAPER. Mr HUME COOK - I desire to ask the for Trade and Customs the following questions,- upon notice:1. Is it true that certain officers of his department are being compelled to work overtime without extra pay, and that not even "" tea-money/' is allowed ? 2. If true, will he take steps to have the practice altered ? I have been informed that those who do not get ""tea-money"" are themselves at f a u l t ; but hundreds of hours of overtime have right been worked, for which no pay has been",15
6,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The answer to the honourable membeHs questions is as follows :Officers arc working overtime to meet the present abnormal pressure of business, which it is hoped soon will cease. Tea-money has in all cases been allowed. If the merits of the case cannot bo met by extended leave the payment of overtime will'be considered ; but overtime geneit has been rally is not favoured. I am sure that the honourable member will agree that officers con fairly be asked to work a little longer during a temporary pressure of work.",15

10,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"A reply has not yet been received from the department, hut I shall endeavour to get thp information for the honourable member as soon as possible. In Committee of Ways and Means : Consideration resumed f rom 7th February (vide page 9869). Excise Duties:Item 135. Sugar-pe r cwt. of manufactured sugar, 3s., until the 1st January, 1907, less from the 1st July, 1902, a rebate to the grower of 4s. per ton on all sugar-cane delivered at factory for manufacture therein, and in the production of which sugar-cane white labour only has been employed. The rebate is calculated on cane giving 10 per cent, of sugar, and is to be increased or reduced proportionately, .according to any variation from this standard.",16
11,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," In pursuance of the understanding which was arrived at on Friday morning last, I move That after the words ""grower of"" the words '' sugar-cane only "" be inserted.",16
12,Mr BASIFOKD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I see no necessity for the amendment. The item, as it stands, is quite definite enough.",16
13,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," As I understand the position it is this: It is intended to give.a rebate of £ 2 a ton upon cane sugar grown wholly by white labour, and we propose similarly to allow a rebate on beet sugar, because we do not wish the growers of beet"" to be handicapped within the Commonwealth by being compelled to pay the same rate of excise as will be exacted from the growers-of sugar-cane who employ black labour. We believe that beet sugar will be produced by white labour, and we desire special consideration to it . On the other hand it is suggested by honourable members opposite that no rebate should be given upon beet sugar, and that it should pay the same rate of excise as must be paid upon cane sugar grown-by black labour. We do not think that is fair, and we ask the committee to support our view. upon, Mr MCCOLL (Echuca) - I propose to amend the amendment by inserting the words ""and beet "" after the word ""cane.""",16
14,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If the amendment is negatived, the honourable member will not be precluded from introducing words which will make the rebate apply specifically to beet sugar as well as to cane sugar, and if we are defeated upon the amendment now before the committee we shall raise no objection to such an amendment.",16
15,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I propose to deal with TARIFF. this matter in my own way. Whilst I have raised no objection to the amendment of the honourable member, I fail to see the reason why it has been interpolated at this stage, because it could have been moved later on just as well. In proceeding as the honourable member has done, the question of beet sugar is merely understood, but it does not appear on the surface of the amendment. I think it is very much better that it should appear in that way, because then we shall know exactly what we are doing; otherwise it is quite possible that honourable members might not be fully seized of the scope of the discussion. I move That the amendment be amended by the insertion of the words ""and beet"" after the word ""cane."" The more one studies this sugar question and the problems connected with it , the more difficult does the whole position appear. It is more difficult to know what to do as regards the industry itself, and it is still more difficult to know what to do as regards the interests of the Commonwealth at large. I am entirely at one with the representatives of Queensland who desire the abolition of Kanakas as quickly as possible. At the same time there is a doubt in my mind, after reading the literature on the subject, as to whether in the extreme north the industry will be carried on with the same facility as it has been. That, of course, remains to be proved ; it remains to be seen whether the bonus that will be given by the - committee for encouraging the use of to apply white labour in the north is going to be effective so far as regards the supply. There is no' doubt that the committee is entirely at one that we should use sugar grown by white men. For the use of the Commonwealth we require 180,000 tons a year, .and with the growth of population, which is sure to take place year by year, that demand will very rapidly increase. We are not growing enough sugar now for our own requirements. In Queensland we grow 1.30,000 tons a year, and in New South Wales some 15,000 tons. Roughly speaking the supply is 40,000 tons short of the normal requirements of the Commonwealth. That, of course, is a serious question which we have to face. Under the dislocated conditions of the cane-sugar industry, it is very problematical whether the Queensland supply, which is now short of our requirements, will be kept up in the immediate future.",16
16,Mr CRUICKSHANK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In New Wales the yield is about 23,000 tons.",17
17,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We cannot take any one year as a criterion. The growth of the plant varies from year to year. Early frosts may k ill the plant, and we may have the yield for New South Wales and Queensland fluctuating to the extent of 20,000, 30,000, or 40,000 tons in a season. But 145,000 tons is, I think, the normal yield of the two States. Not only have we to face the question of the probable shortage of the supply, but we have also to face this other very important question-that the sugar business in Australia is largely in the hands of one monopolistic company.",17
18,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No ; of the growers.,17
19,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is very largely in the hands of one monopolistic company, and whatever duty we may impose-sa y £G per ton-it is protected to that extent. I am not acquainted with any one connected with the company, but I know the position it holds with regard to the industry, and I know to a certain extent the arbitrary and domineering way in which it controls commerce in this particular article. It does almost entirely as it pleases, and if we are not very careful, any bonus we may give will not go to the growers, but will probably be mopped up by the company. In Australia the growth of sugar is very small compared with the growth of the other agricultural products : it is only a little over 2 per cent. Then there is another aspect in which we have to look at the question, and that is that sugar is the basis of a great number of our industries-jam-making , fruit preserving, canned milk. I suppose there is no article so generally used by mankind as sugar. We have to look at the matter not onl}' from the growers' point of view, but also from the consumers' point of view. If our fruit-growers have to pay an increased price for sugar it will come very hard on them. There is no comparison between the f r u it industry and the sugar industry. The inductio n of cane is only £619,000, while the production of f r u it is nearly £2,000,000. Therefore, we have to look to the in terests of these people and to see that sugar is available to them at a reasonable rate. While I intend to vote for the rebate, I also intend to vote that it shall be given to the users of sugar in manufactures. I had intended that it should be givenonlyon exported manuSouth factures, but, on considering the matter more fully, I think that those people who are building up a great industry here on which so many persons are dependent, are fully entitled to a rebate on all their manufactures.",17
20,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member should give a rebate to those who eat the articles.,17
21,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Where shall we get the money for that ?,17
22,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We shall discuss that point later on. I am only mentioning it incidentally now.,17
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member is touching them on the raw.,17
24,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Honourable members who interject are not always concerned for the revenue. I put the question of the prosperity of the producers before the mere question of revenue. If we do not extend this concession to the growers of beet sugar, then we are not doing the right thing. I can see no reasonable excuse for not treating the two products alike. If we were confining the rebate simply to North Queensland - I could quite understand honourable members desiring to limit it to the Mackay and Cairns districts, where black labour is used. But when it is being given to all growers of cane sugar throughout the Commonwealth, then we are bound in justice and honesty to give it to those who grow sugar from beet.",17
25,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What quantity is grown from beet ?,17
26,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We shall see about that directly. We desire to encourage the growth of sugar, and the people who use it are not particular whether it is grown from cane or beet. What they want is to be able to get their sugar at a reasonable rate. As regards the two industries and their value to the - Commonwealth, there is no comparison between the cane-sugar industry and the beet industry. The latter is infinitely of more importance in every respect to the future of this country than is the former . In the first place, beet-sugar is a product that will assist and develop agriculture more than will any other product that can be named. It enriches the soil, whereas cane impoverishes it . Where beet has been grown, one can grow almost any other product, but where cane has been grown, one can grow very little. need in this country, above anything else, not only diversity in manufactures, but also diversity in products of the soil. Our honourable friends on the other side, who have been talking so long about the primary industries and their desire to help them ail they possibly can, will now have an opportunity of doing one of the best services to those industries that they could possibly have, by encouraging the growth of beetsugar. W it h the exception of perhaps very cold places, it is a commodity which can be grown almost over the whole Commonwealth. It provides a market for the farmer almost at the door. It means a very large increase in the employment of agricultural labour, because from the time the seed is sown, up to the reaping of the harvest, labour is employed constantly. It is probably the best handmaidwecould have toagriculture. W it h its refuse it provides a supply of fodder for cattle. It also provides very largely a means of manuring the ground. It means a great improvement in dairying. It is one of the most important features in connection with the dairying industry, with which it will work hand in hand. And, properly treated, it will yield just as much sugar as the cane. In America the growth of beet-sugar has increased enormously during the last twenty or 25 years. Of course we shall be told that the experiment has been tried in Victoria, and that it has failed. In America it was tried first in 1830, and then in 1838. Several spasmodic attempts were made to establish the industry, but they did not succeed until 1869. It is not an easy industry to establish, especially in a country such as ours, where people will not give to the tillage of land that close and continual labour and industry that is applied in other countries. That, of course, will remedy itself in time. They must learn to apply the labour required for the growth of other products beyond that of mere grain. 28 K Beet is different from grain. Wherever grain is grown it impoverishes the land, but' where beet is grown it improves the land. In America large estates which had been rendered almost worthless by the close cropping of sheep, and the continual growth of wheat, have been restored to abundant fertility by the production of beet, and the making of sugar.",17
27,Mr HENKY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,In rotation with what other crop does it improve the soil 1,18
28,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"B y itself it will improve We the soil. America's experience has been very productive of lessons that we might learn. There they had great difficulties at first, but for the last twenty or twenty-five years the growth of beet-sugar has been a very great success. It is now running canesugar very closely indeed. I can quite understand that my honourable friends from the north may think that in encouraging the growth of beet-sugar we are raising a rival to the cane-sugar industry, but we have to consider the good of the Commonwealth as a whole, and while we may be raising a rival, at the same time we are raising a rival that will employ more labour, and do a great deal more good than if we allow the cane-sugar industry to stand by itself. Would it be a fair thing to allow those who may be inclined to take in hand the growth of beet which is produced by white labour to go for the next five years without the bonus, whilst they knew that the growers of cane sugar in other parts of the Commonwealth were receiving this advantage, in order that they might be able to carry on their industry without the aid of black labour ? From whatever point of view we look at the subject, I think we are bound to give this rebate to encourage the growth of sugar from beet, and to give the industry the same chance as is given to those who produce sugar from cane. If we look at it from the point of view of the general good of the Commonwealth, we encourage an industry that will be manifold-indeed , almost illimitable-in its advantages. From the point of view of the consumers and the producers we are bound in honour to give this rebate. If it is given to any portion of the sugar industry, we are bound, I hold, to give it to the beet growers as well as to the producers of sugar from cane.",18
29,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Wentworth),-We have all been delighted with the very interesting speech of the honourable member for Echuca, with a great deal of which many of us may agree. Honourable members know that the question of giving an advantage to the Queensland sugar growers, forms part and parcel of the legislation of this Parliament, in connection with the Kanakas. In the debates that took place upon that subject, reasons were given for the contention that in some parts of Queensland it was absolutely necessary to give every possible inducement to the encouragement of the employment of white labour. It was agreed that south of a certain line, white labour could very well be employed without any detriment to the health of the labourer, but above a certain line going north, it was a moot pointwhich I venture to think has scarcely been decided yet - whether white labour is possible or not - The rebate which is given by the Government is not given upon any principle whatever. It is purely a matter of political/expediency. I do not use those words in censure of the Government, but purely to designate what the real nature of the transaction was.",18
30,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There were special circumstances in the case.,19
31,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We had to deal with the special circumstances, as the Minister says. Under those special circumstances, it might, perhaps, have been better policy to confine the rebate to a certain part of Queensland, north of the line below which we know white labour can be employed. But I quite recognise the difficulty of differentiating in that manner, especially as we have to deal not merely with the southern portion of Queensland, but also with the northern portion of New South Wales. Still, there would be nothing absolutely out of principle in doing that in the special circumstances of the case. But why is it proposed to give this rebate ? What is at the bottom of the whole question 1 It is not a matter of a commodity; it is essentially a matter of climatic conditions. We give a rebate not because the article happens to be sugar-cane or beet, or anything else, but because the cane-is a product which is grown essentially in tropical and sub-tropical climates, where it is difficult' without some inducement to prevail upon people to employ white labour; and because we have in the drastic legislation which I have mentioned agreed, within a certain number of years, to make black labour impossible. That is the whole question. Is there anything climatic connected with the production of beet sugar ? Is there I any difference between the production of beet and the production of potatoes 1 We know well enough that beet sugar is produced in Germany. Indeed, it is produced in many of the countries of Europe. It is not a tropical product; and if we introduce this alien element into the giving of the rebate we absolutely destroy the whole raison d'etre of the policy we are proposing to initiate. That policy will be reduced to an absurdity, and, furthermore, it will contravene one of the principles of our Constitution, which compels us to deal with equal fairness with all the products of Australia. In proposing this rebate at all, we are, to some extent, contravening the Constitution. But there is no Constitution, any more than there are rules of Parliament or laws, which should be our master and not our creature. Therefore, although what is proposed to be done may, to some extent, seem to run counter to the spirit of the Constitution, yet under the peculiarly exceptional conditions of Queensland, especially the tropical part of it, we desire to add to the other arrangements we have made, by giving a rebate to the planters who cease employing black labour. As a necessary corollary we have to include other sub-tropical parts, such as the north of New South Wales, where cane sugar is also grown. But why should we extend those conditions to beet sugar ? Is there any sense in doing BO?- Is there any sense in it, if we look at it purely from the climatic aspect 1 Prom that point of view there is no reason why we should not give a bonus to every other product in Australia. I repeat that we have, to some extent, broken the compact of absolute equality throughout Australia; we have broken that compact intentionally, and for reasons of high policy. But we do not want to go further than is necessary in the breaking of it. This beet sugar has in its favour an import duty of £ 1 0 a ton, as against £ 6 per ton for cane sugar.",19
32,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member must not forget the bounty feeding of beet sugar by European countries.,19
33,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"This difference clearly shows that we have not forgotten the conditions of beet sugar production. I venture to say, and I challenge honourable members opposite to deny it although, of course, I have no absolute proof of the statement-that when the Government proposed this magnanimous way of dealing with the northern planters they never thought of doing the same for the beet sugar-growers. There is no sense in doing go no further. so. We have gone far enough in differentiating. Furthermore, we were told by many honourable members, when some of us pleaded for a little extension of time on half of the planters of Queensland, that everything that was essential was given, and that the proposals of the Government in connection with the exclusion of Kanakas were sufficiently magnanimous for all purwould poses. We accepted that, as it evidently was the view of the majority of the House. But now we are to be told, after going still further, in order to give a chance to the planters-in order to induce them more quickly to get rid of the black element i their labour-that a product which happens to produce the same results and is concerned commodity in Australia. with the same commodity-sugar-bu t posal which can be grown in any part of Austraas lia, and has nothing climatic in connection with its production, as cane sugar has, should be treated in the same way as cane sugar, and that we should throw away the revenue of the country for the sake of that commodity. I do not suppose for a moment that a large quantity of beet sugar would be grown here, but we are dealunder ing with principles. We have no more right to give a rebate, or what is duced practically a bonus, upon that particularWales, product, than we have to give it on potatoes, or anything else that is grown in Australia. Therefore I hope that the committee will pause. I dare say that there is a sort of general feeling that what is now proposed is only fair. I suppose the feeling that dominates some honourable members is that justice. if we give the rebate to the growers of for sugar, we should give it to. the growers will receive a considerable of beet for sugar. But I can assure honorunder able members that that is to a large extent a confusion of ideas. There is no analogy between the two cases. If we do this as matter of high State policy for the canenecessary grower in the tropics, we are not doing thing harsh against the grower of beet who produces his commodity in the more temperate climates of the Commonwealth. Let any honourable member who thinks it is unfair differentiate between the cane-grower and the beet-grower put that idea from his mind. The fact is that we are simply straining a point in order, in this great national crisis in a certain part of Australia, to lighten the load of the growers of cane sugar, but at the same time we should stop 2S it z where it is absolutely necessary, and should",19
34,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," It seems to me that if there is any confusion of ideas in respect to this matter, it rests with the beacting leader of the Opposition. He speaks of this proposal as being a bonus to the growers of beet sugar. But as a matter of fact it is the removal of a disability under which otherwise the growers of beet sugar suffer. I do not pretend that it is likely that the degree of protection and encouragement that is suggested, even in this proposal, will lead to the production of 'a great quantity of beet sugar in Australia.' The conditions under which the beet sugarn industry is carried on in Europe tend to' destroy the creation of an industry in this But this prois, I think, eminently fair, inasmuch it proposes to place every one producingsugar on an equal footing. For the honourable member for Wentworth to attempt to compare the present suggestion with a proposal to offer a bonus for potatoes shows that he has not considered the matter; because there is no excise - upon potatoes, and there is no proposal to put the potato-growers a disability. The honourable member for Wentworth would place the sugar profrom beet at Tenterfield. New South under an excise of £ 3 per ton, whilst in the case of cane sugar produced not 100miles away he would give the grower the benefit of paying an excise of only £ 1 perton upon his product. That does not seem tome to be on the' lines of high policy or any kind of policy equivalent to equity and I am satisfied that the New cane South Welshman who is growing cane sugar advantage the proposals of the Government. I am sorry that in order to solve the question arising in Queensland, without undue a hardship to the persons concerned, it is to propose customs and excise anyduties such as are proposed in this Tariff. Personally, if .it were not for the black labour problem, and the desirability of making its settlement as easy as possible to for those who have hitherto employed black labour under State legislation, I would not consent to a customs duty of £ 6 per ton being placed on sugar, nor, for that matter, would I consent to an excise duty of £ 3 per ton. Sugar is an article which enters so largely into the every day life of the peoplethat it is only under the most exceptional circumstances we are justified in making it so dear as these proposals involve. The whole circumstances are exceptional, and these Tariff proposals are, I think, a part of the understanding tacitly agreed to when the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was under consideration. Nevertheless I understood all along that whatever degree of encouragement was given to the white grower of cane-sugar would be extended to the white grower of beet-sugar.",20
35,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member did not tell us that when the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was before us.,21
36,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Surely the honourable member understood that. If he did not it is remarkable that he did not make some allusion to the iniquity of the Tariff proposals the Government. If he calmly contemplated that men on land suitable for the growth of beet-sugar should invest their money in plant and labour to carry on the industry, .and then be compelled to be at a disadvantage of £ 2 per ton in the markets of Australia as against the grower of canesugar, I have not a high opinion of his sense - of justice. I contend that if we have land so suitable for the growth of beet-sugar that it -«an compete upon anything like fair terms with cane-sugar grown within the Commonwealth, those prepared to go into the in-dustry should have a chance of doing so. We do not know what alterations may take place iathe next year or two i u the methods .adopted for the manufacture of sugar from beet. We are making conditions which will - obtain for years to come under this Tariff, - and we should be prepared to meet all probable contingencies. I trust the committee will see the justice of putting all upon the same footing. The honourable member for Wentworth referred to the fact .that beet-sugar carries a higher customs - duty than does the cane-sugar, and ho spoke an though that made a difference in the price of beet and cane-sugar within the boundaries of the Commonwealth. Of course it makes no difference at all. Personally I am inclined to think that the customs duty on beet sugar is too high, but it makes no difference onoe both sugars are competing withih the boundaries of the Commonwealth. If it were admitted into the Commonwealth at as low a rate of duty as canesugar, the price of sugar all around might be a little' lower than it will be under the proposals of the Government ",21
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,How much beet sugar is grown now 1,21
38,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not know that any beet is grown within the Commonwealth now for the purpose of manufacturing sugar. I do not put it forward that there is any likelihood under the present circumstances that much beet will be grown for the manufacture of sugar. I simply take up the position that the beet-sugar growers, if the industry is started in the Commonwealth, will have to compete with the cane-sugar growers in the same mai-ket, and they should not be placed at a disadvantage, roughly speaking, of £ 2 per ton. I do not say it is likely that a beetsugar industry will be created. I am inclined to the contrary opinion, but we of should not give one grower of sugar an advantage over another, and I trust the first suggestion of the honourable member for Echuca will be adopted. The honourable member's suggestion to make a rebate on sugar duties to the manufacturers is a different question, and one upon which I am not inclined to agree with him. But I trust the committee will see the justice of adopting his suggestion to remove the £ 2 a ton disability which the present proposal imposes upon the beet-sugar industry.",21
39,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Robertson) The statements made by the honourable member for Bland must commend themselves to honourable members generally. Here is a contemplated industry that has not yet been established. The views of agriculturists throughout Victoria upon the subject were canvassed some time ago, and they asked for an increase of the import duty on sugar. That is conceded in this Tariff, and if the industry is established they will have all the}' desire. But the industry has not been established in any one of the States. Assuming that the industry were established, why should not those concerned in it be put upon the same footing as those engaged in the cane-sugar industry in Queensland? The proposal of the honourable member for Echuca seems to me to be a reasonable one, and I think he is to be commended for bringing it forward. The adoption of his proposal can do no possible harm, though I am afraid it will do no good, because the beet-sugar industry has not yet been established. I hope the proposal will be adopted, because its adoption will show a desire on the part of the committee to foster an industry which many agriculturists say can be established here, and which they are desirous of establishing.  to a rebate if it had not been for the special condition of abolishing black labour ?",21
40,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I think not; but as we are giving a rebate we should serve all alike. If I remember correctly, the distinction made in the Victorian Tariff was greater than under this Tariff.",22
41,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Beet-suga r £ 1 2 per ton.,22
42,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In spite of that greater protection, no beet-sugar industry has been established, and as the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca can do no possible harm, I hope it will not be opposed.",22
43,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I cannot agree with the last two speakers. So far from carrying out what were the proposals of the Ministry, the suggestion of the honourable member for Echuca is to depart from the very principle on which we gave the concession to the growers of canesugar. It was recognised that throughout the world cane-sugar is grown, almost without exception, by black labour, and that in depriving the northern plantersof black labour we were entering upon an experiment which might prove successful, but which might, on the other hand, prove to be ruinous to the industry. Parliament was therefore called upon to make some special concession, and even those whose principles are against such a tremendous difference between the excise and the import duties, yielded their principles in recognising the special and tional circumstances of the cane - sugar growing industry in the north of Queensland. We are now asked to go further than that, and to extend a concession, given for particular reasons to one description of sugar, to all sugar, whether it is usually produced by white labour or not.",22
44,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We would not have consented to the excise if it had not been for the black labour question.,22
45,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Then the honourable member would have reduced the import duty?,22
46,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Yes .,22
47,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That would have amounted to the same thing as regards the difference between the tAvo. The honourable member for Bland might possibly not have agreed to the excise ""if it had not been for the black labour question, but he certainly would then have demanded a reduction of the import duty. We have agreed to an exceptional margin between the two duties, for the specific reason that we were inflicting what must for a time at any rate be a blow to the cane-sugar industry of Queensland, and the exceptional treatment was given to lighten the blow.",22
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes , but we are was giving that exceptional treatment for all time.",22
49,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is not actually for all time, because Parliament can alter it, I admit that we are making a sort of moral agreement by the way we are dealing with the question in the Tariff, and many of us on this side sought to avoid that. It has been maintained in the past, as regards the competition between beet-sugar grown"" by white labour and cane-sugar grown by black, that, even with the protection given in Queensland, the beet-sugar from the continent was likely to injuriously affect the cane-sugar growing industry in Queensland. There have been attempts made to secure an increased duty upon this bounty-fed sugar, in addition to the - protection given by the Queensland duty upon sugar, previous to federation 1",22
50,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That was ineffective, owing to over-production.",22
51,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I know it was; but even in Queensland they were for years demanding that drastic treatment should be meted out to this bounty-fed sugar. We have to consider the fact that wherever beet-sugar grown by white labour has excepcome into competition with cane-sugar it has been able at any rate to hold its own. Now we are asked to give a considerable preference to beetsugar, under the suggestion of the honourable member for Echuca. As regards outside competition, we are asked to give locally grown beet-sugar a protection of £ 1 0 a ton, as against continental beet-sugar, and we are asked to give a protection of only £ 6 per ton to the locally grown cane-sugar.",22
52,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The protection against continental beet-sugar will affect the locally grown cane-sugar equally with the locally grown beet-sugar.,22
53,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Of course it will, but we are asked to give this protection of £ 1 0 a ton to the white beet-sugar grower, as against a protection of only £ 6 per ton to the white cane-sugar grower. What may be the effect of that ? May we not he .giving an advantage to Queensland with one hand, and taking it away with the other May we not be encouraging a competition within our own borders of beet-sugar against cane-sugar ?",22
54,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We are encouraging canegrowers sugar growers in New South Wales now wealth. practically to the extent of £ 5 per ton.,23
55,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"But in giving this advantage to locally grown beet-sugar, we argument. may be creating a competition with Queensland eane-sugar, and we know places it has been shown that where the conditions are equal, beet - sugar grown by white labour can successfully source. - compete with cane - sugar grown by black labour. There is that prospect in front of us, and, seeing that the beetgrowers sugar industry has not been established I think we should not try to establish i lines which are special lines given to the growers of cane-sugar for a particular reason-that whereas cane-sugar is grown in other parts of the world by black labour, we are practically compelling growers Queensland to grow it with white labour. We give the special consideration to them for that reason, and that being so, I see reason why we should extend a similar sideration to beet-sugar, which is grown white labour wherever it is grown. Under these circumstances, I support the objection - of the honourable member for Wentworth. I agree that if the conditions were equal, and beet-sugar had been grown by black labour in Australia, it would then be fectly legitimate to say that the growers beet and cane sugar should be treated alike. But the conditions are very different. What beet has been grown in Australia has been grown by white labour. It can be grown in the temperate zone, where white labour may be employed. Therefore, the special condition which is given to sugar cane growers, because we compel white labour be substituted for black, does not apply to beet, and I shall not support the same differentiation.",23
56,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I had not the advantage of hearing the speech delivered by the acting leader of the tion, but I confess that I am charmed hear that he gave expression to what, from his political stand-point, are revolutionary views. I understood that the honourable memthe ber is one of those who advocate always throwing of industrial puppies into the water and leaving them to sink or swim. Now it appears that my honourable friend wants ? Parliament to go out of its way to give an advantage of £ 2 per ton to the cane sugar-growers of his own State and those of Queensland as against the beet sugarof any other part of the Common",23
57,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It is evident that the honourable member did not hear my,23
58,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That was the subthat in other stance of it .,23
59,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member has heard it from a perverted,23
60,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It appears to me that this is the position so far as the sugarof New South Wales are concerned : yet, They have been growing cane sugar by t on means of white labour, and they now desire to obtain the advantage proposed to be given to those who have been compelled to substitute white for cheap black labour. They desire to be placed on the same footing as in the cane-growers of Queensland, who up to the present tune have been growing sugar by means of black labour, but they no do not desire to extend the privilege to the congrowers of any other State. Is that conby tention consistent with my honourable friend's professions of free-trade? W it h regard to the argument raised by the honourable member for North Sydney, that sugar beet is always grown and can be grown successfully by means of white labour, I agree that the perbeet-sugar industry is essentially one for of white labour. But the beet-sugar industry depends as much on labour conditions as does the cane or any other sugar industry. Beet sugar requires a great deal more labour in its production than does cane sugar, and I fail to see how any one with any sense of justice can consistently advocate that those engaged in the sugar-beet industry should to be handicapped to the extent of £ 2 per ton in comparison with the producer of cane sugar. When we consider the relative advantages of the two industries to the countries in which they are established, we find that there is no comparison. I admit that the Opposicane-sugar industry is a valuable and to excellent one, which the Commonwealth should do everything in reason to encourage, but atiy one who has studied the history of two industries will not contend for one the moment that sugar-cane growing does as much good to the country in which it is established as does the beet-sugar industry. Cane is produced in"" very much the same way as maize. It does not require the high degree of culture that sugar beet demands. In order that it may be produced with success it is necessary for 'the sugar beet that the land should be worked into a fine tilth, and kept just as clean as an onion bed. That involves the employment of an enormous quantity of labour. A great deal of labour is required for the work of weeding and thinning out.",23
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And therefore beet sugar cannot compete with cane-sugar.,24
62,Sir GEOHGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Ye t it is said that it-ought to carry an additional handicap. Mr A MCLEAN , - In any case it should not be placed in a worse position than the cane-sugar industry. I do not know whether it can compete with cane sugar on the same terms, but it employs a very great deal more labour, and unlike the cane-sugar industry, it assists a great many other, industries. The by-products of the beet are most valuable. The exhausted slices constitute one of the best kinds of food for stock that can be produced. A Royal commission sat in Scotland for several years, and after taking evidence as to the best possible kind of food for dairy stock, reported in favour of the sugar beet plant. The commission reported that it was better than any other kind of food upon which they had experimented. It is a most valuable adjunct to the dairying and fattening industry, and therefore it does far more good to the country in which it is established than cane-sugar can possibly do.",24
63,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Why was it not a success in Victoria 1,24
64,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Because the company which entered upon the manufacture of beet sugar here did not obtain enough of the raw material to make it pay. I am not prepared to say that beet-sugar can compete on even terms with that produced from cane, but we should at least place it on an equal footing with cane-sugar. It appears to me that there are only two positions which we. can support logically. Either we are tb give this advantage as a bonus to those who have been growing cane with black labour in the past, or we are to extend it to those who produce sugar in the future from cane or any other plant. If cane-sugar grown in New South Wales, which has never employed black labour in this industry, is to receive the benefit of £ 2 per ton, then the beet-sugar industry, if it should become established here, or in any other part of the Commonwealth, should be placed on the same footing.",24
65,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is it not entirely a matter of climate 1,24
66,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No . Beet-sugar can be produced in almost any climate. The best tests of sugar-beet that I have yet seen were obtained from beet grown at Tenterfield, near the borders of New South Wales> and Queensland. Sugar-beet grown there was analysed by the Government Analyst at Sydney, and gave a yield of 22 per cent.",24
67,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Ye t the industry was a failure there.,24
68,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No attempt was made to establish the industry there. The people sowed only trial plots, and waited to see whether the industry established in Victoria would be a success. No doubt the climate and soil of New South Wales are admirably suited for the production of beet, and the same remark will apply to a great deal of territory in Queensland.",24
69,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The tablelands of New South Wales are best adapted for the cultivation of beet.,24
70,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Bee t requires very rich land. Good soil is obtainable on tablelands as well as in the valleys and lowcountry.,24
71,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The climate at Tenterfield is during a portion of the year very much like that of an English winter 1,24
72,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not know anything about the climate there, but I am aware that the experiments made in the cultivation of beet at Tenterfield were most satisfactory. My honourable friend must admit that the cane-growers of New South Wales, who have never employed black labour, should not be placed in an. exceptional position as compared with the sugar-beet growers in New South Wales, or in any other State. At the present time there is no one interested in the beet-sugar industry here except, perhaps, the Govern-* ment of Victoria. The Government of this State have a thoroughly up-to-date beetsugar plant equipped with all the latest improvements, and probably equal to any of its size in any part of the world. It can treat from 400 to 420 tons per day. If we handicap that industry by £ 2 per ton as compared with the cane-sugar, the plant owned by the Government of Victoria will become confiscated, or valueless, practically, because it would be utterly impossible to establish the industry under such a disadvantage. «1_ m i",24
73,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What is the plant doing now 1,25
74,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It has been idle for the last two or three years.,25
75,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Then how could it be confiscated ?,25
76,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There is no reason why the Government should not be able to sell it under the existing conditions. When I was at the head of a Government in Victoria, I was in treaty with a proposed company for the sale of the plant, and it is quite possible that under the present conditions the Government will be able to sell it at its fair value for use either in this or some other State. If we go out of our way to impose an additional excise duty of £ 2 per ton on beet-sugar as compared with cane-sugar, we shall render it impossible for the industry to be established within the Commonwealth, and in that way the plant will become valueless. It would be impossible for the Government to sell the plant. That would not be just. Look at it as we may, it is not just to give to New South Wales, which has never employed black labour in the sugar-cane fields",25
77,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"PATEESON - Yes , she has.",25
78,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Did the Government agree to the importation of the labour'(,25
79,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,PATEESON - The blacks are there.,25
80,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Queensland Government assisted the establishment of the cane-sugar industry in that State by means of black labour, and if we are not going to give this advantage to the growers of any product other than cane, from which sugar is obtained, we should confine any benefit we give to the cane grown by those who have been producing it by means of black labour and not give it to any future growers of cane with white labour. To do so would be most unjust. If we adopt this system as a national policy, as I think we should, we should extend it all round, whether the sugar is produced from cane, beet, sorghum, sugar-maple, or any other plant from which sugar is obtained, provided that the sugar is of the best and can be supplied on the same conditions, and for the same price as other sugar. [ should like honourable members to consider this matter. I have not the remotest interest in the sugar-beet industry. I was one of those who tried to establish it here. Whatever money I put into the venture is lost, and I do not regret it . The experiment was worthy of a trial, and I was prepared to go into it . I have not the slightest interest in the industry now, because the company of which I was a member transferred the plant and factory, and everything belonging to it , to the Government as mortgagees, and I have no intention of entering upon the industry in future. I speak in a thoroughly disinterested way. I believe the proposal is fair all round-for the Commonwealth as a whole.",25
81,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is very true, as the honourable member for Wentworth has said, that probably the Government when introducing the proposals with reference to excise, had not in mind particularly the sugar-beet industry. Of course, the sugar-cane industry was in existence, whereas the beet-sugar industry was not; and no doubt our attention was more particularly directed to the former. But I can assure the honourable member that we never dreamt for a moment of dealing differently with the two industries-favor ing one at the expense of another; and when the honourable member comes to consider the matter he will see it is utterly impossible that a proposition of that sort can be accepted by the committee. If we have protection against the foreigner, well and good; but what is proposed is that there should be protection of one industry against another-the sugar-cane industry as against the sugar-beet industry.",25
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There is no sugarbeet industry.,25
83,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Not at present, but no doubt the suitability of our soil and climate has been proved, and it cannot be very long, I think, .before the beet-sugar industry will be established. We hear from honourable members who know most about beet sugar that it employs at least quite as many hands as does the sugar-cane industry.",25
84,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,A great many more.,25
85,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And gives ""a larger amount of general employment.",25
86,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,To what extent is a duty of £10 practically prohibitive t,25
87,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I cannot tell at this moment.,25
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The Minister cannot tell without consulting the Colonial Sugar Company.,26
89,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I know something about the figures of that company, but I am sure honourable members do not expect that I can cany all of them in my head. It is one thing to provide for protection against foreign sugar, whether cane or beet, and another and very different thing to suggest that we should utilize these provisions for the purpose of giving protection to the cane-grower as against the beet-grower. Such a proposition is utterly impracticable. What do we find ? The cane industry has, at least, been established, while attempts in connection with the beet industry have been failures. The honourable member for Parramatta doubts the possibility of the beet industry being successfully established here.",26
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,T did notsavthatatall.,26
91,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If we read by the light of past experience, we see that the difficulties which the cane-growers have overcome, have not been overcome by beetgrowers ; and, under the circumstances, is it tolerable to provide that one industry shall be subject to a disadvantage from which the other is free ?",26
92,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The cane industry is subject to a disadvantage from which the other is free.,26
93,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Not at all ; but I shall follow the subject a little further. The proposed legislation is not intended to be confined to the northern part of Queensland, but applies to the whole of Australia. It applies to those districts in New South Wales where sugar-cane is at present grown without coloured labour-wher e no necessity has been found for such labour-and yet those cane growers, who make no alteration in procedure as regards employment, are to have the full benefit of the rebate.",26
94,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That only shows the folly of the rebate.,26
95,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The highest excise is £ 3 per ton, £ 1 chiefly for revenue purposes, and £ 2 as a sort of toll for the employment of black labour, which we do not wish to encourage. When beet growers do not employ any black labour, can it be reasonably contended that they shall pay the toll which is exacted from those who do employ that class of labour? It seems to me simply preposterous to make a proposal of that sort. I carry the argument a little further. In New South Wales there is no necessity to employ coloured labour in connection with cane sugar-growing, or any other industry, and the soil and climate of that State are as favourable to beet-growing as are the soil and climate in any other part of Australia. If my friends on the other side attain their object, the position would be that the cane-grower of New South Wales will pay an excise of £ 1 per ton, while in the very next field the beetgrower, who is employing the same description of labour, will be subject to an excise of £ 3 . To state the effect is to show the utter absurdity of the proposal. It is suggested that the sugar-beet industry cannot be established here, and in regard to that there may be room for differences of opinion. I am inclined to think, and hope, that the industry will be established; but, arguing from present conditions, we find that the cane industry has been more easily established, and that it exists and flourishes, whereas the beet industry does not. How can we, when there is no question of black labour, insist on subjecting the industry, which may arise, and we hope will arise, to a disadvantage as compared with its competitor? Such a contention is neither fair nor reasonable, and the more we look into the matter, the more we come to the conclusion that the proposal cannot be defended from any point of view.",26
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Parramatta) The argument of the Minister for Trade and Customs would be ,quite right if there were two industries competing side by side, as he supposes. Honourable members on the other side assume in their arguments that there is a A'ery extensive beet-sugar industry in Australia. As a matter of fact, there is no beet industry, and the question is whether we are going to take steps to establish an industry such as may, at some future time, give us all the trouble and humbug that the cane sugar production is giving us today.",26
97,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the honourable member propose to extend this advantage to future cane-growers?,26
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Did the honourable gentleman see how I voted the other night ? If so, he would not have asked the question.",26
99,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member votes in such an erratic fashion that one cannot quite follow him.,26
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member is voting, all the time to encourage future cane growers with a high duty. I am not, and do not intend to. hope the position is now clear to the honourable member. The difference between the two industries is that the beet industry is not now in existence, whereas the cane sugar industry is, and is giving us all this trouble, discussion, and anxiety, as well as compelling the country to pay huge sums in order to extricate it from its present difficulty. The honourable member for Gippsland told us that beet sugar can never compete with cane sugar, and he gave his reason for that statement. The honourable member says that the beet industry requires better land and better tilth, and consequently much more labour must be employed. For these reasons, so far as tropical Australia is concerned-and , indeed, so far as the continent, as a whole, is concerned-bee t sugar can never hope to successfully compete with cane-sugar.",27
101,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Bee t competes with cane in America.,27
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not know anything about America; I am talking about Australia. If the honourable member says that beet sugar is competing with cane sugar in America, I take his word; but I ask, at what price is that being done ? What duties and what bounties are there in America ?",27
103,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Bountie s have been superseded for five years. Mr. JOSEPH COOK*-And what are the duties remaining ?,27
104,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The same as on the cane sugar.,27
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And I suppose these duties are prohibitive ?,27
106,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes , they are prohibitive.",27
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Exactly . Here is an industry which, on the statements of honourable members on the other side, cannot live except has black labour, or there is an alternative prohibitive duty. Is this an industry which we should rushout of ourway to try to bring into existence at the beginning of the Commonwealth? At whose expense is it proposed we should establish an industry, Which honourable members on the other side show is not native to our soil, or native from the standpoint of our civilization and our labour conditions? These honourable members, in everv argument they use, explain that this industry must have prohibitive duties or it cannot thrive, as other industries thrive throughout the I length and breadth of the continent. They show that the sugar industry of Australia is altogether special, and more or less exotic. These are the facts with which they set out to consider the question, and in the light of all these admissions, we are asked to go out of our way to specially treat the cane sugar of Queensland, and at the same time, promote the establishment of another industry which will be even worse from a commercial standpoint. I , as representing people who use sugar largely-people who are engaged in fruit growing-a m not prepared to promote the establishment of an industry which shows that it cannot possibly live except in so far as it relies for assistance on the other industries of the continent. The honourable member for Gippsland talked about justice. Where is the justice in the proposal of the Government, as applied to the sugar industry of Australia, apart from the question of black or white labour ? The honourable member for Gippsland says that it would not be just to give this rebate in connection with cane sugar and not give it in connection with the beet sugar. But there is no beet sugar industry, and we do not desire to cultivate the latter until it can be shown that, after its cultivation has begun, it w i ll be able to exist by its own inherent qualities. I object altogether to the statement that beet-sugar growing is good for the farmer, or that it employs more labour. The industry can do these two things only at the cost of some of the other people in the State, who have to keep it going by huge prohibitive duties. When honourable members tell me that an industry employs a lot of labour, the question is-at what cost ? Is it remunerative labour, the employment of which is good for the State 1 Or is it the employment of labour which could be more remuneratively utilized in it some other occupation? These are questions which, in a just view of the matter, ought to be asked by honourable members. But it seems to be the fashion on the other side only to ask the question-Does the industry employ labour ? Can the article be produced or grown here ? When these questions have been answered, honourable members opposite think that the whole matter is settled, without any reference to cost, or to the relations which the particular industry will bear to other industrial occupations on the continent. I object to the establishment of the beet sugar industry at the cost of those who use sugar. There was another industry referred to by the honourable member for Echuca, namely, that of fruit-growing. I presume honourable members have had a statement put into their hands by the fruit-growers of Victoria as to the relative value of their industry, and that of sugar-growing. The fruit-growers, it appears, have a greater area under cultivation, and their crop is worth very much more than is the total crop of sugar. The fruit-growers employ more hands and no coloured labour ; and yet it is pz-oposed that these men who have been struggling for many years, shall put their hands in their pockets and pay for the obliteration of black labour in another part of the continent Honourable members sometimes argue as though there were a huge fund at the disposal of the Treasurer, out of which to make these adjustments from time to time throughout the Commonwealth. The money that we give to the growers of sugar-cane we take from those who are engaged in fruit-growing and in fruit-preserving, and from those who use sugar as an article of food. When honourable members talk of justice, it is time that some one asks for justice for those who use sugar as well as for those who produce it. I do not think that the cane-sugar and the beetsugar industries can be compared, because one is an industry which is now in existence while the other is not; and I have yet to learn that, in order to help the Victorian Government, which has somewhere a plant which is now useless, but which, under certain circumstances, might be used, we should penalize the sugar users of the continent. Let the Victorian Government put their plant into a museum as an evidence of their utter folly in trying to bring into existence an industry which cannot maintain itself against outside competition. Do not let them come whining to this Parliament, asking that the sugar users of the Commonwealth may be penalized in order to bring their now useless plant into use. I am surprised that the matter should have been mentioned by an honourable member who is noted for his hard-headedness. All that has been said upon the subject this afternoon goes to show that the beetsugar industry should not couraged by the granting to it of : T a r i ff 9887 special bounties. Honourable members say that beet cannot be grown except where the soil is rich, and that a great amount of labour must be employed in its cultivation and in the gathering of the product. That being so, the beet-sugar industry cannot compete with the cane-sugar industry. Sugar-cane is grown in the tropical parts of Australia, where it is more or less a native product, and if our cane-sugar cannot compete against that grown in other parts of the world, except with the aid of high protective duties or cheap imported labour, can the beetsugar be expected to do so 1 Let us make the best we can of the cane-sugar difficulty in Queensland. This Parliament has declared that sugar-cane must henceforth be grown with white labour, and has determined to give the producers within the Commonwealth an advantage over outside producers. Further than that, during the next five years those who employ white, labour only will obtain a rebate of £ 2 a ton upon their sugar. No doubt the bulk of that money will go into the pockets of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It seems to me that the New South Wales growers are somewhat at a disadvantage compared with the growers in tropical Queensland, where, the climate being hotter, the yield of sugar is probably greater; but, nevertheless, it was found that sugar could be grown profitably in New South Wales with white labour, paid at the rate of 7s. a day, under a duty of £ 3 a ton. Why then should we go out of our way to impose a duty of £ 1 0 a ton for the benefit of the beet-sugar industry, which we are told cannot compete upon even terms with the cane-sugar industry? Is it not time that we gave some consideration to those who use sugar as an article of food, or as the raw material of the products which they manufacture? The value of the return from fruit-growing land is estimated at £11 Is. 5d. per acre, whilst the value of the return from sugar-cane is only £ 4 7s. 7d. per acre. The total value of the sugar-cane grown in 1899 was £619,000, while the value of the sugar refined in 1900 was £1,188,693, while the total value of the f r u it crop in 1899 was £1,783,400. The fruit-growers, however, are not asking for special consideration, but they may justly ask for a remission of the high duties upon sugar. I shall do nothing knowingly been- to assist in the building-up of an industry like the beet industry, until it can be shown that it is likely to be able to compete with the cane-sugar industry. According to the testimony which we have had this afternoon, however, from rabid advocates of the establishment of the beet industry in Victoria, beet-sugar cannot be produced as cheaply as cane,-sugar. Mr A . MCLEAJT - The bigger returns should compensate for the additional labour employed. There is a larger return from the by-products in the case of the beet industry. If it were not for the by-products, the industry would have no chance of competing with the cane-sugar industry, but may possibly compete with it because of value of the by-products.",27
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"As we have got terially into such an economic mess in regard to cane-sugar industry, we should be careful not to get into a similar mess in regard the beet - sugar industry. I believe that our people can do something which will pay them better, and will be more prothe fitable to the Commonwealth than engaging in industries which cannot live unless they are completely fenced round against outside competition.",29
109,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," The honor1898, able member for Parramatta in his concludtons. ing remarks involved himself in the old-tangle as his party generally gets mixed in. He tells us that he is not going to support a proposal to assist the beet industry with special bounties or other aids. But the proposal now before the Chair is, not to give special consideration to the beet industry, but to prevent that industry from being unfairly handicapped. The honourable member also forgets that in dealing with the Tariff the committee have given special consideration to the f r u it growers by ing their home market to them, and i New South Wales, when they had free1899 trade, they always extended special concrease sideration to their fruit-growers. In case, however, the position of the growers and the fruit-preservers does not arise, because it can be dealt with separately by allowing a rebate for the encouragement of the manufacture of jams and jellies from the produce of our own orchards. The honourable member for Parramatta laid great stress upon the fact that i Wales sugar-cane had been successfully grown under a duty of £ 3 at o n ; but honourable and learned member for Werriwa the other night pointed out that as soon skipped that. as we supply our own requirements a duty becomes inoperative. But although the honourable member for Parramatta 1 tells us that with a duty of £ 3 a ton the sugar industry in New South Wales was a success, what do the figures of the statistician prove? They show that production has diminished in New South Wales since the duty was reduced to £ 3 a ton.",29
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Why ?,29
111,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Because the cane growers have gone in for dairy farming.,29
112,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They have not gone it in for dairy farming to any extent upon the land previously used for sugar growing, though dairying has increased very mai n the sugar-growing districts. In the New South Wales, in 1864, there were 22 acres under sugar cane; in 1871, 4,394 to acres; in 1881, 12,167 acres; in 1891, 22,262 acres; and in 1899, 22,517 acres; so that after the duty on sugar was reduced, increase in the acreage was less than 300 acres. The figures as to the annual yield of sugar are still more instructive. In 1895, the yield of sugar in New South Wales was 22,213 tons; in 1S96, 28,557 tons; in 1897, 27,653 tons; in 29,110 tons; and in 1,899, 15,352 Is that an increase in yield, with the same reduced duty in New South Wales 1 On the othe.r side,* taking Queensland, where they had the same duty in force all the time, what do we find for the same period ?",29
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the duty make the cane yield less ?,29
114,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It was made unprofitable to the growers, and they went out of the industry. In Queensland, where the duty was regularly about £ 6 odd per securton, the acreage under cane in 1881 was n 28,026 acres, in 1891 50,948 acres, in 110,657 acres, showing a gradual inin area. Taking the same cycle as I this took in the case of New South Walesfruit1895 to 1899-in 1895 the yield was 86,255 tons, in 1896 100,774 tons, in 1897 97,916 tons, in 189S 163,734 tons, and in 1899 123,289 tons, showing a gradual increase in the yield, though in the latter year it diminished owing to the percentage of sugar in the cane or something of that n New South sort being reduced.",29
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Why did not the the honourable member say that before in connection with New South Wales ? He,29
116,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No . I quoted both the acreage and the yield, and the acreage in New South Wales shows no increase.",30
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No ; the honourable member said that the diminished yield owing to the duty.,30
118,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I said that there no increase in the acreage, and that progress had not continued, apparently, because of the reduction of the duty.",30
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member said that the yield had been reduced since the duty had been put on.,30
120,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I said that it was in the duty. not an increasing quantity, and that is proved both by the acreage and by the the import duty vet. yield. The production of beet is not peculiar to one locality in Australia. Assuming that the enterprise is entered upon, beet may be grown, and grown back profitably according to the sugar in the beets in pretty well all our coastal districts. It is a matter of ditions. Soil, of course, is essential; but there must be certain climatic conditions to insure its growth. CogJdan says :Such high yields as these have forced the conclusion that these colonies are fitted by nature become the home of the sugar beet. Indeed, in New South Wales, analysis made by the to the Colonial Sugar Refiniug Company of roots grown in the New England district, where experihas ments were conducted, disclosed yields ranging from 15'66 to 24 -75 per cent, of sugar. There is little fear, therefore, that with proper care attention, the cultivation of the beet will produce good results. All those who give any consideration future will, I think, leave nothing undone that will leave fair opportunities for development of all these industries. a year or two we may have to pay a little more for our sugar, but we must future. If , taking the same authority as a guide, the total production of sugar tralia in 1899 was 138,000 tons, approximating to our total requirements, only 30,000 to 40,000 tons having had be imported. Looking to the future, have every reason to hope that within a short space of time we shall raise the of the sugar required by Australian concountries sumers within our confines. Surely the committee should give the growers some inducement to go on increasing its producState tion. It is much better for Australia as whole to produce within its confines all sugar it uses than to import it from abroad. This cry of importing is all right when cannot pi-oduce the article in Australia. But I am amongst those who contend that when we can produce anything for our requirements it is our duty to was give every possible assistance to its production within our confines. And was where it is not going to cost a very the great amount, though I have heard some extraordinary statements made in that regard, I think we should do it . For reasons which it is not necessary for me to state now, the committee agreed to differentiate between beet sugar and cane sugar, making a difference of £ 4 per ton",30
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It has not agreed to,30
122,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We have practically agreed to the amount of the import duty. I can hardly conceive of the committee going on the import duty after it has dealt percentage with the excise duty.,30
123,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The import duty climatic conwas not dealt with.,30
124,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,If we give away the whole of the excise we must reduce the import duty.,30
125,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It has been an as to sumption in the mind of every honourable chemist member that the import duty has been practically agreed to, though, of course, it not been dealt with officially. It has been referred to by the honourable members for and Bland and Wentworth, and, I think, Robertnot son. We have assumed a difference of £ 4 per ton between the import duty on beetto the sugar and that on cane-sugar, and the proposition now is to make a difference be the tween cane-sugar grown by white labour, For a and cane-sugar grown by black labour. Why should we penalize specially sugar look to the manufactured from beet?",30
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"How can we penalize in Austhat which does not exist ? we are - Mr KENNEDY - Where there is the possibility of production there is the possito bility of existence. We know beyond a we shadow of doubt that we can grow beet in very Australia, and that brings me to a point whole with which I wish to deal. In those where beet has been grown, it has been established beyond a shadow of doubt that its production is to the benefit of the or the nation. Take the European a countries which have subsidized the growth the and export of beet-sugar. How is it that they have ruined the growers of cane-sugar we I in some of the British possessions ? We know that not long ago the British Government were considering the condition of the sugar-growers in British possessions, and their being brought into competition with the growers of bounty-fed sugar.",30
127,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Does honourable member know what the people of Europe pay-£4,000,0001",31
128,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is an unsupported statement.,31
129,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,German y gets far more in the way of excise than she pays in the way of bounty.,31
130,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"A f t e r a very considerable experience of the bounties those nations are still paying them. If the results were not satisfactory to them they would not be doing s'o. But turning to the United States, I find that in an article dealing with the growth of beet sugar in Oregon, and with the conditions appertaining to a few particular factories, the Agricultural department reports in this way :It is estimated that if this season's expectations be fulfilled more than 1,000,000 tons of homegrown sugar will be consumed in the United States, or three times the figures of 189(5-97, the increase being almost entirely due to the expansion of sugar-beet production. In three years the production of sugar-beet has increased threefold.",31
131,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Has in the United States 1,31
132,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It has special assistance in the shape of bonuses.,31
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No bonuses.,31
134,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am not prepared to say what they have at the present time, but they had bonuses at the outset. What has been a great factor in agricultural development in the United States is the splendid assistance given by experiments in different directions, not only by the State Legislature, but also by the Federal Legislature.",31
135,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Robbin g Peter to pay Paul.,31
136,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Seeing that it is an immense factor in the wealth production of the State, I do not see where the robbing comes in. But in the proposition before the committee there is not a request for any special consideration. It is merely a request not to place a special handicap on one class of sugar production, and seeing that it is a source of considerable wealth production to the growers, wherever it has been engaged in, and where the conditions were favourable, it shall have my hearty .support. Of course it is attempted to mix up that question with other issues--suc h for instance as to how it wil l 1 affect those engaged in the manufacture of garden produce, but that is a question which the we can dispose of at a later stage. I am prepared to go the . whole way with those who have a special knowledge of the conditions prevailing in Queensland, and give them what assistance they have asked. I I do not think that the Government in their proposals have been lenient with the sugar growers in Queensland. Up to 1907, when they will, not be able to utilize black labour, will be the most critical period for sugar growers in that State. I shall give them all the support in my power. I am prepared to be guided to a very considerable extent by the opinions of their representatives. I trust that the committee will accept the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca.",31
137,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I cannot help thinking that we have travelled far indeed from the considerations that were before the Chamber when we were dealing with the Kanaka question. At that time. I paid considerable attention to all the speeches, and I think it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to find any reference to a rebate on sugar grown in, say Victoria, or in those it assistance districts in New South Wales where at no time black labour had been employed. We had undoubtedly before us the question as to how we could best relieve the planters in Queensland who were employing Kanakas, from the inconvenience and the expense which they would inevitably have to face in the change from black labour to white labour. . But while I recognise that fact, and while I admit as a matter of principle that we ought not to concede anything to the growers of beet sugar, still for the sake of expediency, and in order to get on a little faster than we are doing, I am willing to vote for the proposition before the committee. And in doing so I feel sure that I am not giving away any proportion of the revenue to the growers of beet, for the simple reason that I believe that not a ton of beet sugar is likely to be produced in competition with cane sugar grown in Queensland. In Victoria, a great effort was made some years ago to make the beet sugar industry a live one. The attention of its statesmen was concentrated on the industry. One of the leading 1 1 newspapers fought hard; and money was expended freely-in fact nothing was left undone to make the industry a success. To-day every one admits absolute failurefailure of so thorough a nature that I feel certain that even the temptation of £ 2 a ton rebate will be unlikely to resuscitate the industry. I shall vote for the proposal before the committee, not because I consider that the claim is a fair one, .but because I regard it as one of those things which are absolutely meaningless. We have heard a great deal about the advantages of growing beet, and if they were such as have been represented by the honourable member for Echuca, the farmers of Victoria should be only too glad to grow it without any assistance from the State. Tliey might utilize their beet on their farms ; but I feel sure that very little of it indeed 'would go into the manufacture of sugar. Under these circumstances, I have no hesitation in saying that I shall support the amendment, because it does not mean that the country will lose the slightest portion of excise upon sugar which it might fairly expect.",31
138,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," On e argument that has been used in support of the amendment is that there is a possibility of the resuscitation of the beet-sugar industry. The last speaker intimated that he would support it on the ground of that possibility, and also gave as a reason that he was quite sure that it was merely a formal act on his part to vote for it, because no beet-sugar would ever be produced either in Victoria or elsewhere in the Commonwealth. While approving of the honourable member's determination on . the ground stated, I am going to vote in the opposite direction on principle. Beet-sugar production might become in the immediate future a menace to the successful production of cane-sugar by white labour. We know very well that if Germany or France had what the Commonwealth of Australia possesses, immense areas of splendid rich tropical country, with amagnificent rainfall of from 30 inches to 30 feet per annum, they would not grow a'single ton of beet. Those who are intimate with the history of the development of the beet industry on the continent of Europe know very well that it was established for the specific purpose of relieving the farmers, who have been an enormously increasing portion of the population during the past 30 or 50 years.. Something had to be done for them. The beet industry, once established, grew until it became a handle in the possession of the respective Governments of the countries to which I have referred for the purpose of annihilating the sugar-producing industry in the British West Indian possessions and elsewhere. Why was it that Sir Henry Norman was sent out the other day by the British Government to the West India Islands to report on the diminution of the sugar production and the stagnation of the industry, especially in Jamaica ? It was because the matter is under the serious consideration of the British Government. At present the war overwhelms every other question, and the position of the West India Islands has been hung up ; but once the war is over one of the first questions that will engage the attention of the Imperial authorities will be that of the production of sugar beet, to the detriment of cane-sugar as produced in British possessions and in other parts of the world. Are we to imagine that, if the production of sugar by white labour become a success in Queensland, that will be the only part of Australia where sugar will be grown? Not at all. I apprehend that if white labour establishes itself as a successful grower of sugar at a profit, and if the industry is able to pay the wages which white labour demands, the industry will enormously increase right around the whole of the eastern, northern, and western coasts of Australia north of the Tropio of Capricorn. Why should we, then, hold out the slightest inducement, even for five years, to the production of beet-sugar in any part of southern Australia, when in the immediate future cane-sugar grown by white labour will be so generally produced ? It is admitted on all .sides that cane-sugar produced in such regions as enjoy a plentif u l rainfall, and, as one honourable member has said, with abundant sunshine-thes e being the essentials for the growth of sugar cane-is a commodity with which beet sugar cannot compete, no matter where it ' is grown. We can grow sugar-beet most successfully in all parts of our coastal regions in Queensland as well as in northern New South Wales. We can gro w it abundantly and successfully on the Darling Downs, in the western waters. The production of beetsugar in Victoria was attempted while that State was a separate colony, and not as a part of the Commonwealth. It was a.domestic,not an Australian, question. We must look at the prospect of a revival of the sugar industry in Victoria, and the utilization of the splendid plant and material erected here, from a Commonwealth point of view, and not from a Victorian State point of view. I cannot admit that from a national point of view we should desire to encourage the utilization of this plant in Victoria, under the belief that those who use it may possibly make a success of the industry in j i v e or six if they are given the advantage which is asked for under the Tariff.",32
139,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is production of cane-sugar equal to the supply of all Australia 1,33
140,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"PATERSON Very nearly. But if the revival of the production of beet-sugar in Victoria be successful after five or six years, what will happen ? At once away goes the bonus which is to be given to Queensland, and up goes the claim of Victoria to a continuity of the bonus for the production of beet-sugar. We must look ahead, and that is a faildiagnosis of what are the circumstances today, and the prospects for tomorrow. If beet-root production in Victoria had been a success, and not an industrial failure as it has been, and if the industry were in existence, producing a reasonable quantity of sugar, employing a proportionate quantity of labour and capital, and paying interest on the advances which had been made by the State Government, there would be some ground for granting the concession; but at present there is not the strength of a cobweb upon which to hang the clai m that is made. It is said that New South Wales does not employ any coloured labour. I fancy from the best information I have obtained-apar t from personal knowledgethat a considerable portion of the New South Wales northern river growers employ free coloured labour that has come from Queensland or elsewhere.",33
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,When the Kanaka is employed on the Tweed he wants his 7s. a day.,33
142,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"PATERSON I know that the Kanakas employed there receive good wages-receive , indeed, as much as the white men ; and they are very t h r if ty hard-working men, who do not squander their money needlessly either to the injury of their health, or otherwise, but put it in the Savings Bank to provide for a rainy day. Lastly, I would point out that the honourable memberf or Gippsland omitted to tell the committee that the principal condition which was agreed to by honourable members, in respect of the excise to be levied upon cane-sugar production, was founded upon a bargain, as it has been called, that the sugar planters and growers in Queensland should have the advantage of the £ 2 per ton rebate as a sort of recompense, in order to enable them to years, abandon, perforce, the employment of the Kanaka. The honourable member for Gippsland should have told us that the labour not the conditions in Victoria, if beet-sugar culture were commenced here tomorrow, would be the same as they were before.",33
143,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,-Victori a does not ask for consideration ; she asks not to be placed in a worse position than the other States.,33
144,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"PATERSON She wants to be in a better position than that of the sugar-planters of Queensland now. Victoria is not, and never has been, in the position that Queensland is. Queensland has been attacked victoriously by those who have determined that black labour should cease, and the £ 2 a ton rebate was given as a solatium. Victoria has no right to raise the question at all. Queensland gets the solatium for an attack made upon her most successful industry-a n industry that has been carried on for years under State laws, which the people.there were led to believe would not be interfered with by the Commonwealth Government. That solatium was given for the express purpose of enabling those whose capital has been invested in the industry to tide over the period to the end of 1906. Queensland gets the rebate to enable her to maintain her position and her solvency. To enable her to overcome the disadvantages of the changed conditions forced upon her, she is to get this solatium for five-years. Victoria comes now and asks for the same concession upon no grounds whatever, be0 cause no beet-sugar industry exists.",33
145,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And there are no disadvantageous climatic conditions.,33
146,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"PATERSON There are no disadvantageous climatic conditions, and no black labour is to be abolished. There is little or no capital invested at all, or, at all events, what has been invested has been lost for ever.",33
147,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And the Victorian State Government subsidized it by nearly £100,000.",33
148,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I was not aware of that. I know that there are many Victorian banks, financial companies, and private individuals who have hundreds of thousands of pounds invested in the sugar industry in Queensland, and they will regard with anything but a favourable eye any attempt made to resuscitate the beet-sugar industry in Victoria, if it is to be done at the expense of the Commonwealth, or at the expense of a subsidy by the Victorian State Parliament.",33
149,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," This , of course, is a debatable question; but, though I have listened carefully to what has been said, I have seen no reason to alter the position I took up. There is one very strong argument against the proposal. We have put an absolutely prohibitive duty upon the importation of beetsugar-£1 0 a ton-and even if we were to give away the whole of the excise of £ 3 a ton, and reduce the import duty to £ 7 per ton, it would still be a prohibitive duty. In the face of that fact, and of the fact that there are no disadvantageous climatic conditions against the establishment of the beet-sugar industry in Victoria, we are asked to treat people who may undertake that industry in exactly the same way as people carrying on the cane-sugar industry in the tropical parts of Queensland, and for whom the whole scheme has been devised. Mr A . MCLEAX - Surely the honourable member does not mean to say that the high duty was imposed in the interests of the beet-sugar industry 1",34
150,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If it were not as I say, there would be no excuse for this scheme. We can only look upon it as a component part of the legislation dealing with the Kanaka system. It is that and nothing more ; and the idea of dragging in a product like beet-sugar, which does not exist at all at the present time, and the growth of which could be conducted under ordinary climatic conditions, and putting it upon a level with the cane-sugar industry in Queensland, is against common sense and reason. If this is going to be done it might be a reason why honourable members should reconsider their position with regard to the rebate scheme altogether. This concession to beet-sugar was not one of the Government proposals. It was never intended by the Government, and it is dragged in now in a senseless and useless way in regard to an industry which does not exist, and which we know ought not to 28 L exist, because the peculiarity of this beetsugar industry is that it is an entirely artificial industry. It has never been put upon a sound footing, except by a system of robbery of the great mass of the people. At the present time Europe pays £4,000,000, chiefly out of the hard earnings of her working people, for the delightful position of being able to export a lotof beet-sugartootherparts of the world. If these bounties and this artificial assistance were taken away from the beet-sugar industry in Europe, it would go to pieces. Whether we are free-traders or protectionists, none of us will approve of the artificial establishment of an industry which requires enormous, even prohibitive, duties, or on the other hand extravagant bonuses to keep it alive from year to year. I therefore say that this beet-sugar industry should not come into this question at all. If it comes to a matter of being self-supporting, we know that at the present time we make almost as much sugar from cane in New South Wales and Queensland as will supply the whole of Australia. Are we going to bring into competition another product 1 Look at the futility of it ! We must face the fact that this artificial assistance ceases at the end of five years, during which time it will be impossible to establish the industry, or underneath it all there must be a determination that after five years this assistance shall be continued or even increased. The suggestion is absurd. On the one hand we refuse to continue the system of excise' and rebate beyond five years, and on the other hand we give a concession to an industry which is not now established, which could not be established at all under ordinary conditions, and just at the moment when it would be established by this measure of assistance, we take away all the support from it . Viewed in the light of common sense, it is clear that the Government proposal is part and parcel of the treatment of the Kanaka question, and it is intended to alleviate, to some extent, the effects of the rather harsh measures which, as a matter of high State policy, we have had to take in view of the interests of the whole of Australia. Mr A . MCLE AN (Gippsland) - My honourable friend has worked himself up into a state of excitement for the purpose of imposing upon the committee. He commenced by stating that having put a specially high duty upon imported beet-sugar, there was no necessity for giving it any further consideration. The honourable member knows that that special duty was put upon beetbounty sugar to protect the cane-sugar, and not the interests of a local beet-sugar industry which does not exist. The honourable memwas ber has waltzed very carefully round the question. Does he propose to extend concession to cane-sugar grown in New South Wales by white labour ?",34
151,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I said that we had to do so.,35
152,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"How can the honourable gentleman, consistently with his principles as a free-trader, advocate putting a special impost of £ 2 per ton onbeet-sugar which heidoes notpropose to put upon his own cane-sugar ? Is that in accordance with the principles of free-trade?",35
153,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Certainl y not; I admitted it .,35
154,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No special consideration is asked in the interests of beet sugar. All that we ask is that there shall be no special disability imposed upon it. We only ask that it shall be placed in the same category as cane-sugar. It is not proposed that it shall be given any special bonus, but that it shall pay the same rate of excise duty to the State that cane-sugar",35
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It cannot pay anything ; it does not exist.,35
156,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If it does not exist, the proposal can do no harm. All that we ask is that there shall be no special barrier placed in the way of the establishment of the industry. If it can be established on its merits, we should not go out of our way to prevent it being established. My honourable friends talk of the enormous injury to the people of Germany by reason of the bounties paid upon the export of beet-sugar. I think the German nation can be allowed to take care of itself. The honourable member for Wentworth is a student of history, and does he not know that it is he who is in a hopeless minority, and that his views are shared only by the isolated few? Does the honourable gentleman think the few free-traders of New South Wales are to sway the judgment of the teeming millions of the old world ? orable friend ought to know that the antiquated policy to which he is clinging has been discarded by all the enlightened nations of the earth, with only one notable exception. I have not looked at the returns from Germany for the last two or three years, but the last time. I did look them up I found that the amount of the paid upon the export of beet-sugar in was only a few hundred thousand pounds, whilst the amount received in excise duty considerably over £4,000,000. These returns are a few years old, but I doubt this very much if the position has been reversed. Germany makes a considerable income out of the beet-sugar industry.",35
157,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the honourable member approve of that policyof the excise duty imposed there ?,35
158,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not know whether my honourable friend is familiar with the policy of Germany and France. Those continental nations are protectionist nations, and they put a high protective duty upon beet-sugar in favour of the local industry, and make it up by a considerable excise duty for revenue. It is found that this is a very useful industry^ and employs a large proportion of the peasantry of these continental countries, and to encourage that employment, the nation .pays a bounty on the surplus produced, and exports it to other countries.",35
159,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And the people pay 3d. per lb. for sugar, which is sold in London has to pay. at l ^ d . per lb.",35
160,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The bounty is paid upon the beet-sugar produced.,35
161,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"My honourable friend will admit that the cost of living is 50 per cent, greater in England than in Germany,' for the very good reason that England has to get the necessaries of life from the protectionist countries of the world, and has to pay the cost of importation, insurance, and all other charges incidental to their import.",35
162,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And the people pay less for the goods than the people of those countries pay.,35
163,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In regard to this question we only ask that the growers of beetisugar shall be placed in the same position as the growers of cane-sugar, and that if any company desires to undertake the industry it shall be free to enter into it on the same terms as a company investing in the cane-sugar industry. If they produce My hon- as good an article, and can compete in the same market with the growers of canesugar, they should be allowed to do so, and they should not be compelled to pay £ 2 per ton more excise than the growers of canesugar will have to pay.",35
164,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I hope the debate will not take this interesting turn for long j I hope it will not resolve itself into a general argument on free-trade and protection. What is involved,' as I understand it, is whether the bonus proposed to be given to the growers of cane sugar by white labour in Queensland- a rebate of £ 2 per ton of the excise duty-is also to be given to those who may grow beet-sugar in 'Victoria, or in any other State, by white labour. Although the proposal exhibits a good deal of the peculiar unselfishness of Victoria in all matters concerning that State particularly, it shows that honourable members representing Victoria are determined to exact the last concession they can get out of the Tariff in every way. Though I represent a sugar-growing district, I do not see how I can consistently do otherwise than vote for the proposal. I think it is producing discord in the general understanding, but I must consistently vote for it. Even if I feared it I would still vote for it ; but I do not fear it . I do not for a moment believe that any growers of beet sugar in Victoria can compete with our white cane sugar growers in Queensland if they are given proper opportunities. I do not think the high import duty upon beet sugar makes any difference at all. The bonus paid upon beet sugar on the continent makes the customs duty of £ 1 0 per ton proposed here about equal to the customs duty of £ 6 per ton imposed upon imported cane sugar. To be consistent, the Government were, I think, bound to propose such duties as would bring about an equality in that respect, unless we are to go upon the free-trade principle of importing everything as cheaply as we can.",35
165,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What has the beet sugar to do with the Kanaka 1,36
166,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I agree with what has been said in that respect by the honourable gentleman who is at present leading the Opposition, but the whole thing was a compromise at the general election. The honourable gentleman is voting for a revenue Tariff, and the Government are voting for a revenue Tariff, with a protective incidence. Seeing that the cane-sugar industry has been established in two of the States at least, some protection should be given to those - engaged in it, and especially in view of the special circumstances recited in connection with coloured labour in Queensland. There are, however, many reasons why we should follow a consistent course, even if to do so were to our disadvantage. The district I represent is largely a sugar-growing district, and despite the statements of people who think differently, I think that sugar will continue to be produced there to a great extent by white labour. I am prepared to meet competition with beet sugar grown in Victoria, but I make this request of members representing Victoria: that if we consistently vote for this proposal, they will admit that the white sugar-growers in Queensland, struggling against climatic and other disadvantageous conditions, are entitled to almost the f u ll rebate proposed by the Government with respect to sugar produced by white labour. That is quite fair.",36
167,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is a case of "" put your money down.""",36
168,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do not say that.,36
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,A proposal like thatshould be made only in the lobbies.,36
170,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am pleased to heaibonorable members who are free-traders making these interjections, and I shall remind them of something which may be of interest. The honourable member for Parramatta was a member of a Government in New South Wales which considered that a duty of £ 3 per ton on sugar was a perfectly fair protection to afford the sugar growers in the northern parts of New South Wales as against the Kanaka-grown sugar,of Queensland.",36
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is a mere assertion.,36
172,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does the honourable member say that it is untrue ?,36
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do not say anything.,36
174,Mr CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Of course, it is true.",36
175,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I simply wish to put the matter fairly before the committee. I do not want to make points against the honourable member.,36
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member cannot prove his statement as to that duty.,36
177,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The proposal of the Government is that sugar grown here bywhite labour shall be protected against that grown by black labour to the extent of only £ 2 per ton. The honourable member for Parramatta complains because I urge that the same amount of protection should be afforded to sugar grown by white labour as that which a free-trade Government, of which he was a member, gave tp the sugar growers in New South Wales against the Kanaka-grown sugar 'of Queensland, namely, an operative duty of £ 3 per ton. An excise duty of £ 3 per ton has to be paid on sugar produced from Kanaka-grown cane, while the man who produces sugar from cane grown by white labour has to pay an excise duty of £ 1 per ton, so that he is allowed only a differential duty of £ 2 a ton. That is not sufficient. I say that if they are consistent, those who supported the State Government of New South Wales, to which I have referred, ought to give sugar produced by white labour an advantage of £ 3 per ton. Is that a bargain with the honourable members for Victoria ?",36
178,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That was before.,37
179,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If it is a fact, does it matter whether it has been stated before or .not?",37
180,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We are not '.bound by the decision of the Government of New South Wales.,37
181,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I should not have mentioned it but for the jeers of honourable members of the Opposition, who suggested that I was endeavoring to make a compact with honourable members representing Victoria.",37
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member has not stated what is a fact in regard to the duty in New South Wales.,37
183,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If it is thought that an impost of £ 3 per ton was a fair protection to afford the sugar-growers of New South Wales against the Kanaka-grown cane sugar of Queensland, surely an advantage of £ 3 per ton is not too much for us to ask . now on behalf of sugar grown by whi,te labour? We ask the committee to give 5s. instead of 4s. a ton on 10per cent. cane. If the Government yield to that request we . shall be pleased, and, on the arguments I have adduced, I think it would be fair, as well as beneficial to Australia, for them to - do so. If that proposal is not agreed to, I - can assure the committee that the white sugar-cane growers of Queensland will, not sit down and ask for Government aid. .They .are not built that way. They will set to - work and do their utmost. - they will fail in a glorious battle.  - is contended that this rebate should he expended to beet-sugar, because a proposal has 'been been made to allow it to cane growers in parts of the Commonwealth in which white labour is being employed in the industry at the present time. That is the only argument which has been advanced with any force. But does it not show the hollowness of the whole scheme ? Does it not show, that to extend the rebate to beetsugar would be practically a breach of faith with the people of Queensland, or with the planters, from whom we have taken cheap black labour ? It was bad enough to place the growers of New South Wales, who have hitherto conducted operations by means of white labour, on the same footing as those of Queensland, where they are being compelled to introduce white labour in substitution for black. It is proposed now to go farther, and to introduce an entirely not stated new element. If it were not for the fact that we have compelled the sugar planters of Queensland to substitute white for black labour, would there be any proposition for a rebate ? We are asked to give a rebate on beet sugar in order that a new industry may be established. B ut what concession will the sugar-cane growers of Queensland receive if the beet-sugar industry is placed on an equal footing ? None whatever. The more I think of this most recent proposal, the more strongly am I convinced that it would be a distinct breach of faith with the sugar-cane growers of Queensland, whom, we are agreed, should receive a bonus or rebate.",37
184,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We ought to have all the representatives of Queensland with us.  nanimous spirit exhibited by the honourable member for Wide Bay in his desire for consistency; but I think that he exhibited a little of his feeling as to the selfishness of Victoria in asking for this concession when it was absolutely wrung from the Government as a condition of the passing of the Pacific Island Labourers Bill. There was no suggestion that the rebate should be extended to beet sugar until some of the Government's followers got to work. It is not a Government proposal.,37
185,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I did not approach the If they fail, Government in .the matter.  that the advantage'of £ 2 per ton proposed to be given to the Queensland sugar-cane growers, as compensation for the loss sustained by them in substituting white for black labour, will be anything like a fair equivalent ?",37
186,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is not enough.  vote for a proposition which would put a new industry in competition with the canesugar of Queensland, upon exactly the same footing. The demand will not bear scrutiny.",37
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Parramatta) I should not have risen to address myself to this matter, but for the statement made by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that I was a member of a Government in New South Wales which considered that a duty of £ 3 per ton on sugar was a fair one, and therefore kept it on. When questioned on the subject, the honourable member challenged me to deny or to affirm the accuracy of his statement. This is a very old dodge. It is easy to make .statements, and then to challenge the person affected to deny them. I did not fall into the trap. May I tell the honourable member now that the duty of £ 3 per ton to which he has referred was kept on by the Government of which I was a member, not because it was a protective duty, but because we could not afford to take it off at the time. The state of our revenue would not permit us to do so.",38
188,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Did not some of the supporters of that Government threaten to go on the other side if the Government removed it?,38
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Some of them threatened to go on the other side because we refused to take it off ; the honourable member for Dalley was one.,38
190,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Hear , hear. Sir GEORGE , TURNER - As free-traders why did not the Government to which the honourable member refers make the excise and the import duty alike if they desired to obtain revenue 1",38
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Our original proposition was not that an excise duty on sugar should be imposed, but that the duty should be removed. However, we could not control five or six bad seasons in succession. ,",38
192,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No r five or six supporters of that Government ?,38
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That assertion has no foundation in fact. These statements are all so much balderdash.,38
194,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member said just now that he did not recollect.,38
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member does not know anything about the matter. He knows just as much about it as does the honourable member for Wide Bay, who made the statement that we imposed the duty for protective purposes.",38
196,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It is history that the Government refused to discontinue the sugar duties because their supporters threatened to desert them if they did so.,38
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"A m \ to be subjected to all these interruptions, Mr Chairman ? If I were to interject half as much you would be down on me.",38
198,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Order ! The honourable member has rio right to cast a reflection on the Chair.,38
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I stated what was a fact. You know, Mr Chairman, that it is not right for the Minister to go on like this.",38
200,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member is not in order. He is not upholding the dignity of the Chamber as he should do, by protecting the Chair. I called the honourable member to order, and I can do no more.",38
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I want the Chair to _ protect me, and I have a right to that protection.",38
202,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The Government of which the honourable member was a member continued the protective duty on sugar in order to keep in office.,38
203,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Order !,38
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member knows that that statement is absolutely incorrect; that so far from taking the popular course we took an unpopular course in continuing the duty. We kept it on because we could not afford to lose any revenue. When the honourable member for Wide Bay stands up and boldly and i m pudently seeks to enter into a compact with other honourable members,38
205,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,38
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I withdraw. The honourable member for Wide Bay has asked honourable members from Victoria to support the full rebate which honourable members from Queensland hope to obtain in return for his support of their demand for a rebate on beet-sugar.,38
207,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,He never said anything of the sort.,38
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member knows that such a proposal should be made only in the lobbies. It should not take place in open daylight.,38
209,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," B y way of explanation, may I be permitted to say that apparently from what the honourable member for Parramatta has uttered, he is under a misapprehension as to what I in tended to convey. If he believes honestly that I proposed to enter into a compact with Victorians, he is certainly under a misapprehension. I had no such idea in my mind'when I spoke, and I trust that he will accept my explanation.",39
210,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member was holding out the olive branch to the other side.,39
211,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If the honourable member for Dalley thinks that I was seeking in - any way to enter into a compact with honourable members from Victoria, he is very much mistaken. I have never entered into a compact with any party, and do not intend to do so.",39
212,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE, I would not have spoken on this question but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Parramatta. I am glad that honourable member for Wide Bay has made an explanatory statement,39
213,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It was unnecessary.,39
214,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It should not be necessary, because it is not creditable to the Chamber that aspersions such as those made by the honourable member for Parramatta should be cast upon honourable members. They reflect, far more discredit upon those who make them than they do upon those who were so unjustly charged with having entered into such a compact. At the time that the proposal to grant a loan to those engaged in the industry was before the Victorian Parliament, I opposed it very strongly ; but it was a very different proposal from that placed before the committee by the honourable member for Echuca. There is no special concession asked for by the primary producer on this occasion. It has been shown that beet can be grown here of a quality equal to that grown in any part of the world, and those who grow it or intend to grow it, do not ask to be placed at an advantage as compared with those who grow cane-sugar; all they ask is that they shall have the same treatment as the canegrower. Sugar-beet producers do exist here, and others may if they receive any encouragement from this Parliament; and all the arguments which have been poured forth in an attempt to prove that a special concession is asked for, are absolutely without point. All that is desired, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Gippsland, is fair treatment; and the question of an import duty of £ 1 0 a ton on beetsugar does not touch the subjectof discussion. The honourable member for Gippsland is perfectly right when he says that that duty was imposed by the Government with a view to protecting the producers of sugar, whether from cane or beet; and no honourable member will contend for a moment that a duty of £ 1 0 on beet-sugar will advance the interests of the beet-sugar growers any more than those of the cane-growers, seeing that the finished article is practically the same, and is sold at virtually the same price.",39
215,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Then why was this duty imposed 'f,39
216,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In order to assist the producers of sugar, whether beet or cane production.",39
217,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable the member has done away with his own argument.,39
218,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I maintain the position I adopted, namely, that the duty was imposed by the Government, and will be assented to by this committee, with a view to protecting the producers of all kinds of sugar, and it is unfair to say that because the Government place a duty of £ 1 0 on beet-sugar they are doing so in order to specially protect and assist those who manufacture that sugar.",39
219,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I would point out that honourable members on the Government side, by the arguments they have been using, might prolong the debate, if the Opposition chose to follow them j because we have had the whole question of free-trade and protection discussed together with other matters in connection with the proposed rebate of 6s. I do not wish to imply that the honourable member for Wide Bay has entered into any compact with Victorians. There was no implication of that sort; but the way in which the honourable member put his case looked like offering a compact, although I am sure the honourable member did not even mean that much.",39
220,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If I gave the honourable member that impression, it was done inadvertently.",39
221,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I should like to point out a view which does not seem to have been made clear, namely, that this rebate of £ 2 a ton to the beet-grower is an advantage of £2 to that grower. If neither the canegrower nor the beet-grower is restricted in his operations, both are on the same footing exactly; and that was the position before the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was introduced. Both growers were absolutely unrestricted as to the labour tney employed. But a restriction was placed on the grower of cane, and the Government valued the restriction at not less than £ 2 a ton, while the honourable member for Wide .Bay estimates it at £ 3 . When the Government allow £ 2 a ton to the cane-grower, they are not giving him any concession as against the beet-grower, but are only putting him in the same position as if he used black labour; but by giving this £ 2 to the beet-grower the Government give the latter an advantage to that extent, because he has not been interfered with or restricted in any way with regard to the labour he employs.",40
222,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The beet-grower will get the rebate if he uses black labour.,40
223,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The beet-grower does not need to use black labour. When both growers were unrestricted, one used white parts 1 labour and the other used black labour.",40
224,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Neithe r does the beet-grower want a tropical climate.,40
225,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is so. Both were on level terms; but one is now restricted and damaged, according to the Government's own statement, to the extent of £ 2 a ton. But the Government say-""Giv e the beetno grower a rebate of £ 2 per ton, although do not restrict him or damage him,"" there should fore, to that extent he has the advantage the cane-grower. I mention this point because it does not seem to have gene home to honourable members.",40
226,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Robertson) The committee have harked back to the discussion we had on this question able member for Echuca. in November last. Certain honourable members on this side contended that black labour is absolutely necessary in growing sugar in Northern Queensland, and they are sticking to their guns today when they put. say there shall be a concession in favour of sugar grown by enforced white labour; because, they urge, it is a country where black labour only should be employed. When that discussion took place I and others held that south of Mackay white labour could grow sugar, and for that reason I voted for the exclusion of black labour from that part of the State. The Government contended that sugar can be grown by white labour down as far .as New South Wales, but as tliey had to offer some inducement to people to employ white labour in the-extreme north, they decided to give a rebate of £ 2 in the excise. The Government still hold that white labour can be employed there, and it is pretty freely conceded that such labour can produce sugar in the region I have indicated. If the same system is not applied to both classes of growers, the beet-grower will have a protection of £ 3 per ton while the grower of canesugar in North Queensland will have a protection of £ 5 per ton, each using white labour. It seems a perfectly fair thing to say that if, they compete on equal lines in Australia",40
227,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"How can the honourable member say that even under those circumstances they compete on the same not lines in Queensland as in New South Wales, and in other parts where beet sugar is grown 1 Can sugar be grown as easily by white labour in Queensland as in other",40
228,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It cannot be grown as easily as with black labour, nor can other things be grown as easily in New South Wales as when there was convict labour. But the right is denied of using inferior and Kanaka labour; and if the sugar can be grown by white labour, there ought to be advantage given over those parts of we Australia where beet-sugar is grown-ther e be no advantage given to one part of over another.. To give the Queensland growers protection to the amount of £ 5 , and the beet-growers protection to the amount "" of £ 3 , seems to me absolutely unfair; and I shall adhere to the vote I gave on the previous occasion, assuming that the Government accept the proposal of the honorQuestion - That the amendment be amended by the insertion of the words "" and beet "" after the word "" cane ""The committee divided.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Amendment of the amendment agreed Amendment, as amended, agreed to. Amendment (by Mr KINGSTON) agreed to. That after the words' just inserted the words "" The rebate in the case of sugar-cane to be inserted.",40
229,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I m o v e That the figure "" 4 "" be omitted with a view to insert the figure ""5."" The proposed rebate of 4s. a ton upon sugar cane grown solely with white labour, and containing 10 per cent, of sugar, is equivalent to a rebate of £ 2 a ton upon the sugar itself, and as the excise upon sugar is to be £ 3 a ton, the grower who employs white labour will still have to pay an excise duty of £ 1 a ton. I think, however, that i the wish of the majority of honourable bers that every encouragement should given to the production of sugar solely by white labour. The only justification I can find for the Government withholding a larger rebate from those who AYES. labour in growing sugar is that their present Knox, W. proposal will be sufficient to meet the extra expense to which they will be put. I think, however, that a rebate of os. a ton on cane, equal to £ 2 10s. a ton upon sugar, would be a much fairer proposal, and one which I hope the committee will agree to.  ber's proposal apply to beet-sugar ?",41
230,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I should have been very pleased if the beet question had not been raised ; but to be consistent with the vote which I have just given I must vote for the giving of this larger rebate to all sugar growers who employ white labour. Nearly Tellers. all the growers in my district and in uther districts who have communicated with me on the subject, or with whom I have had NOES. personal conversations, have expressed themselves anxious, not to make an unfair profit out of the* proposed rebate, but to demonstrate to the world that they can grow sugar exclusively with white labour; and, if without injury to other industries of the PAIRS. Commonwealth we can make the task easier for them, we should endeavour to do so. For the first year, at any rate, New South Wales growers will benefit by this Braddon, Sir E. arrangement more than the' Queensland growers will benefit. I do not anticipate that outside of NTew South Wales more than Cameron, D. N. 20,000 tons of sugar will be produced with Hughes, W. M. white labour during the first year of the operation of the Tariff, and, therefore, the to. proposal that I now make would lead to a loss of revenue in Queenland of only £10,000 in that year; but I do not wish to conceal the fact that in my opinion in each succeeding year the production of sugar "" be grown with white labour will increase, and, therefore, the loss of revenue will increase, though I do not think that it will seriously affect the Commonwealth resources. I need not repeat what I have already said about - the action of New South Wales politicians in continuing a duty of £ 3 a ton upon sugar to protect their growers from the competition of growers in Queensland and elsewhere who employed black labour.",41
231,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"But under the t is honourable member's proposal the growers memwho employ white labour will have a probe tection of £ 5 10s. against the world. Mr FISHER , - That duty will be operative only while our production of sugar is considerably less than the requirements employ white of the Commonwealth.",41
232,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,But the honourable member does not expect the Commonwealth to export sugar if only white labour is employed in the cane-fields ?,42
233,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am inclined to think that the employment of white labour will be so successful that in the course of a few years our production will overtake the Australian demand. ""When that time arrives, the customs duties will cease to operate.",42
234,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No , they will cease to operate only when we begin to export.",42
235,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"A very few tons in excess of Australian requirements would make a difference in the market value. But I do not wish to elaborate the argument. I am sorry to hear that the Government are against us. In the very first communication I had with the Government I stated that in my opinion the whole of the excise duty should go to the white grower, and I believe that if the electors of Australia were polled, that would be thenview. But if we do not succeed, I believe that those for whom we speak will not sit down to bewail the action of this Parliament, but will set to work and do their best under the circumstances. That is no reason, however, why we should make their task harder than is necessary. I ask the committee to give full consideration to the matter, and if possible to allow a rebate of 5s. per ton in the interests of Queensland growers particularly, and, in my opinion, in the interests of Australia generally.",42
236,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I have not the slightest intention of contributing to the debate on the amendment at any great length.. The question of using white labour for sugar production has been debated ad nauseam, and I respectfully suggest that we should get to a vote as early as practicable. Being in sympathy with the proposal for an additional payment, I had intended to propose that the rebate be Gs. per to n ; but from conversations I have had with other representatives of Queensland, I concur in the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay. To debate the matter at any length would be fatuity. We must all be very tired of discussing the different aspects of this question. I believe that every honourable member has pretty well made up his mind on the subject, and, therefore, there is no need for man}- speeches. I should like to see the business transacted promptly.",42
237,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," Wit h due deference to the honourable and learned member for Brisbane, I think there are a few words yet to be said in favour of the amendment. I am willing to admit that the Queensland sugar industry is in a transition state. It requires all the consideration which can be extended to it by the committee, and I hope that it will be given in the direction indicated by the honourable member for Wide Bay. I am somewhat sorry that he did not adopt his. first suggestion, and propose that the rebate should be 6s. a ton.",42
238,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It had no chance of being accepted.,42
239,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Possibl y not, judging from the expressions of opinion from both sides of the Chamber; but at the same time the honourable member might have tested the feeling of the committee. Honourable members on the other side seem to be imbued with the idea that two-thirds of this rebate is goingto the white sugar-growers in North Queensland. That is a very great fallacy. Of the 4s. which the Government propose to give, not more than a fraction, I suppose, will go to the growers. According to an interview which I read in the Argus this morning, the Treasurer estimates that about 20,000 tons will be grown during the coming season by white labour. Suppose that 30,000 tons are grown by white labour, a rebate of 4s. a ton would mean £60.000 only. The Minister for Trade and Customs has already affirmed the principle that after this month there will be no possibility of its being increased to any great extent. He has said that those desiring to grow cane by white labour only must register this month, and that if they do not they will not be entitled to claim a rebate.",42
240,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is not quite so-if t:iey start fresh.,42
241,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,For this year ?,42
242,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Certainly .,42
243,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That was the impression conveyed to me by the Minister, and I am pleased to hear that he does not adhere to that opinion. I feel positively certain that in no case will the amount exceed £100,000. Honourable members on the other side will be delighted to know that the balance of £310,000 will all go to the revenue, and that the white sugar-grower will get only a very small proportion of it . Speaking on this, question the other day the honourable member for South said that Australia is makin? great sacrifice. I am willing to admit that Australia is making a sacrifice in favour of the white sugai*-grower but if not the industry, at any rate the cause, is worthy of that sacrifice. shows that there are no people who have associated themselves with a servile class, as has been done in Queensland, but have had at some time or other to make a sacrifice of that nature. It is money well spent, and I am sure that the people of North Queensland will feel that Australia is doing, at any rate, justice to the industry and to the cause of a white Australia. The leader of the Opposition said recently that Queensland came into the Federation without any stipulations ; I hold that that is so. It was unfortunate, and perhaps it was a short sighted policy on the part of the Queensland Ministry, that we were not represented at the final sitting of the Convention, where any stipulations might have been made. At any rate, looking at the question from the other side, possibly the other federating States might have asked for some stipulations, on the ground that Queensland was bringing into the Federation a servile element which would not be conducive te the prosperity and welfare of the Commonwealth. I quite agree with the honourable and learned member for Brisbane that this question has been pretty well thrashed out. I hope the committee will remember that only a very small portion of this amount which is being collected as excise can be enjoyed by the cane-growers of North Queensland. It was for their benefit originally that the rebate was put on, and I am sorry that they will not benefit to any great extent. But there is another point to be considered. This excise duty has been collected since the 9 th October last, and there is not a shilling of it repayable as rebate to any of the sugar - growers before the 1st For a period of nine months the whole of the excise will go into the revenue. able members have asserted that this rebate will last for five years. It will operate for only four years and a half, that is, from the 1st""July, 1902, to the 1st January, 1907. I hope that the committee will grant the extra rebate of Is. I think, on second consideration, the Minister for Trade and Customs will support us in our views. i[r. Bamford.",42
244,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I should be very deSydney lighted if I could, but we regret that we a cannot meet the honourable member for Wide Bay as he desires. At the same time we wish to congratulate him on the stand which it is evident that he and his fellowQueenslanders intend to take in reference to History the attemjit to firmly maintain the sugar industry, and to give the scheme a trial. We believe that the concession we propose, and the basis on which our legislation proceeded, is a fair and reasonable one. It is a concession of two-thirds of the whole excise duty, and the honourable member is now asking for 80 per cent., a difference of 14 per cent. We think it would be infinitely preferable to adhere to the principles on which we previously dealt with the matter, to stick to the figures we have hitherto proposed. Hereafter we may come to different conclusions, in the light of fresh events. We are sanguine that the inducements we now propose to the establishmenb of the white sugar industry in Australia are sufficient. And under these circumstances we cannot agree to extend them. Experience, however, may show other results. I am inclined to think that experience will show that we proposed all that was desirable. Further, it must be recollected that after the period which is here referred to the excise ceases, and the full advantage of its abolition is reaped by those interested in the industry.",43
245,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I intend to oppose the proposed addition to the rebate which the Government are offering. At the same time. I never could see the policy of offering this rebate of 4s. The Government are giving it, I suppose, to try to expedite the use of white labour. But after the howl we have had from the Queensland planters as to the impossibility of carrying on except with coloured labour, do the Government for a moment think that the planters are going to dispense at once with July. all coloured labour, or that they are not going to take advantage of the declining Honor- proportions under the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1 If under this bait of £ 2 a ton the. planters at once take to white labour, all I can say is that the allegation made by many of them that they could not carry on with white labour in Queensland was all fustian. I cannot see what result will be achieved by making the proposed addition except to sacrifice revenue. If it amounts to anything it will be simply giving, where there is no necessity for it, an additional compensation to those who anticipate the period of 1907, and the use of white labour only. I do not see the necessity for making the addition. The Government really seem to have gone to work with regard to this rebate in an extraordinary fashion. If they thought this condition was likely to lead to white labour being employed, would it not be better to knock the excise off at once and not wait t ill 1907.? ""Would it not be better to give the concession right off? That would amount to something : but a rebate of £ 2 a ton is not likely to induce a single planter not to take advantage of the declining proportions of black labour which he may employ until 1907.",43
246,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," We find that the Government are against us, and I , therefore, make this suggestion : I trust that if the committee carry the vote against me, the Government will institute a liberal administration of the provision with regard to the refund in the interests of the growers.",44
247,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"What the honourable member mean by a liberal administration ? Mr FISHER , - It has been indicated that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has considerable power in connection with sugar production, both in respect to the cultivation of land itself and the control over many growers. What I for one desire is that the Government should provide the analysts who will analyse the cane and ascertain the amount of sugar contained therein. This will insure the payment of the rebate to the growers. The expense would not amount to a large sum, and if these officers are appointed by the Govern' ment and are under Commonwealth control, they will be entirely free from influence on the part of the Sugar Refining Company or any other concern - I think that the honourable member for",44
248,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The reason for putting the rebate on the cane itself is that the money shall go to the growers.,44
249,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I hope that the acting leader of the Opposition is with me in regard to the proposal. The inspectors and analysts would see that the payment of the money was really made to the growers, and that in this way the will of Parliament was efficiently carried out. I for one should hesitate to pass any legislation of this character were I in doubt that the money of the tax-payers of Australia would go to the people to whom the committee desires it to go. For these reasons I hope that the Government will not be what is called "" penny saving"" in this matter, but will be careful to see that the people whom honourable members desire to receive the money will get it , and that no one else gets it . I also want to draw the attention of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, to some considerations with regard tb his statements in connection with rebate. Does he not know that the protection to the sugar industry afforded by this Tariff is less than the protection throughout Australia before federation ?",44
250,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It certainly will not be so in 1907.,44
251,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It will be found that the protection was over £ i per ton before federation.,44
252,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I think the honourable member is wrong.,44
253,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The duty was in New South Wales, 4s. a cwt.; in Victoria, 6s. per cwt - in Queensland, 6s. Sd. per cwt.; in South Australia, 3s. per c w t ; and in Tasdoes mania, 6s. per. cwt.",44
254,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Wester n Australia admitted sugar free; the honourable member must reckon that in.,44
255,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Tb e duties before federation, came to over . £ 2 5 per ton for the six States. I therefore maintain my statement that the average throughout Australia was more than £ 4 per ton.",44
256,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In four of the States previously, the duties were revenue duties, because there was no production.",44
257,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I admit the statement of the honourable and learned member, but I think he is too fair-minded seriously to contend that it would be a fair thing to do away with these duties on sugar, considering the vast interests involved in Queensland.",44
258,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"South Sydney) Wide Bay in explaining what he would like to do in the matter of securing liberal administration, was taking a line that tended more in the direction of securing what he is working for, than would the proposal which is now before the committee; although the term ""liberal administration,"" in this connection is not fully expressive of what the honourable member has in his mind. If the administration does not carry out the in tention of the committee so that the money reaches the pockets of the growers, the Government will not be doing what the committee intended. It is almost a pitythat the provision in question was made a part of the Tariff. It would have been far better to put the excise at £3 a ton, and then introduce a separate enactment to deal with the rebate to growers of sugar employing white labour. Up to the present I have not heard or seen any very definite and conclusive statement on the part of the Government, as to how the payment of the rebate is to be carried out. The committee has been in a quandary all through to secure what is certainly in its mind-that this rebate should reach the growers of sugar-cane who are employing white labour. A considerable amount of doubt exists as to how it will turn out, and as to whether the rebate will reach companies like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and other organizations of the kind, instead of reaching the grower. I hold that if we have, not what the honourable member for Wide Bay calls liberal administration, but what I prefer to call a rigid and just administration, so that the money reaches the real growers of the sugar, we shall accomplish more than by increasing the rebate. Personally, I should prefer to have no excise at all-and port duty for the matter of that; but as has been said before, we agreed in considering a very vital question, that of Kanaka labour, that we would vote for a protective duty on sugar, and would also grant for a certain time a rebate on the excise duty to those who would grow sugar-cane by means of white We did that in order to soften the blow which it was considered would be struck at Queensland by the abolition of black labour. So that I am prepared to stick to my guns, and vote for duties and rebate in the interest of the Queensland growers, although I say again that it means a considerable sacrifice on the part of Australia generally. Considerable as the sacrifice is, Australia is prepared to make it, and this committee will be united in wishing to carry it out. But I do not think it is right to introduce a proposal to alter this arrangement, and increase the rate. I am also in doubt as to how this rebate is to be arranged so that it will really reach the grower. If the honourable member for Wide Bay and those who are acting with him would take steps to induce the Government to bring.in some legislation or to take some action which would insure the rebate reaching the growers Mr G. B. Edwards. they will do more good than by increasing the amount.",44
259,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," The Minister for Trade and Customs said a few minutes ago that the Government had dealt liberally with the planters in this connection, but that if it were found that some more generous treatment were required they would give consideration to it later on. The time when the planters are likely to feel the change most is when it is first being initiated - Many of them are now complaining that the rebate has already been wil hheld too long. It is not necessary for me to say that I favour the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and shall give it my support. Vested interests have been created in Queensland under certain conditions, and the Commonwealth in the interests of the people are about to disturb those conditions. It is only right that in doing so the utmost consideration that can be given shall be extended to those who have expended their money and their energy in building up the sugar industry. A good deal has been said about the sacrifice the Commonwealth no im- is making. I do not for a moment depreciate that sacrifice; but, at the same time, we must remember the sacrifices other people had to make in consequence of their not having dealt with similar problems in their earlier stages. We should remember the millions of treasure and the thousands of lives that America had to sacrifice in labour. dealing with the coloured labour problem. We ought to think lightly of the sacrifices we are called upon to make in the beginning to free Australia from the possibility of the dangers that America had to face in the early sixties. W it h the last speaker I think that the committee should have been made acquainted with the arrangements which the Government propose to make for the payment of the rebate. There has been a good deal of anxiety in Queensland to find out how the arrangements for carrying out this system are to be conducted. The excise is being collected, but the rebate will not be payable until July, and, in the meantime, those who are to obtain the rebate have to accommodate themselves to the altered circumstances. Some of them are loyally trying to do so. I hold in my baud letters on this subject from some of my own constituents. My electorate comprises part of the Queensland sugar districts. These electors are full of complaint upon the subject, and say that there is a condition of unrest and uneasiness as to how the business is to be eonducted. They do - not know what to do to qualify themselves to receive the bonus. W it h the honourable member for Wide Bay, I believe that whatever decision the committee may come to upon this proposal, the planters of Queensland will do their best to accommodate themselves to the altered circumstances. But I also agree with him that we should make the transition as easy for them as possible. I admit that there should be some excise duty imposed, even if it were to cover only the cost of inspection and administration under this part of the Bill, but I think that 10s. per ton, which will be left if the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay is adopted, will be ample to cover those expenses. I hope that, notwithstanding the Government have declared against the amendment, the committee will carry it .  wish to express my entire sympathy with the honourable member for Wide Bay on the question of the administration of these proposals. At the same time, I express my doubt whether conditions can be enforced by any Government that will bring about the results the honourable member looks for. The companies who have such power in this industry can practically fix the price they will pay for cane.",45
260,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If we get a majority in Queensland we shall establish a State refinery.  gest that the only solution of the difficulty will be the establishment of a State refinery or the nationalisation of the industry, because I believe that these large companies will be able to regulate the price of cane, and as the price paid for cane is lowered, so will the price paid for labour be lowered. I cannot agree with the honourable member'sproposal to increase the rebate, as I have pledged myself to the Government proposal which goes quite as far as I can go.",46
261,Mr MCDONA LD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE, I desire to endorse all that has been said as to the desirability ' of the Government making some special provision to secure that this bonus to be given for the cultivation of sugar by white labour shall only go not to the planter but to the workmen engaged in the industry.,46
262,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is a still more difficult matter.,46
263,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I realise the difficulty as fullyasdpes the right honourable gentleman, but I have risen to put in a word for the unfortunate men who will have to work on the plantations, knowing that in particular districts in Queensland, and other honourable members can bear me out in what I say, 7s. 6d. a week has been offered for white men to work on the plantations, 12s. a week being quite a common wage to offer. I hope that in carrying out these proposals, while getting rid of the Kanaka at the earliest possible moment, as we all desire to do, the Government will see that those who have to work in the cane-fields"" are not brought down to the level of the Kanakas. A good deal has been said about the monopoly of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that at perhaps no distant date we shall have a State sugar refinery in Queensland. I believe that is the only solution of the difficulty. We must not overlook the fact that the world's production of cane-sugar is - very small, and that we are really giving the planters a protective duty to the extent of £ 1 0 a ton, because the only competition we need expect is that of - beetsugar, and not of cane-sugar grown outside the Commonwealth.",46
264,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There is a great deal of cane-sugar imported from Mauritius.,46
265,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I admit that it is imported to some extent, but the honourable member knows that the only competition we have any need to fear at the present time is from imported beet, and not from imported cane-sugar.",46
266,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Onl y onaccountof thebonus.,46
267,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I admit that the bonus is the real cause of it. I believe that the Continental nations are very stupid in paying four millions of their people's money to put cheap sugar upon the London market, and to capture the other, outside markets. That, in my opinion, was a very stupid thing to do, but honourable members must not forget that we are now proposing to do exactly the same thing here with reference to beet-sugar. I desire to point out that we are really giving the sugar-planters a protective duty of £ 1 0 per ton, and I hope they will reciprocate the generous treatment being extended to I them by this House by fair treatment of those who have to work in the fields to produce the sugar-cane. I fear with other honourable members that there is likely to be some difficulty in securing that, but I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Government that everything will be done on their part to frame regulations which will prevent the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from intercepting the amount of the rebate, and putting it into their pockets, instead of allowing it to go to the planters, and possibly from them on to the workers. Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN "" (Melbourne) - I have a very great deal of sympathy with the honourable member who has moved this amendment, and also with some of the speakers who intend to vote with him on this occasion. I feel that they have themselves to blame to a very great extent for having made this discussion necessary by voting 'to prevent the planters having proper labour, and the only labour with which I believe they will be able to continue to grow sugar cane. Still I will vote with them, seeing that they have turned round, and because I feel that Queensland has been very hardly dealt with in this matter.",46
268,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member for Wide Bay has said that careful and liberal administration is necessary in this connection. The Government have always recognised that one of the difficult problems they have to face is how to secure to the grower the benefit of this rebate, because it is undoubtedly the intention of Parliament that the grower should have the benefit ,of it , and that it should not pass into the hands of the manufacturers and refiners. We have given much care to the consideration of the matter, and have devised something which we think will meet the case. We have decided that the rebate is to be paid to the grower, and also that it is to be paid on the delivery of the cane or beet for manufacture, so that there would not be much time for it to get into the hands of the manufacturer. Our idea is that on the delivery of the cane or beet the sugar contents should be ascertained, and the grower should receive a liebate note, which will be as good as cash for customs purposes. I believe that will effectually do what is required. We recognise that there may be a struggle between the manufacturer and the grower, and that, if we are not careful, what we intend for the benefit of the grower may be diverted into other hands. 'We therefore ask that, whatever Government may have charge of the matter, the House will deal liberally with them by giving them large powers to carry out the proposal. Of course with that they will have the increased responsibility of carrying out the intention of Parliament to give this rebate for the benefit of the grower and the grower only. To meet the various devices which we may expect to have to meet for the purpose of defeating the intention of Parliament we ask to be armed with very large authority in this respect. I am disposed to think that the committee, recognising the difficulty, will do what is necessary to enable the Government of the day to effectually deal with the matter. .

278,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That would be a matter of administration. If the Minister found that the Government analysts were capable of determining the quantity of sugar that the cane would give he would get rid of them.,48

We are trying to give facilities to sugar. farmers to produce sugar-cane by means of white labour, and to that end are attemptis taken out ? ing to afford them certain advantages. The Queensland Government have lent money to a number of farmers who have operated to erect mills for the production of raw sugar, which the Colonial pany buys and refines. The* great difficulty in the past, before the present imposed, was that, while raw sugar was worth £ 8 10s. or £ 9 10s. a ton, refined molasses. sugar was worth £ 1 4 or £15. The margin of profit on the raw sugar runs from, to £ 1 per ton, while on the sugar turned out by the company the profit is £ 3 to per to n; and yet, according to the Minister, the producers of the raw sugar are excise to the amount of £ 1 or £ 3 , and thus have their profits very largely reduced, or taken away altogether, seeing that they do golden syrup ? not get the benefit of a protective duty.",50
320,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We must give the rebate and charge the excise on the same basis. 2S 3i,50
321,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The Government are not proposing that.,50
322,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is what we want to do.,50
323,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I understand that the basis of all the calculations is not the amount of raw sugar, but the amount of refined sugar produced.",50
324,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What does the honourable member mean when he says that the producers of the raw sugar will have to pay the excise ?,50
325,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I understand that the producers of the raw sugar will have to pay the excise. The sugar refiners make what is known as the best white sugar, while the raw sugar is brown, with a ceramount of molasses in it . The latter is produced by a number of farmers who have co-operated because they cannot go to on the enormous expense of £100,000 to£300,000 for magnificent up-to-date plant.",50
326,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The raw sugar. I such understand, includes all the molasses.",50
327,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Not at all. It is a market- ,50
328,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Some of the' rawis sugar is marketable. The Treasurer may know the brown sugar which is served out. on stations.,50
329,Sir GEORGETURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Soft , whitey-brown",50
330,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is the raw,50
331,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,After the molasses,50
332,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No .,50
333,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I thought the re- cofiner took out the golden syrup ?,50
334,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The raw sugar has Sugar Comthe golden syrup in it .,50
335,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Has it all the duty was molasses out of it ?,50
336,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,A portion of the,50
337,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And that portion say, 10s. becomes golden syrup ?",50
338,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No , not altogether;-. £ 4 and that is where the difficulty will befound. I am talking of the raw sugar which, to pay the company buys to refine.",50
339,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And when they refine it , what they get out of it is the",50
340,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes , but it is not proposed to charge the excise on the refined sugar; it is the person who produces the raw sugar who will have to pay the excise.",50
341,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The member wants the excise charged on the refined sugar?,51
342,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Yes .,51
343,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"How are we to ascertain how much refined sugar the cane will produce, because we must pay on the same basis as we collect ?",51
344,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It is generally considered that 8 tons of. cane will produce one ton of refined sugar.,51
345,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It varies very much, but it has been put at 10 per cent.",51
346,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It varies according to the density of the cane, and the Government have put it at 10 per cent., but the proportion I have stated is the general average. - Mr FISHER - I think not.",51
347,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am not particular to a ton, and will say 9 tons of cane will produce one ton of refined sugar.",51
348,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is it .,51
349,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I advise the Minister, before he decides definitely as to how the excise is to be charged, to make further inquiries as to whether it would not be better to collect the excise on the refined sugar. This is a most important matter, because the Colonial Sugar Refining Company may be allowed to go free, while the excise is levied on the producer of the raw sugar, who is the very man we want to protect.",51
350,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What percentage does the raw sugar lose in refining ?,51
351,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I cannot say exactly ; but it would be well to make full to. inquiries into this matter.,51
352,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We have made f u l inquiries, but we shall be happy to suppleobjecting ment them.",51
353,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," If the Government wish to be accurate and just all parties, it would be better to fix standard. In Europe 88 degrees of purity is the standard for raw sugar, and 99 degrees the standard for refined sugar. the percentage were lower, some deduction could be made, and, if higher, tion.",51
354,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In order to pay the rebate on the cane and to enable the excise to be collected on the same basis, could analyses be obtained ?",51
355,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Not to be very accurate, because some canes give more molasses than others. honourable Sir GEORGE TURNER - That is the trouble I see.",51
356,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I suppose that what applies to beet-sugar in this connection will apply in a sense to cane-sugar. If an analysis of the juice of beet-root shows the presence of 14 or 15 per cent, of sugar, it is generally found that, included in that, is 2 or 3 per cent, more or less of foreign substances, which prevent the crystallization of more than about 10 per cent, of the sugar, and then, of course, there is a further loss in the process of refining. The honourable member for AVide Bay suggests that the rebate should .be paid upon the analysis. If that were done, an allowance would have to be made for the quantity of molasses and other waste. To be accurate, I think the excise should be fixed, and the rebate given, upon sugar that would polarize at SS degrees, making an increase or diminution according to the variations from that standard of purity. If we deal with the sugar, there is no difficulty, but if we deal with the cane there will be difficulty, because it will be necessary to ascertain the average weight by which to fix the standard. Eighty-eight degrees of polarization is the standard of raw sugar in the European markets.",51
357,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," On e of the speakers to-night has argued that the excise duty will have to be paid by the grower of the sugar-that the excise duty must be paid the moment the sugar leaves the mill, and before it is sold.",51
358,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is what I object,51
359,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The l honourable member would be quite right into it if it were so; but I am certain that the purchaser of raw sugar, like the purchaser of tobacco, whisky, beer, or to wine, will buy in bond, and that excise a will not be paid until the sugar has to be taken out of bond. The producer will not pay the excise unless he has agreed beforeI f hand with the purchaser to do so. In practice it is the refiner or the speculator some addiwho will pay the excise.",51
360,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," The question which has been raised is of much more importance than 'the committee seem to think. Under three of the State Tariffs, all sugar, except loaf sugar, was treated as raw sugar, and paid duty accordingly. That definition of refined sugar, however, was notoriously incorrect. All sugar, except the pure juice of the cane, is more or less refined, and the question that must be determined is what is the degree of refinement. In England, I believe, the duty is paid upon the saccharine contents of the sugar, and varies according to the degree of polarization. I think it would be wise for the Government to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Kennedy, and postpone this matter until they can consult with experts as to what is the proper wording for the conditions which we are now considering. How we are to get over the difficulty of the amount of rebate which the Government should pay to the growers' I do not know. The first thing that we should do is to establish what the duty on sugar shall be, and define the standard of strength. Then the rebate must be paid upon the same lines, according to the contents of the cane.",51
361,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I think it must be clear to honourable members that we are to some extent wasting our time ; because it seems impossible for this committee to define the term ""manufactured sugar."" The Minister, perhaps, will inform us if it is possible to formulate a definition by regulation 1 The operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are very large. At its refineries in Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Adelaide, and Brisbane, it refines most of the sugar that is used within the Commonwealth. All the sugar that is refined in New South Wales is refined by them. As a result, the value of the by-products, the loss of weight, and the cost of refining, are, in a sense, trade secrets.",52
362,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Dr Maxwell gave us a. fair margin in his report.,52
363,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not think honourable members have sufficient information before them. Therefore we have no basis' upon which to found a definition. I am inclined to think that if we trust the Minister to have a definition formulated, it will be satisfactory to honourable members.",52
364,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The difficulty is this : We want to provide for the payment of excise and the giving of rebate upon the same scale, but »ve wish the rebate to be given on the cane before it has undergone any process by which its sugar-giving contents may be discovered. In order to secure the benefit of the rebate to the grower, it is highly desirable that upon the delivery of the cane, he shall obtain his rebate note, and that thereupon his interest in it shall cease. 28 M 2 At ' the sametime, for the safety of the revenue, we must provide that the rebate shall not be in excess of the scale upon which the excise is fixed.",52
365,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"A standard could be fixed approximately by getting returns from two or three mills as to what they pay according to analysis, and what is the waste in manufacture.",52
366,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They mix the different sorts of cane. I think we are thoroughly agreed as to what.we want-to give the growers the full benefit of what they are entitled to, and at the same time to reserve to the Government the right to get what they are entitled to. I think if we put in a provision of this sort it will meet the caseAll rebates to be allowed at the time of delivery of the cane or beet on the ascertainment in the manner prescribed of the sugar-giving contents. We have had a lot of expert advice, and will look into the matter further, and, if necessaiy, bring it bef ore the committee again. I take it that it is possible to ascertain when certain cane is submitted what are its sugar giving contents.",52
367,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What it will give when manufactured.,52
368,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It is always bought on that basis.,52
369,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes . I do not wish to provide in so many words how I am going to do it on account of the difficulties which are patent to honourable members at this very moment. I wish to have the power of dealing with the matter as it arises. I do not think we can put a hard-and-fast rule in the Act. A matter of this sort ought to be subject to parliamentary control and supervision, and if we take the power to deal with it by regulation we shall do all that is right, and I shall be very glad if honourable members will let us have that power. We tax on the sugar it gives and we ought to allow on the sugar it gives. We ought to get the necessary information as quickly as possible, so as to let the grower have his rebate and go away happy.",52
370,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I am afraid that it is only pushing the difficulty further back ,52
371,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I am taking the fullest power to deal with any difficulty.,52
372,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I do not see that the Minister's proposal differs to any appreciable extent from what is proposed here* Although the Minister says he is going to charge an excise duty of £ 2 on the raw sugar the rebate is to be given, not on the raw sugar, but on the refined sugar, because it says-""Te n per cent, of sugar."" When a ton of sugar has been got out of 10 tons of cane, it is refined sugar, not raw sugar.",52
373,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,But does the honourable member hold that under the name of sugar he could not collect the duty on raw sugar ?,53
374,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am pointing out the effect of the proposal. The Queensland members and the committee generally, I think, are under the impression that there is a difference of £ 1 per ton between the excise and the rebate, but if raw sugar yields only 86 per cent, of refined sugar, there would be a reduction of the difference by 10s. per ton, that is to say, the duty would be £ 3 10s. on the raw sugar as compared with a rebate of £ 2 a ton on the refined sugar.",53
375,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We want to make the calculation on the same basis, either or the other.",53
376,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is of no useto ignore the strength of sugar, because if you charge on raw sugar you reduce the margin between the rebate and the excise.",53
377,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Not if you take the sugar-producing power of raw sugar.,53
378,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No j but the Ministry has not provided for that.,53
379,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The intention is that both must be on the same basis.,53
380,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There is no provision for that, and the Minister for Trade and Customs said that he was going to charge the £ 3 per ton on raw sugar.",53
381,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,He said also that he would allow the rebate on the same and basis.,53
382,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"But the basis is proports vided for, and it is n6t the same basis. agree with the honourable member for GippsQueensland, land that you have to take into account sugar strengths, and you cannot even say that you will charge on only the refined sugar, as some of it ought to go into sumption in its raw state.",53
383,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We oharge whatever goes into consumption.,53
384,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The full sugar duty?,53
385,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Before it leaves the factory we charge the excise.,53
386,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If you charge £ 3 a ton.on the raw sugar and it runs 86 or 87 cent., and you only rebate on the sugar as if it were refined sugar",53
387,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Oh , no.",53
388,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is what is proposed here. The rebate is calculated on cane giving 10 per cenb. of sugar, and is not that refined sugar ?",53
389,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No .,53
390,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is 10 per cent, of refined sugar that is meant. What is sugar? Is not this the test-suga r without any foreign ingredients in it ?",53
391,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Sugar that is refined has no foreign ingredients in it.,53
392,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The rebate is calcuthen lated on the cane giving 10 per cent, of sugar, and is to be increased or reduced proportionately, according to any variation from this standard. In Queensland, as a rule, ten tons of cane will give a ton of » refined sugar. This duty evidently is meant to apply to refined sugar. I think it would one be much better to decide what is payable by the strength of the sugar.",53
393,Mr MCDONA LD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," To emphasize what I said, I propose to read an extract from the report of Dr MaxwellThe price of raw sugars, of 88 per cent, net titre, f.o.b. at Queensland ports, for the season commencing 1st July, was £8 per ton, with a bonus which is estimated to have added £1 19s. per ton, thus making a total of £9 19s. per ton. Dr Maxwell goes on to quote the prices of best white sugars in bond at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, for the year ending June, 1901, according to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's transactions. The price in Brisbane was £ 1 6 ; in Sydney, £ 1 6 5s.; in Melbourne, £ 1 7 ; in Adelaide, £ 1 6 5s.; while the price of raw sugar in Queensland for these various was £ 9 19s. There is a difference I of £ 6 in the price of sugar not only in but throughout the States. In the the production of raw sugar which runs to 88 per cent., they say that the margin of profit is only about 8s. or 10s. per ton. conFrom the time the raw sugar is produced up to the time it is refined they had a maron gin of profit of about £ 4 per ton.",53
394,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,You do not get quite as much rifined sugar as you do raw.,53
395,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They say that allowing for loss and all other charges in refining, there is a net profit of about £ 4 . The real difficulty in Queensland has been per that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has practically been pocketing this enormous profit, A large number of the mills situated all over Queensland produce what is known as raw sugar.",53
396,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What is the cost of refining ?,54
397,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We the ins and outs of the working of these establishments, but it is generally admitted by all those who have anything to do with the industry, that the profit from the chase of the raw sugar, until it is refined, ranges from £2 10s. to £4.",54
398,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There is an enormous amount for the depreciation of machinery and all that. - Mr MCDONALD - I admit all that. Here is the very difficulty .cropping up which we originally tried to guard against-tha the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are going to get off scot free. If they buy the sugar in bond, they will buy it less amount of duty they will have to pay. I do not think that any company will be different foolish enough, while they can force people to sell-raw sugar to them at £ 8 or £ 9 per ton, to give £ 1 0 or £ 1 1 per This extra amount of excise duty that the producers of raw sugar will have to pay will come out of their pockets, and hence will come off those who produce the cane, and so the very thing we are trying to avoid will happen if we charge the duty on the raw sugar.",54
399,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Will not the same thing happen if we charge the duty on the refined sugar ? Will they not carry back just in the same way 1 Will it really cutting. make any difference?,54
400,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If the company has density ? to pay the excise duty it is quite possible that they will try and shift the producers of the raw sugar, and that the latter will try and push it on to those who produce the cane, who i push it on to the workmen.",54
401,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What the honourable member suggest 1,54
402,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It would be far tons better under the circumstances to charge the duty on the refined sugar, because it the company that really gets the benefit the sugar industry.",54
403,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Then does the honourable member say that the eight er ten tons of cane will give a ton of refin sugar ?,54
404,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Fro m eight to ten tons. Of course, I can not speak definitely. If it is a very dry climate or a dry season the density of the cane may go down. It depends upon the density of the cane. If there is a good season, suitable for cane do not know production, eight tons of cane may produce a ton of refined sugar; or if there is not a good season it may take ten tons to produce a ton of refined sugar. I think the density purof the cane would be a fair basis upon which to calculate. But that is not the point I want to get at.",54
405,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member wants to make the refiner pay the duty.,54
406,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The sugar refining people are those who make the money, and t I want them to pay the excise.",54
407,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I see difficulties in the method suggested by the the Minister for Trade and Customs, because when the areas are small, perhaps 30 or 40 cane growers will bring their cane into the mill at the same time. There is no possibility of judging of the density of each ton for it . man's cane separately.",54
408,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does not the mill do that before buying the cane ? Otherwise it how do they know what they have to pay ?,54
409,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,When the cane is grown upon small areas they cannot do it .,54
410,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Then how do they arrive at what they have to pay ?,54
411,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They pay per ton. In most of the cane-growing areas each mill has a cane inspector, whose duty it is to go it round and see when the cane is fit for",54
412,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Does he not test the,54
413,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No , that is tested in the duty on to the mill afterwards.",54
414,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Is there not a certificate given to the grower, showing the n turn will density of his cane 1",54
415,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The weight of the does cane-but not for the density. I was going to suggest that we should assume that ten of cane will make a ton of refined sugar, and pay the rebate on that j but I recognise is that in one sense that plan would be against of the interests of the industry because it would lead to slovenly cultivation. The man who carefully cultivated his land would get no more than the careless man. I should d prefer to follow the suggestion of the honourable member for Kennedy, and advocate the collecting of the excise upon the refined sugar. That - would be very much easier for the Government because there would be fewer places at which, to collect it .",54
416,Mr HABPEB,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,How could they collect it?,55
417,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They would collect it at the refinery. That would be simpler than collecting the excise at any particular mill and would also protect the manufacturer; because there is no doubt about it that the ""manufacturer is now entirely at the mercy of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",55
418,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"A lot of sugar is disposed bf that is not refined. Mr . BAMFORD - I do not see "" any other way of doing it than that suggested.",55
419,Mr MCDONA LD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," Perhaps it would be wise, under present circumstances, to pass the item, and then the Government can make the necessary inquiries about the matter. - SirGEOBGE TURNER - We made a lot of inquiries, but do not seem to get "" any forrader.""",55
420,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If we passed the item now it might be recommitted at later - stage. There seems to be a great difficulty, and we do not appear' to get - ther forward by discussing it now; because there is no one in the Chamber who has 'expert knowledge.",55
421,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Government - have made a number of inquiries, and have given the committee the benefit of them. am disposed, however, to think that we ' be able to arrange it better if we pass item now, and look into the matter further. ' If we 'can give the committee more infor-' mation on the subject we shall be glad ' do so ; and if afterwards we cannot satisfy the committee, we shall be pleased to an opportunity for the reconsideration of the ""subject - We know what we want to do, but there are difficulties in working 'matter out.

422,Mr KENNEDY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE, I wish to move that a rebate of so much per cwt. be allowed on all sugar used in the different processes of manufacture. The rate I would suggest would be 3s. per cwt.,55
423,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member is. thinking of customs, but this item pertains to excise. Item, asamended, agreed to. Item 136-Tobacco , viz. :Manufactured, per lb., Is: Cigars, per lb., Is. 6d. Cigarettes, including the weight of the outer portion of each cigarette, per lb., 2s. . Snuff, per lb., 2s.",55
424,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I . do not intend just now to suggest any particular alteration in this item, but I should like to urge that in dealing with tobacco manufactured, cigars, cigarettes, etc., we are dealing with one of the great revenue producing items of the : Tariff. It is not a matter of free-trade and have protection. No matter how we arrange these things, up to a certain point there is bound to be considerable protection for the local article. What we have to do is to decide a what is a reasonable protection, looking at it from the protectionist point of view, and fur- - then what is a reasonable, revenue to derive. In other words we ought to be very any careful not to rob the revenue for the sake of the protection. I think most honourable members will agree with me in that view of the item. We must recollect in dealing with the Tariff as a whole that many of the I items of an essentially protective character shall which we have passed are such that, as the the years go on, it may be more and more difficult for the Treasurer to know exactly what revenue he will receive from them. An unto certain revenue is one of the worse features of the financial situation. We must also give recognise that the continual interference with the Tariff after it is once of a reason- able character-which ; of course, we do not the believe this Tariff to be-is one of the injuries which can be done to busito ness. Therefore what I want to point out I '-at the beginning of this discussion is, which I that in the interests of revenue we ought to get as much out of the excise on this purely revenue-producing item as it is possible to get, considering at the same time' other conditions - - I am satisfied All rethat these excise duties should be increased. of the The Minister for Trade and Customs says manner to me across the table that we practically agreed to these items when we were discussing the customs and import duties on tobacco. I believe there were some divisions on the subject, and I do not know that they went altogether in favour of the Opposition contention. I do not think any definite agreement was arrived at, nor, as far as I recollect, was there any compact between the two sides. I have never looked upon this as a question between free-traders and protectionists, and I feel that the excise, as it stands here, is not on a sufficiently high scale in the interests of the revenue. But I do not want, at this stage, as other honourable members may wish to address themselves to the subject, to commit myself to any definite proposal.",55
425,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am afraid my honourable friend does not recollect what occurred when this discussion took place. We discussed this matter with regard to tobacco for several days, and there was a distinct feeling in the committee, with which I concurred, that the margin of difference of Is. per lb., which we were proposing, was too great. I recollect saying that I had not been able to satisfy myself that the manufacturers were entitled to that. We agreed then that the margin should be 9d. There was considerable difference of opinion, and grave doubt in my own mind, as to the wisest plan by which to fix the differencewhether it should be by increasing the amount of the excise, by putting something extra upon the leaf, by dividing it between the two, or by reducing the duty of 3s. 6d., which had been proposed, to 3s. 3d. U l t i mately it was decided that the import duty should be reduced to 3s. 3d., leaving the duty upon the manufactured leaf imported at Is. 6d., and the excise at Is., thus making the difference of 9d., which it was the feeling of the committee was sufficient. We practically adopted the margin which had been in operation in New South Wales, and I do hope we are not now going to re-open that question, as I am certain the committee came to that decision after fully considering the matter.",56
426,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"South Australia) The Treasurer has just stated that there was an arrangement made, or an agreement come to, for the time at any rate, that the margin should be 9d.; but he will probably recollect that in speaking upon the subject. I and other honourable members said that that would be quite insufficient.",56
427,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That was with regard to twist.,56
428,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes , particularly with regard to twist. I asked the right honourable gentleman bo look into the question, and see whether he could not agree to differentiate between strand and plug or flat tobacco.",56
429,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is so.,56
430,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In accordance with the notice I have given, I move That after the words "" Manufactured, per lb. Is.,"" the following words be inserted:- "" Manufactured strand, per l b . Is-, and on and after 12th February, 1902, per Jb= 9d."" "" Strand"" tobacco is the term used in the trade to describe what is generally known as twist tobacco. It was pointed out in previous discussions that the margin then fixed would be a severe blow to the tobacco-twisting industry, and might have the effect of abolishing it altogether. It has not had quite that result so far, but it has had the effect of producing a reduction of wages. The action of the committee in cutting down the margin to 9d. per lb. has had the effect in South Australia of bringing about a reduction of wages equal in the average to about 5s. per week per man.",56
431,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,They do it on piece-work V What do they get per lb. 1,56
432,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They are paid by piece-work, and, roughly, the average isabout 3^d. per lb.",56
433,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It is 4d. in Victoria. Mr BA TC H ELO R - I am speaking of South Australia, where there has been a reduction. The rate of pay there used to be 4d. per lb. all round. The pay now varies according to the number of plugs that go to a pound. In the' case of the lighter tobacco the wages paid are at the rate of 4d. per lb., and, in the case of other tobaccos, at the rate of 3^-d. and 3d. per lb., the average being 3Jd. per lb., as against 4d. per lb. previously paid. The margin in South Australia was previously Is: l ^ d. per lb., and the reduction of the margin to 9d. per lb. has had the effect of reducing the wages from 4d. to 3Jd. per lb., and that applied to the average output of a workman amounts to about 5s. per week. As Ministers know, the men engaged in the industry have not been working full time, and a reduction of wages to the extent of 5s. per week is, under the circumstances, considerable. I desire to draw the attention of the committee to the distinction between strand tobacco and other kinds of tobacco, because, unless the distinction is clear, it would impracticable to ask the Government to twisters make any difference.",56
434,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Is not "" twist"" a better word to use 1 The officers of the department recognise it as "" t w is t "" tobacco.",57
435,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,""" Strand "" tobacco is the word used in the trade, and as i technically known as "" strand "" tobacco, we might as well keep to that term. The process of preparing the leaf is the same in case of "" strand"" tobacco "" and "" f l a tobacco, but in the case of "" strand"" tobacco, the leaf having"" been prepared rolled by hand. I have here a number of specimens illustrating the manufacture. Honourable members will see here a number of leaves prepared ready for rolling. I have here also a piece of half-rolled tobacco, and a plug of "" twist "" tobacco as it leaves the tobacco twister's hands. After it leaves the tobacco twister's hands in this form, i is pressed, and flattened into the form i which it is sold. I have produced these specimens to prove my contention that it is very easy to the difference between flat tobacco and strand tobacco. I have here a specimen flat cake tobacco. As I have said, the leaf is prepared in the same way as for strand tobacco, but it is then placed in the receiver of what is practically a pressing machine. It is drawn into the machine, and pressed, and then comes out in long flat cakes, when it is cut into the squares or long cakes which honourable members are familiar. I this form it is wrapped round with a long leaf by the tobacco twisters, and that only handling it receives. I desire to the attention of the committee particularly to the fact that in the case of strand tobacco labour has to be employed to a considerable extent in rolling or twisting the leaves, because no machine has yet been invented that will do the work of the tobacco twisters. I am not in this matter making a fight against machinery; it would be idle not very material. to do anything of the kind, but, as I say, machine has yet been invented which will do the work of the twister, and so a plug considerable number of men are employed in the manufacture of the strand tobacco. The plug or flat tobacco is produced almost entirely by machines, which are fed, in some cases, by adult males, but which can and are sometimes,, worked by girls. The abolition of the manufacture of strand tobacco would, therefore, mean the displacebe ment of the skilled labour of tobacco by the labour of a few girls chiefly. I have no desire to exaggerate the case, and I therefore admit that in the case of the higher-priced tobacco the quality of the leaf used for both strand and flat tobacco is the same. Tobacco leaf is bought according t is to its colour, aroma, and length. Short leaves that will not roll up well are called "" fillers,"" and that is a cheaper tobacco the by from 2d. to 6d. per lb. than the leaf ret "" quired for making strand tobacco. Honourable members can compare the sample of is leaf which I have here for the manufacture of strand tobacco, and which consists, as they will see, of a number of long leaves of about equal length, with the specimen I have here of "" f ill e r "" leaves, which are very much shorter. The fact that in making strand or twist tobacco it is necessfiry not only to employ t leaf of good quality, but to use long leaves, n and also that more labour is involved in its manufacture as compared with flat or plug tobacco, makes it impossible for twist to ascertain compete with flat tobacco with the small margin of profit that exists at present. of That is why I ask for a difference in the treatment of the two kinds. Another point to be remembered is that strand tobacco presents fewer opportunities for adulteration than does plug tobacco. It is impossible to use the short ends in its manufacture, but, on the other hand, all the short ends with can be crushed together in plug tobacco. n Some two or three years ago I obtained out of a plug of imported tobacco nearly the is the whole of a stocking, which had been draw crushed up in it by machinery. There are some flat plugs, which are also made by hand. In appearance it is exactly like a machinemade cake. No one but an expert could tell the difference, and even an expert - could do so only by cutting open the plug and separating the grain. The quantity of plug tobacco of this kind made by hand is It would not be no fair to ask the committee to differentiate between hand-made plug and machine-made tobacco, because the difference between the two is so fine that an expert alone can determine it . On the other hand anyone can tell the difference between strand and plug tobacco, and there is a distinct demand be, for the two. In South Australia and Western Australia the greater demand is for stand tobacco, but in some of the other States that is not the case. I put it to the Government that one of the strong points in favour of this differentiation is that it is very easy to distinguish between the two classes. It is possible for anyone to distinguish between a piece of twist tobacco and a cake of plug tobacco. The former can be separated readily and the different rolls can be seen at a,glance. That applies to both large and small twists, but no amount of twisting would make an opening in a plug of flat tobacco. It is simply pressed into a solid block, and there is no special run of the leaf in it . If the differentiation in treatment for which I ask is allowed it will prevent the annihilation of the twist tobacco-making industry, while the men engaged in the work will receive an advantage.",57
436,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,How many employees ?,58
437,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Practicall y all the male tobacco workers are employed in making twist tobacco. Plug tobacco requires very little labour. Therefore, the manufacturers do not favour this proposal very strongly. Indeed, I do not know that any of them favour it .",58
438,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Some of them think that the system would not work very easily.,58
439,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Fro m what I can hear the majority of them hold quite the opposite view.,58
440,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I put it to a manufacturer who did not care for this proposal, whether there was anything in the contention, placed before me by another manufacturer, that difficulties with the excise officers would constantly arise in regard to distinguishing between twist and plug tobacco. He replied that it was impossible to imagine any difficulty that could arise. He did not agree with the proposal because he preferred to employ as few men as possible. He thought that the fewer men he employed the better it would be for his business.",58
441,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There would be less likelihood of strikesMr BATCHELOR,-Yes . He said facture of tabacco. the few girls and unskilled labourers required would be less likely to demand higher wages than would skilled workmen belonging to an organization. Therehigher fore the manufacturer would not view with disfavour the knocking out of strand tobacco.",58
442,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,How many men are employed in the manufacture of this tobacco 1,58
443,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,In South Australia alone the industry employs about 300 men.,58
444,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Is it solely because strand tobacco is made by hand that the honourable member asks for this concession t,58
445,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Certainl y not. I could not ask for it on that ground, because it is useless to kick against the employment of machinery. I have explained already that I ask for this concession on other grounds. There is always a certain demand for twist tobacco, but owing to the greater expense involved in its manufacture, as compared with plug tobacco, the margin of 9d. which we allow will knock it out. The manufacturers will secure greater profit from the making of plug tobacco.",58
446,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,How many men will be thrown out of employment if the concession for which the honourable member asks is not conceded 1,58
447,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I am not prepared to say.,58
448,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,About 500.,58
449,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The question is, how many men will drag on a miserable existence 1",58
450,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The whole of the tobacco twisters in. South Australia have been compelled already to submit to a reduction in consequence of the Government proposal. On the othei hand, if my proposition be acceded to, they will be placed on their former wage level.",58
451,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What do they earn a week 1,58
452,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They are paid by the piece and earn from £1 15s. to £2, and, in some cases, £2 5s. per week. What is it that the honourable member wishes to get at 1 Mr HENRY WILLIS . , - I want to know what would be the loss to the revenue ?",58
453,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I have not worked that out. The fact of the matter is, that if twist tobacco is knocked out altogether we shall have fewer men employed in the manu",58
454,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Cannot the price of twist tobacco be raised 1,58
455,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It has always been than the price of plug tobacco, but it cannot compete with plug tobacco on the basis proposed. This is not a case in which we are asking for something for the benefit of one or two manufacturers. The manufacturers are satisfied that matters should be allowed to remain as they are, although, no doubt, they would like a bigger difference all round. - Mr KINGSTON - The honourable member thinks they will continue to manufacture twist tobacco in any event; but that unless the concession he asks for is granted, they will cut down wages ?",58
456,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,They have done so already.,59
457,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"They will manufacture at the old rate of wages, if they obtain the difference for which I ask.",59
458,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I should think so. In that case they would be getting an advantage above that which they enjoyed before.,59
459,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member is wrong. They had Is. l ^ d . before.,59
460,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,But had they difference between plug and twist tobacco ?,59
461,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No . There was a difference of Is. l ^ d .,59
462,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Both on twist plug?,59
463,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes ; and as there was a greater local demand for twist as against plug, the manufacturers had to meet the demand. Under the present circumstances the manufacturers cannot pay the same rate of wages, and continue making twist; indeed, one manufacturer has assured cigarettes. me that he is not going to make any tobacco if the present excise is continued.",59
464,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Then manufacturers' generally, in South Australia cannot combelieve pete with'manufacturers in other States 1",59
465,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Undoubtedly into some cases smaller factories will not be to compete with factories elsewhere with very large outputs, the protection which former now have not being as great as was the case previously. They can, making the strand tobacco if the difference I ask for is granted, and that will mean the preservation of 'the industry. case, the tobacco-making industry in Australia, if it be confined to the one line of plug work, will hardly be worth protecthave ing to the extent proposed. In order protect the workmen's wages, this difference should be granted, especially as already some considerable damage has been done by the reduction of the import duty from -6d. to 3s. 3d. .",59
466,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member for South Australia, Mr . Batchelor, has placed his case on behalf of the workers in this particular industry very strongly. As I understand him, the manufacturers care very little what the rate is ; but the honourable member has raised a very important point. Are we to differentiate between the manufacture of the various Icinds of tobacco ? The honourable member has made out a fairly strong case in regard to twist tobacco; but my trouble is that, if we once admit the principle of differentiating, it is difficult to know where it will end. It will also raise the question of the employment of machinery in the manufacture of tobacco, and it would be hard to say that we would make a difference in the rate of excise because an article is made in the one case by hand and in another by machinery. The honourable memberhimself sees the no difficulty of such a position. So far as cigarettes are concerned, I should be only too glad, if it were possible, to make such a differentiation, because I believe it would and be perfectly just. But I am afraid we could not take up the position that, because these articles are made by machinery, therefore there should be a difference in the excise.",59
467,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I intend to move in that direction in the case of,59
468,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is a case in which my sympathies unquestionably go with the honourable member, because I that the amount of protection enjoyed by machine-made cigarettes is altogether too large. At the same time, are we declare, that, because certain articles can be able made by the best classes of machinery, we shall differentiate in favour of articles made the by hand ? This twist-malting industry appears to be limited almost exclusively however, go on to South Australia.",59
469,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,And to Western AusIn the other tralia and Victoria.,59
470,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"There are 54 hands employed in Victoria, but, though I no expert knowledge or experience, I am to told that there is very little demand for this particular class of tobacco, and that the industry is gradually dying out, no new persons entering it as employees, and no apprentices 3s. being taken. The honourable member mentioned that the leaf used is to a great extent colonial leaf, and we are all anxious to increase the production of leaf as far as possible. But if colonial leaf is largely used, the honourable member will realise that a somewhat better protection is given than is enjoyed by those who use imported leaf. I shall be glad to assist in every way I can those employed in the industry, and relieve them of any fear of their work being taken away altogether. But I have had so much experience of manufacturers saying that they will have to shut their factories and discharge all their men that I am beginning to get a little suspicious of such arguments. The men themselves, no doubt, believe that that will be the result, but I have great doubts whether there - will be any attempt to close factories - The honourable member has pointed out that wages have - been somewhat reduced, and we all regret that such should be the case.",59
471,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Not necessarily.,60
472,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,In South Australia i the case.,60
473,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Wage s may have been reduced in South Australia, but posal. I hope the reduction is only temporary.",60
474,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No ; it is final,60
475,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I hope that it has only been made pending the final decision of this particular matter.,60
476,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No ; and the reduction will be found to extend to Victoria.,60
477,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It is the same old story that I have heard before.,60
478,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Pu t a clause in protecting the men.,60
479,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am afraid we cannot put in a clause protecting men; they will have to follow the example of Victoria, and take such steps as will protect themselves. I feel pretty that the result of the Government proposal will not be to close up the factories where this particular class of tobacco",60
480,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"No , but it will throw these men out of employment",60
481,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I do not think that these men will lose employment,60
482,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It will abolish theat? twist-making industry.,60
483,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"As to the venue aspect of the question, if the manucurling, facture of this twist tobacco ceases, practilb., cally the same amount of some other : of tobacco will be consumed. I confess my sympathies would be with the men, if I had any fear there was going to be any permanent reduction in wages, or that they were going - to lose their positions ; but since the matter was mentioned some weeks ago, my colleague and myself have given it careful consideration, and we are faced with the great difficulty that if we once affirm the principle of differentiating, we do not know where it will end, not only in this but other manufactures.",60
484,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,A precedent has just been established by differentiating in the case of sugar.,60
485,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is a different thing altogether. That is differentiating between production by white labour and production by black labour; and we were affirming a great principle. We are not now dealing as between man and man, but as between man and machinery. Under all the circumstances, much as I should like to meet the wishes of t is the honourable member, I am afraid there are so many difficulties in the way that the Government cannot consent to his pro",60
486,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I regret the Government are not able to accept the proposal of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor. This is not a case of desiring to stop the wheels of progress. It is well known, not only in relation to twist and plug, but also as regard cigars and cigarettes, that in consequence of their not being pressed so tightly the first time, there is a better chance of the leaf curing; and I am informed that twist tobacco is the best for the smoking. The only differentiation asked for is equal to the amount which goes to the workers in wages, and I believe it is quite sure true that the manufacturers are not asking for this difference, because there is no fear of machinery asking for better conditions is produced. or going on strike.",60
487,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There cannot be 3d. per lb. difference ?,60
488,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Yes .,60
489,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,How is it arrived,60
490,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I believe that the wages recost of twisting the tobacco, apart' from packing, and other .charges, is 4d.per whereas the wages cost of the same leaf class manufactured by machinery, and ready to be placed in the boxes, is only about I d. per lb., which goes to the girls who wrap up the tobacco.",60
491,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The cost is about one-fifth of the labour in the former case.,61
492,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I realise that if the posal is not accepted by the Government there is no hope of it being passed by the committee. I was prepared to make a proposal, not only in regard to tobacco, but also in regard to cigarettes. The amount of protection enjoyed by machine-made cigarettes is enormous, and I am prepared to raise the excise so that we may not play into the hands of one or two large companies.",61
493,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The Government would have placed a higher rate of excise on cigarettes, but that would have meant throwing the hand-workers out of employment.",61
494,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I see that in New Zealand there is a differentiation.,61
495,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,That is the only one place where I know of such a differentiation.,61
496,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not see why we cannot have it here. If there is any possibility of reconsidering this matter at a later stage, in view of further evidence, I hope the Government will take the opportunity.",61
497,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"South Australia) I hope the Treasurer will do me the justice of not basing his objection to what I propose on the ground that I ask him to differentiate between machine work and hand work. I never put such a case, though that is partially incidental to the position. What I ask the Treasurer to do is to prevent, as much in the interests of consumers as of the workers, the annihilation of the strand tobacco industry. I am afraid that if the Government will not support the amendment I have no chance of carrying it ; but if, as they have always contended, the beginning and the end of their protectionist principles is to provide work and insure the manufacture of articles of a good quality, they should support it . I do not contend - that plug tobacco is not good tobacco, but the process of its manufacture lends itself to adulteration, whereas twist tobacco, since it is manipulated by hand, cannot easily be adulterated. "" Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN (Wentworth) - I listened with a certain amount of sympathy to the honourable member's remarks. He tells us that because a certain kind of tobacco is supposed to be better made and purer than other kinds we should differentiate in its favour.",61
498,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If we differentiate in connection with the excise duty we should prodifferentiate in connection with the import duty, too.",61
499,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yes ; but I trust that the Government will not allow any differentiation afc all. If we adopted the principle enunciated by the honourable member, we should have to review half of the work we have already done. Furthermore, there is no proof that the industry will be destroyed if we do not carry the amendment.",61
500,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I do not think that the honourable member has shown any reason for a differentiation. ' If the excise duty is lowered because of the superior quality of the tobacco, a difference should also be made in the import duty.  beer excise, but not in the import duty on beer.",61
501,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In the past, in all the States, the duty upon twist tobacco has been the same as the duty upon plug tobacco, and the manufacturers have been recouped the extra cost of making twist tobacco by the higher selling price.",61
502,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,But a great quantity will be imported because the duty is lower.,61
503,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The difference between the import and the excise duties is as large as it was in one of the States where they are able to manufacture tobacco successfully. One of the effects of federation will be that if a sot of factories in one State cannot compete with a set of factories in another State they must close. If there has been the reduction of wages which the honourable member for South Australia speaks of, it does not seem to be justified by the action of this Chamber, and I think that it must be regarded as an attempt to influence our decisions.",61
504,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I * am exceedingly sorry that the Government cannot accept the amendment. The men who are employed in this industry are paid on the average exceedingly low wages, in comparison with the profits which are made by the manufacturers, and I am sorry that we cannot compel the manufacturers to pay better wages. We can, however, do what will injure no one, and will not affect the revenue to any extent, while it will greatly improve the condition of 400 or 500 men who are largely family men and good citizens. The honourable member for South Australia has assured us that the manufacturer to whom he alluded would prefer not to make this tobacco, because he could do better by making other tobacco. think that the - proposal now before the committee will, therefore, put these men out of employment.",61
505,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,They will cease to be employed whether we agree to the amendment or not. In South Australia they were in a bad state with an advantage of l ^ d . more than the honourable member's proposal will give them.,62
506,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I am sorry to hear the honourable and learned member say so. I am afraid that many of our decisions in regard to the Tariff will have a similar effect.,62
507,Mr THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The demand for twist tobacco is dying out.,62
508,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,I have been told that they are making more twist tobacco in Victoria today than has been made for years past.,62
509,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am not pleading for the manufacturer, but for the men. I am sorry that nothing is to be done to help them.  regret that the amendment has not received more sympathy from the Government. I understand that their position has been that any differentiation in the excise and import duties should be in the direction of encouraging labour. The other day a distinction was made between two kinds of beer, upon the ground that one was more costly to make, and was better when made, than the other.",62
510,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We did not say that.  fact that more labour is employed in connection with the manufacture of twist, than in connection with the manufacture of plug tobacco, and that twist tobacco is superior to plug tobacco, because it is not so much adulterated. To make twist tobacco, it is necessary to use the best leaf. The amendment is proposed by a supporter of the Government who advocates a distinction between import duty and excise duty for one reason only, not for the sake of revenue, but for the purpose of encouraging labour within the States; and although it affords a chance to give employment to six times as much labour, yet the only sympathy and support he gets from the Ministry is"" We appreciate your efforts; we think you have made out an admirable case, but we cannot help you.""",62
511,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I I listened with very great interest to the explanation of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor. If it were possible to make out a case for twist tobacco he would have done so, but he utterly failed at the outset, when he made the admission through the honourable member for Yarra that the men are paid 4d. a lb. at piece work, and turn, out about 100 lbs. weight of this tobacco per week. He says further that they are suffering a reduction equal to 10 per cent, of their wages; and he asks the committee to allow the manufacturers 75 per cent, rebate in this excise. And then we hear from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, once more, who says he does not speak in the interests of the manufacturer, but in the interests of the poor working man. The whole thing is a fraud. The revenue cannot afford to suffer to the extent proposed by the honourable member for South Australia, and I hope the committee will not entertain his proposal.",62
512,Mr BRUC ESMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I am not a pipe smoker, although I should like to be, and therefore I cannot speak practically on the subject. But as I have sat here one or two thoughts have occurred to me, which I think have a general bearing on this sort of question. The figures which have been submitted, illustrate very clearly to me how utterly helpless the 'committee is when it comes to deal with a question which depends to any extent on local statistics. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Batchelor, has been telling the committee in his ad misericordiam appeal, that 200 men or more are likely to be prejudiced if Parliament refuses to consent to some differential treatment of "" t w is t "" tobacco. I am told, on authority quite as good as that which he has produced, that in the Commonwealth, not more than 40 or 50 men are specially employed in making twist tobacco.",62
513,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,More than that number in Victoria.,62
514,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The honourable member is not an authority on the use of either spirituous liquors, smoking, or any other of the virtues which so many men possess.",62
515,Sir GEOHGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The number of men given to me as employed in making twist tobacco in Victoria is 54.,63
516,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am told on A'ery good authority that 40 or 50 is the full number of men exclusively devoted to this Avork, but that there are a large number of men who do this Avork at times, and other work at other times. It all proves the unreliability of such information. A number of honourable members seem to look on Parliament as a sort of charitable institutionAvhich is to be used for the purpose of imposing duties because certain classes happen to benefit by one course or the other which it may adopt. My view of Parliament-it may be a wrong one, and a very cold-blooded one-is that we have nothing to do Will indiA'iduals at all.",63
517,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What are Ave here for ?,63
518,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"We are ""here to 'look after the community as a Avhole. The motion means that the customs or excise duty which is to be imposed with regard to at least 2,000,000 people is to be affected one Avay or the other by the consideration for some 200 men Avho happen to follow an occupation which, it is generally admitted, is becoming obsolete. We all heard of twist tobacco Avhen we Avere children, and it is quite clear, I think, that the desire for it is altogether declining. If the making of twist tobacco is an occupation which is gradually dying out, Ave are simply putting this commodity - on the same footing as exists betAveen the steam-engine and the old-fashioned coach, between the sewing machine and hand-seAvn garments. It means that Ave are appealed to to differentiate from the general principle which we are laying down, because a certain - number of men are going to suffer by the effect it may haA'e upon them. I submit - that Ave ought not to listen to such a suggestion. It may be very unfortunate for the men, but it must be clear to every sensible observer that if 200 men are qualified to make this very superfine tobacco they must a for t i o r i be qualified to make inferior tobaccos. And it cannot be posed for a moment that the men will be completely throAvn out of employment be-cause they have a proficiency in some' more skilful method of manufacturing this article than have some of their fellow Avorkmen. If the honourable member Avere prepared to - state that the numbers Avere much larger, and that these men are so incapable of doing anything ' else that it means that they must become the ""pattering feet"" Ave heard of at Maitland, he might make out a case, and then it might be a question for the Treasurer Avhether he should not deal with them in another way. But there is no evidence before the committee that these men cannot follow the occupation of making up tobacco of other qualities. I submit that the appeal made to us is oneAvhich we should, on broad principles, refuse to entertain, because, as the honourable member for North Sydney has pointed out, if a differential treatment Avere adopted in regard to twist tobacco, it would lead us into all sorts of other discriminating considerations with regard to other qualities of tobacco. I shall heartily support the Government . in their refusal to entertain the application which has been made to them.",63
519,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"South Sydney) It is quite a mistake to impose a differential duty on any of these manufactured commodities. If Ave did it in the case of tobacco, Ave should have to do it in the case of many other articles, in the manufacture of which more expensive labour is employed. One assumption runs all through this argument, and it is that twist tobacco is better than plug tobacco. An y honourable member Avho is a smoker must knoAv-that the three or four best brands of American tobacco knoAvn to him are plug tobaccos. There is no need for making any difference between tAvist tobacco and plug tobacco, because, although the honourable member for  plug tobacco is stuffed up with stalks and fillings, the same thing can be done Will twist tobacco. It can be put inside the leaf and tAvisted in Will it . The only difference between the two tobaccos is just a fancy difference in having it twisted. I feel certain that if Ave were to make this difference of 3d. per lb. in favour of twist tobacco, Avithin eighteen months from its imposition there Would be no such thing as plug tobacco in the land. The difference in duty would supbe quite sufficient to compel every manufacturer in Australia to make up nothing but twist tobacco. It is no part of the policy of this Parliament to enforce the payment of more expensive labour in the preparation of any commodity. If tobacco fit for consumption can be made in plug form, as it is, Avhat policy is it which Would dictate a differential duty to enforce the making of all tobacco in twist form 1 It would pay the Commonwealth to pension off the tobaccotwisters, rather than make a ridiculous difference between oneform of the commodity and another. Why should we not have a differential duty in the case of anything else which is put up 1 Because there may be more expensive labour employed on one kind of commodity than on another,- are we to impose a differential duty ? You might as well say that there should be a difference in duty between beet-sugar and canesugar. There is no reason for making any difference in the duty merely because it is more costly to prepare the article in one form than another. Question-That the words-""Manufac - per tured strand per lb.

520,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I want to refresh my memory, as so many statements have been made as to what was promised, and we have heard so much in respect of compacts. I think the Treasurer will agree with me that no compact was made with regard to cigars and cigarettes.",64
521,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,We will - give the honourable member the benefit of any doubt.,64
522,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I want to point out that the duty on imported cigars ultimately agreed to was 6s. 3d. and 15 per cent, ad valorem. We will put the 15 cent, out of the question for the present. We are now asked to accept an excise duty",64
523,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That is on the leaf, the duty on which is Is. 6d.",64
524,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"So that we have practically 3s. excise against 6s. 3d. plus 15 per cent. I desire to debate this question altogether free from any party instincts. We have a great duty to AYES. perform to the revenue. I am sure that the Treasurer is anxious that the revenue should be safeguarded. This is a genuine item for revenue purposes. Even from the protectionists' point of view I do not think we have any right to make the import duty twice the amount of the excise or the excise half the amount of the import duty. We have a right, perhaps, from the protectionist point of view, to give a certain amount of assistance by differentiating between NOES. excise and import d u t y ; but surely we can do that without making a difference of 100 per cent. It is very probable that, A. as the years go on, the amount of excise, as compared with import duties, will increase. Therefore, to a large extent, we shall have to make up in our excise for the loss upon import duties. Indeed, this excise business may have to be carried much further in the future. As. we are putting the manufacturers in a more favourable position as compared with the importers, imports - may considerably diminish, and if we put the excise rate too low, we are bound to lose revenue very rapidly. T do not propose at this PAIRS. moment to move an amendment, because I wish to hear the views of honourable members. It is not a question' exactly of principle, but more a question of degree. The question is, should we not raise this excise from what it practically means-that is - to say excise, and a duty. on the imported leaf, making 3s - by afc least Is. more, so as to make the gap in reference to the cigar somewhat proportionate to the gap which we have made in reference to the tobacco 1 But apart even from any kind of scientific arrangement of that sort, I am looking at the question from the revenue point of view. Have we any right to give a bonus-becaus e that is practically what it means-of a large amount of our legitimate revenue to people who do not require it, and who have no right to it ? I think honourable members may reasonably be startled when they are told that, in the thrashing out of the principles of the Tariff, we agreed that there should be a difference of 9d. in an article valued at 3s. 3d., and that now we are asked to have a difference of about 3s. or more in an article valued at 6s. The difference between the two positions is enormous. There is no reason in it . We are also dealing with luxuries. I understood that one of the principles which should guide us when we have to get revenue is that those things which are undoubtedly luxuries should bear a large proportion of the charges in the way of taxation. The Government might reasonably review the position. From their point of view they are making a Tariff which, I presume, they consider will last for many years. That may not be our point of view, but they want to fix something now which will to a large extent determine prices without those continual changes which are so detrimental to business interests. The Government should therefore propose something in respect of this particular item which will be more reasonable and more in line with their proposals upon other items.",64
525,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I think that my honourable friend the acting leader of the Opposition is hardly treating us fairly. He opens the debate upon these items, but does not take the responsibility of moving anything in connection with them. It would be fairer if he were to make some direct proposal, and let us have an opportunity of discussing it . I am not going to say that in this case, as in the case of tobacco, there was a distinct understanding with regard to the difference between the customs duty and the excise, but I will say that the whole question was taken into consideration, and I believe the committee voted with regard to the cigar duty being fixed in relation to the particular amount excise being imposed, believing that there would be no attempt to change that excise. We fixed upon this amount after a comparison of the various rates prevailing in the States. We found that the difference between the customs duty and the excise in Victoria was 4s. 3d. The difference we now propose is 3s. 3d. In New South Wales, with the reduced excise that that State had, there was also a difference of 4s. 3d. In Queensland the difference was only 2s. In South Australia it was 4s. 7£d. In Western Australia 4s. l^d., and in Tasmania 4s. Our proposal in regard to the ordinary kind of cigars is 3s. 3d., which is certainly not excessive. We find that in New South Wales and Queensland, at the old rate there was practically no manufacture of cigars. In Queensland there was none whatever, and in New South Wales practically none. New South Wales had an excise duty of 2s. 6d., which was brought down to 9d. The difference of only 2s. in Queensland absolutely killed, the industry. New South Wales now has a large number of cigarmakers working in Sydney. They have been brought out from Germany, and cigars are now being made in that State to a much larger extent than they were before. I do not propose to go into all the details, because we had them explained when we were dealing with the customs duties. I have no hesita tion in saying that the duties of customs were fixed having in view that the duties of excise which the committee would agree to would be those we now propose.",65
526,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," There is no item in the Tariff which evoked a keener debate or that was discussed at greater length than this item of cigars, and, as the Treasurer states, there was practically an agreement amongst honourable members that the excise should bear the relation to the customs duties that is now proposed by the Government. Under the old rate although Victoria, with a 4s. 3d. margin, manufactured about two out of every five cigars consumed, the State of New South Wales, with the margin that there prevailed, only manufactured about one forty-fifth part of the cigars consumed. We have provided in this Tariff that when Queensland planters employ white labour in the manufacture of their sugar they shall receive special treatment. On looking up the statistics I find that New South Wales imported about of 14,000,000 cigars in 1890 from black-labour countries. She imported over 11,000,000 cigars from the Philippines. Honourable members opposite are asking on the one hand that we shall do away with black labour in the Commonwealth, and on the other that we shall take in the products of black labour in other places. That, to my mind, is quite illogical.",65
527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The honourable member would take tea from the Chinamen ?,66
528,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Not if we could produce it .here. I would sooner deal with a white man than a Chinaman or a black man at any time. The honourable member for Parramatta might not ; but every man to his taste.,66
529,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Does honourable member see that in one case the question of a race taint amongst ourselves is involved, and that the' other is a mere matter of trading 1",66
530,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,There might be a question of race taint involved in the smoking of cigars made by black labour. I trust the committee will confirm the decision previously arrived at to maintain a margin of about 3s. lOd. per lb.,66
531,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," What honourable. members forget is that we are now dealing with the one only engine of taxation at our disposalcustoms and excise. We are not dealing with customs and excise as they have previously been dealt with in the States, some of which had a large land revenue and direct taxation to fall back upon. This is the only source of revenue the Commonwealth has, and we are deliberately throwing away a most legitimate source of revenue in these excise duties which must increase as years go by. ' It must be remembered also that we are here dealing with a luxury. It is perfect madness to deal with the Tariff in this way, and I am surprised at the Treasurer, who ought to know better, adopting such a course. To test the matter I move That after the words ""cigars per lb. Is. the following words be inserted:-""And on after 12th February, 1902, 2s. 6d."" Amendment negatived. Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN bourne) - I desire to ask the right honorpeople able gentlemen in charge of the Tariff whether they will agree to a reduction to 9d. in the case of hand-made cigarettes 1",66
532,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If the honourable member asks for anything, it should 28 N an increase in the excise upon machinemade cigarettes.",66
533,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I move That after the words ""cigarettes . . . per lb. 2s."" the following words be inserted :""And on and after 12th February, 1902, handmade cigarettes per lb., Is. 3d."" My reason for proposing the amendment is that hand-made cigarettes are much more expensive to make than machine-made cigarettes. I believe the Government see some difficulty in deciding whether cigarettes have been made by machine or by hand, but as they will be made under Government supervision there should be no difficulty in not the providing by regulation that those which are hand-made should be so marked. I point out that in one factory alone in Viccoria there are 300 persons employed in making cigarettes by hand, and the wages paid by one firm here amounts to £10,000 a year. That is a matter which deserves consideration by the committee. The details of the matter have practically been discussed in connection with the amendment moved upon the excise upon twist tobacco, and I shall therefore not weary the committee by a long speech in support of it .",66
534,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Unde r no circumstances could I agree to the amendment, which would mean a considerable loss of revenue. The honourable member might have put the proposal in another form-to increase the excise duty upon machine-made cigarettes to 3s. There would have been more sense in that proposal. Honourable members know the position we have taken up with regard to hand-made and machinemade tobacco, and I fail to see how we could justify what might be called penalizing the latest improved machinery. If we are to apply the principle to cigarettes I do not know where we are to stop. We might just as well say that hand-made boots should be given a greater measure of 6'd."" protection than boots made by the latest and improved machinery that could be imported. Personally, I should like to do away with cigarettes altogether because I believe they (Melare a curse to the community. However, will smoke them, and while I woulcl be glad to get a larger amount of revenue from them, I fail to see how we can agree to any differentiation between articles made by machinery and articles made by hand. be for Under the circumstances I am bound to c oppose the amendment in whatever form it is proposed.'",66
535,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," It is a remarkable circumstance that the difference between the excise and customs duties in the case of tobacco and cigarettes should be so great. The difference in the case of tobacco is 9d in favour, of the locally-manufactured article, and the difference in the case of cigarettes amounts to 3s in favour of the locally-manufactured article.",67
536,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The makers have to use imported tobacco, while the tobacco manufacturers may use locally grown leaf or mix it with imported leaf, and that makes a considerable difference.",67
537,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That may partly account for the difference to which my attention has been drawn. It seems to me, however, that some proposition in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne ought to be favourably considered. I am informed on the authority of a circular distributed by the hand-made cigarette manufacturers that the difference in the cost of production between hand-made cigarettes and machine-made cigarettes amounts to Is. 3d. per lb. That would sustain the contention that machine made cigarettes should bear a heavier excise duty.",67
538,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,It only shows that sooner or later machine-made cigarettes will altogether displace hand-made cigarettes.,67
539,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I submit that it would have been better if the honourable member for Melbourne had moved that the excise duty upon machine-made cigarettes be increased rather than that the excise on hand-made be reduced. The right honourable the Treasurer suggested that there were some difficulties in the way of differentiating between hand-made and machine-made cigarettes, but I find that there is a precedent in favour of such a differentiation. In the New Zealand Tariff there is an excise duty of 2s. 6d. per lb. imposed upon cigarettes made by machinery, while handmade cigarettes carry an excise duty of only Is. per lb. There the principle of differentiation is recognised and given effect to, and there should be no objection to the recognition of the same principle in this country. The foundation of the distinction made is that hand-made cigarettes bear an additional cost of Is.. 3d. per lb. for production. Why should an article which costs an increased price of Is. 3d. per lb. to produce be taxed at the same rate as an article involving a lower cost of - production 1",67
540,Mr BRUCESMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," If anybody doubted whether humour had departed entirely from our parliamentary proceedings he might well be instructed by listening to this debate. I never heard cigarette such arguments proceeding from the mouths of rational men. The honourable member for Bendigo must be talking with his tongue in his cheek when he advocates such a proposal. Because an old-fashioned method of manufacturing a particular article is still carried on by some antedeluvian manufacturers, Parliament is to deliberately encourage them by giving them something equivalent to the difference in the cost of production. It means that if one manufacturer chooses to adopt modern machinery to turn out an article for the public welfare at a much less cost than that at which it has hitherto been turned out by obsolete machinery, the owner of the obsolete machinery may ask Parliament to differentiate between the article made by the obsolete machinery and that made by the modern machinery. There is no difference in this case, because here the machine is the human hand in the one case, anda piece of mechanism on the other. I have too much respect for the mental powers of the honourable member for Melbourne to believe that he makes this proposal seriously, and I cannot believe that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is serious in supporting it . To give a better illustration of what this proposal means I take the case of ready-made cotton goods which are imported Very largely into New South Wales, though not so largely into Victoria. We know that, to this day certain people prefer hand-made cotton goods and we might just as well be. asked to differentiate between manufactured cotton goods made up by a sewing machine and the same class of goods made by hand.",67
541,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"How does the honourable and learned member get his clothes made 1 I am sure he takes care to stick to the old-fashioned way. Mr BRUC E SMITH - As a free-trader, provided that things are equal in their general results, I go where I get them cheapest. I am sure that the honourable member is serious.",67
542,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I am perdivided fectly serious. Mr BRUC E SMITH - The honourable member for Yarra put before us an arguMelbourne. ment which, I understand, is adopted to some extent by the honourable member' for Melbourne, namely, that it is undesirable to smoke imported cigars, because they are made by the hands of black people, and, consequently, render those who smoke them liable to disease.",68
543,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE, adopt that argument.,68
544,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The argument applies against this amendment. Instead of encouraging the employment of clean machinery in the manufacture of we are asked to give a preference to handmade cigarettes, produced by workmen and workwomen who are not as careful in refor gard to the cleanliness and purity of their hands as one could be in using machinery the ultimate point of the theory which is for the manufacture of cigarettes. If there is anything to be said in support of the argument that the handling of cigars and cigarettes which have to be used in the mouth ought to be avoided as much as posto sible, we should lean towards the machineemployes, made article in preference to the hand-made one. I shall not spend any more time cussing this matter, because I do not think it requires to be argued. It coninterfere demns itself as soon as stated.",68
545,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I wish to ascertain, Mr Chairman, whether the prosame position of the honourable member for bourne precedes the item of 2s. as to excise, monwealth. or whether I shall have an opportunity wards of moving to increase the excise.",68

547,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"An increase of the exraise cise on cigarettes. The Treasurer is sceptiwindlass, cal about the question of cigarettes, and doubtful whether it is necessary from protectionist point of view to give a ference of 3s. 'There is an excise of 2s. all round. on cigarettes, a duty-of Is. 6d. on the unwants manufactured leaf, and an import duty of 6s. 6d. Protection to the extent of 3s. is afforded. The figures given by the Treain surer show that in New South Wales the difference was 2s. 6d. During the debate on the import duty it was shown clearly After 28 N 2 not that the manufacture of cigarettes here produced enormous profits which were among a few people; that the American Tobacco Trust owned about 60 per cent, of the shares in the American, tobacco companies of Adelaide, Sydney and",68

That can be disposed of, and then the question mentioned by the honourable and cigarettes, learned member can be put. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: (Parramatta) - I am astonished that the honourable member Melbourne should have made such a proposition as that now before us. It is 1 advocated on the Government side. There are many more ways of effecting the wish of the honourable member than by imposing a differential duty. For instance, if he wants favour hand workers as against machinery let him smash up the machines.",68
550,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Would not in disthe law deal with me if I did so 1,68
551,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I think it woulcl with the honourable member if he smashed up some one else's machines. I would advise him, however, to apply the reasoning to the industries in which he Melis so much interested all over the ComLet him smash his own aftermachines on the same principle. If the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. desires to create opportunities for hand all labour, let him advise the mine-owners to do away with all their mining plant, and the material from the mines by means of a rope and a bucket. That would is give employment for much more labour than the would the use of machinery, as at prepresent. Let him apply this principle If the honourable member to continue his logic further, let him advocate the abolition of locomotives and the trundling of the traffic of the country old - fashioned wheelbarrows. . That would give employment to infinitely more labour than does the present system. all, this is only an illustration of the. way in which the protectionist theory cuts right in the teeth of all our modern progress. The end arid aim of protectionists seems to be"" to create labour. The whole trend of modern progress is to lighten labour; to supply our wants and wishes with the least possible labour. Here is a good old fashioned proposal, however, that cuts right into the teeth of the law of civilization and progress, and would take us back again to the old days when there were no machines; when men had to rely solely on their muscles to supply their wants. I am surprised that the honourable member, as a large, employer of labour, does not see the absurdity of his proposal. I could understand some honourable members, who employ no labour, and who are not interested in this scheme, making a mistake of the kind, but the honourable member for Melbourne ought to know better. imagine what there is at the bottom of his proposal; I do not know whether any of the ,people affected live in his electorate, and whether he is making this proposition ou t of - a full and sympathetic heart, but, at any rate, he is making a most illogical suggestion. the beginning of the twentieth century we ought not to entertain seriously a proposition to penalize a machine that is employed in supplying the every-day wants of our citizens. The honourable member is going back to the dark ages. He is going back .also to the condition of things which obtains now in some of the glorious, protectionist - countries, notably China, where I believe very little machinery is used, and where that little is of the most inadequate kind. are backward in all forms and arts of civilisation, but there is plenty of labour there. The honourable member makes a similar proposition seriously today, and I congratulate him upon putting forward what is at any rate a logical proposal from a protectionist stand-point. If he wants to create opportunities for labour he cannot do better than he is doing ; but every day that we live we .seek to invoke the aid of machinery to lighten the tasks which labour has hitherto iad to perform. I hope these proposals will not be received seriously by the committee, because by so doing we should write down this new Parliament-which is supposed to represent^ step forward in the forms of Jiuman government-as a Parliament besmirched, shall I say, with ideas out of which .we are supposed to have grown hundreds of years ago.

552,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," When They I was interrupted by you, Mr Chairman, I had almost completed my speech. I believe that cigarettes are manufactured largely here by three companies, in which the American Tobacco Company owns about 60 per cent, of the shares. In Sydney the company made pretty good profits with a difference of 2s. 6d., when the difference in Victoria was 3s. 6'd. On the former difference, I understand the company were able to make a profit of even 100 per cent, on the paid-up capital, and 50 or 60 per cent, on the nominal capital.",69
553,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The difference now is only 3s.,69
554,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"And I think it is too much, when the manufacturers earn such tremendous profits. W it h the difference of 2s. 6d. in New South Wales, the revenue from cigarettes was double that in Victoria, with the difference of 3s. 6d. Under these circumstances, I shall certainly go to a division on the amendment, which I now move That after the words ""Cigarettes' . . . per lb. 2s."" the following words be inserted"" and on and after 12th February, 1902, 3s.""",69
555,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"^I have done my best to protect the interests of the hand-made cigarette makers, and having failed, I shall certainly support an increase in the excise - I believe that the result of the Tariff as it stands will be the extinction of the hand-made cigarette industry, and that the manufacture of these articles will become a thing-of the post.. The difference between the customs duty and the excise is too much. In the year 1900 there were 258,196 lbs. of cigarettes mode in ""Victoria, and that, with a difference of 3s., represents £38,729 in favour of the manufacturers, the wjiole of these cigarettes being consumed in Australia. The inevitable result of the Government proposal, will be to wipe out the hand-mode cigarette makers.",70
556,Sir GEOEOE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,No .,70
557,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"The hand-made cigarette manufacturers have issued a circular, stating that, they are now selling their cigarettes at a loss, and, assuming their contention to be correct, their extinction is a matter of absolute certainty. I fail to see why the machine-wade cigarette manufacturers should have the advantage of 3s. per lb., when, according to the returns, they had a benefit to the extent of £38,279 in the year 1900. The Treasurer suggested that the difference was justified - by the fact that manufacturers hod to buy imported leaf. But the import duty on cigarettes, according to the Tariff, amounts. to 6s. 6d.; the import duty on leaf to Is. 6d., and the excise to 2s., so that the difference of 3s. exists after accounting for the import duty on the leaf and the excise.",70
558,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," The information which has been afforded from different parts of the Chamber ought to have its effect on the Treasurer; and one of the most ardent supporters of the Government, in the person of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, supports an increase in the excise. If the amendment be not agreed to it will mean a loss of revenue, and an increase in the overgrown profits of a very large company, to the extent of £25,000 per annum, The revenue is coming i u beyond expectation, but this is an item to which we should look for returns in order to remit imposts on the necessaries of life. In New South Wales in 1900 there were 350,000 lbs. of cigarettes manufactured, and the import duty amounted to £21,000, while the revenue from the locally-made cigarettes, inclusive"" of the tax on leaf, was £61,800, or a total of £83,800. In Victoria in the same yeor, 240,000 lbs. of material was made up, and the income from imports was £5,600, while the revenue from the' locally-made article, inclusive of the tax on the leaf, was £30,000, or a total of £35,600. By increasing the excise by Is., as moved, the Treasurer will have at his command a large revenue easily obtained, and be able to remove some of the imposts on necessaries.",70
559,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I only desire to say a word, in reiteration to a certain extent, in order to prove the very serious position the Treasurer wil l have to face in the future. Many of the articles on which we have excise, or on which. we may have excise, will be increasing year by year, while the imported articles will be decreasing year by year. If we are to have an elastic revenue we must, be very careful not to starve it on particular items, the production of which may be increasing, by putting higher duties on those which are decreasing.",70
560,Sir GEOBGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,B y that time. I shall have to increase the excise.,70
561,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In 1900 there were imported 251,000 lbs. of cigarettes, but we manufactured 623,000 lbs. I believe that these figures are short of the reality, and that probably 800,000 lbs. of cigarettes were manufactured in Australia. Here we have a rapidly diminishing quantity of imports, and a rapidly-increasing quantity of colonial manufacture. We ore simply throwing away revenue, and the Treasurer ought, 'as a matter of finance, to accept the proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, because, I take it , the Treasurer is making aTariff not for one year, but for several years.",70
562,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Yarra) In the case of cigarettes which are made by machinery, and which employ very little labour, we have given a large amount of protection, by means of a small excise. If the committee had decided to differentiate, I should have been prepared to vote for a high rate of excise for machine-made, cigarettes ; and I believe that on the question which was last before the committee many honourable members, hod they been here during the debate, would have voted in accordance the views I hold. If the 'hand-made cigarette industry is extinguished, then shall be prepared to go with the Government or any honourable member, in increasing the excise on machine-made cigarettes, and I believe such a proposal would be received by the committee with practical unanimity.",70
563,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The r e would then be a difference of 2s. at least.,71
564,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"- Even that amount I would not give, merely for the sake of the company which practically controls the market. I shall be prepared to increase the excise still further if the hand-made cigarette industry is wiped out, but I cannot consent' to k ill that branch of the trade by increasing the excise right away.",71
565,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I intend to vote for an increase in the excise, because I am thoroughly satisfied that the smoking of cigarettes is detrimental to the intelligence of Australians, who, 1 notice, now are beginning to look sickly,,pale, and intellectually destitute. If we could have hand labour, I should give this industry any amount of protection, but as protection now would only increase gigantic monopolies, I shall vote: for the amendment.",71
566,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE," I venture to think that an excise of 3s. per lb. is not enough. Terrific profits are made in this particular industry, and to have the excise so low is simply giving away revenue, while we refuse the remission of taxation on the necessaries of life. Cigarettes are a luxury which some contend is positive damnation to our young people, and yet an excise is proposed, which simply means immense profits to one or two manufacturing companies.' I am' very much inclined to move that the excise be 4s; ",71
567,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"It use; such an amendment would not be carried. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to.",71
568,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"To-morro w we propose to go on with Division VIA . If any occasion arises for postponing that division, we shall go on with Division VII . , . but we shall not deal with the kerosene-duties.",71
569,Mr GLVNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,What about the timber - duties ? There is a great deal of timber now in bond.,71
570,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"A r e we not. going to consider the proposed duties upon tea, rice, and other articles after we have with dealt with Division VIA , ?",71
571,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,All I can say is that I we shall not deal with them tomorrow. Pregress reported. House adjourned at 11.4 p.m. is of no,71
