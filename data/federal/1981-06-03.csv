Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: (i) the financial situation of students enrolled at Australian post-secondary institutions is already extremely difficult (as indicated in the Commonwealth Department of Education's 1979 survey of student incomes and expenditure) and any substantial increase in the financial commitments of students would gravely worsen their financial difficulties. (ii) the imposition of post-secondary tuition fees of comparable levels to those imposed prior to 1974 would force many currently enrolled students to discontinue their studies and deter many persons willing take post-secondary study from doing so. Wednesday, 3 June 1981 (iii) those students and potential students from social groups currently under-represented and disadvantaged in the post-secondary education system would be most severely affected by the reintroduction of fees for post-secondary education.

This petition of the Tertiary Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students. 2. the proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a terpotential students from social tiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as and disadvantaged in the a 'poor risk' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness. 3. in regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education. 4. the proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early. 5. the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children. Your petitioners therefore pray that: (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students; Tertiary Education (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students. (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced. (iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance; (v) that the proposal not to fund 30 CAEs unless they are rationalized be rescinded.

Trans-Australia Airlines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services. The Federal Liberal Party Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest. Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in: (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia; (ii) higher domestic airfares. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Charles, Mrs Child, Mr Hurford, Mr Jacobi, Mr Charles Jones, Mr Kent, Mr Mildren, Mr Morris, Mr Mountford and Mr Scott. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life; a place to eat, a place 2. The hotel industry is occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia. 3. The hotel industry is almost sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds. 4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment. 5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget. 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry's 5,811 hotels in Australia. 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded growth of the Australian hotel industry. 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community. 9. Such is its significance occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect. 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer. 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates. 12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives: policy objective of selling Trans1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian hotelindustry in the social and economic life of the nation. 2. Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism. And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.

(3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to cnsure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.

Petition received. Privacy and Personal Information To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in JUlle 1980, undermines the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the ChrisHealth Costs tian basis of OUf society, by proposing that 'between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent '. assembled. The petition of the It is your petitioners sincere belief that: (a) an adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent. (b) as a record keeper has no responsibility for the child, and as his moral standards may be different to those of a parent, he should not be permitted to come between child and parent. (c) a parent has a unique position which may enable him/her to perceive a situation that the record keeper does not. The parent must therefore be aware of the problem if remedial action is to be taken, and has the right to guide the child in the direction he/she feels fit. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Members of the House of Representatives will reject the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and find some other means to protect children from the excessive abuse of some parents. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Dobie. Petition received. Proposed New Constitution To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe that Australia's constitution is undemocratic and should be replaced by a democratic constitution, particularly as regards the new standard for regulation of Vitamin and Mineral Supplements. We believe: 1. This legislation will curb for our own health according to need, environment, mate, et cetera. 2. These substances have proven their efficacy in maintaining health rather than destroying it and should remain freely available. 3. Why curb these substances while other noxious and toxic substances are freely available to the obvious thorough detriment of our society-e.g. commercial alcohol and tobacco. This new constitution should be drafted at a representative directly elected people's convention debate, and then put to a referendum of the people. The petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament, as a matter of urgency, will help to promote such public debate and will arrange for the holding of such a people's convention and referendum. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Good luck. Petition received. Defence Service Home Loans To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That all members of the Women's Services 1939-45 War qualify as 'Australian Soldier' under the Defence Service Homes Act for loans because on voluntarily joining the Australian Forces they took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies making themselves available for combat duty in War Zones, and according to Acts and Regulations of the period the Military women had enlisted for service anywhere, some Naval women to sail in any waters, with all servicewomen available for service in Papua New Guinea. As those members of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force of 1939-45 War who were not sent to War Zones are granted loans, refusal to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you amend the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.

Plant Variety Rights following extensive public To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government: I. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely: (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation. (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers. (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats. 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands. 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of we, the undersigned showeth: That we oppose any expansion of the facilities of Kingsford-Smith Airport which entails the building of a new runway as it would have the following detrimental effects: (1) The loss of one mile of waterfront including Lady Robinson's Beach and a huge part of Botany Bay; (2) The loss of up to 1,230 remaining neighbouring properties; (3) The creation of more noise pollution in the area; (4) The creation of more traffic congestion on streets leading to and from the airport; (5) The forced diversion of Cook's River and further damage to the ecology of the area. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will not consider satisfying the airport needs of Sydney by extending Kingsford-Smith Airport and that any decisions related thereto are not taken before there is an opportunity for adequate consultation ticularlyaffected. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Funding of Children's Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth: That funding in the area of children's services, which has been reduced by almost 40 per cent in real terms over the last five years, should be restored forthwith to at least the real value of funding allocated in the 1975-76 Budget. And further, that annual Budget allocations in the area of children's services should be spent in full for the purposes designated. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Les MCMahon. Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of The immediate and unconditional withdrawal of any proposals to deny Unemployment Benefits to unemployed people under 18 years old. That the level of Benefits for all unemployed people, and including people receiving sickness benefits and pensions, be raised to at least 120 per cent of the poverty line. That future employment policies be devoted to job creation and the restoration of full employment rather than the evasion of this responsibility by hiding the unemployed in short term training and education schemes.

We ask that the Federal Government acknowledge that 'Betsy' and its counterparts provide housing and care for women and children in violent situations, and the Government agree to meet the financial responsibilities for continued and effective Refuge functioning. The Federal Government should be informed that one in every five applicants are not accommodated at the Betsy Refuge due to overcrowding or full occupancy. with any community parWe therefore petition for full and adequate funding, and as petitioners for this we humbly pray. by Mr Mountford. Petition received. Trade Unions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeththat we are gravely disturbed by the actions of militant unions, the ACTU and the failure of the President of the ACTU to assist positively in settling the dispute which has caused massive losses to Qantas our national airline, and we applaud the action of the Government in using RAAF planes to rescue Australians stranded abroad. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Parliament and the Government should be of firm resolve not to permit SUCll unions to hold the country to ransom and continue to take a forceful and resolute stand against such union militancy. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Ruddock. Petition received. Interest Rates The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that: Australia respectfully calls for: (1) Interest rates, rather than falling by 2 per cent as promised by the Prime Minister in November, 1977, are now between 2 per cent and 5 per cent higher than when that promise was made, and are at historically higher levels. (2) This prevents many potential home buyers from borrowing to purchase a house; causes severe hardship to many people who are paying off a housing loan, causing some to default and lose their home; prevents or restrains the establishment or expansion of many businesses; and is directly responsible for increasing numbers of bankruptcies. Your petitioners, therefore, pray that: Minimisation of interest rates be adopted as one of the aims of economic policy; the money supply target be relaxed to accommodate income growth without forcing credit restrictions and exorbitant interest rates; regulation of borrowing the financial institutions raising lending rates to compensate for higher borrowing rates; and foreign investment be more rigorously controlled in order to prevent destabilising inflows of foreign funds. by MrScott.

Your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Blewett. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors of the Division of Parramatt a respectfully showeth: That beer is the drink of the working man and that any increase in the excise on beer will place it in the luxury bracket and beyond the means of ordinary people. Australians are already the highest beer taxed people in the world; further increases in beer prices will both harm the brewing industry and fuel inflation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government not proceed with any proposals it may have to increase the excise on beer in the 1981-82 Federal Budget as such a move would be unacceptable to all beer drinking voters. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr John Brown. Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: rates be reintroduced to prevent As regular viewers and listeners of the ABC Melbourne Showband we were disappointed to learn of the dismissal of seventeen members of this outstanding orchestra. We have had a great deal of pleasure over the past eight years viewing and listening to this band's fine music.

The petition of the undersigned in the Northern Territory respectfully showeth: That the proposed use of Darwin Airport as a refuelling and Rest and Recreation base for American B52 bombers: Jeopardises the welfare of the citizens of Darwin and of Women's Refuges all Australians, in that it establishes a stronger potential of Darwin being a nuclear target in any conflict between the USA and another power. Impedes the sovereignty of the Australian nation in that Australian citizens would have neither control nor knowledge of whether B52s: (a) Carried nuclear weapons (b) Were engaged in bombing missions against another State. Violates the Australian people's independence and links this nation irreconcilably with United States foreign policies thereby destroying the potential for independent Australian defence policy. Violates democratic procedures in committing the Australian nation to participation in future wars without due consultation and informed assessment by Australian citiExcise on Beer zens and further increases the militarisation of the Indian Ocean thereby increasing the likelihood of super power conflict in this region. Jeopardises the welfare of the citizens of Darwin, in that noise pollution and the threat of accidental radioactive fallout will increase substantially to the residents"" Negates the potential of the Australian nation to establish itself as a nation of peace in the Pacific region and violates Australia's commitment to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Members of the House of Representatives will ensure that the Prime Minister withdraw the' offer of Darwin, or any other . location in Australia, as a base or depot fQr American B52 bombers.

6,Mr HOWE,AGREEMENT,"My question is directed to the Minister for Housing and Construction. I seek clarification of his confusing answer to a question yesterday concerning the net value of Commongreater competition so that prices wealth payments to the States for housing. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that total State repayments of advances and interest to the Commonwealth in 1980-81 amount to $200.3m? Is it also a fact that the base payment for the States and Territories for housing in 1981-82 and the subsequent four years is only $200m, of which $54m is for Notice of Motion special groups in need? Is it a further fact that in 1981-82 New South Wales will receive $45.5m of loan funds for housing but will pay back $56m? Does that not mean that New South Wales will this House, the Government should pay back more than it receives from the Commonwealth in 1981-82? Will the Minister confirm that next year Victoria and South Australia will also be paying back more than they receive for housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing way of conserving that environAgreement?",20
7,Mr MCVEIGH,AGREEMENT,"The answer to the first two is desirable and, if so, the questions is yes. As to the other questions, surely the honourable member can understand this simple fact of life: Since 1945 the Commonwealth Government has made available to the States Notice of Motion funds which have been topped up by State funds and surpluses accruing to the States because of rates of interest on which loans have been made available. Last year in Australia $630m was made available for housing. Net profit aggressive Big 'V' political camaccruing to the States was $142m. Payments. to the Commonwealth are not made by the States; they are made by the people who pay rent and repay loans granted for home purchase.

8,Mr HARRIS,COMMISSION REPORTS,"My question is directed to the Notice of Motion Prime Minister. When are the Commonwealth Grants Commission reports due? Has the Victorian Premier-elect asked for an extra meeting between the States and the Commonwealth to discuss those reports, and has such a meeting been agreed to?",20
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMISSION REPORTS,"There has been some doubt about the precise date on which we will have available, not only to ourselves but also to the States, the Commonwealth Grants Commission report examining the relativities of Commonwealth payments to the respective States. As we are advised, it will be available some time in June. On present advice, we will probably have the report in time for people to look at it but not to examine it before the Premiers Conference on 19 June. I think it would probably be agreed that substantive decisions will not be able to be made at that meeting because, clearly, all State governments and the Commonwealth will want to examine the document very closely. At this point, nobody has any idea of the recommendations that might be contained in it, and whether or not they could pose particular complications for some States. As a result of that, Mr Thompson, the Premier-elect of Victoria, asked the Commonwealth whether it would be possible to schedule a special Premiers Conference to discuss these matters. I have told him that I think that is the only way to handle it and that such a conference will have to be held. We will need some flexibility about the date, but it would need to be some time during the winter. NA",20
10,Mr LES JOHNSON,PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY,"I ask the Minister for Housing and Construction: Has the total value of housing loans provided by permanent building societies fallen from $91m in April 1980 to $57m in April this year? Has the number of building society loans fallen from 2,963 in April 1980 to 1,953 this year? Since permanent building societies provide one-third of all housing loans, does the Minister accept this decline as a serious deterioration in the availability of finance vate home buyers? Is this a major reason why home ownership has fallen to the lowest level for a decade?",21
11,Mr MCVEIGH,PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY,"The answer to the first and second parts of the question is yes. When we look at the amount of funds made available to permanent building societies, we see that again the figures are correct, and I congratulate able gentleman for at least doing his homework. However, I question his figure for the percentage of funds to total housing made available by permanent building societies. From the information given to me at 2 o'clock, the figure was 28 per cent, not 33 per cent. I indicate to the honourable member for Hughes that when we look at the totality of funds made available for housing we find that for the March quarter this year, compared with the March quarter last year, there was a slight drop of 3 per cent. However, we must remember that last year was a record year for loans made available to home owners-240,345--and of those people 106,000 were buying their first home. On account of the responsible financial decisions made by my colleague the Treasurer, in December last year there was a return to the traditional lending and borrowing patterns in Australia. Because of a distortion in the money markets more money was made available in 1980 to permanent building societies than to banks. We have returned to the traditional ratio of 63 per cent for banks and 28 per cent for permanent building societies. We have to look at the total picture of finance made available for housing. Again I question the accuracy of the honourable gentleman's figures. The total figures for home ownership in Australia show that this Government can claim a proud record. In 1949, 53 per cent of Australian people owned their own homes or were in the process of purchasing them. In August last year, from the most recen t statistics made available by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 71.9 per cent of Australian people owned their own homes. That is a record that this free enterprise Government can be proud of. NA We are about home ownership for all Australian people. We do not subscribe to the proposition adopted by those who sit opposite. They should recall that one of their previous housing ministers said: 'We do not believe in home ownership. That will make a nation of capitalists'. I sat on the Opposition side of the chamber and listened to a former Minister for Housing say: 'We want to cut costs in Australian housing. We will make Australian people own smaller homes'. We for pri- do not subscribe to that proposition. NA",21
12,Mr CADMAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,-My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications. What is the current situation in regard to the Telecom Australia dispute? Are there any signs of an early settlement or will there be continuing reduction the honour- and disruption of services?,21
13,Mr SINCLAIR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,"Discussions are still continuing. Just before I came into the House, I endeavoured to determine what the prospects were for the breakdown of services. With respect to the international network, I understand that people trying to plug into the Sydney Overseas Telecommunications Commission network switch are finding it a little difficult getting through the trunk arrangements, but, with the exception of a few countries, the international subscriber dialling service is still functioning effectively. Where it is not operating, it is possible through reference to a trunk operator to obtain connection to most countries. However, within Australia there has been a breakdown of a number of trunk systems and that is of major concern to the Government. The Government is very conscious that within the conciliation and arbitration procedures there is a fair and equitable opportunity for the representatives of the two unions to pursue their claims. It is totally opposed to the implementation of bans. A number of personnel have been stood down as a result. The Government is obviously very anxious that services should be resumed at the earliest possible moment. However, it does not believe that in conditions where the service continues to deterioriate it can remain completely at arm's length from the dispute. Therefore, 1I have initiated a number of approaches to Telecom management to try to ascertain the exact state of play. I hope that out of the discussions before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission it is possible for the dispute to be settled. If not, the Government will of course have to consider what measures it needs to take to ensure a resolution of the dispute even if those steps lead to having to close down Telecom. NA",21
14,Mr VREN,HOVSING LOAN INTEREST RATES,Will the Minister for Housing and Construction agree that housing loan interest rates with banks and building societies are now at a record level? Is it a fact that because of the tight liquidity in the banks and building societies interest rates are under pressure to rise again? What action is the Government prepared to take to prevent the housing industry from suffering still further under its restrictive monetary policy?,22
15,Mr MCVEIGH,HOVSING LOAN INTEREST RATES,"Mr Speaker, firstly I crave the indulgence of the House for two brief seconds and thank honourable members for giving me an opportunity to reply to the scurrilous charges made by the Opposition in the debate on the Housing Assistance Bill last night, when it would not give me the opportunity to reply.",22
16,Mr SPEAKER,HOVSING LOAN INTEREST RATES,Order! The Minister is not entitled to refer to that debate. I will rule him out of order if he does so.,22
17,Mr MCVEIGH,HOVSING LOAN INTEREST RATES,"Mr Speaker, I accept your guidance and am grateful for it. In answer to the series of questions asked by the honourable member for Reid I will itemise what happened when the Opposition was on the Government side of the House. Interest rates for savings banks loans increased from 7 per cent when the Opposition took office to II per cent. For permanent building societies the interest rate increased from 8 per cent to 11 t per cent. How can the Opposition talk about an increase in interest rates? After five and a half years of responsible government interest rates are basically the same as they were when we took office and tried to get this nation back on the rails. If we look at the control of interest rates we find that one of the problems in New South Wales is the New South Wales Government, which is not able to cope with financial responsibility. I remind those honourable members who sit opposite that by world standards interest rates for home loans in Australia are very low. I will fill in honourable members opposite on statistics from the rest of the world.",22
18,Mr SPEAKER,HOVSING LOAN INTEREST RATES,"Order! The Minister is defending himself valiantly but he does not really need so much time. I ask him to draw his answer to a conclusion. Mr MCVEIGHInterest rates in the United Kingdom are 13 per cent, in the United States of America they are 15.5 per cent and in Canada they are 16.5 per cent. So Australia is not doing too badly by world standards. Our housing interest rates are amongst the lowest. Finally, the honourable member [or Reid asked what the movement in interest rates would be. r let the honourable member know that he is not going to draw me into any debate on the likelihood of increased interest rates. One of the problems in containing interest rates in Australia is the enormous demand made on the available resources including household savings by the borrowing programs of State, local and semi-government authorities in Australia. r hope that those who sit opposite will ask their State Premiers, who will be coming to the Loan Council and the Premiers Conference later this month, to show a bit of the infectious enthusiasm for responsibility and financial control that this Government maintains in all its undertakings. If they did that they would at least be doing something for the housing aspirations of all Australian people. SYDNEY (KINGSFORD-SMITH) AIRPORT: CURFEW",22
19,Mr DOBIE,HOVSING LOAN INTEREST RATES,"I refer the Minister for Transport to an article in today's Canberra Times wherein its aviation reporter has alleged that Trans-Australia Airlines has made an application to the Minister's Department to have the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport lifted to allow more efficient use of TAA 's about to be introduced Airbus aircraft. Is the Minister in a position to assure the House that-should such an application from TAA exist-no decision has been made, nor any indication given, to advantage TAA while totally disadvantaging the people who live within the environs of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport?",22
20,Mr HUNT,HOVSING LOAN INTEREST RATES,The maintenance of the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport has been a policy of this Government for some considerable time. Any application by TAA for an easing of the curfew would be a matter of policy consideration. I can assure the honourable member that no decision has been taken and no decision will be taken without giving very serious consideration to the people living in the region of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. NA,23
21,Mrs KELLY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,"Is the Minister for Communications aware of the survey undertaken by Telecom Australia management and the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association of comparably qualified tradesmen in various areas of public employment and accepted by Telecom management as a representative survey? Does the Minister agree that the survey shows Telecom employees as being amongst the very lowest paid of those employed by the 25 employers in the survey and that, for instance, tradesmen employed by the South East Queensland Electricity Board are paid 16 per cent or $34 a week more than tradesmen with the same qualifications employed by Telecom? Does the Minister agree with the management of Telecom that this is not an acceptable position for Telecom and its employees in this industry which is characthere. terised by high technology and unquestioned financial capacity and which is ance to the Australian community?",23
22,Mr SINCLAIR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,"J am very indebted to the honourable member for Canberra for having demonstrated how generous the tax reimbursementarrangements entered into by this Government have been to the State governments. Indeed, it is true that particularly the New South Wales Government, but to a degree the Victorian Government, for example through the Victorian power authority, and the other State governments have entered into arrangements outside the wage indexation guidelines which have created enormous problems for the 80 per cent of employees who are employed under the private sector in this nation. The honourable lady referred to a specific questionnaire relating to a number of parallel wages paid within selected areas of Public Service employment. Had that survey ranged across the whole breadth of employment, taking into account private sector as well as public sector employers, she would find that there are many areas in the private sector where the wage disparity with Telecom looms in favour of the Telecom employees. The concern we have is for the whole nation and not just for those who work within the public sector. KING'S HALL: REMOVAL OF NA",23
23,Mr COLEMAN,DEMONSTJUTORS,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services as the Minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police. Will he inform the House whether the police used brutality in removing demonstrators from King's Hall yesterday afternoon?,23
24,Mr NEWMAN,DEMONSTJUTORS,"-I do not think I have to remind all honourable members of the very unruly and, I must say, unnecessary demonstration that took place at the entrance to Parliament House yesterday. To answer directly the honourable member's question, let me say that I believe that the police acted with considerable restraint in the face of a very vigorous, hostile crowd that physically set out to attack the police. I reject utterly some allegations that have been made by members and senators of the Opposition that the police acted brutally or with undue hostility to the crowd. I have taken the trouble to'-Mr Barry Jones-Undue hostility?",23
25,Mr NEWMAN,DEMONSTJUTORS,"-Without any hostility to the crowd. I make no qualification at all. I have taken the trouble to look at some of the video tapes of the incident. I have spoken to reporters who were They watched the police ask the demonstrators to leave King's Hall and then physically of critical importtry to remove them. Those tapes show many incidents that demonstrate what I was saying about the hostile nature of that crowd. One policeman was having his hair pulled, and was being pushed and pulled headlong down the steps of Parliament House. If they had got him there, there would have been a possibility of quite serious injury. A young woman police officer was being punched in the chest and crushed against the doors of Parliament House by the crowd. The police were acting under the orders of their superior officer on this occasion. They were asked to act with physical restraint. They were acting under the principles of common law. I say once again that I reject the allegations made by some honourable members opposite about the actions of the police. I go further, and commend the police for the most considerate way in which they dealt with these people under undue provocation which mean- physical injury. NA",23
26,Mr HAWKE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications. Firstly, did the Acting Chairman of Telecom Australia, Mr May, write to the Minister on 16 April seeking approval to negotiate with the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association in respect of the union's wage claims? Secondly, is it a fact that by the time the matter was called on before Commissioner Clarkson on25 May Telecom management had received no reply from the Minister? Thirdly, I ask whether it is a fact that in these circumstances Telecom, having acknowledged that Telecom employees have a legitimate claim for a significant wage increase, put on record before the Commissioner the following words: The recent decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on wage indexation ready basis for advancing such a claim. Finally, as Telecom management and the unions believe that a significant wage increase should be negotiated and as they, together with the arbitration commissioner, believe that this cannot be achieved appropriately under the guidelines, why does the Minister persist in a course of action which is against the public interest and which Telecom management believes is against the interests of Telecom?",24
27,Mr SINCLAIR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,"The answer to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question is yes. The answer to the second part in respect of contact with the Acting Chairman of Telecom is that verbal discussions were held with both the Acting Chairman and members of the executive of Telecom regarding the details of the basis on which negotiations could proceed. Thirdly, with respect to the whole of the basis of public interest which the honourable gentleman seeks to assert, I point out to him, as I did in answer to the honourable member for Canberra, that it is imperative that the interests of the whole Australian community be taken into account. In this present dispute, while there was a review analysing comparable wage levels between members of some sectors of the Public Service and Telecom, that review did not embrace the private sector. It did not embrace wage levels paid to people in similar wage and salary classifications in areas where people were called on to do similar jobs and where the wage levels do not show the wage disparity which appears in the review undertaken by Telecom and its employees. Fourthly, it is true that within the conciliation and arbitration system there is a capacity to refer to an anomalies procedure through which there is an ability for the genuine public interest and the interests of the employees of Telecom to be properly taken into account. It is in that forum that the Governm mt believes wage negotiations should occur and it is within that forum that the Government has been encouraging both Telecom and its employees to resolve the present dispute.

28,Mr FISHER,SHEEP SHEARING,"The Minister for Science' and Technology would be aware that a search for a safe, reliable and effective chemical for the harvesting of wool has been carried on throughout the world for decades, particularly in the United States of America and the Soviet Union. Is the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation involved in such research into finding an alternative to the manual shearing of sheep? If so, what progress has been made? guidelines does not provide a Mr THOMSONThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has been engaged in research on biological defleecing for some time. This has been sponsored by the Australian Wool Corporation. It has been a most interesting and successful piece of research so far. The research has been aimed at finding a substance which, when injected, will cause a break in the fleece. The fleece can then be pulled off either manually or automatically.",24
29,Mr YOUNG,SHEEP SHEARING,Round the paddock. Mr THOMSONI hope the honourable member for Port Adelaide will be interested in this great example of Australian science.,24
30,Mr SPEAKER,SHEEP SHEARING,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide will remain silent. The Minister will proceed with his answer and ignore the interjection from the honourable member for Port Adelaide. Mr THOMSONCSIRO has discovered a protein which causes shedding of the fleece in about 48 hours. The protein is a substance called epidermal growth factor which, very fortunately, occurs naturally in body tissues in small quantities. The advantage of this natural occurrence is that there is unlikely to be any drug residue problems or harmful side effects. The next step in this research is field evaluation and development of management techniques which will take some time. I hope that honourable members will join me in congratulating CSIRO on what appears to be a breakthrough in what has been world-wide research. UNITED STATES: NUCLEAR WEAPONS",24
31,Mr SCOTT,SHEEP SHEARING,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to extensive reports that the United States has introduced nuclear weapons to Japan which is contrary to law and without informing or consulting the Japanese Government which is contrary to an oral agreement to consult in advance. I also refer to the official sponse by the United States to questions on this issue which are that it neither confirms nor denies the presence of nuclear weapons in any circumstances. Has this issue been discussed with the United States Administration? What assurances has the Prime Minister been given that similar non-binding oral undertakings given to Australia in relation to B52s will not also be evaded?,25
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SHEEP SHEARING,Japanese and austerity United States relations have not been discussed between Australia and the United States because we happen not to be responsible for the policies Japan or responsible for relations between and the United States. We are responsible for lations between Australia and the United States.

35,Mr ARMITAGE,GOVERNMENT MEETING,"I refer the Prime Minister to his remarks in the House last week in which he strongly defended his decision to send five Ministers and six back benchers to deliver personal invitations to 40 Commonwealth political leaders to re- attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne in September. I ask: Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to wide editorial criticism of the Government's decision in the Australian Press? In particular, has he noted the comments in an editorial in today's Sydney Morning Herald which describes the decision as an affront and the Prime Minister's public explanation of it as eyewash? Finally, in view of the Government's professed determination to impose in government spending, will the Prime Minister now abandon his expensive and unnecessary scheme and leave the matters of conferof ence invitations and agenda discussions to the Japan Commonwealth Secretariat and our own diplorematic representatives in the various countries?",25
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GOVERNMENT MEETING,"I have advised Govern the House on more than one occasion of the reasons for the Government's decisions. Those decisions stand. But, for the benefit of the honourable gentleman, let me repeat the arguments and the reasons. Over the last decade when the Canadian Government or the United Kingdom Government was responsible for holding the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting it adopted the practice of sending people to some Commonwealth countries for the very reasons that we have adopted-to seek the views of other about the nature of the agenda, the senthe sitive issues that might have to be handled and what progress the Commonwealth can make in contributing to a resolution of significant issues. The one difference on this occasion is that instead of sending emissaries to some Commonwealth practice which we believe was not in dethe best interests of the unity of the Commonwealth, in which all members, large and small, have a significant part to play-we are sending fact people to all Commonwealth countries. This is part of the process of building into the Commonanwealth Heads of Government Meeting an agenda which has had an input from all Heads of Governa ment from all Commonwealth countries, wherweapons program. ever they may be. Earlier, I advised the House that at the end of testJuly I will be having discussions in the United we Kingdom with the Secretary-General, Mr Ramphal, who very strongly supports this process of consultation before the conference begins. On this basis the program will continue. I do not think the honourable gentleman has really shown much appreciation of or concern for the importance with which many people regard the Commonwealth and its relevance to modern day issues. There is only one other thing I would like to say. Austerity in government does not mean, and never has meant, that in all things we spend less or are necessarily restrained in expenditure. In programs for the disabled and disadvantaged people within the community the expenditure of this Government is almost double that of the previous Labor Administration. That is because we give it a very high place on our list of priorities. We are able to do that only by being restrained in those matters which are of less importance. A Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which will take place in Australia maybe once in 50 or 60 years, is something which this Government and, I believe, much of the Australian community will regard as being something of importance, even if the honourable gentleman does not. NA",25
37,Mr TUCKEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,I address my question to the Minister for Communications. Is it a fact that a ballot conducted by the Telecom Australia unions to authorise the present industrial action was shown on television? Did the television camera clearly show that one ballot box was marked in large letters with the word 'Yes' and the other was marked in large letters with the word 'No' and that voters were obliged publicly to indicate their intentions?,26
38,Mr SINCLAIR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS DISPUTE,"One of the features of a comthat munist society which most of us are' completely appalled to see is the extent to which authorities generally try to direct those who live within their countries to cast their votes in a particular direcbecome tion. I think one of the features not to be commended in current union practice where ballots are called fods the apparent adoption of a somewhat similar tactic. Not only is it to be deplored that the ballot boxes are so identified, that television cameras were played on the individuals casting their votes and that each individual was required to go out and put his vote in box in front of his colleagues. Even where a taken not through the ballot box but through show of hands, one sometimes doubts the extent to which a person holding a genuine and sincere view which might be contrary to the view of majority is prepared to get up and express it. think it is to be regretted, therefore, that cumstances of the present dispute have originated in a ballot which has taken place in somewhat dubious circumstances and in a manner which think most of us in this place would be appalled to see applied to the ballot boxes used for the election of members of this place.

39,Mr HAYDEN,EXXON CORPORATION,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the recently released financial report of the Exxon Corporation? Did he note that Exxon's after tax profit per barrel of oil produced in Australia, as stated in the report, is higher than Exxon's profit on oil produced in the United States and Canada, and the average for all foreign operations? Is he also aware that Exxon's profits on oil refining and marketing outside the United States are almost four times those in its United States operations? Will the Minister acknowledge that his Government's generous treatment of the Esso company has been one of the main factors in Exxon's world-wide massive profits? Will he acknowledge that his Government's oil pricing policy and its failure to regulate properly downstream oil industry activities have made Australia one of the most lucrative targets for operations of foreign oil companies? Finally, will he have the activities of Esso and other foreign oil companies operating in Australia immediately investigated and appropriate policies introduced promptly to stop this rip-off of the Australian public?",26
40,Mr ANTHONY,EXXON CORPORATION,"First of all, I have not seen the report to which the Leader of the Opposition referred. I do want to say how grateful Australia is the Exxon Corporation-or Esso, its Australian subsidiary-joined the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in Australia and managed to discover oil in Bass Strait, enabling Australia to approximately 70 per cent self-sufficient. Mr JacobiThat is not so. Weeks found the oil in Bass Strait.

That has been of enormous advantage to this country, to our econthe omy and to our general well-being. Under the I arrangements that were made some years ago it the cirwas decided that the price that Exxon would achieve, along with BHP, on old wells in Bass Strait would slowly progress up to 50 per cent of I the world parity price.

Any new fields, developed since September 1975, attract the world parity price. The previous Labor Government decided that those new wells would attract the world parity price, so it ill becomes the Leader of the Opposition now to complain of the returns that those companies might be getting for oil because it is partly Labor's policy that is giving them that return.

46,Mr HICKS,FARM OVERDRAFTS,"I ask the Treasurer whetper, in view of the very high interest rates operating for overdrafts and farm loans, now in the vicinity of 16 per cent, he will as a matter of urgency consult the New South Wales Government to see whether it will immediately lift or completely eliminate the iniquitous 1t per cent levy it places on high interest rate loans.",27
47,Mr HOWARD,FARM OVERDRAFTS,"The loan instrument duty which is imposed by the New South Wales Government has been in operation in that State for a number of years. It is a revenue measure which I think is duplicated in most, if not all, the other States of Australia. Whilst I share very much the concern of the honourable member for Riverina about the level of interest rates charged on overdrafts around Australia, and of course noting his particular interest in the rural communities of Australia, I would have thought that the New South Wales Government could make a more constructive contribution towards moderating interest rates, not only in that State but also throughout the rest of Australia-a moderation that might not involve the forgoing of a significant source of revenue for that State. I refer in particular to the capacity of the New South Wales Government to moderate significantly the borrowing appetite of its authorities and to cooperate with the Commonwealth Government in bringing about a sustainable and proper reduction in the size of the total public sector borrowing requirement. TAXATION: MINERS' HOUSING",27
48,Mr HUMPHREYS,FARM OVERDRAFTS,"My question, which I direct to the Treasurer, refers to the crippling strikes on the central Queensland coal fields in 1978 and again last year in response to the Government's decision to tax the housing provided to miners. Does the Treasurer recall that in order to settle this dispute he promised in a statement on 13 October last year to amend the Income Tax Act so that only one-tenth of the market rental value of the miners' accommodation would be subject to tax? Does the Treasurer also recall saying in his statement that until the law was changed the miners would continue to be assessed on the basis of the existing law? Does the Treasurer intend to introduce these promised amendments into the Parliament this session? If not, does this mean that if the law is 110t changed by 30 June the Commissioner of Taxation will continue to tax the Queensland miners on the value of their housing, thus precipitating another wasteful and prolonged dispute on the coal fields?",27
49,Mr HOWARD,FARM OVERDRAFTS,I recall both that strike and the terms of settlement and the statement that I made in October oflast year. Mr Dawkins-Which one?,27
50,Mr HOWARD,FARM OVERDRAFTS,"The one to which the honourable member's colleague· referred. The legislation will not be introduced during this session. I can inform the honourable gentleman that I had already anticipated the possibility of this question arising. I have discussed the matter with the Commissioner of Taxation, who is responsible for the administration of the Act. On the basis of that discussion, I can say to the honourable gentleman that it is. plainly unthinkable that the law would be administered in a way contrary to the clearly stated intention and understandings embodied in that statement in October. MOTOR VEHICLES: LIQUEFIED NA",27
51,Mr GOODLUCK,PETROLEUM GAS,"Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that motor vehicles can and do run economically and efficiently on liquefied petroleum gas? In view of the stated objective of the Government to encourage alternatives to the petrol-driven motor vehicle, will the Government consider, firstly, converting all Commonwealth Government vehicles to LPG; seoondly, introducing incentives to local motor vehicle manufacturers to offer as an option a dual-powered vehicle-petrol and LPG; thirdly,. calling for an inquiry into the reasons why the efficient Datsun LPG-only vehicle failed and was condemnedso unfairly in the market place; and fourthly, encouraging more LPG filling stations throughout Australia, supported by constructive publicity?",27
52,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM GAS,"I am not a salesman for Datsun; nor can I explain why that company's liquefied petroleum gas conversion car was not a success. However, I can make some inquiries and advise the honourable member. Certainly it is the Government's policy to encourage LPG as an alternative type of fuel. We have been encouraging people to convert. We have been using Commonwealth vehicles as an example. I know that in some of the capital cities a considerable number of vehicles in the Commonwealth fleet have been converted to LPG. I think all these vehicles are capable of running on either LPG or gasolene. One of the encouraging features about LPG is the recently reduced international price. I note that the price from Saudi Arabia and some of the other Gulf states has decreased by about $50 a tonne by the recent announcements at the meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. If this decrease reflects on to the Australian market it means that LPG prices will come down. Certainly, that in itself ought to be an added encouragement for people to convert to LPG.

53,Mr SPEAKER,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, n-mely: The inability of the Australian Defence Forces to to the open ended commitment to a Sinai force and at the same time develop basic Australian defence requirements. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",28
54,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"It is not my intention to deal with the foreign policy or political implications of the commitment of an Australian defence force outside Australia. My concern is the effect that such commitments have on the Defence Force, the development of Australian defence policy and the directions of planning for the defence of Australia which, to say the least, is currently inadequate and is rendered even more inadequate by ad hoc commitments which do not necessarily reflect the Government's planning for the Defence Force, nor the capacity of the Defence Force to respond in such instances. It is known that during 1978-79, when a force was requested to serve in the proposed United Nations force in Namibia, the Defence Committee and the Defence Force leaders made it clear to the Government that the capacity to provide a force of the size and type which was being suggested did not exist. Ultimately, a force of 250 non-combatants was agreed upon, with 50 security troops to protect that force. If accepted now, this commitment would place a serious strain on the capabilities of the Australian Army. This commitment was strongly argued against, because of its effects on the Defence Force, by senior defence personnel and members of the Australian Defence Committee. The current offer is not in response to a United Nations commitment and, according to correspondence exchanged between the Australian Government and the United States recently, it does not reflect a necessity. The Government has made it clear in statements that it believes the capacity to supervise the withdrawal in the Sinai exists within the two powers party to the agreement, which are not at this stage seen to be under any threat, or likely to be under any threat from a power other than one of those in agreement to the withdrawal. The force proposed is not a United Nations force, as was suggested. It is to be a United States formed multinational force made up of unknown components. Australia has been requested to make a commitment to provide forces for two years, or, as would be more acceptable to the United States, three years. The minimum period is two years. The countries acceptable to the two parties and of whom a request has so far been made are Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Equador, Fiji, respond Italy, the Netherlands, Singapore, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand and Uruguay. A substantial number of those countries will not accede to the request unless some form of pressure is applied or unless they are offered incentives which would make it difficult for them to reject the United States request. These countries do not constitute substantive military powers. The United States has indicated it is prepared to provide up to half of the force requirements. One country of that number is expected to provide a force equivalent to battalion size-in this case a truncated battalion of between 500 and 600 men. It is suggested that the force be lightly armed, which places it in the category of a token commitment, not a real commitment, and in a situation where if any hostilities of any description break out in the area the force will be totany incapable of self-defence. The force will be going into an area where technicany military capabilities are of the highest levels in the world. It is a fact that the highest per capita levels of military expenditure in the world are now taking place in that region. It is also true to say that any force which goes into that area goes into a region of uncertainty and hostility and cannot be guaranteed secure, peaceful tenure during its period of service-and peace is the only thing for which it will be armed. Mr Harris-You want 100 per cent assurances.",28
55,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,It would be nice to have some assurance. I do not expect the honourable member to have any serious regard for the defence of Australia. An he is interested in is the political mileage he might make out of the commitment of Australian forces but not the risk undertaken by them. The serious question that must be asked-Mr Newman-If you want to be rude about people do not be rude about him. He has done more than you will ever do.,29
56,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"I am not questioning what the honourable member has done. I am saying that in this Parliament the Government is not taking a serious position on the defence of Australia or the security of Australian forces which the Government is prepared to commit for purely base political reasons. If Australia provides a force approaching battalion strength, which would be expected from Australia if it is to make a significant contribution rather than a token contribution, one of the task forces in Australia will be rendered almost totany inoperative. It is reasonable to expect that the members of the force will be taken from the operational battalions at Townsville, although they could be taken from other areas where a different type of training and preparation is currently in hand. But to remove a battalion or a substantive part of a battalion from Townsville would leave not even a skeleton force to provide the reinforcements which must be ready to replace the Middle East force on a reasonably regular basis. We are looking at a two-year to three-year commitment. In the documents, as the Minister would surely be aware, there is a request from the United States for the option of a further commitment beyond the three-year period. The effect on the Australian Defence Force would be to remove the Army's potential for operational activities within its own region and to take away its capacity for training. During the period of our commitment we could not even provide an adequate force to participate in exercises such as Kangaroo II or III, or Kangaroo IV, which is now coming up. We could not provide adequately the force which would be expected of us if the Namibia offer, which has been made by Australia, is taken up. We would be placing at serious risk our relations with a number of Arab countries which are hostile to any force which is United States based going into the Middle East. The matter which is before us for discussion and decision today concerns what the planning for and use of the Australian defence forces is all about. In the priorities the Government has set, and in statements which have been presented by members of the Department of Defence to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, it is clearly indicated that commitment to United Nations forces, whilst an important objective of defence policy, is not a significant priority in the planning of the Defence Force. As far as the Army is concerned, no attempt has been made over the past five years to equip the Army for any form of combat whatsoever. Its priority is nil in the equipment purchasing programs of the Government. As a result of decisions taken on major equipment items and deferment of commitments made in 1976, the Defence Force commitments for the next several years are almost exclusively in the area of provision of major equipment items for the Air Force and, subsequently, the Navy. The major equipment purchases for the Army in the past four years have been in the nature of trucks, not armaments. There is an argument at the moment about whether the Rapier missiles which the Army had acquired for its use will, in fact, be under Army control or will be transferred to the Air Force. The Air Force is certainly making a bid. The Government's own advisers have expressed serious concern at this type of operation. Those advisers include the most senior advisers in the defence area. The Government is well aware of this situation. It is also true to say, and I repeat, that the Government's foreign policy advisers have advised the United States that they are not happy with the request for this commitment, but they feel an obligation to meet it. It would serve Australia's defence interests best if the Government determined what it expects its defence forces to be able to do because within their budget they cannot carry out a multi-role function. The Government certainly has not equipped, or sought to equip, the Army for foreign policy extension operations such as this. That is what we are talking about. There is certainly no real need, other than the demands of one of the parties concerned, for a force to go into the Sinai. The force would not be capable, if formulated even in the maximum form requested, of providing any form of protection should any hostilities break out. It is not an isolated area as is generally accepted. It is not an area where hostilities are currently taking place. But it is in close proximity to those areas in the Middle East where conflict is at present taking place. The force could, by certain parties in that area, be seen to be performing a role of releasing forces of one party to go into operational areas on another border. The Australian Defence Force is being treated in a cavalier manner. Firstly the Government's determinations suggest that the Australian Army should have the last priority in defence reequipment programs, especially in armaments. It then makes commitments for operations of the Australian Army which will make impossible the training and development programs which the Government has announced for the Army, limited as those may be. Certainly, the removal of a substantial number of troops from the Townsville area or from the training areas at Ingleburn in New South Wales will render whichever task force is involved practically inoperable because of the lack of available manpower. Their training programs will be disrupted to an extremely high degree over a long period. If the Namibia proposition is also taken up the Australian Defence Force will be rendered impotent because the manpower commitments to foreign policy objectives of the Government rather than the defence of Australia will be sllch that the defence forces, because of the limitations of finance and other limitations which have been placed on them, will be rendered incapable of providing a capacity for the defence of Australia which is desirable and which is, at least, announced Government policy, although it is not terribly often applied. This proposal could also lead to much more serious problems for Australia, apart from the risk to the personnel involved, who will not be armed to cope with the situation in the area. If we commit a serviceman to an area I believe we have an obligation to ensure that he has both the protection and the military equipment which is comparable, competent and capable of being effectively utilised in the area. It would be ludicrous in this day and age to suggest that we would send horse cavalry into a modern battle, but with the Middle East situation the relevance of the armaments available to the Australian Army is not greatly different from that. If any form of hostilities involving the Australian forces broke out in that area they would be totally incapable of defending themselves with what is available and what could be made available in existing circumstances. It is all right to say 'a light force in a peaceful operation'. Anyone who is prepared to predict that the Middle East will remain peaceful for any period, let alone the next three years, is prepared to take risks with other people's lives. The Opposition believes that a commitment to this type of force, irrespective of the political consequences or the political motivations, will involve a diminution of the capacity of the Australian defence forces to carry out the role which should be their prime objective, that is, the preparation and carrying out of tasks associated with ensuring the security of Australia. This is a commitment by the Government to a reduction in that capacity.",29
57,Mr NEWMAN,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"Bass-Minister for Administrative Services and Acting Minister for Defence) (3.27)-1 begin by saying that I am surprised that the Opposition raised this subject as a matter of public importance. The suggestion that the Australian Defence Force may not be capable of making the kind of commitment that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has been talking about is sheer nonsense. In fact, it is absolutely fundamental to our force structure planning that we do have the capability to respond to a task of this nature. Before I expand on that, 1 think it is necessary to make a few points clear. By implication, the honourable member for Corio made some assertions which are simply not correct. The position was made quite clear by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) on 26 May, when he made his statement on the Sinai peacekeeping force. We have received no request for this commitment. I repeat that: We have received no formal request for this commitment. Obviously it has been admitted that there is suggestion that we might receive a request, and that has not been in any way concealed from this Parliament. The second point that has to be made is that before we agree to the request, when it comes, we have to have a great deal of information before us about what the role and size of this force may be, what other forces it will co-operate with, and so on. There is absolutely no way that the Government will make the commitment, when the request comes, unless we are in possession of all the proper information that would be required for our defence advisers and, of course, the Government to make a proper decision on the request. I make that absolutely clear. Therefore, it is folly for the Opposition to speculate on the level of the force that may be committed if the decision is finally made along that line. I stress again that no request has been made. We would need to have a lot of information before we met the request. Therefore, it is wrong to start speCUlating on what size of force may be involved. I wish to make one other point before I come back to the assertions made by the Opposition speaker, the honourable member for Corio. He mentioned the reaction of Arab countries. That is one of the questions that we are seeking to find out about, to establish, to analyse. I think that has been made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on several occasions. In all, far from treating this proposition that may come to us in a cavalier fashion, the Government makes it clear that it will take the matter extremely seriously. It will assess the information that it receives very carefully. Then it will make a decision. That is far from making a cavalier statement. Let me come back to the technical part of the debate. I said that it is fundamental to our force structure planning that we have a capability to respond to this type of operation. Let us take as an example the force predicated by the Opposition spokesman; that is, a battalion. Let us say that the request is for a battalion and let us say that we responded to that request. I want to stress again that I am simply speculating. I think it is an interesting point to take the example of a battalion deployment because then we can see how correct or incorrect the Opposition is in describing what effect that would have on the Defence Force. The honourable member made several assertions about our request to take part in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group force in Namibia and about training. Let me deal with those precisely. First of all, the deployment of a battalion would not affect the following: The availability in Australia of the operational deployment force, the ODF; the availability of the engineering unit set aside for possible use in the United Nations operation in Namibia; the force specially trained to meet the anti-terrorist operations in Australia; the joint forces exercises which he mentioned and which have been planned with allies and neighbours within our region; the major exercise of our troops of the defence forces planned for this year, Kangaroo 81; the capital equipment program already laid down in Defence Force planning; and the development of Defence Force facilities in Australia would not be affected.",30
58,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,That is not what the Defence people are saying.,31
59,Mr NEWMAN,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"I made a very precise statement. The Government stands by that statement that I have just made. In fact, arising out of those very firm precise statements that I have made, and I might say, on the precise advice of our advisers, this commitment therefore adds up to this: If we had to make a commitment of the force predicated by the Opposition, that is, a battalion, in fact, far from disrupting the defence forces, it would be a demonstration of the degree of preparedness that we have now in the forces. Not only could we meet this role but also we could meet all the tasks and the activities previously planned and which I have just set out. In fact, this commitment would test our ability to make this kind of deployment, and not only to make the deployment but also to support it properly from Australia. It is the very kind of training, if it is put in that context, that will benefit the Defence Force from time to time. The deployment of an infantry battalion, as the Opposition suggested, would be an illustration of our ability to get our force there and, once we got it to the Sinai, to support it. My colleague, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton), will talk about the methods that we would use to get it there. That will demonstrate the ability to move our forces out of Australia and deploy them to operational areas. He will be talking about our capacity with our 707s, C130s, HMAS Tobruk, HMAS Jervis Bay and all the rest. I make the point again so that everybody will hear it loudly and clearly: The support of an infantry battalion to the Sinai as an example is within our present capabilities. Of course, it would not operate independently. It would have to be part of a much bigger multinational peacekeeping force. Perhaps I could take time to answer the point that the Opposition spokesman was making about that force. He tried to suggest that there is already a force in being and countries have suggested that they will go and that it will be on that basis that we will agree to the deployment. Again, I make it very clear that before we would make the commitment, one of the vital pieces of information that we would need to know would be what countries we would be co-operating with and what countries would be subscribing to the force, what their capabilities would be and so on. The point that I think the Opposition is trying to make is that somehow the Army has been left out in the force development; that it is an unbalanced development. Let us look at what the Army is doing. The Army is now preparing, planning and testing its ability to meet a number of commitments. For example, I have already menhonourable tioned the anti-terrorist plan that has place. I think it is now common knowledge that the Special Air Service regiment is training to have a capability to meet the plan. If we are unfortunate enough to have to bear the brunt of an international-type terrorist activity such as we have seen occur around the world where terrorists such as diplomats take hostages in our country then of course,although it would be principally State ot' police action to solve the problem, the fence forces have the capability to back up that police effort if it were requested. So the ability the SAS which principally would meet that quest for additional defence support has been trained to a high capability to assist the police such an action. Those who have been fortunate enough to see the high degree of capability this already reached by the SAS, can only describe as a superb level of training. I suggest, although fortunately, it has never been tested in real battle, it would meet any of the standards that have set by other such forces around the world. That one example of a principal support element of the Defence Force. I have already mentioned the fact that if a battalion, as has been predicted by the Opposition, were deployed, it would not affect the ODF. It simply would not affect it. I am assured by our advisers that our ability to meet contingency plans from that force is not impeded at all.",31
60,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,That is not what they are saying in their documents.,32
61,Mr NEWMAN,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"I do not care what sort of documents the honourable member has. I am giving him the facts. On many occasions, in this place, we find the Opposition quoting from unnameq documents or documents that it picks out of rubbish tins and so on and it then asserts the Australian people that these are facts. Honourable members opposite do not do this nation any good by doing that. Instead of supportmand. ing the efforts being made by the defence forces and giving the nation some confidence in the training, ability and standards of our defence forces, they go a long way to undermining that confidence which is necessary in our nation. does them no credit.",32
62,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,You are being childish.,32
63,Mr NEWMAN,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,I am not being childish at all.,32
64,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"We are quoting from the evidence which Defence advisers have given before parliamentary committees. That is what we are quoting. If they are telling lies, say so.",32
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,Order! The member will not use unparliamentary been put in language. He will remain silent.,32
66,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"He has made personal reflections which he is not entitled to make. He doesn't know what he is talking about, that is his trouble.",32
67,Mr NEWMAN,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"I am not making any personal reflections at all. I am merely taking up the false accusations that have been made here today. a If they reflect on the honourable member persondeally, so be it. I am only taking up the points that he is purporting to make in this debate. There are of two other elements that I would like to reaffirm. reAnother question raised was in relation to the nature of the Army and its training to meet a in range of contingencies. Although it is not certain that finally the Army would end up with a force of nature, it has to be accepted that it is training it to meet a number of contingencies with its battalions. Work is being done, for example, to produce a mechanised infantry battalion that would been be able to range and operate in a number of is environments. Likewise, we have just seen an exercise conducted in Tasmania, quite successfully, where a force was deployed from the Royal Australian Air Force base in Townsville into Tasmania. It landed by parachute and conducted the exercise which was very successful and which demonstrated the flexibility of the deployment of a battalion in yet another role. I use these examples to show how the Army is training to meet a range of contingencies and a range of operations. That hardly sounds like an Army that somehow has not the wherewithall to meet this training requirement and to meet new roles. We all know that the roles that the Army has to meet go across a wide spectrum. I summarise what I have been saying. Using the illustration given by the Opposition, I have tried to to demonstrate that if we had to deploy-I only say 'if'-an infantry battalion the Defence Force would be more than capable of meeting that deAt the same time it would be capable of meeting without any detriment to it at all not only its continued planned force development but also other contingencies for which it has been prepared. The deployment would not in any way imIt pair the Government's fundamental plans for the continued development of the Defence Force.",32
68,Mr MORRISON,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"1 was interested to note in the comments made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who at the moment is Acting Minister for Defence, a back pedalling on the commitment for a force to the Sinai. For the first time he has introduced a number of very serious qualifications. He certainly does not reflect the enthusiasm shown by his colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). 1 believe that this serves to underline that the defence forces are not enamoured of the prospect of a deployment to the Sinai force. That very concept in the manner in which it has been presented, particularly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, runs counter to the present planning and the philosophy of Australia's defence. Let me take up one very important point which is reflected in the matter of public importance before the House. The commitment to a Sinai force is an open-ended commitment. I use these terms advisedly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement said that it would be difficult for the Australian Government to consider an openended commitment but, throughout the speech that he made to this House, he sought to convey the impression that this was only of a temporary nature. Let us look at the realities. There is no cutoff date or fixed term in the Camp David Accords for the force. The commitment is indefinite. According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the commitment will be maintained as long as either party believes it to be necessary. It could go on for years. I wish to make it very clear that the terms for the presence of a force in the Sinai are indisputably open-handed. What then would be the commitment for the individual participants? What would be Australia's commitment? Again, let us look at the realities. We all know that there is a widespread and understandable reluctance by countries throughout the world to get involved. The responsibility of maintaining the continuity of that Sinai peacekeeping force will be in the hands of only a very small group of countries. That very small group of countries will be left to carry the baby. The Minister will be aware of the discussions that have been going on. The United States of America has made it clear that the commitments of participants to the Sinai force will be for at least two years and, more likely, three years. The Minister will be aware also that the United States has told the Australian Government quite clearly that the forces of participating countries could well be asked to remain beyond that period. The commitment is open-ended but this Government is very likely not to resist United States pressure for Australian participants to stay on and on. The Minister has spoken of our capacity to put a force into the Sinai but he has not spoken about our capacity to maintain a force of one battalion year after year, which is the likely consequence of a commitment to the Sinai force. This can serve only to distort the planning for the defence of Australia. It will become irreparably distorted. Australia is not, as we well know, a superpower and it has limited resources. These resources are most properly devoted to our main defence responsibility-the defence of Australia. 1 thought this proposition had been accepted on a bipartisan basis. It is a singularly sensible statement arising, as it does, from the philosophy and the administration of the Australian Labor Party when in office in the years 1972-75. There is a very distinct and delineated area of Australia's primary strategic concern. I wish to quote from the White Paper on defence issued by this Government in November 1976 which put forward a number of propositions that were carried over from the Labor Party's administration of defence. The White Paper states: For practical purposes the requirement and scope of Australia's defence activity are limited essentially to the areas closer to home. These are our adjacent maritime areas; the south-west Pacific countries and territories; Papua New Guinea, Indonesia; and the South-East Asia region. It continues: Events in distant areas such as Africa, the Middle East arid North East Asia (assuming there were international sanctions for Australia's involvement) are beyond the reach of effective defence activity by Australia. That sums up the standing of Australian Defence Force thinking, not only in 1976 but also through the period 1972-75 and, I trust, now. I want to turn to the role of the Sinai force to which this Government is seeking to commit Australia. On any reading there is an Alice in Wonderland haze about the whole concept of the Sinai force. Does anyone really believe that a put together force of 2,000 lightly armed personnel is anything more than a token, the worse form of plate glass diplomacy? A small force of that nature, if smashed, will bring on to the scene the major insurance policy holders. The concern of the Australian Labor Party is that Australians should not be sacrificed as one of the splinters from that plate glass diplomacy. We all know that the force will be concentrated in two areas-in the north at Rafau on the Mediterranean and in the south at Sharm El Sheikh on the Red Sea. These areas are separated by something of the order of 250 miles of the Sinai Desert. Not even the Israeli Government would regard the proposed Sinai force as anything more than a flimsy security blanket unless-this is the important qualification-United States forces were directly involved. One could well be excused for believing that the repeated references to a UN force in the Camp David Accords are a sham. Israel, for a variety of reasons-undoubtedly it thinks they are good reasons-is insistent that the United States should guarantee its security and, to that end, wants the United States directly involved in the force. As we all know, paragraph 8 of Article VJ of Annex I of the Camp David Accords states that the United Nations force and observers will be drawn from nations other than members of the Security Council. This automatically excludes the big powers, including, of course, the United States. However, we have all noted that President Carter's letter of 26 March 1979 provides the let out by agreeing to provide an acceptable alternative multinational force if a United Nations force did not eventuate. In a recent question addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I asked: As both Israel and Egypt have a direct and significant interest in ensuring that the Camp David Accords are fully implemented, will the Minister urge both governments to assume responsibility for managing forces without the necessity for a multinational force? We should realise that already there has been a major withdrawal from the Sinai area. Israeli troops have withdrawn from over two-thirds of that area. This has all been handled by a Sinai field mission of some 200 civilians. A simple proposition which I think we should put, and which we should urge the Minister to put to the United States, is: Why cannot that Sinai field mission continue to handle the withdrawal processes? It has certainly been successful up to now. I see no reason why it cannot be successful in the future. The important point is that the Camp David Accords are agreements between two governments. Both of those governments have a vested interest in ensuring the success of those Accords. They have a responsibility to themselves, to peace in the Middle East and to the rest of the world to ensure that their conduct under the Accords is such that there is no necessity for a peace force in the Sinai. There is certainly no necessity, as we on this side of the House see it, for Australian participation in a non-United Nations force in the Sinai area.",33
69,Mr SHIPTON,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"The matter of public importance raised by the Opposition today is an attack on the Australian defence forces. Besides being an attack on the defence forces, it is an attack on attempts in this place to have a bipartisan approach to defence policy. I find that very disappointing indeed. This is an attack on all the forces-the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Army-and an attack on the institution and morale of those forces. The defence forces must quiver when they hear members of the Opposition in this place carryon the way they do. They only denigrate the defence institutions of this country. They talk down the good things and are negative about the Australian defence forces. It is quite disgraceful to have the Opposition spokesman on defence matters, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), and the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison), a former Minister for Defence, speaking in the way they did, attacking the defence forces of Australia. The whole policy of members of the Australian Labor Party on this matter, as in so many other matters, is to knock, to whinge and to talk Australia down but not up. In their speeches they ought to express pride in the Australian defence forces rather than be puerile about them. The position of the Camp David Accords and the peace treaty is clear. Israel has withdrawn success- from two thirds of the Sinai and, under the arrangements, planned to complete its withdrawal the withdrawal of Israeli by the end of April 1981. Both parties, Egypt and Israel, envisaged United Nations supervision. We did not hear from the Opposition today that the Soviet Union effectively vetoed the proposition to have a United Nations force. The United Nations Security Council has been unable to reach agreement; the Soviet Union has vetoed the United Nations peacekeeping force proposed under the Accords and the peace treaty. The United Nations has failed to fulfil its role under the peace treaty. Israel, whose security is threatened, regards the establishment of an effective peacekeeping force as an integral part of the treaty and a prerequisite for final withdrawal. That is perfectly sensible and reasonable because the security of the State of Israel is involved. Let us look at the Opposition's position. Its members have come into this House today to talk about the capacity of the Australian defence forces, denigrating that capacity. But they have hidden under this smoke-screen their real policy, which is that they are against any peacekeeping force other than a United Nations force. They fail to face up to the fact that the Soviet Union has vetoed such a force. It is a smoke-screen, and an attack on the defence forces. They have put up that smoke-screen for a number of reasons, one of which is the confused ALP policy on the Middle East. They are ashamed of their policy, so they have attacked the defence forces in this House today. They are confused about their Middle East policy and wish to hide their actual policy, which is against peace. They wish to hide behind this smoke-screen a number of things, including the power of the socialist Left in the Australian Labor Party. As well as the battle going on between the socialist Left and the rest of the party, they wish also to hide the leadership dispute in the Australian Labor Party. They are the four or five things they are trying to hide behind the smokescreen they have put up by talking about defence in this House today. The Opposition is against anything other than a United Nations force. One assumes, from the comments of the honourable members for Corio and St George that they are against other peacekeeping forces and bodies in the world, that they were against the Commonwealth heads of government initiatives in getting peace in Zimbabwe. I assume from what they both said today that they are against Australia's contribution to the election peace processes in Zimbabwe. They should have been working for peace at all levels. There ought to be some of that lateral thinking about which the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) talks. Honourable members opposite ought to consider, if the United Nations fails to deliver peace, whether any other bodies or institutions can bring about peace. I would have thought they ought to be interested in peace itself. That is what they should be about. I regret that the bipartisan support that one would hope for in this area, which was inherent in the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) to this House in September 1978, on the Camp David Accords, no longer exists. That is a shame. On 26 May of this year, in relation to the statement made in 1978, the Leader of the Opposition stated: . . . were comments of a somewhat hopeful expectation on the basis of the Camp David Accords as we understand them. That statement was a shame and it also clearly attacks Israel. The Parliament of the people of Australia deserves a clear statement of why the Labor Party no longer supports the Camp David Accords. A possible explanation which emerged after a special meeting of the Labor Caucus on 14 May this year is that the Accords are yet another victim of the policy of the Leader of the Opposition to curry favour with the left wing elements of his party.",34
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,Mr MiIlar)Order! The honourable member for Higgins is not addressing the matter before the House.

71,Mr SHIPTON,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am addressing my remarks to the matter of public importance. I am also addressing myself to the matters raised by the two previous speakers, who clearly analysed and talked about foreign policy aspects of this matter and the foreign policy implications of Government policy, expressing tacit commitment to the Opposition policy. I believe I am enabled, by their raising matters in that way, to answer the points made.",35
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,The Chair will rule on the matter. The Chair's requirement of the honourable member stands.,35
73,Mr SHIPTON,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,I believe that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has succumbed to the pressure of Labor Party politics and has supported the undermining of the bipartisanship which existed until recently towards the Camp David Agreement.

74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"Order! The Chair is reluctant to interrupt the honourable member but the matter of public importance hinges on the inability of the Australian defence forces to respond to the open-ended commitment to the Sinai force. In the course of debate on that issue some latitude was given to enable a description of the type of commitment that might be required in the Sinai, but the remarks of the honourable member for Higgins now depart totally from relevance to this matter.",35

77,Mr SHIPTON,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"I think that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) clearly analysed the nature of Australian defence forces required to meet. a potential commitment of this type. In a defence context he proved that we have developed a core structure in Australia to meet potential situations, of which the present Middle East situation is one. He pointed out that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) and he made no commitment to this force in any form. It is worth remembering what the Foreign Minister has said in relation to this matter. He said that, as far as Australia is concerned, such a force would need to be considered as broadly based, politically and geographically. In speaking about the capacity of Australian forces to respond to this type of situation, the Minister referred to the ability of the forces to deploy. I believe that Australia, through the transport squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force with its Boeing 707s and C130 aircraft, and the Nwy with HMAS Tobruk, HMAS Jervis Bay and the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, has proved that it has a capacity to respond to situations from time to time. The response by the Navy and HMAS Melbourne to the Cyclone Tracy disaster in Darwin some years ago proves that the Australian defence forces have the capacity to respond to the potential situations that were mentioned today.",35

83,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) said that some of the documents to which I had referred relating to the capacity of the Australian Defence Force were recovered from some rubbish bin, or some such remark. The document to which I referred was a document presented to the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and refers to the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force to respond to requests for participation in United Nations peacekeeping forces. To put the record straight, I would like to quote the passage of that document to which I referred so that there can be no question as to the authenticity of my source. I think it is a serious reflection on me that a document presented to a parliamentary committee can be described in the Parliament by a Minister as a load of rubbish and not being accurate. I ask that I be permitted to quote from the document.",36
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"If the quote is short, the honourable member may do so.",36
85,Mr SCHOLES,SINAI PEACEKEEPING FORCE,"It is short. The only reason it may be long is because I am a slow reader. The document stated: In responding to such approaches, it is necessary to determine the effect of the requested contribution on the Defence Force capability to meet its overall functions and roles in the strategic circumstances pertaining. A contribution which would result in a serious imbalance in residual capacity-or even complete denial of a particular capacity-might be judged to be unacceptable having regard to the effect on the ability to react to other contingent situations, on training, or on, for example, the planned introduction of new skills or equipment. I make that point because I think it is important. I also make quite clear-I think this is important because our approach to defence has been challenged-that at no stage have I reflected on the capabilities or training of personnel in the Australian defence forces. I have reflected on the inability of the Government to provide equipment, and that is a quite different matter.",36

92,Mr SINCLAIR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 to provide for changes covering: (a) supplementary licences for radio stations; (b) public interest criteria; (c) ownership or control provisions; (d) the Australian Broadcasting Commission's merchandising and contractual activities; and (e) other minor amendments. The House will l'ecall that in a statement on 9 October 1980 my predecessor, the Hon. A. A. Staley, foreshadowed legislation to introduce supplementary licences as a means of increasing the range of broadcasting services available in nonmetropolitan areas. The Government recognised that in those areas where an additional fully competitive commercial station was not a viable proposition an alternative needed to be found which widened the choice of services. The supplementary licence concept was conceived as a means of providing additional radio and television services, while protecting the commercial viability of existsubject ing services in the area and preserving the principle oflocalism in broadcasting. The Bill provides for the introduction of supplementary licences for commercial FM radio in areas outside Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. While commercial FM services have begun operation in mainland metropolitan areas, no commercial FM services are available in regional areas. Many such areas cannot support fully competitive FM services, and accordingly the only means of providing these services in those areas is through the supplementary licence concept. This will enable an existing mercial AM operator to provide an FM service in any area not able to support a fully competitive service. Honourable members will note that the Bill does not provide for supplementary television licences. The Government has decided not to proceed at this time with supplementary television licences, following extensive discussions with the television industry and following representations by regional television operators that in many cases supplementary television licences would not be commercially viable without a subscription television component. Before any introduction of subscription television services is contemplated, a number of issues will need to be considered, not the least of which is the desirability of such services and the ground rules within which they should operate. Furthermore, the Government believes it WOUld, in any case, be anomalous to introduce subscription television into regional areas without also considering such services for metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Government has referred the matter of SUbscription television to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for consideration in conjunction with its inquiry into cable television. No decision regarding subscription television will be made until the Tribunal presented its report, which is expected in March 1982. The Government is conscious of the fact that in a limited number of areas supplementary television licences may be viable without a subscription television component. However, the Government is not prepared to make separate provision specifically for those areas at this time. It believes that any introduction of supplementary television licences to increase commercial services should be considered in a wider context. The Government is anxious that large regional cities and the smaller capitals such as Canberra should have the opportunity for increased services at the earliest practicable opportunity. It is anticipated that Government will be making further decisions on the following receipt of the Tribunal's report. In particular, representations have been received from the CTC7 group in Canberra and a station in Hobart in the expectation that two supplementary licences would be provided for their use in those two centres. The Government has considered theil' representations. However, as with the other major sub-metropolitan area of Newcastle, where again the population base and the nature of the commercial television coverage is such as perhaps to justify more than one supplementary licence, it is felt that the introduction of specific provisions to accommodate their com- peculiar circumstances could not properly proceed in isolation from consideration of the matters that will be under debate in this Parliament following receipt of the report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on the cable television and subscription television inquiry that I mentioned a little while ago. The House will also recall that on 9 April 1981 I announced to the Parliament the broad thrust of the conclusions reached by the Government after its review of aspects of the Act. I foreshadowed amendments covering: 1. The machinery and procedural aspects of sections 90 to 92KA of the Act; and 2. inadvertent breaches of the Act by shareholders in companies acquiring interests in radio and television broadcasting licences through share trading on the stock exchange. Necessarily that statement did not express with the same precision as legislation the changes proposed to the Act. Honourable members will note that in some respects the Bill differs from the proposals then outlined. The changes follow from has further consultation with the industry. However, that statement did outline in general terms a package of proposals with two major themes which certainly remain relevant. Firstly, the amendments will maintain the basic structure of decision making that has been in operation since 1977. The amendments will provide the means for more effective administration of the broadcasting system in accordance with government policy. The lack of reference points for the Tribunal in deciding whether a particular licensing decision would be in the public interest has led to some uncertainty in Tribunal proceedings. The incorporation of legislative guidelines for public interest will provide a clearer statement of government policy in relation to the major discretionary powers of the Tribunal. Secondly, the amendments are designed to ensure that the ownership or control provisions will remain effective and appropriate to the commercial environment of the 1980s. Restrictions on the free transfer of interests should be no greater than are necessary to achieve a reasonable balance between the desirability of preventing uncontrolled trading in licences and the need for a vigorous share market. It has become apparent that the present share transaction procedures, which, of course, require the Tribunal's approval prior to any purchase, may operate to prevent a large diversified industrial corporation, for example, from lawfully purchasing shares on the open market in another such corporation, if the second corporation has an indirect interest in a radio or television station of as little as 6 per cent of issued capital. The Government regards such a result as inappropriate for an Act which is designed only to regulate radio and television, and unnecessary to achieve the aims of the legislation. This applies even more strongly in the case of third party breaches of the Act. It is only in exceptional circumstances in our system of justice that a person should be immediately liable for an offence as a result of some other person's actions. In this instance, the circumstances certainly do not warrant such a result. In the Government's view, any person being put into inadvertent breach of the Act should not face possible prosecution, without first being allowed at least six months to comply with the ownership limitations. On 9 April last, my colleagues the Attorney General (Senator Durack) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), representing the Attorney-General, tabled in Parliament a report by the Administrative Review Council on the inquiry procedures of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In my statement to the House on the same day I said that there would not be any decision as to specific recommendations until the public and the broadcasting industry had the opportunity to comment. I have, through my Department, recently contacted interested individuals and organisations asking for their comments on the report by the end of July. Therefore, I expect the Government to be in a position to consider specific recommendations of the report later in the year. I also point out that during the preparation of the Bill and particularly following my announcement to the House on 9 April there has been considerable public debate. In particular, details of the proposals have been discussed extensively with a wide range of broadcasting and television groups and all those who have made contact with my office. The idea, of course, was to ensure that in the application of the ownership or control amendments those who were immediately affected should have some opportunity of expressing the consequences as they saw them. Certainly, overall the objective was to assess the impact of suggested changes before the details of the Bill now to be presented to the Parliament were finalised. In summary, the intention of the present amendments is to streamline procedures, avoid delays in the Tribunal's consideration of transactions, minimise the necessary number of inquiries and provide clearer guidance in relation to the Tribunal's major discretionary powers. I turn now to the detail of the proposed amendments. Supplementary Licences for Radio Stations The Bill will enable commercial AM licensees, in areas other than Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, to apply for a supplementary licence to operate an FM radio service in their areas. Provision has also been made to allow licensees, in areas where there is more than one AM station, if they so choose, to form a consortium to apply for one supplementary licence on a joint basis. Because of the different propagation characteristics of FM as opposed to AM signals, provision is also made for the Minister to invite an applicant to apply for associated commercial translator licences. The intent behind this provision is to ensure that an area currently served by a commercial AM station and its associated translator stations will as far as possible be able to be served by a supplementary FM station together with its associated translator stations. Applicants will make their applications to the Minister in accordance with a form approved by him. Applications can be made by commercial AM operators only to provide a supplementary FM service in their own areas. Unlike other licence applications, where applicants apply in response to an invitation by the Minister, applicants for supplementary licences will be able to apply at any time. The Minister will, however, be able to refer the application to the Tribunal or to reject the application on grounds relating to technical matters or to the planning or development of broadcasting and television services. This provision arises from the Minister's statutory responsibilities for the planning and development of these services. There is, after all, only a limited spectrum and it is essential that there is a capacity to regulate the available area within it. In considering applications for supplementary licences the Tribunal will follow similar procedures to those applying to other licences. For example, in considering an application for a supplementary licence, the Tribunal will be required to take account of the criteria applying to the grant of other licences. However, an additional provision will enable the Tribunal to refuse to grant a supplementary licence in any area which can sustain a fully competitive commercial broadcasting station without endangering the viability of existing services. If the Tribunal finds that an additional commercial station would be viable then it will be required to inform the Minister of its determination and the reasons for it. Supplementary licences will be granted for up to five years and renewed for up to three years. The Tribunal shall, in considering any renewal of a supplementary licence not less than eight years after the initial grant of a supplementary licence, determine whether an additional commercial station is reasonably likely to be viable in that area. If it finds that such a station would be viable, it shall recommend to the Minister that he invite applications for a commercial licence and shall give the supplementary licensee three years' notice of its intention not to renew the supplementary licence. A licensee, but not a consortium, will be able in such a case to opt to retain the broadcasting station operated under his supplementary licence and instead forgo the station operated under his commercial licence. This provision is intended to cover a broadcaster wishing to retain his supplementary FM station rather than his commercial AM station. In this case the supplementary licence will convert to a normal commercial licence. I need to comment oil some aspects of supplementary licences which have been the subject of some recent concern by the broadcasting industry. A decision to seek a supplementary licence is entirely a decision for the licensee in the area concerned. The ministerial discretion to dismiss applications can be on only technical grounds or for planning and development reasons, for example, where no frequencies are available or where the calling of applications for a fully competitive service is contemplated. I emphasise that the ministerial discretion must be interpreted within the scope, purposes and objects of the Act, which are all laid down and are available for everybody to see and understand. The minimum duration of a supplementary licence is 11 years with no consideration of non-renewal before eight years. The procedures for renewal impose what I believe is reasonable protection for the licensee on the one hand and the public on the other. The Government believes this provides an adequate period for licensees to recoup their investment. Finally, it is not correct to suggest that there are no appeals against decisions by the Tribunal which apply to other classes of licence. The appeal provisions in section 119A apply equally to supplementary licences as to other classes of licences, the only difference being that there is no appeal against non-renewal ability after eight years. Special provisions have been inserted to allow the supplementary licence to continue in operation in circumstances where the Tribunal has decided not to renew the licence but for one reason or another competitive licences have not been issued. The Bill includes a number of special provisions relating to localism and arrangements with other radio stations. Specifically, supplementary licensees will need to seek Tribunal approval for arrangements entered into with other stations for the regular broadcasting of: (i) the programs of a related commercial AM station or other commercial stations; (ii) the programs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Special Broadcasting Service or public stations. This provision will provide some degree of Tribunal oversight over the simulcasting· of programs-that is, the simultaneous transmission in one area of the same radio program by two or more stations-or the networking of radio programs from other areas. Other provisions intended to preserve the principle of localism are those relating to: (i) the minimum amount of locally produced or originated programs as provided for by licence conditions; and (ii) the encouragement of local advertising. The proposed amendments will provide a legal basis for the introduction of supplementary licences for radio. However, it needs to be noted that substantial lead. times are involved both for the industry and for my Department. This involves giving reasonable notice to those who will be required to vacate the 88-108MHz band, and the determination of station service areas. Substantial costs may also be involved. The decisions required can be made, and the costs minimised, only if all concerned in the process of clearing band are given adequate notice of the Governadequate ment's intention. There is already a considerable backlog of applications to be considered relating to the existing range of broadcasting and telegreater vision services. Planning for supplementary cences will proceed in parallel with the clearing this backlog and the introduction of nontakes metropolitan commercial FM services. Accordthe ingly, at a later date, I intend to make a major statement regarding planning guidelines for stage of development of commercial FM services. For these reasons, the Bill includes a transitional provision that no applications for supplementary licences may be made before a date to be fixed by proclamation. Public Interest Criteria Clauses 13, 16, 18, 19,28 and 38 of the Bill vide for legislative guidelines for the public interest component of the major discretionary powers of the Tribunal in relation to licence this grant, renewal, suspension, revocation or transfer and in relation to the approval ture, transactions. Although the words 'public interest' do not currently appear in the Act in respect of licence grants and transfers, the High Court of Australia has confirmed in the 2HD case that the concept of public interest is a relevant factor in the exercise of the Tribunal's discretionthe ary powers even where it is not explicitly stated. The Bill provides a consistent codification of lic interest for all the major discretionary powers. Dependent on the type of application, the public interest criteria will be established according to the following guidelines: (i) whether the applicant will meet or has met an undertaking to: (a) compJywith the conditions ora licence; (b) provide an adequate and comprehensive service in pursuance to: be served; munity;and vices which may be received in the same area; (c) encourage the provision of Australian produced programs and the use of Australian creative resources; (ii) whether a person or company is fit and proper to hold an interest in a licence; (iii) the financial, technical and management capacity to undertake the operations of a licence; (iv) in non-metropolitan areas (Le. outside the six State capitals) the degree of concentration of influence of radio or television stations; and (v) the commercial viability of stations in the area. the The undertaking concerning the provision of an and comprehensive service in pursuance of the licence provides a focus for public input at licensing inquiries. It is also intended to generate awareness in the public and the industry liof the need to provide programming which not of only complies with general standards, but also account of the particular characteristics of audience served. With regard to the concentration of influence on radio and television in rethis gional areas, honourable members should be aware that the principal Act already applies much stricter limits on ownership in metropolitan areas than in regional areas. It is not possible for any in. dividual to hold prescribed interests in more than one television station and one radio station in any one State capital city within the overall limit of two television or eight radio stations. On the other prohand it would not be illegal for one person to control up to two television stations and four radio stations in a regional city such as Newcastle. In latter case, it is clearly desirable that the Tribunal should be able to limit undesirable of share, or debenconcentration. Ownership or Control Provisions NA NA The current ownership or control provisions of Act provide that it is an offence to hold prescribed interests in more than two commercial pubtelevision licences or more than eight commercial radio licences. The acquisition of a prescribed interest or an increase in a prescribed interest, as defined in the Act, is currently subject to prior approval by the Tribunal. The provisions restrict the opportunities to purchase shares or debentures in a company if they would confer on the purchaser a prescribed interest in a licence. It is proposed that the requirement for prior approval of such transactions be relaxed whilst preserving the prinof the licence, having regard ciple that changes in the ownership or control of the nature of the community served or to licences be subject to effective public scrutiny. Most importantly, the Tribunal is being given the diversity of the interests of that comeffective powers to collect information on the nature of other radio/television serproposed transactions and to give directions to avoid irreversible adverse effects on the licensee prior to approval being given. Sections 90J and 92F of the principal Actclauses 27 and 37 of the Bill-are being amended to provide for the notification to the Tribunal of any intended transaction and the lodgement of an application for approval of either an intended transaction, or a completed transaction. Failure to lodge a notice or application prior to a transaction will be an offence on each day until a notice or application is lodged. However, such an offence will not preclude ultimate approval by the Tribunal of a transaction provided an application is lodged within 28 days. These amendments will allow the Tribunal to receive applications for approval of share transactions after, as well as before, transactions have taken place. New sections 90JA and 92FAA-clauses 28 and 38 of the Bill-make provision for the approval of share and debenture transactions. In summary, these sections provide: (i) for the Tribunal to approve an application in respect of share transactions after, as well as before, a transaction has taken place; (ii) that the Tribunal may disapprove an application made before or after a transaction provided that it first holds an inquiry into the intended transaction; that inquiry may at the Tribunal's discretion be: (a) a separate inquiry into the transaction; or (b) an inquiry into both the transaction and the renewal of the licence; (iii) that any inquiry may be required by the purchaser, in his application, to commence within three months after the application and if the inquiry does not commence within three months, the transaction is deemed to have been approved; and (iv) that the Tribunal shall take all reasonable steps to complete an inquiry within three months of commencing the inquiry. Where a transaction has taken place without prior approval the Tribunal may give directions to prevent any action it considers will have an adverse effect on the ability of a company holding the licence to comply with the conditions of the licence or on the operations, management or the selection or provision of programs by the licensee company. These powers are conferred by clause 40 in new section 92M. Clauses 28 and 38 of the Bill also provide the criteria which must be taken into account by the Tribunal in considering whether to approve a transaction. In particular, the clauses provide the grounds on which the Tribunal may refuse an application for the approval of a transaction, in whole or in part where an application is lodged in accordance with section 90J or 92F. These are: (i) in the case of a purchaser acquiring or increasing a major interest in the licence, the Tribunal would be empowered to refuse consent to the transfer of that licence to the applicant; This provision recognises that a major share transaction affecting a licensee and a transfer of the licence are, in practical terms, similar and the Tribunal would consider the same public interest criteria and other criteria as are provided for in clause 19, that is, section 89A dealing with transfers; (ii) in the case of a purchaser acquiring any interest in the licence, where the licence has been granted within the previous two years, this provision is intended to preserve the integrity of the licence grant process, by preventing an unsuccessful applicant for a licence from taking over the company of the successful applicant. (iii) in the case of a purchaser acquiring a minor interest, or any other applicant acquiring an indirect interest through the purchaser, where the applicant does not comply with public interest criteria, this provision applies the criteria in a more appropriate way to minor and indirect interests than if these were considered under point (i) above and take into account: (a) the effect the transaction will have on the capacity of the holder of the licence to comply with the conditions of the licence and the written undertakings given to the Tribunal in relation to program services; (b) whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a licence and, as far as is relevant, has the necessary financial, technical and management capacities to carry out the requirements of a licence; and (c) the degree of concentration of influence either directly or indirectly, on commercial radio and television stations, in a nonmetropolitan area. These streamlined procedures and guidelines will provide adequate controls on the ownership of radio and television. The Tribunal's approval will be necessary for the acquisition or increase of a prescribed interest, and the Tribunal will retain a discretion to consider an acquisition in the context of a public inquiry. At the same time the share market will be freed from unnecessary restrictions, but adequate checks will remain to discourage trading in licences per se. I should like to make one further point. The Government has decided that the new provisions relating to approval of share transactions will apply only to transactions taking place after commencement of this legislation. Clause 50 gives effect to this decision. NA Under the existing Act, loan interests in a television station may result in a lender acquiring a prescribed interest in a licence. In some cases this will restrict opportunities to obtain tinance, except by bank overdraft, to which exemption already applies, when in practice the investor might only be able to influence a licence where a licensee defaults on a loan. New section 91 cclause 31 of the Bill-empowers the Tribunal to register approved lenders and so exclude them from the prescribed interest provisions of the Act provided the Tribunal is satisfied that a person will not be in a position to exercise, directly or directly, a significant influence on any company holding a licence. In circumstances where a registered lender used a loan interest to exercise undue control over a licensee the Tribunal could deregister the lender. The lender would then be subject to the prescribed interest provisions applying to loan interests. VARIA nON OF LIMITS ON NA New section 91D-c1ause 31 or the Bill-addresses the problem of breaches of section 92 of the Act by third parties acquiring excess prescribed interests as a result of share transactions by other persons. Experience has shown that an investor can be put in breach of the Act through the purchase of shares by another party in which the investor is a shareholder, because of the tracing provisions of the Act. Problems of third party breaches of the Act have arisen particularly with institutional investors because of their large and diversified portfolio shareholdings. New section 91D provides that any person holding an interest of from 5 per cent up to 10 per cent-on any test-in a television licence without its being considered as a prescribed interest, may apply to the Tribunal for a certificate permitting him to hold that interest. However, the benefits of the section will be extended only to persons acquiring an interest in a television licence operating in an area where there is at least one other commercial television station-that is, the five mainland State capitals-and then only if those persons can satisfy the Tribunal that the interest in question will not give rise to a person exercising, either directly or indirectly, a significant influence on the licensee company. Clause 31 of the Billincorporating both section 91 and section 91D--will commence on a date to be proclaimed. Some preliminary work by the Tribunal is necessary to enable introduction of these provisions. However, the Government will be looking to proclaim this provision as soon as practicable. NA NA The existing sections 90G and 92D of the Act restrict ownership of shares, but not voting rights, in licensee companies by any individual nonresident to 15 per cent, and by the aggregate of non-resident shareholders to 20 per cent, of issued share capital. The interpretation of the provision has presented difficulties because of the lack of definition of 'resident' and the meaning of 'control'-that is, whether it is commercial control, up to 50 per cent of votes, or control as defined in the Act; that is, 15 per cent of votes and in- shares. These sections have been redrafted to provide a redefinition of restrictions on foreign shareholdings to provide that only Australian citizens and companies in which Australian citizens hold more than 50 per cent of the votes and/or shares, may be 'in a position to control' a licensee company. Clause 53 is a transitional provision for non-resident shareholdings, enabling residents who are not Australian citizens to retain any interests they hold at commencement which comply with the existing provisions of the Act. NA NA NA The changes proposed by the Bill to the ownership or control provisions will produce a system which gives considerably more flexibility to licensees and persons acquiring interests in licences. The Government expects strict compliance with the new provisions. To this end existing sanctions and penalties have been strengthened substantially. Clause 40 provides for the Tribunal to give directions for the purpose of securing disposal of excess interests if it is satisfied that a person has breached the provisions of Division 2 or 3 of Part IV of the Act by the acquisition of shares, debenture or loan interests. Directions given under clause 40 will be enforceable in the Federal Court of Australia. Additionally, the Bill provides in clauses 40 and 46 that non-compliance with directions will attract substantially higher penalti- than those presently in force. NA NA NA Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill amend merchandising and contractual provisions relating to the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. These provisions will enable the ABC to make, promote, circulate or sell non-literary matter associated with its programs. Clause 8 allows the ABC to enter into contracts for the sale of its programs without ministerial approval. This delegation is essential for the quick negotiation of contracts. NA The Bill contains a number of other provisions which are either consequential to the changes outlined or are minor changes which update and standardise provisions to accord with current legislative practice. In 1965 when the ownership provisions were last amended special provision was made for persons holding interests in excess of the new limitations, such that these interests could be retained as long as they were not increased or restructured. The effect of this 'freezing' provision or the 'grandfather' clause as it was known, which today applies only to a few companies, has been to inhibit their ability to adjust their corporate structure to the present commercial environment. These companies will require time to restructure their interests. I take this opportunity to foreshadow a Government amendment which I will be proposing to move during the Committee stage of the debate on the Bill which will make appropriate transitional arrangements for these companies in relation to the new share transaction procedures. The proposed changes I have outlined to the ownership or control provisions will be the first major alterations for 16 years, yet there have been significant developments in the industry over that time. These changes, together with the introduction of supplementary licences for radio stations, will provide a sound basis for the continued development of broadcasting in the coming decade without undue constraint on commercial activity. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Dawkins) adjourned. NA FEES AMENDMENT BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time. Second Reading",36
93,Mr SINCLAIR,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill makes consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act 1964 to extend that Act to supplementary licences for radio stations. References in the Act to commercial broadcasting stations, licences and licensees are applied to supplementary broadcasting stations, licences and licensees. Provisions have also been inserted to deal with licence fees payable by a consortium of commercial broadcasting licensees holding a supplementary licence. The Bill provides that the supplementary broadcasting station will be regarded as a separate operation for the purposes of licence fees assessments. The effect of these amendments is to place supplementary licensees on the same basis as commerciallicensees in respect of the imposition and calculation of licence fees. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Dawkins) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time. Second Reading",43
94,Mr SINCLAIR,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"lmove: That the Bill be now read a second time. The principal purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946 to allow the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) to form or participate in the formation of a company that may be established to own and manage the national communications satellite system. On 18 September 1980, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications informed the House that tenders were to be called for the supply of a communications satellite'system, and that the Government was considering the possibility of establishing a company to own and manage that $ystem, the public sector to hold 51 per cent of the share capital in such a company and the private sector to hold 49 per cent of the shares. A committee of officials was requested to report on the interest of the private sector in participating in such a company in which OTC would have a major interest on behalf of the Government, the company to operate' as a commercial tax-paying ertterprise. As an interim measure, OTC had been designated as the authority to own and manage the communications satellite system. For this purpose, licences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 had been issued to OTC to provide telecommunications services by way of a satellite system. The request for tenders for the satellite communications system was issued in October last year. The request for tenders is a comprehensive set of documents inviting tenders for the supply of the space segment of the satellite system, the major city earth stations and minor earth stations to access the satellite, and earth stations required by Telecom Australia for telephony services as well as to receive only earth stations for regional and remote area national broadcasting services. Also included in the request for tender was the supply of earth terminals for the Department of Transport's air safety and navigational services. Twenty tenders were received for the space and earth segments of the satellite communications system and evaluation of tenders is now taking place. In introducing this Bill I make it clear that the Government has not taken decisions on what the final ownership arrangements will be. The report of officials on their discussions with the private sector on participating in a company to own and manage the satellite communications system is now being considered by the Government and I hope to be able to announce the outcome of these considerations in the neal' future. Honourable members will appreciate that if the Government decides to proceed with the concept of establishing a company with public and private sector involvement, there will be a need for further discussion and negotiation on the detailed arrangements which might apply before the company, as a legal entity, is established. The visions of the Bill in this regard should therefore be seen as a contingency measure only. Whether there will be a need for recourse to the provisions of the Bill will depend on Government decisions regarding the organisation or authority which will be the ultimate owner of the satellite communications system and the timing for implementing those decisions. For this reason the Bill provides that action by OTe to form or participate in such a company requires the approval of the Minister. Other objectives of the Bill are to enable OTe to provide technical services, on a commercial basis, to such a company, and to enable OTC to provide consultative services to the governments of neighbouring countries on the use of the satellite system for their own purposes. Again the Minister's approval is required before OTe can take action along those lines. The provision for OTC to provide consultative services of this nature to neighbouring countries reflects the Government's policy of assisting less developed nations in the region to develop their own telecommunications services. Provision has been made in the design of the system for the satellite to provide telecommunications services for the Government of Papua New Guinea. This is an optional feature in the system design, and the Papua New Guinea Government has yet to make decisions regarding its use of the Australian satellite system for its own needs. For technical reasons, it has not been possible to provide in the first generation satellite system for services to be available to other countries in the South West Pacific region. The Government has offered, however, to participate in a study of the telecommunications needs of those countries, and a formal invitation has now been received for Australia to take part in such a study. The results of that study will be taken into account when planning later generations of communications satellites. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission has had considerable experience in the provision of telecommunications services by satellites. It now provides tracking, telemetry, command and monitoring facilities for the Intelsat satellites in orbital locations over the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It will provide similar services for satellites to be launched by the European Space Agency. The OTe also provides the major facilities at Moree, Ceduna and Carnarvon for receiving and transmitting by satellite of international communications. Since the taking of the decision to invest OTC with the interim responsibility for pro- developing the satellite communications system, that authority has built up its technical resources on satellite communications. The skills and experiences of OTC officers in satellite communications systems will be of major benefit in pursuing the Government '8 policy of extending modern telecommunications services to all people in Australia. In seeking the support of honourable members to this Bill 1 would emphasise that the development of the na tiona I communications satellite system is a major project. The evaluation of tenders will be one of the most critical aspects. It has to be undertaken within a time frame which would allow contracts for the supply of the system to be entered into in early 1982, so that the space and earth segments of the system are available to coincide with reservations which have been made with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, and the European Space Agency to place the satellites in their Ofbital positions. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by MI' Scholes) adjourned. BOUNTY (PRINTED FABRICS) BILL Bill presented by Mr Moore, and read a first time.",43
95,Mr MOORE,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to pay a bounty on the printing in Australia of certain lightweight woven fabrics weighing less than 120 grams per square metre. The decision to adopt this form of assistance follows the Government's consideration of the recommendation by the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report No. 240 of 30 April 1980 entitled 'Textiles, Clothing and Footwear'. This bounty proposal is part of the Government's broader program for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, intended to encourage the development of a more efficient industry structure. It is expected also to provide substantial benefits to user industries such as clothing manufacturers. To this end, the proposal is in agreement with the broad objectives of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation. The Bill provides for the bounty to be payable at the rate of 70 per cent of the additional value added to the fabric by the printer. The value added will be based on the factory cost of tl>e bountiable printed fabric less the costs of materials used in the printing process. The scheme is to operate for a period of seven years from I January 1982 and bounty payments for the tlrst full year are estimated to be $2.5rn. The bounty assistance is designed to offset the effect on printers of another Government decision to grant import entry of certain fabrics at mini .. mum rates of duty and free of quota that is, those printed fabrics weighing less than 120 grams per square metre, and destined for garment use. Bounty is payable on fabric printed at registered premises during the bounty period, if the fabric is used or is sold for use in making up into garments in a registered clothing factory. Clothing factories will be treated as being registered for the purposes of the bounty scheme if registered under a State law or, in the case of internal Territories which do not have laws suitable for these purposes, such places used for the production of garments and approved by the Comptroller·General of Customs. This approach is consistent with exclusions from the proposed tariff concessions of certain lightweight woven fabrics which I mentioned earlier. The exclusions will protect the interests of 1981 manufacturers of other lightweight cloth, such as pocketings, linings and curtains. At the same time, the Bill makes provision for an extension by regulation of the uses to which bountiable fabric may Second Reading be put, if the Government decides that such an extension is desirable. The Government expects that the assistance proposed by this Bill will enable the local industry to compete adequately against printed fabrics of a similar nature which will be able to be imported at minimum rates of duty and free of quota after 1 January 1982. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. BOUNTY (TEXTILE YARNS) BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Moore, and read a first time. Second Reading",45
96,Mr MOORE,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide bounty assistance to the production in Australia of certain yarns. The decision to adopt this form of assistance follows the Government's consideration of the recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report No. 240 of 30 April 1980 entitled 'Textiles, Clothing and Footwear'. This bounty proposal is part of the Government's broader program designed to encourage the development of a more efficient industry structure for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. It will also provide substantial benefits for industries using bountiable yarns in manufacturing textiles or textile products. User industries will benefit from reduced costs of material inputs and greater flexibility of sourcing. To this end the proposal is in agreement with the broad objectives of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation. The Bill provides for the bounty to be payable to producers of most yarns at rates calculated as specified percentages of the value added to the yarns, on a factory cost basis, in their production. The yarns eligible for the bounty are specified in clause 2 of the Bill and the rates of bounty proposed for each type of yarn are specified in clause 6 of the Bill. The Government in August last year established the bounty rate for several yarn types, including yarns, spun on the cotton system, at 33 per cent. Following extensive discussions with industry sectors, and based on an assessment of up to date information, it has become apparent that assistance for cotton system spun yarns at this level would be likely to result in a degree of disruption that could not have been foreseen at the time the Government took its original decision, particularly in some regional locations. For this reason the Government has decided to set the bounty rate for these products at 43 per cent. From 1 January 1982 imported yarns similar to the bountiable yarns will be quota free and subject only to minimum rates of duty. Wool carpet yarns and yarns for handcrafting and sewing thread will not be eligible for the bounty. Sewing threads and hand craft yarns are to be assisted by import duties from 1 January 1982. The processes and expenditures eligible for bounty are specified in clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill. In general, the 'additional value' provision excludes materials such as fibres and polymers, dyes, yam additives, and some packaging materials. It also excludes other costs such as general administration, selling and distribution. The bounty scheme is to operate for a period of seven years from 1 January 1982, and it is estimated that bounty payments during that period will be $47m for 1981-82 and $71m per annum thereafter. Bounty eligibility will be restricted to yarns produced in premises registered under this Act and used in registered textile factories. Textile factories will be treated as registered for the purposes of the bounty scheme if used for the commercial manufacture of textile products and if registered as a factory under a State or internal Territory law. In the case of internal Territories which do not have laws suitable for these purposes, buildings used for the commercial manufacture of textile products and approved by the Comptroller-General of Customs will be recognised as registered factories. The Government expects that the assistance proposed by this Bill will encourage further improvements in the efficiency of this industry, reductions in cost, and responsiveness to changing consumer needs. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. AIRLINES AGREEMENT BILL 1981 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by MrHunt: That the Bill be now read a second time.",45
97,Mr MOORE,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Bill, the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill and the Airlines Equipment Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",46
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these three measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",46
99,Mr MORRIS,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The three Bills in this legislative package contain some advances on existing arrangements for the provision of airline services. I will, at appropriate stages in the debate, move amendments designed to shorten the life of the two-airline agreement that is proposed, to provide greater participation by the public and consumer interests in air fare fixing procedures and for oversighting of the profits of the two parties to the agreement, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines. The major purpose of the package of Bills is to ensure the profitability of Ansett Airlines for at least the next eight years. Some provisions of the legislation have been included to appease dissidents in government ranks concerning what they rightly saw as undesirable aspects of the preference and protection afforded to Ansett Airlines under the terms of the now discarded 1980 airline agreement. The position, therefore, is that any benefits to the public that have arisen from this legislation are incidental to those two main purposes. Airline services are one of the few profitable areas of our public transport system. The objective of the Australian Labor Party Opposition is to ensure that the people of Australia have maximum access to safe, convenient airline services at a minimum cost to the users. There can be no justification, in the provision of airline services under the airline agreement, for the operators of those services, Ansett Airlines and Trans-Australia Airlines, to earn profits commensurate with trading operations in the general commercial environment. That was a point made very strongly by the recent Holcroft Committee of Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares in its recent report. The fact is that the public transport system of which the airline service is a major part is there to provide a service to the community. It is not there to earn rewards for risk-takers. In fact, under the provisions of the airline agreement there is little risk involved because the system is a cost-plus system. Only the profits have not been spelled out in specific terms. .Before discussing provisions of the Airlines Agreement Bill let me quickly recall the origins of the two-airline policy. Honourable members will remember that it was introduced in the early 1950s to prop up the failing private enterprise operator, Australian National Airways. It was amended subsequently in 1957 to meet the desires of its successor, Ansett Airlines. The policy has entrenched a rigid regulatory control of domestic airline services and has been supported by successive conservative governments. The great contradiction in the behaviour of honourable members sitting opposite is that despite their constant claims as to the efficiency and efficacy of free enterprise and how it can be done better by the private sector, the two-airline policy, by its very nature, is the antithesis of free enterprise. It provides to two private multi-millionaire operators guaranteed protected access to half the capacity of major airline services in this country. On the basis on which they are protected from any competition, there can be no danger of a competitor pushing them out from their share of the traffic or of endangering their commercial position. As I mentioned, they are protected by a cost-plus pricing system. The present proprietors of Ansett Airlines seized control of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in a gigantic stock exchange coup in late 1979. They paid heavily inflated prices for AT!. The new proprietors then had to set about finding ways of increasing the financial yield for Ansett Airlines. They did not have great difficulty because they had a compliant government. They had a captive government then and they have a captive government now. It stands ready to do their bidding. Today we saw the introduction of the Murdoch amendments in respect of the Broadcasting and Television Act. The two-airline agreement was to be re-negotiated and changed to assist further the multi-millionaire proprietors of Ansett Airlines. The new agreement makes no reference to a limitation on profits despite the exclusive right of the parties to provide major domestic airline services. It is designed to help achieve that higher financial yield now required by Ansett Transport Industries to fund the inflated prices and to help pay for the tax free profit that Mr Robert Holmes a' Court gained from the sale of his shares to the present proprietors. As I have pointed out, because the fare structure is based on a cost-plus system and the agreement requires the operation of only two operators over the entire trunk route network, Ansett cannot fail. There is no risk or danger from competitive forces over the entire trunk route network. Again, that is a point which was made by Mr Holcroft. In effect, the two airline policy is a licence to print money. That is the point that has been made by editorial writers around this country on a number of occasions. The editorial writer of the Australian Financial Review of7 December 1979, at the time when the coup was in progress, was correct when he wrote: The major asset of A TI is the entrenched rights and privileges it possesses under the two-airline policy. Television licences are public property which may not be freely bought and sold. So is the position of ATI within the two-airline policy. Government policy does not have to remain unchanged on either. It certainly has not. The present multi-millionaire proprietors of ATI bought into that company and organised that stock exchange coup on their own initiative. Let their risks be on their own heads, but let not their risks be an imposition upon the air travellers of this country under the masquerade that they are providing a public transport service, a better service and that they would not have entered into contracts to purchase new aircraft if they did not have knowledge of the new agreement which was negotiated and which was not made available to this Parliament. The travelling public has no obligation to ensure an inflated rate of return on the investment the proprietors of Ansett have made in their airline. The incredible subservience of this government to the Ansett proprietors is shown by the surrender of its sovereign power to determine aviation policy. It is an incredible performance. I could not find anything in parliamentary history which showed a sovereign government handing over its power finally to determine policy in the appropriate area to a private organisation which, in this case, is two multi-millionaires. The granting in clause 2 of the agreement of a 90-day power of veto to Ansett and TAA is without precedent in parliamentary history, but it also indicates the level of distrust. This is very important because this legislation has come before the Parliament after several months of dissention, disarray, backroom brawling and attempts to overthrow the leadership within Government. Out of all that disarray has come this second version of a two-airline agreement within 12 months. The distrust that is indicated in clause 2 of the new agreement goes to the distrust between the Australian National Airlines Commission, Ansett Airlines and this Government. In effect, Ansett has said to the Government: 'We do not trust you to legislate in the manner you have indicated in the agreement. We do not trust you to legislate along the lines you have indicated in respect of the Independent Air Fares Committee. We do not believe you can trust your own back benchers'. That is the climate in which this legislation has been brought before the Parliament. Mr Hyde-We are getting on very well.",46
100,Mr MORRIS,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I have noticed, but they are mopping up the blood outside at the moment. The removal of freight from the agreement is supported by the Opposition. The introduction of wide-bodied aircraft and specialised cargo aircraft should result in a higher level of efficiency in the industry together with improved services to air freight users. Accordingly, we do not oppose the Airlines Equipment Amendment Bill. However, the continued restrictive definition of trunk routes will continue to give Ansett and TAA exclusive right to those routes, thus severely limiting opportunities for the development of regional operators such as East-West Airlines Ltd and any other future developments as population patterns and market patterns change. East-West has rightly expressed its concern at the dangers it sees arising from the limitations being placed on operators in the new agreement. Clause 6 of the new agreement in the Schedule attacht'd to the Bill spells out in clear terms the unfettered right of Ansett and TAA to be 'the only two operators which provide scheduled domestic passenger air services over trunk routes within Australia'. Clause 6 (1) (e) nominates 18 trunk route centres in which an air link between any two of such nominated centres comes into the category of trunk route. There are in excess of 150 such combinations, of which 20 per cent are intrastate centres requiring a State government licence. The questions that must be asked are: How many of these trunk route centres are commercially viable now or in the foreseeable future? Why were they included in the agreement? Which party instigated their inclusion? Once a centre has been nominated as a trunk route centre now, or in the future, there is no machinery whereby the airlines can drop the status back to that of a prescribed route. This agreement effectively closes up all route centres in Australia where there is even the remotest possibility of an economic air service. Over 50 per cent of the proposed trunk route combinations are not practicable or commercially feasible to the airlines. However, they are effectively closed to any other air passenger operator unless such operator develops specialised sched.uled passenger air services over such routes for which the Commission and the company are not providing an adequate service to the satisfaction of the Minister or unless either of the two major operators should withdraw from the service. Clause 7 deals with consultations mainly between the Commission and the company. Clause 7 (2) (a) relates to the efficient and. economic operation of passenger air services. It does not set out objectives or standards by which one may analyse the efficient or economic operation of the airlines. One cannot but form an opinion other than that the Government is totally incapable of evaluating an efficient or economic air service. The report of the Holcroft inquiry supports this contention and sets out various formats by which these objectives and/or standards may be judged. Clause 12 deals with the replacement of rural services. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) has now publicly acknowledged that TAA and Ansett will have the right to opt out of rural airline services under the provisions of the new agreement given that, after a specific procedure, they can prove that total costs exceed total revenue. The Minister and his National Country Party colleagues representing country electorates have again thrown their constituents to the wolves. The Fraser Government has given to its friends the profitable air routes, and the marginal and loss routes will be reduced to a lesser standard of service. There is a need for the operator opting out of a rural service to make arrangements-Mr Hyde-Are you calling for crosssubsidisation?",48
101,Mr MORRIS,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"No. I will go on to explain. There is a need for the operator opting out of a rural service to make arrangements with other interested operators to provide an adequate air service. Ansett and TAA should, under the provisions of this agreement, be compelled to operate rural services until continuity of such services is guaranteed. Clause 13 of the agreement requires provision of financial information generally in compliance with the Victorian Companies Act. I ask honourable members on the other side of the House who have corporate experience to enlighten the Minister on what the provisions of the Victorian Companies Act can provide in an analysis of financial matters relating to the airlines. Ansett has for some time complied in its annual' report with the provisions of the Victorian Companies Act. Under the agreement the Minister is to be presented with accounting information specifically, with airline operations in total, not specific, terms. Why could the Schedule not provide for accounting information from Ansett and TAA set out in a standardised format so that a meaningful analysis and comparison between the two operators could be made? There is a great need for financial information on each individual aviation section of Ansett. The Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Act requires this information to be furnished each year by Ansett. All the Minister has to do is extend this information to be available to be tabled in Parliament. If TAA has to furnish similar financial information in a standardised format then members of this Parliament and members of the public will be aware of what is going on in this highly protected industry. In the 24 years since the 1957 airline agreement Ansett has not had to produce a detailed set of accounts for examination by anybody. The Demum partment of Transport may have had access to those accounts. I do not believe that in recent years the Department has exercised its prerogachanging tive to require that information. If it did the infortourist mation was not provided to the Parliament. In the recent Holcroft committee inquiry the proprietors of Ansett were not only able to dictate the inquiry how it should conduct its affairs also were able to elude providing necessary detailed financial information on the airline's activities. That information is absolutely necessdent ary. If other operators in the industry are required to produce information so should Ansett. But it necessary so that the parliament and the people can assess the efficiency and the financial results of the airlines on a comparative basis as part the offset for the heavy level of protection that provided to Ansett and TAA. Clause 15 of the agreement deals with the role of Qantas Airways Ltd, TAA and Ansett. In the 1980 agreement this clause, despite recent Press coverage, still retains for Ansett a power of over direct Qantas participation in the provision of domestic air services. I have noted in recent weeks stories which gave the impression that the clause had been modified. It has been modified to require the Government to consult with the board of Qantas. But the modification has not altered the fact that Ansett, as one of the parties to agreement, has a power of veto over whether Qantas should directly participate in the provision of domestic air services across Australia. Again the consumer is discriminated against for the benefit of domestic operators. The contrast to be made is that recently, when there was a strike within the domestic aviation industry and the Government wanted to do something about it, it was quickly able to overcome the facilitation problems the Minister for Transport is so fond of quoting as the reason the capacity of Qantas across Australia cannot be used. In that strike situation, where it suited the Government's own political purposes, it moved in quickly to utilise Qantas capacity. Clause 15 (2) sets out that any change in Government policy in the future in the respective roles of TAA, Ansett and Qantas will need only the approval of the parties to the agreement. That confirms what I have just mentioned in respect of Ansett having the final veto. The consultation process for Qantas is a little bit of window dressing. Another undesirable feature of the agreement is its term of five years, plus three years notice of termination, which is in effect an eight-year miniperiod. Its result will be to deny to Australians the benefits of new generation aircraft, adjustments that may be required flowing from market patterns, population shifts and development. I will deal with these aspects in more detail in the Committee stage of the Bill. Because of time limitations I turn briefly now to to the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill. This but legislation is a partial acceptance of the Australian Labor Party's policy canvassed at the last two elections for the establishment of an indepenair fare tribunal, to which I referred on those occasions as the Prices Justification Tribunal or a is similar body. Such a tribunal would be given the power to assess and determine air fares. Despite the deficiencies of this Bill, it is a step in the right of direction. Those deficiencies can be remedied in is the Committee stage with the support of some honourable members opposite. One major deficiency in this Bill and the Airlines Agreement Bill is the absence of a finite and precise financial objective for the airlines which would be available for consideration by the Independent Air Fares veto Committee. The Preamble to the agreement to which I referred earlier refers, in association with paragraph (a), to the need to ensure 'the efficient and economic operation of air passenger services within Australia'. As I said earlier, they are vague words, public service jargon, with the meaning being in the mind of the utterer. Clause 11 of the the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill lists the items to which the Committee shall have regard in conducting major air fare reviews. Clause 15 (11) (d) contains almost the same words as clause A of the preamble to which I have referred; the same vagueness and the same generality. However, clause 15 (11) (g), which relates to operating on a competitive basis, is almost in conflict with clause 15 (11) (d) because the two objects cannot be compatible. On the one hand, the legislation involves operating on a competitive basis and, on the other, it involves ensuring economic and efficient operation. Clause 15 (11) (d) of the legislation would be improved if the financial objectives were specific. From my assessment and interpretation clauses 3 and 5 of the air fares committee legislation create serious problems for East-West Airlines Ltd, the major regional operator, in that that company's fare over a trunk route sector must be treated by the Committee as a discount fare. The fact that its fares will be treated in that manner imposes upon the company an obligation to supply information to which it would not have access, and an obligation to make forecasts or produce evidence that certain events may not happen. Again, that is information to which the company would not have access and which it would not be able to provide. We will examine that matter in more detail when we come to the Committee stage of the Bill. Whilst the legislation picks up a number of the Holcroft committee's recommendations, it is regrettable that it has not adopted those in respect of profit limitation, full public disclosure and, very importantly, reconciliation of airline accounts with the overall activities of the organistions concerned. Some Government members like to criticise the non-airline activities of Trans-Australia Airlines from time to time without following the argument right through or without providing full information. After all, they are members of the Government and it is their responsibility to ensure that full information is provided. It is not the responsibility of the public; they are the Government. In the case of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, I have often had the complaint from surface transport operators that there are ways and means that can be followed by Ansett Airlines of Australia and ATI in the preparation of accounts, in inter-company transfers and inter-company baJances in the establishment or conduct of operations, airline and non-airline, which conceal the true movements of funds between those companies and which place the airline company always in the position in which, when it is purchasing new aircraft, it needs the benefit of Government guarantees to obtain loans abroad. Mr Holcroft, a major figure in the private sector of the transport industry; Professor Hogan, an economist; and Dr Bell, who is an economist in the investment field, were skilled and able to assess and determine the importance of proper reconciliation. Unfortunately, a provision to deal with such a practice is not contained in the Bill. Similarly, the Bill does not provide for public dissemination of comparative information on the efficiency of the financial and technical results of both airlines. I am restricting my time because of a request from the other side. I have outlined the Opposition's general approach to the three Bills before the House. In view of those time restrictions I will reserve my further remarks for the Committee stage of the Bills.",48
102,Mr SHACK,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The three Bills the House is debating cognately this afternoon-the Airlines Agreement Bill, the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill and the Airlines Equipment Amendment Bill-together with the Australian National Airlines Repeal Bill which will be debated in this chamber later today, are the result of over two years of extensive consideration of domestic aviation policy by the Government, by private members of parliament, by the airlines themselves and, importantly, also by the pUblic. Some of the decisions that have been announced by the Government to date, and to which I will refer shortly, ensure that this consideration will be an ongoing process; a process to evaluate the appropriateness of the two-airline policy, which is to be perpetuated by the Airlines Agreement Bill, and perhaps to examine some other options such as a greater or lesser degree of deregulation in the future. As the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) mentioned, there is a limitation of time for this debate. I know that several of my colleagues would like to speak in the Committee stage. I propose to keep my most detailed comments for that time. I now want to speak broadly, but briefly, on what I think has been achieved over the last couple of years. Over the last two to two and a half years consideration can be perceived as beginning with the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee Report, which came out in 1978. That was an important report because it came out in June 1978, when the Airlines Agreement Act of 1973 terminated. After December 1977 the opportunity existed to provide for termination of previous airlines agreements with five years notice. I believe it was an important report. It came to numerous conclusions designed to improve the regulatory environment. It was on the basis of this report that the Government proceeded to negotiate with the airlines to come up with the airlines agreement which was signed towards the latter part of last year. That agreement was designed to incorporate the improvements and changes that were recommended in the report. Although it was a valuable report, it had two weaknesses. Firstly, it proceeded from the basis of the maintenance of the two-airline policy. The two-airline policy was not brought into question. Secondly-I do not think this is unfair criticismthe review was conducted largely by the Department of Transport. I think it can be shown from the report that the interests of the regulated and the regulators became enmeshed. It was not an independent study in that sense. Because of that there grew in the community, and certainly inside the Parliament, a level of disquiet which recognised that this was a valuable opportunity to reassess domestic aviation and to reassess our needs for the future. It was felt that perhaps the reassessment in this report was not as full as needed. Wisely, the Government recognised that disquiet and moved to set up the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. I want to place on public record my opinion as to the valuable contribution to the study and understanding of domestic aviation made by the Holcroft report. I want to pay tribute to Warwick Holcroft, Harold Bell and Warren Hogan for the work they did in the course of the committee's investigations. The focus of the committee was on fares but, without repeating old arguments that I have voiced in this place, the terms of reference of the committee gave it wider scope. The committee was able to bring into focus and into question the two-airline policy itself. The Government has had the Holcroft report since the early part of this year and now we have this legislative package reflecting some of the findings in that report. As I stated at the outset of my remarks, I would like to catalogue what I believe has been achieved. I refer firstly to fares. It will be remembered that the Holcroft committee, among other things, identified gross cross-subsidisation between routes, deficiencies of the present air fare setting formula and procedure and, in the committee's opinion, a lack of desirable accountability which is necessary in the regulated environment due to the absence of the disciplines of market forces. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), in his 1 April statement to the Parliament, gave an initial response to the Holcroft report. One of the most important elements of that response was that the Government accepted the need for a national cost-based formula with the elimination of crosssubsidisation as far as is practicable. To date we have seen a first step readjustment of the fare relaits tivities between the long haul and short haul routes in an effort to eliminate cross-subsidisation. The Government rightly recognised that Holcroft did not go far enough in terms of his figure work and that more cost allocation work was required. The Minister announced in that statement that the Government would be enlisting independent assistance to help in that work. As I understand it, a tender has been let to some accountants. I would be grateful for the Minister's explanation, in his responses during debate on these Bills, of how that further work is going. I hope that that cost allocation procedure can be concluded so that when we next face a new fare rise, and if that new fare rise comes before the Independent Air Fares Committee is in place, it will be based on the Holcroft formula. I mention the Independent Air Fares Committee because it is the second major initiative of the Government in response to the Holcroft report. There is an intention to establish the Committee, which will be given the sole responsibility of periodically reviewing the cost allocation methodology. It will be independent and separate from the Department of Transport, and it will have the further responsibility of adjudicating on future fare rises, be they minor or major. An important point I make about the Committee at this stage is that its personnel will be important, absolutely crucial. They must be men who can be seen and shown in the public arena as possessing the absolutely highest integrity because in a regulated environment they will have the sole responsibility on behalf of the public of adjudicating on what the fares should be and of explaining to the public why they have arrived at such findings. I hope to make an input to the Government as to who should be on that Committee. I merely stress that the Committee's personnel will be absolutely vital to its success in the public eye. The second most important thing about the Committee is that its findings will be public. Not only will it announce a fare rise but it will also publicise its reasons for that determination. This initiative is an attempt by the Government to pick up that element of accountability that the Holcroft committee identified to be lacking in the regulated environment, and I think that is especially important. I have my own personal view that if that is done, and done properly, more and more Australians will come to appreciate the ludicrous nature of a regulated air fare setting environment. However, for the moment, and for the purposes of this debate, that is by the by. The third major initiative of the Government is decision on Trans-Australia Airlines. I do not want to run the risk of referring to a debate that will take place in this chamber later today. I simply say that the 1 April statement by the Minister contained an in-principle announcement of the establishment of TAA as a public company, to free it from the same sorts of bureaucratic controls that Qantas has complained about. It is an initiative that has been welcomed by TAA. It will make TAA more competitive, and I believe the regulated environment will be all the better for that decision. I am mindful of the Government's own interdepartmental committee study into the future of TAA. The report of that committee, which was given to the Government on 14 March 1980, stated: However, the committee concluded it was not possible to make Trans-Australia Airlines fully commercial while the Government was a majority shareholder. What we are doing now, in my view, is taking the first most important step. We have to take the next most important step before we arrive at a final decision as to the future of TAA, that is, to investigate the structure of TAA. To look at TANs superannuation liabilities and other liabilities, its asset value and so forth. We can then arrive at an answer to the question which at present we cannot answer, that is: What is TAA worth? We have heard a lot of hysteria from the Australian Labor Party on this matter, which is central to its socialist ideology. I believe that if the Australian Labor Party shook off its blinkers and looked at the matter it also would come to the conclusion 1 presently hold that a more competitive TAA will be achieved if there is direct public shareholding. 1 believe that the regulated environment would be all the better for that. The fourth initiative that has been announced by the Government is the intention to establish a deregulation inquiry, and again I refer to what Holcroft said. In simple terms, he said: '1 determine faults in the regulated environment and I list by way of recommendations ways in which I think you can improve it. But even if you do everything I say you should do to improve the regulated environment, you will end up only with second best.' In my view, the Holcroft committee's most important conclusion was that we should be proceeding down the road towards progressive deregulation. The Minister in his 2 April statement to this Parliament, when dealing with the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantees) Bill, announced the intention to set up the inquiry. Again I say that the two most important aspects yet to be determined are the terms of reference for that inquiry and the personnel who will conduct it. I can see no reason why those matters should not be decided later this year when Parliament returns for the Budget session. As the Minister announced, the inquiry will be asked to report within five years. If the inquiry is set up properly, with dinkum terms of reference and with people who have open minds on the question of future aviation policy for this country, 1 can see no reason why it cannot bring down progressive reports. The Government will have before it the benefits of that inquiry within five years. For the first time since the two-airline policy was brought into play, we will be in a position to consider where we should be going-not from the basis of maintaining the status quo but by comparing the status quo with perhaps some other options. Fifthly, ] come to the proposed two-airline agreement itself. The agreement takes into account the Government's decisions on the independent air fares committee and on TAA. Before dealing with that in a little greater detail, I would like to summarise the stage we have reached. In my mind, there has been definite progress. There have been air fare reductions on long haul routes and we have seen a foreshadowing of further changes in the relativities between fares for long and short routes. It is intended to establish an independent committee separate from the Department of Transport to determine future fares, to monitor the cost methodology, and to provide that public accountability that is so necessary in a regulated environment. A new two airline agreement has been negotiated to take into account the decisions of the committee and the decisions on TAA. It is intended to establish an inquiry to investigate whether deregulation is a viable objective for our future domestic aviation needs. These are all significant undertakings and statements of intent which, in my view, mark important and welcome shifts in Government policy. Honourable members will recall that only a little while ago that policy did not really accept that the fare relativities between long and short haul routes were inequitable or unjust. Only a little while ago that policy was firmly committeed to the reins of regulatory control being held exclusively by the Department of Transport, which was committed to the continuance of TAA as a statutory corporation. It was based on a seemingly unshakable commitment to the long term maintenance of the two-airline system. [ believe that we have progressed, that we are taking steps in the right direction, and that further progress can be expected as we move down the path that has now been chosen. In my last five minutes I want to turn to the two-airline agreement. I oppose the two-airline policy. I have opposed it in the Parliament for as long as I have been here, and my opposition is well known outside the Parliament. I accept that the proposed agreement contains improvements over previous agreements-improvements with respect to freight, the air fares committee, and public accountability. But for every improvement we can find complaints and criticisms, such as the legitimate concerns of East-West Airlines Ltd, the concern that Qantas Airways Ltd will not be able to play its proper role, and so on. I remain opposed to the two-airline policy as such because I believe it denies entrepreneurs freedom to enter the market, it denies the Australian travelling public significant carri-r choice, and it offers the public little realistic price value choice in terms of fares. I accept that the policy does have some benefits, such as flight frequency and a very high standard of in-flight service, but I do not think that they outweigh the disadvantages, and they are certainly benefits that are provided at an inflated cost. In the past I have called the two-airline agreement a piece of economic madness which is costing Australia dearly. I believe the present system is based on an inflated cost due to operational inefficiency. It is my view that a deregulated system would open up the system to competitive market forces and would see all features-price, frequency and service-based on and responsive to consumer demand. I have to accept the possibility that I may be completely wrong. My prejudice against the two-airline policy and in favour of progressive deregulation may be completely wrong. In that light, I congratulate the Government for opting for the only responsible course available to it, that is, to investigate the situation. The deregulation inquiry is a first-class initiative. welcome it with all the support I can muster. For the first time in 20-odd years we will look at other possibilities and make a decision as to whether they can be applied to Australia. We will look at the American experience, not only from the perspective of the airlines but also from the perspective of those people we too readily forget-the passengers. The deregulation inquiry will report within five years. Given that fact, what bothers me most about this legislative package is the life of the new agreement. I believe we should put ourselves in a position whereby we will make a decision on the deregulation inquiry at the end of five years. The airlines agreement as it is presently drafted and the Bill which gives effect to that agreement places no requirement on anybody to do anything after five years. We cannot do anything before five years, but after five years we do not have to do anything either. If honourable members doubt that I ask them to look closely at the terms of clause 22(4) of the agreement. Over the last few days we have heard a lot about whether five plus three makes eight, whether three from eight equals five and so forth. I want to try to reduce the whole issue to this fundamental point. As clause 22(4) is presently drafted, it provides for a five year minimum plus an indefinite period during which we mayor may not give notice of something. It then has a three-year period of termination. Effectively we have a minimum of eight years but a maximum that is indeterminate. I have advocated strongly in the past that we should have a five-year maxamum. I will save my comments on that matter for the Committee debate because I am running out of time. I foreshadow that I will argue that we should opt for a five plus three situation but that we should make the minimum of eight years as provided for in the agreement a maximum of eight years. Amendments to be moved in my name have been circulated. I will leave my further remarks for the Committee stage of the Bill.",50
103,Mr BEAZLEY,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"1 will support in the Committee stage the Opposition's amendments. I will now range over the Airlines Agreement Bill, the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill and the Airlines Equipment Amendment Bill, though not as broadly as the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) ranged in the course of his remarks. He was extremely provocative, introducing at this stage of the debate the question of the future of Trans-Australia Airlines. That matter is not before us at the moment. He protrayed a picture of sweetness and light in the progress to the point at which we are now, which I I do not think the history of this issue justifies. This debate today concludes a sorry tale, not only for the Government, although mainly for it, but also for the Government's revolting back bench. The Government's performance for over a year now has been one of vacillation and deceit-a misleading not only of the Parliament but also of the Australian people in a general election. These points were made quite clearly during the various debates on this matter to this point. Most particularly misled have been the citizens of Western Australia. They have also been ill-used by a selection of Liberal back backbenchers from that State. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean) have never been able to work out whether their main task has been to lower air fares for Western Australians or to conduct an ideological tribal dance on the question of the abolition of the Government's airline, of interest only to the wretched coterie of neanderthals in the local Liberal Party organisation. They will be put to the test on these Bills. Several honourable members opposite are on record as supporting a five-year maximum period on a non-negotiable basis for the operation of this legislation. We shall be moving an amendment in the Committee stage that will give them the opportunity to display exactly how far they will go and how nonnegotiable that position has been. The Labor Party's amendments are designed to resurrect something for the Australian and Western Australian people from this morass. To do this we must resist the Government's attempts to make the two-airline agreement election proof and the operations of the Independent Air Fares Committee public proof. This Government does not trust people because, left to themselves, the people do not trust it. Therefore, a popular view, in the view of this Government, must be resisted at all costs. Despite the fact that there are some improvements as the Opposition shadow spokesman said, referring to the Air Fares Committee, I suggest that these are way short of the requirements of the Holcroft inquiry into domestic air fares. They are short at least of what some honourable members opposite have said on the public record to this point. It will be extremely interesting to see how they come across on the amendments we will be moving. Our intentions through the amendments we will move will be two-fold. The first will be to stop the victimisation of the Australian travelling public by preventing their having to carry the burdens of excess and uncontrolled profits. Secondly, our amendments will render the airlines' economies publicly accountable. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) wrapped himself, as far as he possibly could, in the Holcroft inquiry flag in his second reading speech on this Bill. However, throughout that speech and throughout the negotiation of this agreement he frustrated at every point the purpose of that inquiry and the recommendations it made. Fundamental to the inquiry and ignored by this agreement and the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill was a limitation on excess profit. In chapter 16 of the Holcroft report the question of profit was assessed at great length. Many constructive suggestions were put forward. The Holcroft inquiry stated: The attention given to profitability in relation to of air fares requires a careful appraisal of the ways in which an equitable return in a regulated activity should be assessed. This is all the more important when so little attention has been given in Australia to what this means in practice. Neither in the agreement nor in the terms of reference for the Air Fares Committee' is this made fundamental to the process. The Holcroft inquiry concluded with four recommendations on profit levels. One of them was quite clear on amounts. It stated: Profit before interest and tax, excluding extraordinary items, should as a proportion of revenue not exceed 6 per cent, given a continuation of present levels of interest rates and income taxation in Australia. We can interpret many things in the Holcroft inquiry in many ways, but one thing we cannot do is interpret that recommendation out of existence. It is quite clear. It is also quite clear from the Minister's second reading speech and many of the contributions from honourable members opposite so far that this limitation simply will not be imposed. It should be imposed. We have every right to expect that it should have appeared in the Minister's statement and in the legislation. An indication of that was given by the Minister when he spoke on this matter on 1 April. He said: In addition, the report's recommendations advocating the adoption of a profit target must be more fully examined. More fully examined by whom, if it is not to be directly more fully examined by the air fares inquiry to this point? Not only is there no limit on profits but also there is no requirement to make public airline accounts so that people may judge the extent to which they are being justly or unjustly treated. This is evident from clause 13 of the Schedule to the Airlines Agreement Bill which has already been mentioned by the Opposition spokesman on this matter. I think it is worthwhile to refresh our memories. The Bill is before honourable members so I will not read the clause to them. They should contrast the clause with what the Holcroft inquiry recommended. Recommendation (1) in the section on profit stated: There should be public disclosure of balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for those activities subject to special regulation and these accounts should be shown separately from those for the company as a whole. There should be reconciliation statements for such accounts stating the results for regulated activity together with the overall accounts. This should be supported by sufficient information to show the methods used for allocating relevant items between the two sets of accounts. How far short of that very desirable objective does clause 13 of the Schedule fall? It falls a very long way short indeed. It is no particular credit to the Government that it has chosen not to adopt the setting that recommendation of the Holcroft inquiry. There is a half-baked comm-tment right down the line to the Holcroft propositions. This is a110ther element of that half-baked commitment. The House is not only misled by ministerial protestations on the level of government compliance with Holcroft recommendations but also misled on the undertaking by the Minister to permit the use of Qantas Airways Ltd seats on domestic flights between east and west. I will quote in full an answer to a question asked of the Minister by the honourable member for Tangney on 29 April 1981. The Minister said: I think the events of the last few days have indicated that the proposition-That concerned the suggestion on the permanent use of Qantas on east-west fiightsput forward by the honourable member is certainly a feasible one in terms of administration. In the longer term, however, I understand that there would for Customs, quarantine et cetera, in order to cope with the mix of passengers on such aircraft. I have initiated between the airlines to ensure that there is a way through the problem that has been concerning the Western Australian people for some considerable time. Where we can use excess capacity on international services from Perth to the eastern States, we should endeavour to do so, so long as we do not disrupt the regular scheduled services that the Western Australians have come to expect. That is the only concern I have in trying to achieve that objective number of people from Western Australia. The Minister may defend himself, if he wishes to, by pointing out that there are enough caveats and loopholes for him to whip a horse and cart through. There is no loophole in that statement to suggest that he may permit Ansett Airlines of Australia to determine the point at which the Government's conclusions on that investigation have been reached in a satisfactory way. There is no suggestion in the statement made by the Minister on the question of the use of Qantas seats that Ansett Airlines will be given a veto. There is no suggestion of that whatsoever. Effectively, that section of the agreement relating to the use of Qantas provides Ansett with a veto. Therefore, Western Australians cannot, I believe, look forward with the degree of confidence they ought to a rapid gaining of access to Qantas flights on the east-west trip. I remind honourable members that various estimates made of the value to the Western Australian travelling public of the use of Qantas seats have put the reduction of fares as high as 50 per cent. Further, in terms of reference, functions and public accountability of the Independent Air Fares Committee that from a parochial point of view the main possibilities for air fare justice have been thwarted. That is a parochial Western Australian point of view but also one which I think could be adopted by any honourable member from any area of Australia. The Holcroftinquiry demonstrated the extent of the cross-subsidisation of the eastern network by passengers travelling on the east-west routes. Whilst the honourable member for Tangney does not wish us to look at those matters historically and says that bygones ought to be bygones I do not think that we who represent Western Australia ought ever to tire of reminding honourable members that the estimates of subsidies were over $20m per annum. That is a shameful figure. It is a figure that has not in any way been alleviated, at least to any substantial degree, by air fare reductions that have occurred so far. We cannot guarantee in any aspect of this legislation that the situation will be alleviated in the future. The Governments adjustments to air fares were a joke. But they were accepted by gullible have to be additional facilities members opposite from Western Australia as the discussions forerunner of more cuts. All the groundwork was laid for a rapid reallocation of costs by the Holcroft committee. A considerable amount of work was done by committee members on that matter. As I said, the groundwork was laid for a rapid decision. But under the Bill there is no obligation on the committee to report in under three which has been sought by a years. I will refer to the Minister's speech on 1 April and his comments on whether there would be further air fare reductions. To a very considerable extent these can only be based on a proper appreciation of the need to reallocate costs. The Minister stated: However, the inquiry recognised a considerable amount of detailed work would still be necessary to derive and verify the most appropriate fair setting formula based on current costs. He went on: The Government will arrange immediately further substantial discussions with the airlines so this task can be completed by July 1981. The honourable member for Tangney expressed hope that when the next air fare rise came about such adjustments would be made. The simple fact of the matter is there is now established a body given responsibility for reallocating costs. That will provide a perfect excuse for this Government-and it has not very often needed perfect excuses in the past to do what it wants-to evade having to do that cost reallocation so that we in Western Australia can expect, three years from now perhaps-no doubt promises will be made before the next election by the Liberal Party advertisers doing a soft shoe shuffle-the fare reductions that we might get in the west. Of course, that may well come to naught after the next election. That question has been made 'public proof' with the terms of the Committee's reference. As I would suggest, in the end nothing will come of it. Therefore we still have the situation where the air fares to Canberra from Sydney is $112, from Melbourne $145, from Adelaide $232, from Brisbane $214 but from Perth $504. Over the years quite effective pressure groups have been established in Western Australia to demand air fare justice. Nothing in the Bill gives such groups automatic access to the committee they have striven so hard to create. At cost allocation reviews such groups will appear at the Committee's pleasure. If the groups are not made parties to the agreement they, like the rest of the public, have no automatic right of appearance; nor do they have the right to know what transpires at Committee hearings. Part of the hearings-a part vital to a Committee decisionmay be held in private. On top of that, interest groups have no right of access to major and minor air fare reviews. As the honourable member for Tangney pointed out the Committee must be trustworthy. The Holcroft inquiry pointed to the dangers of regulators identifying with the interests of the regulated and not the interests of the public, on whose behalf they should be acting. This applies to the Government in the case of the Holcroft inquiry. It will apply to the Committee in the case of its composition. We have not been given any guarantees in the Minister's second reading speech that the Government will appoint to this Committee the type of person who will not purely be a lackey of the Independent Air Fares Committee interests. The importance of doing so I think was well outlined on page 238 of volume 1 of the Holcroft committee report. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard that page of recommendations in order to be able to conclude my remarks and to give other honourable members time to speak. Leave granted. The document read as jollows15.9 The problems of accountability in an industry or activity that is treated for regulatory purposes as in some sense part of the public sector are especially testing. The concept of accountability is bound to embrace the activities of the regulatory agency as well as the ticipants. For example, accountability requirements imposed upon the regulated industry may reveal shortcomings which also reflect upon the workings of the regulatory agency. In such circumstance the regulatory agency may develop as much of an interest as the regulated the information available on past and present performance. 15.10 A positive concern with accountability must involve the dissemination of information on the workings of the regulated industry and the regulatory agency in such a manner as to allow third parties, especially the users of services regulated industry, to make judgments about the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory regulated industry. 15.11 It may be objected that the regulated industry, while having to meet the requirements of the regulatory agency, also has to meet other obligations reporting requirements that firms. However, this objection is misplaced if the provisions for an industry specially regulated by the mechanisms of the public sector also involve withdrawing some of the normal checks applied to market performance. 15.12 Air passenger transport activity bears witness to the complexity of arrangements associated with regulation. For example, the two major participants, TAA and Ansett, are not engaged solely in this activity so there is no clear basis to?",53
104,Mr BEAZLEY,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I thank the House. Neither the membership nor the public accountability of this Committee conforms to the standards that the Holcroft committee laid down. The failure to conform to the standards that the Holcroft committee laid down, I believe, means that in the future there will be considerable difficulties in ensuring that the travelling public is treated justly by the two-airline agreement. There is to be no consumer representative on the Independent Air Fares Committee. Public access and public accountability are highly restricted. The Opposition will move amendments that will provide honourable members opposite with a chance again to assert their principles on both those accounts. I believe that the Opposition's amendments when they are moved must be supported. The honourable member for Tangney talked of the progress of sweetness and light on this matter, but it appears that quite bloody and bruising battles have taken place opposite. Honourable members have gone on record via leaks and direct public statements. Their statements are all on record; they all match amendments that the Opposition is moving. We look forward with very great confidence to a few thumping victories this evening.",56
105,Mr CHARLES JONES,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The Bills before the House in this cognate debate are the Airlines Agreement Bill, the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill and the Airlines Equipment Amendment Bill. The introduction of these pieces of legislation into the Parliament has certainly brought about considerable conflict within the ranks of the Government members who have all been pushing their own lobby's point of view. The result is that the Cabiperformance of the regulated parnet and the Government have been in one hell of a mess ever since the airlines agreement was first brought to negotiation. In a country the size of Australia, with a population as large as it is, with a participants in limiting limited number of air travellers, there are some advantages in having a genuine two-airline agreement and an arrangement which would put the airline system into a truly competitive position of the and which at the same time would give the people agency as well as of the of this country a first-class airline system at fair and reasonable prices. Ever since the original airline agreement was first negotiated and brought into legislation by the in the marketplace with all the are laid down for private sector Menzies Government in 1952 the result has been one thing only. On that occasion the legislation was designed to protect Ansett Airlines of Australia from Trans-Australia Airlines or any other competitor which might move into the field. I draw the attention of the House to the case only a few years ago when IPEC endeavoured to get into the airline business, into the lurk, into the monopoly operation; in order to get a licence to print money. That is what the airline agreement has developed into-a licence for the private operators to print money. In such a situation there is a need for a renegotiation of the airline agreement. A limitation of five years notice of termination under the old agreement has been mentioned. The position under the old agreement was that it was almost impossible to terminate the agreement. The present agreement has five years to run. With three years notice of termination the position could well be that at the end of this Parliament in 1983 we could have an Australian Labor Party government. In 1985 the five years would have run its course. The Labor Party could give notice of termination of the agreement at that point. When the three years notice expires there could be a change of government. So, we then have a change of policy. This airlines agreement should be a sunset agreement. If we have a five-year agreement then at the end of five years that agreement should terminate. There should not be any notice of termination of the agreement. When the agreement is approaching the end of its five-year term it is up to the government of the day and the parties to the agreement to sit down to talk about it, to negotiate a new agreement that would then become operative, if it is agreed to by the Parliament. This should be the practice instead of this humbug, this means whereby Ansett can get out of having the agreement renegotiated. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in his speech drew attention to the fact that in 1974 I, as Minister for Transport, wanted to give the people of Western Australia another service. Thereby TAA would have been in competition with MACRobertson Miller Airline Services which, after all, is only another name for Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. The Labor Government was going to fit TAA with DC9s. It was going to give the people the option of two fares-the first class fare and the economy class fare. At that time all the people using the MACRobertson Miller airline had to pay the first class fare. There was no economy fare. Our proposal involved a 25 per cent reduction in fares for the people. How long did it take to get that decision that was taken by the Labor Government put into effect? It was some three and a half years. By the use of the terms of the agreement and the High Court of Australia and all the rest of it the people were prevented from getting this opportunity to have lower fares. The Minister in his second reading speech said: In its submission to the public hearings of the Holcraft Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares in Port Hedland. TAA claimed that between November 1977, when the DC9 services commenced. and August 1980, 41,168 passengers had used the DC9 services. These passengers had paid some $1.5m less for their travel than if they had usedF28 services. a saving of over $25 for each passenger. That is what the first two-airline agreement meant to the people of Western Australia. The members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the members of the Liberal and Country parties in this Government were instrumental in forcing the people of Western Australia to pay the extra charges on the airlines operations in Western Australia. The proposal could have resulted in cheaper fares for those people. What happened occurred just because the Government wanted to pay for services rendered to it by Ansett. Ansett has been protected for years by the Liberal and Country Party governments of this country. Now we have the set-up with Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles in Ansett Transport Indus"" tries Ltd. Here once again is the pay-off. Just as with the pay-off earlier today with· the amendments of the Broadcasting and Television Act, this pay-off is for services rendered to the Government by Ansett and by Murdoch in the 1975, 1977 and 1980 elections.",56
106,Unknown,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,57
107,Mr CHARLES JONES,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The Airlines Agreement Bill and the two associated Bills are very important pieces of legislation. One of the most unfortunate aspects of this debate is the limited time the Parliament will give to considering these major Bills. Without repeating what I said prior to the suspension of the sitting, I wish to refer to a couple of matters. The first relates to the set-up of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. a company that covers a multitude of undertakings. No real consideration has been given to the composition of this company, as to whether it is a transport company or a media company, or whether it will be involved in television operations as a result of the legislation introduced earlier today. That legislation is part of a pay-off to Murdoch for services rendered to this Government in the three elections held in 1975, 1977 and 1980. Honourable members know that what I am saying is true. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that Ansett Transport Industries operates in the airline business not only as Ansett Airlines of Australia but also as Ansett Airlines of New Souih Wales and MACRobertson Miller. One can go through the various States and see the names under which Ansett Transport Industries operates. The company also owns a number of tourist resorts and touring buses throughout Australia. The Wellington Hotel, which is just down the road from Parliament House, is owned by Ansett Transport Industries. The company deals in interstate bus and freight operations, and it also operates as a furniture removalist. This is all part and parcel of its operation. When Sir Reginal Ansett was Chairman he took the company into television. As a result, we now have a situation where this agreement will have a major effect on all the undertakings in which Ansett Transport Industries is involved. I remind honourable members that Ansett had a very substantial shareholding in Associated Securities Ltd. Ansett employees were encouraged to take out debentures and secured and unsecured notes. Finally ASL folded up after Ansett Transport Industries had been given a guarantee by this Parliament for the borrowing of money from the Exim Bank of the United States of America, thus enabling the company to borrow money at much lower rates of interest than would normally apply and to use the cash flow that the airline industry provides for a company to try to keep ASL alive. Unfortunately, these matters have not been taken into consideration by this Parliament. I believe it is wrong to rush this lation through the Parliament. Consideration should be given to referring the legislation to a parliamentary select committee or to one of the Parliament's legislation committees, rather than pushing it through as we are doing at present. One of the clauses in the Airlines Agreement Bill places us in an intolerable situation. The clause seeks to allow one of the private operators to decide whether Qantas Airways Ltd will be permitted to operate on domestic routes. One of the two operators, Ansett or TAA, can veto Qantas's operations. Do we intend to reverse the position and allow Qantas to veto the operation of Ansett and TAA on the international routes? These matters have not been explained in detail. I am concerned about the Press reports and statements we have received from East-West Airlines. I have great regard and respect for that airline because I think it has done an excellent job. The former Chairman, Don Shand, was a great man in aviation, and I am certain that the Minister for Transport, who is seated at the table, would not dispute that point of view, having lived fairly close to him. I had great respect for Don Shand and the airline he operated, and I have the same respect for the present General Manager, Mr Riley. These people are all concerned about what is happening. Budget Rent-a-Car Systems Pty Ltd, which admittedly is not owned by Bob Ansett but by the Bank of New South Wales, is putting forward the point of view that the agreement should not be passed by the Parliament at this stage without its being given further serious consideration. It is for these reasons that I say there is a need for this legislation to be considered by a select committee or by one of the Parliament's legislation committees. I am surprised at the hide of the signatories to the agreement, but I think I can guess where it came from. It came from Ansett. The name of Sir Reginald Ansett has been maligned, but unfortunately the airline carries his name. He is not the guilty man; the guilty men are Sir Peter Abeles and Murdoch, but the fact is that we still have to refer to the airline as Ansett. I now turn to clause 10 (3) of the Schedule to the Airlines Agreement Bill, which states: The Commonwealth agrees that it will not increase the amount of tax (including customs and excise duties) payable in respect of each litre of aviation fuel in any period of twelve months by a greater amount or rate than the corresponding amount or rate of any increases in tax in that period imposed on motor spirit. It is like the hide of them to require the Australian Parliament to give them that assurance, that is, that the Commonwealth Government will not increase aviation fuel taxation or excise. Does the legis- electorate have any assurance from the Government that it will not increase fuel tax? Does it have any assurance that the Government will not increase income tax? The Government gave the assurance to Ansett. It has tied it to some other remotely related form of taxation in a tax for roads. I will never forget what Harold Holt said back in about 1962 when he was the Treasurer. I asked him a question about fuel tax and he said that petrol was only another commodity that the Parliament reserved the right to tax and that the Parliament should not assent to agreements such as the one to which I have referred namely, the agreement contained in clause 10 (3). That clause should be deleted from the agreement, and I am disappointed to find that the Minister is prepared to agree to such a clause being included in the agreement. I believe that parallel scheduling by the two airlines, Ansett and TAA, is a waste of capacity. Day after day two aeroplanes fly simultaneously between major centres, in many cases with only half the capacity of the aeroplane occupied, where one aeroplane could do the whole job. Unfortunately, this situation applies under the agreement as far as parallel scheduling is concerned. The airlines stick rigidly to the principle. Neither will give an inch. In the limited time available to me I wish to make reference to the Independent Air Fares Committee which it is proposed to set up. The Committee is to 'comprise a part time chairman and tWo part time members. I would like some indiCation from the Minister, if he should reply to the debate, as to whom he is considering for those positions. What sort of people is he looking at? Without mentioning names, of course, the appointment of a judge has been mentioned. If he was a full time judge, he would not receive any special allowance as the Chairman of the Independent Air Fares Committee. I am more interested in establishing who the three people will be. What will be their connection with the aviation industry? I draw the attention of honourable members to the constitutional powers of this Parliament to set up an interstate commission. Legislation to establish such a commission went through the Parliament in October 1975. That legislation has never been proclaimed by this Government. Admittedly, avia-ion was excluded from the amendments which we were forced to accept. Of course, that was all done at that time. Let us be clear and frank about that. It was done because of the pressure that Ansett Transport Industries was able to wield on the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition. At that time the Australian Labor Party, unfortunately, did not have the numbers in the Senate as was later proven on 11 November 1975. We could not get the legislation for the establishment of the interstate commission through in the form we wanted it through. I had to accept the amendments in this House rather than let the amendments be introduced in the other place. The Liberal-National Country Party Opposition at that time, under pressure from Ansett, was successful in forcing us to accept the deletion of any reference to aviation. It would be quite easy for this Government to bring that commission back into being. I believe it would be of great value as far as transport is concerned. Nobody really knows the cost of carrying a tonne of freight, whether it be by road transport or by rail transport. We do have some idea of the cost of a tonne of freight carried by ships because shipping gets very little subsidisation compared with the other two modes of transport. So the Government should be looking at this aspect rather than setting up a separate identity to deal with just one facet of transport, namely, the fares to be charged on the main trunk route operations. I ask the Minister to give some serious consideration to this matter. Once again I think this matter should be referred to a select committee. It is one thing that that committee could have a very good look at. It could also look at providing the means for correctly assessing the rates that will be charged by the airlines. While people are only appointed to part time positions their connections are questionable. Pressures can be applied to them in relation to the fares to be charged. I am not satisfied with the means whereby these people will be appointed. I think it is a matter that should be considered in much greater depth than we have considered it at this time. Having in mind the desires of the House to go into Committee I conclude my remarks. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The BilL",57
108,Mr SHACK,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS," Mr Deputy Chairman, I seek your indulgence. The Committee is determined to consider the Bill as a whole. I have an amendment to clause 2 which has been circulated in my name. It is the first clause that can be amended unless we change the name of the Bill. I have also circulated an amendment to insert a new clause. I submit that my two amendments are consequential upon one another. They do not make sense unless they are put together. They are two sides of the one coin. I seek leave of the Committee to move those two amendments together forthwith. Mr Morris-Leave is not granted. I was on my feet to move the amendments circulated in my name. Leave not granted.",59
109,Mr SHACK,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I seek your guidance, Mr Deputy Chairman. I have circulated an amendment relating to clause 2. As I have said, that is the first clause that can be amended. I move: Clause 2, page 1, line 8, omit sub-clause (2), substitute the following sub-clause: '(2) Section 3 shall come into operation at the expiration of the period of 90 days referred to in sub-clause 2 (3) of the agreement referred to in section 5'. The whole thrust of my contribution to this debate is that the Parliament should provide for an end point to the new airlines agreement. Equally, I believe, it should provide for a definite end point for the existing legislation. As the Bill is drafted at the moment, clause 2 (2) states: Section j shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by Proclamation. Proclamation is an uncertain time. I see it as the role of this Parliament to place a definite end point on when section 3 shall come into operation. Section 3 is, of course, the repeal section of all those Acts which currently give rise to the civil aviation agreements and the airline agreements that bring us to this point. I repeat that clause 2 (2), as presently drafted, states that section 3 shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation. My amendment, if passed, would mean that the repeal clause would come into effect at the expiration of the period of 90 days which is provided for in the agreement. Subclauses 1 (3) (a), (b) and (c) of the Schedule which is, in fact, the agreement, state that the remainder of the agreement shall come into operation on the day of occurrence of the last of the following events: The first event is an Act of the Parliament providing for the establishment of the Independent Air Fares Committee; the second event is the amendments to clause 8 related to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the Airlines Equipment Act; and the third event is the 90-day period which, in everyday speech, is the opt-out clause which is provided for in clause 2 (3) of the Schedule. The new agreement will come into existence after the expiration of 90 days. 1 believe that is also ing agreements should be repealed. That is my purpose in moving the amendment.",59
110,Mr HYDE,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"1 think this is an appropriate time for me to make one point. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) has described the purpose of the amendment. I cannot add to that. This amendment and the one that will be shortly moved by the honourable member for Tangney come at the end of a period of long negotiation, at the end of which substantial agreement has been reached with the Government. During that time those honourable members from this side of the chamber who have sought to achieve a more free enterprise domestic aviation system have had many difficult discussions with the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and with the Government. For the record, in spite of odd disagreements, it ought to be said that the Minister has, at all stages, been courteous, co-operative and frank with us. Had that not been the case, we would not have got through to tonight where there is only one area of disagreement at the end of a long stage of quite difficult negotiations. I, and I think those who have argued with me, appreciate the Minister's co-operation.",60
111,Mr HUNT,OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I would like to thank the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) for his generosity. Unfortunately, the Government cannot support this amendment and the one that will be moved later as they are contingent upon each other. I would like to reserve my remarks until we deal with the next amendment. I just foreshadow that the Government cannot accept either amendment.

112,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I take a point of order. The right to tell in a division belongs with the official Opposition; yet the honourable members for Tangney and Moore, both Government members, have been appointed as tellers from the side on which the Opposition is voting. The honourable member for Tangney is also the mover of the amendment.",61
113,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"In view of the practical difficulty that the honourable member for Tangney is the mover of the amendment and in view of the concern that has been expressed by the Opposition, I now appoint the honourable members for Hughes and Griffith tellers for the ayes. Question so resolved in the negative.",61
114,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"I move the following amendment standing in my name: Page 3, after clause 8, add the following new clause: Cessation of operation of Act '9. (l) This Act, unless sooner repealed, shall cease to be in force at the expiration of 5 years after the date of commencement of this Act. (2) For the purposes terpretation Act 190 I, when this Act ceases to be in force by virtue of sub-section (1), thereupon be deemed to have been repealed by an Act other than this Act.' The purpose of the amendment is to limit the life of the agreement to five years, which is the minimum life under the existing agreement. In the view of the Opposition, the Government has no mandate to extend the life of the agreement, whether by one year to six, three years to eight or five years to ten. It has been revealed in recent times that a secret deal was concluded between the proprietor of Ansett Airlines of Australia, Sir Peter Abeles, and the Government to double the life of the agreement to lO years. That deal was made prior to 17 March last year, the date on which Ansett, with a great deal of fanfare at a national Press conference, announced its decision to purchase its new Boeing fleet. The doubling of the agreement to 10 years was carefully concealed from the Parliament and from the public by the Government, by the Ansett firm and by Sir Peter Abeles, despite the expensive fanfare associated with the announcement of the purchase of the new Boeing fleet. I refer specifically to the speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) made in this House on the last night of the last Parliament. On page 2, he stated: We have now reached a stage where discussions on principles with the airlines have been finalised and drafting of the new agreement is nearly completed. That was the evening of 18 September last year. Some 16 hours later it was announced that the Minister, Ansett Airlines and the Australian National Airlines Commission had sign.ed a new agreement. But it was carefully concealed that the new agreement provided for a doubling of its life to 10 years. I quote also from the Minister's Press release of 19 September last year recording that event. Paragraph 3, in reference to the new two airlines agreement, states: The terms of the new agreement are along the lines of the principles outlined in the second reading speech of the Australian National Airlines Act introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 September 1980. The Minister was careful to make no reference in his speech or in that Press statement to the doubling of the life of the agreement or to the veto power being provided to Ansett to prevent the use of Qantas Airways Ltd capacity in the provision of direct domestic services across Australia. There was a conspiracy of silence to delude this Parliament and to delude the Australian electorate because the Government was then going out on an election campaign. Not one word was uttered, except for a report that appeared in the Australian Financial Review of 22 September. That report referred to a 10·year agreement. It is of section 8 of the Acts Inreported that the Minister refused to confirm the it shall accuracy or otherwise of that lO-year agreement. So he knew there were questions raised about it but he refused to confirm it. He denied that information to Parliament, as did the airline itself. Sir Peter Abeles, his colleagues and this Government have engaged in a conspiracy of silence to deny essential information to the Parliament and to the public. What of the term of 10 years? I quote from no lesser personage than the Secretary to the Department of Transport, the Minister's own top adviser. A few weeks after this deal was done, on 15 April 1980 in an address to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, that gentleman said: In listening to me, you might bear in mind that in a fast changing world a span of 10 years is a long period over which to make predictions. In other words, he was saying it was difficult in planning the transport scene and in developing transport policy to make any kind of firm predictions on that time scale. A five-year period, as proposed in the amendment the Opposition has put to the chamber, would enable reviews of the agreement to be carried out in, say, the third year or the fourth year. It would enable the effectiveness of the new arrangements to be assessed and an assessment of market changes to be made. It would enable Parliament and the government of the day to appraise the features of the new generation short haul aircraft. It would enable the Government and the Department of Transport to evaluate changes in the tourist industry, including changes in demand. It would enable government to determine any desirable changes to the agreement, with public interest being the first consideration. The appropriateness of any further extension of the agreement beyond that date or amendment to the agreement could be made in light of experience and in light of all that information. But the Minister has chosen by his actions, and the airline has chosen by its actions, to deny to the electorate and the people of Australia, in a general election campaign, the knowledge that a secret deal had been done to restrict the provision of air services in this country for a period of 10 years, to the disbenefit of the Australian people. Why was the matter kept secret? It was kept secret because the Fair Internal Air Fares Organisation in Western Australia had proposed to mount a candidate at the Senate election in late 1980. This deal was done in March 1980. I do not know which Government back benchers knew about it. I understand some Government back benchers from Western Australia knew about it but they did not have the courage to tell their constituents, nor did they have the courage to tell the Parliament or the people of what had been consummated between Ansett Airlines and this Government. The principals of the Fair Internal Air Fares campaign disclosed subsequently that they learned of the new term of the agreement some three days prior to the election and they knew that a number of Western Australian back benchers also knew about it. But the campaign committee thought that at that time, so close to the election, there was little point in revealing the information to the public. So we have the reasons for the conspiracy of silence and the participants in it. This legislation has now been brought in. What does Sir Peter Abeles say? On 27 May, having engaged in an exercise to conceal critical information from this Parliament and from the electorate, he then had the temerity to make a statement to the Australian Financial Review. On 27 May its report stated: Sir Peter Abeles said he viewed the five year idea and that Ansett would not have committed itself to its big reequipment program if it had known it was not to have a 10 year term. The Ansett company knew; it had done a deal with the Minister and with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Sir Peter Abeles, in an attempt to pre-empt this Parliament, in an attempt to block the honest men and the men of integrity on the other side who know that this proposal is not right for the Australian people and that it is an attempt to bludgeon them, then had the temerity to claim-",61
115,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"Come on, cut out your remarks about honesty.",62
116,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,What does the pipsqueak opposite want? He will be following the leader for the rest of his life. I know how he will be voting. The little man should not worry.,62
117,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,I'm taller than you.,62
118,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"We will see about that. In this proposal, Sir Peter Abeles and the Government engaged in that conspiracy to pre-empt the decisions of this Parliament and to conceal from the public what they were about. If this amendment is carried, and we invite support from the men of integrity on that side of the chamber, the men who put public interest first, it is the Opposition's intention there will be a review in year three and year four of the five-year term in which we would carry out the kind of analyses and assessments that I have indicated. Recognising that immediate changes cannot be made to existing arrangements because of their complexity, then those changes could be discussed and debated and means established to determine how new equipment could be brought in, how air fare structures could be changed if necessary, and how greater flexibility and better service could be provided to the Australian people. I commend the amendment to the men of integrity opposite who put public interest first.",62
119,Mr SHACK,PAIRS,"1 appreciate being called a man of integrity by the spokesman for the Opposition, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). As a man of integrity, I see it as my responsibility to come into this chamber and vote for things which I believe, if passed, would make good law. It is no secret that outside the chamber there has been long, consistently hard negotiation in arriving at the Government's position on this legislation. Equally, it is no secret that I have argued that the agreement should have a limited life of five years. The process of negotiation in our great party is simply one of give and take. As that negotiation concluded, I very dimly opted for a maximum of eight years, and I will be moving my amendment at the conclusion of the consideration of the Opposition's amendment. I have opted for my amendment rather than the Opposition's amendment for one reason. Even if the Opposition's amendment were passed it would not be good law. What we are considering at the moment is an enabling Bill to give effect to an agreement between three parties, namely, the Commonwealth and the two airlines. There is a weight of legal opinion which concludes that the Parliament is in the position of simply adopting or rejecting that agreement. We are not in a position, however much we may like to be, to amend that contract between the three parties. Clause 22(4) provides for a minimum agreement of eight years. To move for the agreement to have a maximum life of five years flies directly in the face of the agreement. We may not like the agreement, but we are stuck with the legal position. I am interested in seeing that Parliament passes good law. A five year maximum term is not good law. It flies directly in the face of the signed contract tween the three parties. There is legal doubt as to whether the amendment, if passed, would be legal. There is legal doubt as to whether the amendment, if passed, would have any effect on the actual agreement. If the Parliament is to move in the direction in which I have argued it should move, that is, that we provide an end point for this agreement and not allow an infinite run, we should provide an end point which is consistent with the agreement and which has the possibility of being passed not only in this chamber but also in another place. My relationship with the Government on this matter over the last couple of years has simply been to try to improve the situation, to try to achieve something that is achieveable, and to try to achieve something that is constructive, and not be negative and obstructive. I intend to vote against the Opposition's amendment.",62
120,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"The comments of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) sought to give the impression that the legal advice he has in respect of the amendment I have moved is the correct advice. The fact is that the Schedule and the Bill have been very cleverly drafted, and the Minister acknowledges that.",63
121,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"No, I did not.",63
122,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"I thought that the Minister did. The expert legal advice given to me is that the form of the amendment I have moved, given the contents of the Bill and the manner in which the agreement has been drafted and contained in the Schedule, would be effective if carried. It is no good the honourable member trying to hide behind the prop that his advice or the advice to his colleagues is that our amendment would not be good law. The simple fact is that the Government was extremely clever in the manner in which it drafted the legislation. Clause 22 (1) of the agreement provides that the agreement shall continue in force unless and until determined in accordance with its provisions. The Standing Orders prevent the moving of an amendment to a Schedule contained in a Bill. If we consider those facts we recognise something of the cleverness of the Government. As I mentioned earlier, from the beginning this has been a very clever and secret deal. Firstly, the public was denied knowledge of what was happening. The deal had been done. Secondly, the Bill was drafted in such a way as to be amendment-proof. Irrespective of what the honourable member for Tangney has just said, I repeat that the legal advice I have taken from experts similar in standing to those who advised be- the honourable member, is that the amendment in the form we have proposed would be good law and would be effective in terms of the Standing Orders and in terms of the laws of this nation. In conclusion, the five-year period we are pro-. posing is the minimum currency of the existing agreement. Nobody on the Government side, nobody in the airline industry-not even Sir Peter or Mr Murdoch-has said that the five-year notice in the existing agreement is not sufficient time. Not one word has been uttered. There has been general acceptance of that time. All we are asking of honourable members opposite-those men of integrity and those who put public interest first-is that they confirm the policy they have been pursuing for the past five years under existing legislation. If they want to see the Australian tourist industry develop, if they want to see Australians get a better deal in airline services, if they want to see cheaper fares and greater public accountability, and the right of the government of the day to control airline policy, they will support the amendment I have moved.",63
123,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,1 oppose the Opposition's amendment. I think the point that is being overlooked in this argument is that the airlines already have an agreement which entitles them to five years' notice to pass both Houses of Parliament.,63
124,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,And a much more restrictive agreement.,63
125,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Of course. That is a fact that I am quite able to put to the House. I am on my feet to point out that the agreement the airlines currently enjoy is much more beneficial to them, and in fact includes such things as freight arrangements in respect of Tasmania and so on. If they were to have a term of five years to nothing, they would naturally accept the present agreement. If we pass a five-year term, it comes down to a situation of the airlines obviously saying: 'Thanks for nothing; we will take a five years' notice, if you can get it through both Houses of Parliament. If you cannot get it through both Houses of Parliament we are very grateful because we will continue as we are today.' As the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) mentioned, that is a far more attractive situation to them. We have to accept the practicalities of this ation. We can argue the law until three o'clock in the morning. The fact is that the airlines will not take a five-year term and the new agreement. They do not have to. They have an agreement and they will obviously take five years under the old agreement. I certainly would if I were in their shoes. Another thing should be put to rest at this stage of the game. I think honourable members on this side of the House know that there has been talk about all sorts of funny business and deals. That is not the case. There is no doubt whatsoever that the airlines were entitled to an understanding that things were to continue as they had for the previous 20 years. Statements made by this Government before the election clearly indicated that that was the case. That it was not the opinion of some of us in this place has now been made quite clear. Let us get things straight. We are not talking about that; we just think that we would like to put the Government in a better position by making this agreement finite. Anybody who believes that he can talk the airlines into dropping the situation they have today for a new agreement of five years' notice would not have had much experience in business.",63
126,Mrs DARLING,PAIRS,"I am amazed by the differentiation made by Government members as to what this chamber can and cannot do. When, with five minutes' notice, this Parliament wishes to grant substantiation to a loan to enable Ansett Airlines of Australia to buy Boeings we have all the power in the world, but on something as sensible as restricting the time limitation for an agreement such as this for the benefit of the Australian people it appears that we are entirely powerless. This agreement as it stands has set the course of this nation's domestic aviation policy for the next five to eight years. We are locked in. The next Parliament, the subsequent Parliament and probably even the Parliament after that will be unable to debate this legislative foundation for the country's domestic aviation policy. Unless the Opposition's amendment is carried, this will be the last opportunity for another eight years to deliberate on the agreement. The Government has introduced this historic legislation and is rushing it through both houses in the shortest time possible. After months of prevarication it is ramming the agreement down our throats without countenancing the most mild and modest protestations even from its own side of the chamber. It is regrettable that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) did not make his announcement to establish an inquiry into whether deregulation of situ- the airline industry was a desirable long term objective four or five years ago. If he had done so by now we could be debating the results of that inquiry. Of course, that is too much to expect of a government that insists on moving in such a short sighted way. My colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) has stated publicly that the Opposition would support the establishment of such an inquiry if it were to be public; if it were to receive the full support and access to the resources of the Department of Transport; if its task were to be completed within a reasonable period, preferably a year; and if the inquiry were given the power to require the airlines to present all relevant information. Instead, until tonight the announcement of this inquiry is all that the Government's airline rebels have to show for all their public utterances. The eyes of the Australian public will tonight be on those back benchers who have moved a certain extent and shown their concern. I hope that they will move even further to limit the life of the agreement to five years. The Opposition has already expressed grave concern over the main points contained in the agreement. The first is that the new agreement will give Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines the right to control routes which they do not at present even operate, such as between Sydney and Hobart. It seems that this and other provisions of the agreement are designed to deal with EastWest Airlines Ltd. Secondly, the agreement allows TAA the right to withdraw from routes where it is at present sustaining heavy losses. Of course, this is of intense interest to Queenslanders, particularly those in the more remote corners of that state.",64
127,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS," I am sorry to butt in on the honourable member, but I am having precisely the same trouble as I had last night. The clause is a limited one. This is not a general second reading debate. If I let the honourable member continue in this line I will have to open up the debate for others, which I am not prepared to do. I ask the honourable member to confine her remarks to the amendment under consideration.",64
128,Mrs DARLING,PAIRS,"It is rather awkward to debate even a narrow clause without bringing in some relevant information. I believe the information I am giving is relevant. Mr Ian RobinsonYou could be wrong, couldn't you?",64
129,Mrs DARLING,PAIRS,"I could be wrong. I hope anyone would admit that he or she could be wrong. The Holcroft report established that TAA was losing about $l1m a year on Fokker Friendship services. The possibility of withdrawing from these services and the unprofitable air corridors, along with the decision to sell TAA and thereby elevate the profit motive as TAA's primary, if not sole, priority, will surely mean the end of these services. We must move to limit the time before such a move takes place. TAA's submission to the Holcroft inquiry stated: A reasonable profit is only a minor component of the price of air travel. This is not a cavalier approach to the responsibilities of running a national public airline. Quite the reverse . . . The airline must maintain its productive capacity in real terms and provide for necessary expansion manded by growth in the community's needs for air transport services. This is a true reflection of the responsibilities of a nl;ltional publicly owned transport company. Ansett, on the other hand, made it clear that it exists to make money and run at a profit.",65
130,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will resume her seat.,65
131,Mr TAMBLING,PAIRS,"I am not impressed by the comments of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). In fact, I am rather fearful that he is playing at being the devil's advocate on this issue. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) has already said that the intent of the amendment of the honourable member for Shortland is very destructive and probably legally questionable with regard to the specific relationship between the agreement itself and this enabling legislation. My only hangup with the legislation relates to the timing clause, but I cannot support the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Shortland. The development of this legislation embraces very significant changes and advances in airline policy. There are total links both with the Independent Air Fares Committee and with the proposed deregulation inquiry. It is important to stress that the deregulation inquiry is to report within five years. That period of five years has an integral link with the proposed term of the agreement. The shortest term under which the agreement contemplates notice being given is eight years, that is, the initial five years and the three years of giving notice. That can be done and can be adequate. I also believe the honourable member for Shortland is inconsistent with his own Party's policies and platforms on this issue. I refer to the decisions made and the platform that was developed by the Australian Labor Party at its Adelaide conference. They indicate that the honourable member is not being genuine. On transport the ALP said: Transport systems and services should not be solely determined by market forces but should be designed to maximise social benefit to the community.",65
132,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I take a point of order. If the honourable member for Lilley was ruled out of order on the propositions she was putting forward, surely the honourable member for the Northern Territory is out of order on the grounds of his arguments at this stage. He is not addressing himself to the question before the deCommittee which relates to the five-year expiration date of the agreement. He is talking generally about the Labor Party's transport policy.",65
133,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"The honourable member's point is sustained, but it was only in the last few sentences that the honouraBle member got away from the point.",65
134,Mr TAMBLING,PAIRS,"The sensitivity of Opposition members is obvious when one refers to their own paper work. I will refrain from quoting from the document on the Opposition's economic policy. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), in his own comments in the second reading debate, was also, I am sure, playing political football with his own State. He was merely trying to take the mickey out of the Western Australian members on this side of the chamber who have worked in conjunction with the Minister for Transport (Mf Hunt) to develop a strong and positive policy.",65
135,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,The honourable member will not refer to a second reading debate that has taken place today.,65
136,Mr HYDE,PAIRS,"1 also will not be supporting this amendment. T will in due course be supporting the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). My reason is that I was advised some days ago that what we sought to achieve in a five-year sunset provision, which I agree would be desirable, was not achievable in law. It was my judgment that it was not achievable in Parliament. 1 agreed at that stage-I hoped at the time that 1 could do so-to reach an accommodation with the Government to settle for eight years. I will abide by that agreement.",65
137,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"Newcastle) (8.59)We are debating a clause dealing with the endorsement of the agreement, the signatures to which are R. J. Hunt, Law-Smith, Fitzgerald, Abeles and Simpson. I hope honourable members will pardon the deletion of the initials.",65
138,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,The honourable member is debating an amendment.,66
139,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"We are debating an amendment. Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman, for your assistance. Whilst we are dealing with an amendment to insert a new clause 9 in the Bill, in actual fact we are talking about clause 22 (1), (2), (3) and (4) of the Schedule to the Bill, that is the agreement. The question is whether we can legally overrule that agreement. I see the Minister's signature on the agreement as speaking on behalf of the Parliament. To this date, to the best of my knowledge, the Parliament has not authorised the Minister to sign the agreement. The agreement is not law. Those words are not worth the piece of paper they are written on until such time as this Parliament passes the Bill. That is when the agreement will come into being. If those honourable members who voted against the second reading reconsider their position I am confident they will see as preferable a five-year agreement and the negotiation of a new agreement in the run-up period to the end of the five years. I suggest that those honourable members may give the matter some second thought and carry the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). That will give us a terminating agreement. Believe you me, there is no way that honourable members could ever convince me that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd will not accept such an agreement. I notice that Sir Peter Abeles spoke up and said: 'There is no way we will accept any amendment of this agreement'. Good God, I have seen enough of Sir Peter Abeles's industrial agreements to know the trade unions twist him around their little fingers. He does not give a damn what the unions get so long as he can get a buck and so long as he can up the price of everything that he is selling in the form of freight. Sir Peter Abeles is a great old bluffer. He has bluffed this Parliament out of a five-year sunset agreement. If Government members have the intestinal fortitude to give it a go we in the Opposition will give it a go too and make it a five-year terminating agreement. It is ridiculous that the present two-airline agreement has a five-year period and then five years notice of termination. AlII can say is that in another two years and one month the five years notice of termination will be included. This Government should have the intestinal fortitude to do what a Labor Government would do and terminate the agreement, forcing the parties to come to the negotiating table to work out some sort of agreement acceptable to them and to the Parliament. The agreement is not worth anything unless the Parliament passes this Bill. Therefore, I say to those honourable members who I know are in favour of the five-year agreement to give it a go and let us see where we get to. That is the situation. I ask honourable members to give it serious consideration.",66

(1) This Act, unless sooner repealed, shall cease (2) For the purposes of section 8 of the Acts InIn the second reading debate I spoke about the amendment to some extent. Suffice is to say that if the amendment were agreed to it would see the insertion of a new clause 9. I believe this to be a legally responsible amendment. It complements the agreement in that the minimum eight years as provided for in the agreement would, under this amendment, become a maximum of eight years. It coincides with the timing of the deregulation inquiry in that the Government has announced that the inquiry will report within five years. The Government of the day will then be in a position to give notice after five years and consideration of the findings of the deregulation inquiry. If the Government chose to go down the deregulatory path there would be a three-year transitionary period, after which time the agreement in to to would expire at the end of eight years.",66
141,Mr MORRIS,NOES,"The amendment moved by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) is in the view of the Opposition a second best proposition. It suffers from the same doubts, on legal advice, as did the amendment that 1 moved on behalf of the Opposition. It is not correct to say that this amendment would be effective and that the other one would not have been. As I said, we regard it as second best. The Opposition will be supporting the amendment.",67
142,Mr HYDE,NOES,"I wish to make only one point; namely, that 1 do not believe the NOES amendment suffers from the same legal doubts. The eight years were guaranteed to the companies under the agreement that they had signed. There is opportunity for the government of the day to fill that agreement to the letter with the acceptance of this amendment moved by the honourable Tbomson, D. S. Tuckey, C. W. member for Tangney (Mr Shack). This would not have been possible with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), NA Drummond, P. H. MCMahon, Sir William",67
143,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"The Government rejects the amendment. The Government has resolved to establish an independent inquiry into the advisability or otherwise of deregulation. This committee of inquiry is to report within five years. If the committee should report in favour of deregulation and the government of the day resolves to adopt those recommendations the government would have the to be ill force at the expiration of 8 years after the day on which the agreement referred to in opportunity of serving notice, at the end of five section 5 comes into force and effect. years of operation of the agreement, to terminate that agreement three years later. This would terpretation Act 1901, when this Act ceases to enable an orderly transition from a regulated be in force by virtue of sub-section (1), it shall thereupon be deemed to have been repealed two airlines arrangement to a deregulated by an Act other than this Act. '. environment. There is no doubt that at least three years would be required to enable the Government and the airlines to make the necessary infrastructure arrangements at airports and elsewhere to implement a deregulated system. It would enable airlines and other interested groups to gear themselves up to take advantage of a deregulated system. On the other hand, the sunset clause in the agreement would terminate the agreement at eight years regardless of the report of the inquiry. It could well result in the government of the day, say a Labor government, not exercising its right to give notice to terminate the agreement, thus leaving the airline industry in considerable uncertainty until the airline agreement concludes at the end of eight years. Such an agreement would result in aviation policy being dropped into a vacuum at the end of eight years. Such a policy would lead to a chaotic situation and could well result in the ultimate nationalisation of the airlines system which is clearly the objective of the Opposition. I believe the difference between the Government's approach and the approach involved in the amendment is the difference between order and chaos. This amendment would not be in the best interests of the travelling public. In view of the decisions taken by the Government, and leaving aside the Airlines Agreement Bill before the chamber but including the decisions relating to Trans-Australia Airlines and the decisions to establish an inquiry into deregulation, it is doubtedly a logical and rational approach to port a five-year agreement with a provision three years notice to terminate the agreement following any decision that a future government might take resulting from the deregulation inquiry. Moreover, the legal advice I have obtained from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is that if the amendment were accepted by the of Government, or, carried by the Parliament, the Airlines Agreements Act and the agreement itself would be thrown into doubt and confusion. It would, therefore, be ridiculous for the Parliafive-year ment to accept those circumstances. I am advised that the amendment would also have the effect repealing the Customs prohibited import reguing lations thus destroying the basis of the twoprejudice airlines policy. The Government, therefore, not accept such a proposition or the amendment.",67
144,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"1 support the amendment that was moved by member for Tangney (Mr Shack). In doing so I make a couple of points about it. The Minister Transport (Mr Hunt) has waxed moral on the issue of the chaos that the airlines would be thrown into if this amendment were passed. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), however, they made quite clear over the weekend what the inlook tentions of the Government were with the Schedpreviously. ule and the way in which the Government devised the Schedule, with particular relation to this eight-year clause. He pointed out that the purpose of the legislation, and particularly this clause, to make it Labor election proof. In other words, the purpose of the Government was not orderly airline policy. The purpose of the Government was, by whatever means possible, to frustrate Australian Labor Party eight years in advance. think that is a disgraceful position to be presenting to the Australian public, even if it was disclosed a closed session of the Liberal Party sequently leaked. If that is the Government's motive it deserves all that it gets on this item. I do not believe that the advice of the Attorney General (Senator Durack) is any more valid than the advice that has been given by the various legal sources of both the honourable member for Tangney and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). If the advice of the Attorney General turns out to be correct, it will be correct because of the way in which the Government has gone about negotiating the agreement. Its intentions are to frustrate the capacity of the Parliament to operate in a normal way when dealing with an agreement such as this. But it will not Adermann, A. E. happen because the legal advice that we have Anthony, J. D. unreceived, which is the same legal advice that the suphonourable member for Tangney has received, is for good and therefore, the amendment should pass.",68
145,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"1 will be brief. There are many great advantages in what is being proposed by the Government. Whilst J understand the attractions of the proposition put by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) I am afraid that 1 disagree with the thrust what he is doing in light of the pressure of time both and the circumstances. There has been much gained. He admitted this in his speech at the second reading stage. The proposal that there be a period plus a three-year notice period, as the honourable member has moved, would tend to of deny the opportunity for open discussion concernthe setting of air fares. It would also tend to the deregulation inquiry. The full evalucanation of the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, I believe, would also be put in jeopardy if this amendment the honourable were to be carried. I say to my colleagues who tend to support this for amendment that, as Shane Paltridge did, we have broken new ground in the airline system in Australia today. I think that we have put in place a proposition that will allow all people, whether live in the east or the west of this country, to forward to opportunities they have not had If those opportunities were denied to them, as indeed the Opposition would deny them, it would be a great shame. I indicate in passing that the Opposition completely opposed the idea was of differential equipment and the opportunity of breaking up the tight and tied system. The Opposition has spoken against it and has opposed that proposition. We on this side of the chamber have the moved forward to advantage the people of I Australia. J think that from this point we can see advance, and there will be opportunities for at further advance. It would be a great shame if and was subthose opportunities were lost.",68

147,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,"1 want to speak against clause 12 of the Schedule to the Bill. As we understand the two-airline agree53 ment, it is finished. Trans-Australia Airlines no 56 longer acts as a service airline. We object to clause 12 very violently because we believe the 3 Government-",69
148,Mrs KELLY,PAIRS,Who is 'we'?,70
149,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,"Mr Katter and I. That is enough. How many do you want? Bob Katter, the honourable member for Kennedy, and I object to clause 12. Two is enough. The basic reason fIJr our objection is that the Government has set out to do away with services to western Queensland and the rest of rural Australia. It is important for members of this chamber to remember this. The Holcroft report recommended that a fares tribunal be established to finance Ansett Airlines of Australia's continuing profits. It also recommended that the Government look at assisting some of the inland air routes of Australia. Nothing in clause 12 guarantees this will happen. Clause 12(2) states: That in the event that the total direct and indirect operating a rural airline service during a continuous period of net less than 6 months commencing after the date of commencement of this clause exceed the total revenue from that service in respect of that period, the Commission or the Company, as the case may be, which operates the service (in this clause called ""the operator"") may give to the Commonwealth notice that it will cease expiration of 3 months after the giving of the notice. I ask the Government: What happens if another operator does not want to take that air service We object to that clause. No longer do we in our part of Australia have an essential service. Qantas Airways Ltd was established in my electorate the electorate of the honourable member for Kennedy. No longer does Qantas fly world. TAA has supplied some sort of service until now. We expect the Government to allow this to continue. The air service in this part of world is an essential service. How can Canberra get $lOm to keep its buses running and Brisbane get $20m to keep its buses running? Railways in Queensland run at a $ 100m loss. denied a service in Western Queensland. Mr Leo MCLeay-Well, come over on this took side.",70
150,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,I might. This is the point I am trying to get across. Mr Leo MCLeay-We might not have you.,70
151,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,Shut up and listen. Mr Leo MCLeay-You're just not a good enough socialist.,70
152,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,Honourable members agreed opposite would not know how far it is from one end of the electorate of Maranoa to the other.,70
153,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Maranoa will address his remarks to the Chair and not to the rest of the chamber. This might discourage honourable members from interjecting, which is disorderly.",70
154,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I am sure you would have some idea of the distances involved and the fact that aeroplanes are absolutely essential in this part of the world. I point out to honourable members that it is 1,600 kilometres from Kikoy to Birdsville. The distance to Tasmania-I do not particularly want to fiy there-is approximately the same. That is what honourable members must understand. Air services are absolutely essential in this part of the world. Mr Leo MCLeay-When are you going to build an airport at Quilpie?",70
155,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,"I am working on that. Do not worry about that. Enough people go to the races at Birdsville to put in a jet strip. The withcosts of drawal of mail services is also envisaged in this package. 1 think that is terrible. That service will be given to private contractors. That means that those people in that part of the world will get no services at all. There will be no plane services and no mail services.

159,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,It is not for the Chair to give that information to the honourable member. Mr Charles Jones-I noticed earlier-,70
160,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. The question before the Committee is that the Bill be to. As I understand the situation, therefore, the honourable member is perfectly entitled to speak if he has described to the chamber already the clause that he is debating. Mr Charles Jones-Are you sure you are not debating clause 12 of the Schedule to the Bill?",70
161,Mr IAN CAMERON,PAIRS,"I am debating clause 12 and a few other clauses. It is enough that TAA will be granted a $500m backing by the Federal Government. I believe that that subsidy alone is sufficient for the two airlines to operate in this country. I believe the agreement should be 10 years, being tied to the term of the loan. I cannot understand either side of the chamber wanting to give the agreement a term different from the terms of the loan. The 90-day clauses are a disgrace to anyone's way of thinking. I put it to the Committee that we are here to govern, not Ansett. It is a great weakness of our political system that unfortunately the party system rules here tonight. I have said enough on this matter and now give way to my friend, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter).",70
162,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,-I am sorry to spoil the unholy alliance but I call the honourable member for Lilley.,71
163,Mrs DARLING,PAIRS,"Briefly, I would like to support what the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) has just said. I share his concern regarding clause 12. In Queensland it could force Bush Pilots Airways out of business. The Airlines Equipment Amendment Bill gives the Minister sole power to determine the number of future aircraft and flights to be operated by every airline. This number having been arbitrarily decided, the airline is not permitted to operate additional flights if passenger demand suddenly increases. This clause relates to airlines being forced out of a service. If larger lines decide to opt out of servicing country routes-as the agreement allows them to do if they find them unprofitable-it is reasonable to assume that passenger demand for an airline such as Bush Pilots Airways will increase. Under this agreement Bush Pilots Airways will be locked in. It would be compelled to refuse the business under threat of heavy penalties, if Ansett Airlines of Australia or Trans-Australia Airlines should withdraw and Bush Pilots Airways have to meet that demand. Mr Bradfield-That is not right.",71
164,Mrs DARLING,PAIRS,"That is right. Under the agreement, Bush Pilots Airways will be locked in. n will be compelled to refuse business under threat of heavy penalties, according to this agreement, once a certain number of flights is agreed upon. I do not know whether the honourable member realises this. The same ludicrous situation will occur if demand drops. It may be required by this legislation to operate, as near as is practicable, a set number of approved flights despite the drop in demand. It could even be obliged to run empty flights to satisfy the needs of the agreement. This situation could definitely crop up in Queensland if clause 12 is agreed to. The larger airlines, if they find it unprofitable, coud drop those routes. They would not be serviced. Bush Pilots Airways will have to pick up those routes and start servicing them and then it will be locked in by this agreement. It is a ludicrous situation which will be very bad for Queensland. I recommend to honourable members that they consider the points which have been put forward. This clause should be dropped from the agreement to the benefit not only of Queensland but also of other areas. If honourable 'members opposite are really concerned about free enterprise they will move in this area and stop the squashing of free enterprise. At present they are only boosting big monopolies, be they private or public enterprise, to the detriment of small airlines. It is up to honourable members opposite to show where they stand and support their colleagues and my neighbours from Queensland.",71
165,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"I am particularly concerned with clause 12. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mf Ian Call1eron) and I are concerned about those people who sustain industries that bring many billions of dollars into this country. Particularly vital to them is just how often an aircraft flies into their remote areas, the sort of aircraft that flies in and what they will be charged for those services. The difficulty with clause 12 is that if an airline is not showing a profit air- over a period of six months it can withdraw from the service after a further period of three months. We just did not sit back and accept this. There has been a series of long discussions-- .",71
166,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,We have had meetings.,71
167,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"We have had meetings. On Monday the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) convened a meeting which was attended by Frank Ball, the Australian General Manager of Trans-Australia Airlines, Frank Pascoe, one of the senior officials of Ansett Airlines of Australia, the honourable member for Maranoa, my-elf, and a few others. The crux of that discussion was our understanding that Ansett and TAA have a unique privilege. They have the sole rights to run on the major routes in Australia. I well remember it being said some time ago by the then Minister for Civil Aviation that if those airlines were to continue to have that protection and that sort of privilege they were expected to serve the rural air routes. The Holcroft report has been adopted and we have to try to make the best of it. As a result of very lengthy discussions on Monday the General Manager of TAA issued the following statement which I very much want to go in the record: 1. TAA will honour its undertaking with the Queensland Government to maintain F27s now operating until April 1982 or in accordance with the provisions agreement, whichever is the later. The second point he made was in the following terms: Before that time TAA will: (a) Negotiate with Bush conduct commuter operations over routes which TAA can no longer economically ance with IAFC guidelines; (b) Assess the viability of the establishmentThis is a very important point which came as a result of some pretty hot argument on Monday afternoonof regional centres serviced by commuters radiating from those regional centres with F27 services operated by TAA. Finally, he stated: The Government will continue to assist in negotiations tween TAA and other operators, including Bush Pilots and East-West, to ensure that air services in western Queensland are maintained at a satisfactory level. The point J want to make is one on which we will have to stand firm. I do not know what muscle we will have when it comes to a final showdown. In my part of Queensland we are sustaining three industries that bring billions of dollars into this country. We did not tell God to put all the minerals 400, 500 or 600 miles away from the coast. We did not tell God to give sheep foot rot. I notice that a lot of honourable members opposite do not believe in God. They should make their own arplay rangements and deal with their bloke, but I will deal with my fellow. We did not ask that sheep along the coast get foot-rot. We did not ask that lousy pastures be put along the coastal areas for us to have the great trace metal areas out the back blocks. This is no joke, although it might be a joke to honourable members opposite. These great industries are many hundreds of miles from the coast. If we do not have damned airline vices, what do we have? Whitlam came along and dragged away every subsidy we had. He kicked in the guts and brought us to our knees out there. That is the sort of thing we had to take. He did give a damn about anyone out there.",71

169,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! There is no point of order. I understand that the honourable member for Kennedy is addressing clause 12.,72
170,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"So, the rot set in. We saw the gulf services go and we saw the channel services go. Then came a challenge. We were told our F27 aircraft would be taken away and that Metroliner aircraft would be put on. With the permission of of the new two-airline the Deputy Whip, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), I would like to put his description of that aircraft before the chamber. Perhaps I had better not. It is a splendid aircraft for short runs, perhaps up to an hour or an hour and a half. But to fly for four and a half hours in a rigid Pilots and other operators to seat with no hostess, with no facilities operate in accord- whatsoever-Honourable members inte1jecting",72
171,Mr KATTER,PAIRS,"I apologise for the connotation. We have achieved something because we have had these discussions and we have the undertaking from the manager of TAA. But, over and above that, we have established a monitoring committee, consisting of those who are present beplus the Australian general manager of TAA plus one of the senior executives of Ansett Airlines, Frank Pascoe. The object of the establishment of that committee was to monitor what would happen to those airlines over the next five, six or 12 months. I can assure the chamber-1 will be in constant touch with the Minister on this matterthat we will not stand idly by and see the frequency or the standard of our aircraft services reduced. That is why we are concerned about clause 12.",72
172,Mr DAWKINS,PAIRS,"One can only admire the spirited and uncharacteristic disof independence on the part of the National Country Party. It is regrettable that it all comes too late and there is nothing anyone can do about the situation. If members of the National Country and Party are really concerned about the airlines in agreement which tonight is being ratified by this Parliament, they should have, at the very minimum, voted for the last amendment proposed. They have voted for an agreement which can go seron for ever and ever. If they were concerned about any aspect of the clauses in the Schedule us they would have-had they known what they were doing, presumably they would have-voted not to give a limited life to this agreement. They would have voted to provide for the circumstances in which the Parliament would have had enter into deliberately and ratify another agreeat the expiry of this current agreement into the eight years time. The votes of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) would have been enough to turn this question around, to rewrite aviation history in this country not only for people in the metropolitan areas but also for people who those honourable members purport to represent. They are nothing but phoneys or dopes because the whole point is that in advance of eight years time they and the rest of us would have had the opportunity to rewrite the agreement. But they have given this Government, or any government, and more particularly the airlines, an agreement with an infinite life. Unless a parliament or government at some later time takes the initiative to rewrite this agreement it will go on forever and the aspects of clause 12 with which the honourable members disagree can go on not only for their lifetime but for their children's lifetime and children's children's lifetime. The problem with them is that they do not even understand what they are doing. The honourable member for Maranoa said he would call for a division. What on earth will he call for a division on? Mr Ian Cameron- Mr Chairman, I have not mentioned a division.",72
173,Mr DAWKINS,PAIRS,"The honourable member has just denied it, but earlier he said he would call a division. There is nothing to call for a division on. We have just discussed the eight clauses of the Airlines Agreement Bill. It might be of enlightenment to the honourable member for Maranoa to know that he is not free to meddle with the clauses of the Schedule; he either had to take the opportunity offered to him a moment ago to vote for giving this agreement a definite life, or do nothing. It is a great shame that his spirited display of independence was not a little more in evidence just a few moments ago. I repeat that he and the honourable member for Kennedy had the opportunity to rewrite aviation history in this country but they displayed their arrant gutlessness in not defying their Government and taking that course of action. We are used to slick justifications from the National Country Party. A moment ago the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), in his explanation of the reasons we could not have an eight-year term, said we have a committee that needs five years to report. I remind people of the situation a few months ago when we had another inquiry, the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, which was supposed to have a year to report and yet all of a sudden the urgency of the matter, the requirement to prevent chaos in the airline industry, required that that inquiry should report within five months; should terminate its inquiry in order for the Government to carry out certain undertakings that it gave before the election to its powerful friends in the airline industry. We are used to these slick justifications. No more than five months was necessary before the election; now we need five years for an inquiry into whether there should be deregulation. I wish to tell members of the National Country Party another thing. Tonight they have crunched headlong into the movement in the Liberal Party which supports small government and deregulation. They have just woken up for the first time that there are some dangers and problems invol ved in deregulation. If we go flying straight into deregulation some people are bound to miss out. I just ask you-Mr Katter- Mr Chairman, I raise a point of their order. The honourable member for Fremantle is directing his remarks at me. I find them completely insulting. I would not vote with him if I were dying in the middle of the Nullarbor Plain.",73
174,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Kennedy will resume his seat. I remind the honourable member for Fremantle to address his remarks through the Chair.,73
175,Mr DAWKINS,PAIRS,"The honourable member is for prepared to do anything for his constituents except vote in their interests. He would not move away from the Government benches for anything in the world. His constituents have to realise, once and for all, that he will not take any action which advances their interests if it means deserting the Government which he has supported in such a cherished fashion for so long. There are some problems in deregulation. I ask honourable members to contemplate this: If the National Country Party is up in arms about the horrors, the portents, of deregulation, what are the chances of this inquiry likely to be?

The present dilemma that faces the Government is a result of its own disarray, its own inability to get its act together, and its own inability to prepare legislation. As we approach the final days of the autumn session even its own members are rebelling against an extension of sitting hours. Yesterday's proceedings concluded at 2.20 this morning. Today some most important and critical legislation before the Parliament has been jammed through the House, and other important legislation is to follow. This is not the way to run a country, it is not the way to run a parliament, and it is certainly not the way to manage the affairs of this nation. Mr Sainsbury-Don't be so self-righteous.",74

186,Mr MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Mr Speaker, far be it from me not to want to address my remarks to you. I was making the point that this is the Government's problem. It is a matter of rearranging the ordinary sitting times of the Parliament and, if necessary, sitting further into this month.

The only good thing to come out of the Labor Administration and the Whitlam years was the 11 o'clock rule.

190,Mr SPEAKER,PROPOSED SITTING HOURS,"I wish to indicate to honourable members that ballot papers have been circulated which ask a question about sitting hours. The closing time for the ballot I had announced to be 10 p.m., but it seems that there have been events in the chamber this evening that have diverted the attention of a number of members. I therefore propose to extend the closing time of the ballot until noon tomorrow. NA COMMITTEE BILL 1981 Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by MrHunt: That the Bill be now read a second time.",75
191,Mr MORRIS,INDEPENDENT AIR FARES,"The remarks I made earlier in the second reading debate on the Airlines Agreement Bill were pertinent to this Bill. I simply move: That all words after 'That' tuting the following words: 'the House is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient that it does not provide for(1) cost allocation reviews on a sufficiently comprehensive and frequent basis; (2) the involvement of the public, including consumers' representatives, in the review process, and (3) recognition of the profitability of the major in the conduct of reviews by the Committee'.",75
192,Mr SPEAKER,INDEPENDENT AIR FARES,"Is the amendment seconded? NOES Mr Charles Jones-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak at a later stage. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 and 2-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 3 (Interpretation).",75
193,Mrs KELLY,INDEPENDENT AIR FARES,"I wish to speak in opposition to clause 3 sub-clauses (5) and (6) on behalf of the Opposition. These subclauses illustrate that this whole package of legislation is framed on the basis of backing up and supporting Ansett Airlines of Australia. In faCt, one could be forgiven for thinking Ansett's own PAIRS legal people had drafted this legislation. That is so clearly illustrated in these two special sub-clauses. I will go into them in some detail. They highlight the totally hypocritical approach of this Government. On the one hand the Government parties say that they are the parties of free enterprise and that they like market forces to operate. Yet when it comes to airline policy the situation is totally different. These sub-clauses act as a deterrent to East-West Airlines Ltd, in particular, and any third airline operating fairly in the market place. I will highlight that claim in my discussion on these two sub-clauses. First of all, I think the existing fare structure operating in Australia is to the detriment of consumers in Australia, that is, the users of air services in Australia. They have not been taken into consideration at all in the drafting of this legislation. The situation for my constituents in Canberra is one example. Recently Second Reading we had an increase of 37 per cent in the fare for the leg between Canberra and Sydney. That is absolutely appalling when one considers that we have a degree of isolation in Canberra.",75
194,Unknown,INDEPENDENT AIR FARES,Government members interjecting,75
195,Mrs KELLY,INDEPENDENT AIR FARES,"How do you get here if you do not come in on aeroplanes? I do not see you driving, walking or hitchhiking. This rapid increase in be omitted with a view to substiair fares-37 per cent for my constituents· in Canberra-has had a very detrimental effect on in the tourist industry. It will continue to do so. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) nods his head. What is he prepared to do? Will he vote with me on this matter? This legislation should give a third airline the opportunity of proairlines viding for my constituents in the Australian Capital Territory a cheaper air fare. That is why I am opposing these twosub-c1auses today. Twill illustrate a point to honourable members. When the air fare increase was announced a further airline put a submission to the Department of Transport outlining a proposition to provide an air fare cheaper by $10 each way than the existing Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines fare. That was the proposal. The operators claim they can do that with the F27 and a one class service. The legislation before us today will work to inhibit their doing that and providing this fairer tem for my constituents in the Australian Capital Territory and others like them throughout Australia. I want to confine my comments specifically to sub-clauses (5) and (6) of clause 3. The effect of clause 3 (5) is that any air fare proposed by an operator other than Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia for a trunk route shall not be an economy fare or first class fare for the purpose of the Bill. The consequence is that no operator other than TAA or Ansett has a right to have its trunk route fares reviewed under clause 15, the major air fare review clause, or clause 16, the minor air fare review clause. Such operators can have their trunk route fares reviewed only if the Committee of its own motion decides to conduct a review under clause 15 (2). The opportunity for a minor air fare review is removed. This follows from the definition in clause 3 (5) of economy fare and the fact that clause 15 and clause 16 refer only to economy fares. Under clause 3 (6) any trunk route fare of an operator other than TAA or Ansett which is not the same as the TAA or Ansett fare is treated as a discount fare. The consequence is that unless the other operator charges the same fares as TAA or Ansett approved fares the operator then must satisfy the Committee. Such an operator has to prove, firstly, that the proposed fare is likely to increase the operator's profitability; secondly, that the proposed fare is unlikely to result in the economy fares of any operator over trunk routes being increased; and thirdly, that the conditions are reasonable and not discriminatory between persons who comply with the conditions in clause 17 (4). Although on the face of it these criteria may seem reasonable, legal advice which I have had, and which I know has been available to other of the minor operators in Australia, is to the effect that it would be unreasonably difficult for an operator to satisfy the Committee on the first two requirements. The requirements of clause 17 (4) are unduly onerous in their application to discount fares. They are even more unreasonable and unnecessary for regional airline trunk route fares. All trunk route fares should be assessed on the same basis as TAA and Ansett fares under clause 15 (ll) and clause 16 (8). These clauses provide TAA and Ansett with more than adequate protection. This Bill can be amended easily by the deletion of clause 3 (5) and clause 3 (6). I wish that more National Country Party members were in the chamber to hear this because they are the people who should be voting with the Opposition on this amendment. This amendment will have the effect sys- that the trunk route fares of regional operators such as East-West Airlines and Bush Pilot Airways are considered on a proper basis. All that the Opposition is asking for is that such operators get a fair go. If this Government really believes in supporting private enterprise and free market forces it should give those operators a chance.",75
196,Mr MORRIS,INDEPENDENT AIR FARES," Mr Chairman, it is the intent of the Opposition to oppose the inclusion of sub-clauses (5) and (6) of clause 3. I have just been discussing the matter with the Clerk and it appears that because of the haste with which we are considering these amendments and because of the pressure since last evening we have not prepared written notice of that intention. Could notice be prepared to enabk that process to be followed?",76

199,Mr MORRIS,AYES,"Clause 4 prescribes the constitution of the Independent Air Fares Committee. It is to be made up of three members. Amendment No.1 standing in my name reads: Clause 4, page 5, after sub-clause (2) insert the following sub-clause: '(2A) At least one member shall be a person who is a member or officer of a body having functions in relation consumer protection. ' The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is direct consumer representation upon the Committee so that there is a direct link from some 11 million persons who use domestic passenger air services each year to the deliberations of the Committee and there is a channel and means by which the problems experienced by members of the public in the utilisation of air services and the views as to the adequacy or appropriateness of the types of fares offered to the community can be processed AYES through to the Committee. At the same time, having direct consumer representation on the Committee would ensure that there is a link both ways-between the Committee's activities and NOES the public and then between the public in its expression of views and the Committee. Not wishing to delay the chamber at this stage, for those reasons I move: Clause 4, page 5, after sub-clause (2) insert the following sub-clause: '(2A) At least one member shall be a person who is a member or officer of a body having functions in relation to consumer protection. '",77
200,Mr HUNT,AYES,"The Government notes the view of the Opposition in regard to this matter. The Government intends to leave the clause in its present form. I assure the chamber that we will obtain the best people possible whatever the qualification. There is not the slightest doubt that the quality of the people who are chosen for this task is very imShack,P.D. Shipton, R. F. portant to the functions of the Independent Air Fares Committee. The Committee has a very important task in ensuring that it sets the fares according to the guidelines that have been adopted which are consistent with the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares recommendations of setting a nationally consistent cost related fare. Every effort will be made to ensure that we will obtain really top people who NA will take into account the consumer requirements. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 5 to 12-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 13 (Cost Allocation Reviews).",77
201,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"by leave-I move amendments No. (2) and No. (3) together: Clause 13, page 9, sub-paragraph (2) (a) (i), line 4, omit '3 years', substitute '6 months'. Clause 13, page 9, sub-paragraph (2) (a) (ii), line 6, omit 'at least 2 years, and not more than 3 years,', substitute 'not more than 2 years'. to The purpose of the amendments is to ensure a cost allocation review of the two .major trunk operators at least within six months. If we examine the record of public analysis of the operations of the airlines since the commencement of the two airline policy we see there has been no public examination of any nature either of the costs and fare structure or of the cost allocation procedures in establishing fares other than the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Airfares which was truncated by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), who is at the table. Given the new arrangements under the Airlines Agreement Act which has just passed through this chamber tonight, and assuming that it passes through the other place, and given that both the major airlines have embarked upon major reequipment programs and that the aircraft that each airline is purchasing are of different style with different characteristics, different sizes, it is important that as soon as possible a cost allocation review of both airlines be conducted. In the Holcroft inquiry I referred to, only Trans-Australia Airlines lodged a substantive submission. As Mr Holcroft said in his report, the bulk of that inquiry's recommendations was based upon the submission of TAA. The fact is that since 1957 some 24 years have elapsed, almost a quarter of a century, and the accounts, financial performance and efficiency of Ansett Airlines of Australia have not been analysed publicly in that time. Those on the other side might say that the Department of Transport has done that. The Holcroft committee showed that it has not done that. The committee showed that, in fact, the Department of Transport, the regulatory authority, had engaged in a rubber-stamping exercise over a number of years. The Department in the domestic aviation policy review, noted that it had been unable to determine the extent of non-airline activities by Ansett Airlines. It also noted that it had been unable to get adequate information. Again, the Holcroft inquiry came to that same conclusion about lack of information, that the Department had not carried out its task. If we are to develop a system of airline services that has some relationship to an accurate measurement of efficiency, to an objective of giving a safe, convenient service at the cheapest price, then we need to have the data that would be thrown up by the cost allocation reviews. As the notes to the Independent Air Fares Committee Bill point out, the cost allocation review deals specifically with apportionment of airline operators' costs and how they should be attributed to the flag fall and the distance components of an air fare formula. It will also determine the first class fare differentials. Under the provisions of the Bill such reviews are to be held concurrently for Ansett and TAA but the first cost allocation for both those airlines, again under the provisions of the Bill, is to be conducted within three years of the enactment of this Bill. That involves well over a quarter of a century before there is any public analysis. I cannot see any substantial reason that could be advanced in support of this situation by the Government. The Government is picking up the Australian Labor Party's policy of establishing an independent body to determine fares. We commend the Government for that. We would like to see it go further, as these amendments show. I cannot see any reason, that will stand the test of responsible examination, why the Government cannot accept this amendment. It will give the Government a good base from which to assess changes in the distribution of costs as between flag fall charges, onground charges, overhead charges, and the distance component, the cost of keeping an aircraft in the air from the time it is airborne until it gets down. Let me refer to the importance of that matter. As 1 mentioned before, with the airlines going on to use different aircraft fleets-a Boeing fleet, an Airbus and DC9 fleet, with some Boeing 727s of Trans-Australia Airlines-that decision means a departure by the two major airlines from the past practice of utilising the sharing of spare parts stocks, maintenance equipment, flight simulators and so on. Let me quote again from the remarks of Mr Lyn MCKenzie on 12 September last year. Referring to the new fleets, he said: The two different major aircraft types provide the consumer with a choice, but the consumer will have to pay for the privilege. The choice of different aircraft is unfortunate from the national point of view. It will prove costly because of the need for expensive duplication of spare parts, engine test cells, flight simulators, engine overhaul and in the provision of various facilities. He went on to refer to the costs that will be incurred by passengers in being able to have the choice of flying in a Boeing aircraft, an Airbus, or whatever make of aircraft comes on the scene, particularly in the next few years. It is important, with this Committee being established, that there be a proper data base and a proper analysis of existing cost allocations of the real costs involved in flag fall and in the distance component, so that as aircraft changes come along there will be an accurate base from which to work. Finally, let me make the point that while both airlines are operating similar fleets over similar routes, with schedules having similar characteristics, irrespective of the comments we make from time to time about the lack of public analysis of accounts and the paucity of information on the operations of each airline, a rough kind of comparison can be made. Both airlines have been doing roughly the same thing with the same kind of aircraft fleets. With this change, that position will no longer pertain. Unless there is an accurate base on which to compare future performance with present aircraft fleets, again it will be a case of the Committee accepting the word of the airline. I strongly urge the Minister and the Government to accept these amendments in the spirit in which they are moved, that is, that within six months of the enactment of this legislation there should be a cost allocation review of TAA and Ansett, and that future reviews be no further apart than two years, rather than the three years provided in the Bill. I commend the amendment to the Committee.",77
202,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,The amendment is not necessary because the Government intends to request the Independent Air Fares Committee to conduct a cost allocation review within six months of its establishment. Mr Morris-For the major airlines? For Ansett and TAA?,79
203,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"For both, to establish the faresetting formula. The Department of Transport is engaging consultants to evaluate the formula so far established by the Department following the Holcroft report. So at least some refinement will be made to the formula prior to any application that might be received from the major airlines after 30 June. However, I doubt very much whether the consultants and the Department will be able to undertake the thorough review that would be necessary to complete the work necessary to establish the base to which the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) has referred. The Holcroft report indicated that to do this task accurately would take a considerable period. It is not an easy task. Already there has been some disputation as to the 1evel of the flag fall that has been established. There are those who argue that the flag fall is already too high; there are those who argue that the flag fall is too low. Naturally it will be the task of the Committee, after a public inquiry, to conduct a cost allocation review in order to establish a formula from which future fare adjustment applications can be made. There is really no need for the amendment because obviously the Committee will have to establish a satisfactory base on which to do its future work.",79
204,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"1 do not wish to delay the Committee, but I ask the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to clarify the comments he has just made. In his second reading speech and in the explanatory notes attached to the Bill, it is stated that a period of three years is provided within which to initiate a cost allocation review for Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia. In respect of other passenger operators, the Minister made the point in his second reading speech that a cost allocation review would be initiated within six months. I want the Minister to be specific and clear, and to undertake that a cost allocation review of TAA and Ansett will be initiated within six months of the enactment of the legislation.",79
205,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"Clause 13 (2) states: The Minister shall request the Committee to conduct a cost allocation review(a) in relation to each trunk route operator(i) before the expiration of 3 years after the commencement of this Act . . . What I am saying is that it will take some time for the Committee to get its staff and to get itself esc tablished, but within six months of the establishment of the Committee-Mr Morris-That is a firm undertaking?",79
206,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"We would expect that Committee, and it will get a direction, to undertake such a cost allocation review to establish a proper base for future fare setting processes. Mr Morris-That is a firm undertaking?",79
207,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,I have said that. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 14 agreed to. Clause 15 (Major air fare reviews).,79

(iv) inviting members of the public to make submissiQns in writing to the Committee in relation to the matters to be considered by the Committee during the review within such time as is specified in the notice.'. For the information of honourable members, subsequent amendments Nos 7 to 13 relate to the matter contained in the amendment I have just of such moved. The effect of the amendment is to ensure that major fare reviews be conducted by way of public hearing. Under the provisions of the Bill, cost allocation reviews will be conducted in publieve lic, with the Independent Air Fares Committee having a discretion to determine which part of proceedings ought to be conducted in private and to determine which evidence should be released, with a disclaimer that evidence, or material may be submitted or submissions made that would breach trade secrets or be of a commercially fidential nature. That is a matter to be tested in the operation of the Committee, Parliament, I hope. The purpose of the amendment I have moved to ensure that the major fare reviews be conthis ducted publicly. One of the very contentious points of the whole two-airline policy was brought out very clearly by Holcroft in his report, and it a point that I have made over and over to the liament in the last three or four years. Where have a situation in which two major operators have exclusive access to the provision of a public transport service, and where they operate under legislative protection on a cost-plus basis that ensures they have to be profitable, and under legislation, as in the Schedule to the Airlines Agreement Bill, which prescribes that there be only two operators over the entire trunk network, it is a nonsense to suggest that they suffer from a risk of disclosure of information. me record in Hansard an extract from page 175 the Holcroft report. Paragraph 10.23 states: The Inquiry has observed a number of features of the administration of air fare pricing which it believes should be altered as quickly as possible. these is the lack of public disclosure of financial and performance data by the airlines. The matter of public disclosure overriding importance in the regulation of air fare pricing. A moment's reflection will recognise the irrationality of creating a protected joint monopoly, and then affording the members of that joint monopoly secrecy in relation to costing and pricing. Paragraph 10.25 states: The Inquiry points out when a company accepts a place in an industry into which competitorsSuch as East-West Airlines Udare precluded by law from entry and in which prices are set by law so as to recover costs, including profit, and in which long term government policy prescribes that there shall remain only two firms, each capable by implication that they shall survive that competition, for each airline then to adopt the stance of being a firm in a highly competitive environment, jeopardised by the slightest disclosure, is plainly ridiculous. So too is the toleration that has been Duffy,M.J. displayed over a long period by the regulatory authorityIn this case the Department of Transporta stance, apparently without asserting its right to be properly informed as surrogate for the pUblic. I could not put it in better words than it has been put in the Holcroft report. For this reason we beit is the responsibility of the two airlines to provide information to the Committee in the conthe duct of major fare reviews, so that those two airlines give full public accountability to the public and to the Parliament that gives them legislative protection in the conduct of air fares. For those reasons we believe the major fare reviews should conbe conducted in public. The effect of my amendlater ment is to bring about that result. I commend the and here in the amendment. MI' HUNT (Gwydir-Minister for Transport) is (10.53)---The Government does not agree with amendment. To have a public inquiry every time there was a major fare review would result in extended inquiries. It is very necessary to have a is public inquiry for the cost allocation review to set Parthe formula. Once the formula has been set it is we necessary for the Committee then to adjust all future applications for fare increases according to that formula. Needless to say, there would be very lengthy delays in reponses to applications if there were to be a public hearing every time there was an application for a fare increase. When one takes account of the scope of responsibility-it covers not only the trunk operators, but also the regional route operators and the commuter operators-the Committee would hold, on average, one inquiry Let each working day. An enormous bureaucracy of would be needed to handle such a work load. We do not believe it is necessary. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Morris's) be agreed to.

209,Mr MORRIS,AYES,"I move: (5) Clause 15, page 14, after paragraph (11) (a) insert the following paragraph: '(aa) the need to ensure that the profit of Ansett and the Commission, before interest and tax, excluding extraordinary items, as a proportion of revenue does not exceed 6 per cent, levels of interest and income taxation Clause 15 deals with the conduct of a major airfare review. Sub-clause (11) deals with the matters to which that the Independent Air Fares Committee shall have regard in determining the amount of economy air fares. Paragraph (e) states: the need to ensure that air services are provided over trunk routes by 2 economically viable passenger operators: Whatever that means I do not know. The meaning is in the mind of the utterer. Paragraph (d) prescribes: AYES the need to ensure that air services are operated on an efficient and economic basis. Paragraph (g) prescribes: the need to ensure that air services that are provided over trunk routes are operated as far as possible on a competitive basis. NOES That paragraph makes a nonsense of the previous one to which I have referred. If the fares are to be the same, if the matters to be taken into considerHyde,I.M. ation are the same, and if there is a vagueness Jannan, A. W. about establishing that air services are to be operated on an efficient and economic basis, then Lloyd,B. Lusher,S.A. the only real competition can be the colour of the curtains over the galley of the aircraft or the colour of the uniforms of the hostesses on board. We are proposing that, in addition to those vague items, there be included a 'precise measurement of profit objective for the two airlines concerned. The amendment that 1I have proposed O'Keefe, F. L. Porter, J. R, again is taken directly from the Holcroft committee report. I must point out that the members of that committee are men with a very wide exRuddock, P. M. Sainsbury, M. E. perience in the commercial world, with a wide experience of the type of return that is available to the various industries within Australia, whether in investment, manufacturing or transport. Mr Holcroft is from the transport field, Dr Bell is from the investment field and Professor Hogan is an economist from Sydney University. I will not go into the report and the detail of the matters they considered, the kind of ratios they compared and the comparisons that they made of the NA different measures used to establish what is a satisfactory return up on funds employed upon capital or upon revenue, but those three gentlemen came to the conclusion that, in the light of all the evidence available, the most appropriate measure would be to write into future legislation a requirement relating to profit before interest and tax. Paragraph 16.82 sub-paragraph (3) of the Holcroft report states: Profit before interest and tax, excluding extraordinary items, should as a proportion of revenue not exceed 6.0 per cent, given a continuation of present levels of interest rates and income taxation in Australia. given a continuation of the present in Australia;'. Sub-paragraph (4) states: The rate of return and the rate of profit before interest and tax should be reviewed whenever there is a significant shift in the criteria by which they were previonsly established. I will not take the time of the Committee going through the detail of the background to that recommendation. I have read the recommendation and I am satisfied that it is an appropriate recommendation. I leave it to honourable members to refer to the report. Before 1 sit down I wish to repeat the point that I have made before. When two operators are given a protected and privileged position in the provision of a public transport service-a guaranteed profit through a cost plus system-in the public interest, that arrangement must carry with it a heavy responsibility for public accountability. Neither of the major operators is exposed to the degree of risk that exists in other commercial ventures in the economy. They are protected. There can be only two operators; there cannot be a third operator in the field. They are not entitled to the kind of return that could be justified in a venture or a commercial operation with a higher risk component. Airline services should be predicated upon the assessment that they are part of the public transport service. For those reasons the Opposition moves the amendment which I have outlined to the chamber. 1 commend that amendment to honourable members.",81
210,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"1 want to reinforce some of the remarks made by the Opposition spokesman for transport, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and point out that in fact the Holcroft committee considered the question of profit at very considerable length. In fact it saw it as fundamental to its whole examination of the air fare structure. The figure of 6 per cent was arrived at after extremely detailed consideration. A second feature upon which it is worth commenting and upon which the Opposition spokesman did not comment is that because of the experience of the Holcroft committee and the general tenor in which the negotiations for the two-airline agreement were conducted, it is possible that we will have some trouble ensuring full disclosure of the accounting procedures of the two airlines that will be party to this agreement. I refer not so much Trans-Australia Airlines, which was relatively blameless in its performance before the Holcroft committee, but to the other airline. The point I wish to make about this 6 per cent profit margin is that as well as being appropriately calculated by persons capable of making such a calculation and as well as being right, given the regulated nature of the airlines and ensuring that there is no exploitation of the travelling public, it would also have the very distinct advantage of concentrating the minds of the accountants of the two airlines wonderfully and ensuring that the figures which they come up with are accurate and the sorts of figures that we could subject to some form of public scrutiny. Thus [ hope, we arrive at a situation in which the airline travelling public is not exploited to the extent to which it has been to this point.",82
211,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"In brief, the Government does not accept this amendment. The airlines have made an $800m investment in new generation widebodied aircraft, which will be of tremendous benefit to the travelling public generally. They are a more efficient and less noisy aircraft, and will help to stabilise the fares of passengers because of their efficiency, so long as we can maintain a sufficiently high utilisation level. Work done indicates that if the 6 per cent figure were established there is no way that either airline could operate at a profit. [n fact, they would operate at a loss. Of course, Holcroft made the point that the figure could be varied, so the question of the making of a profit will be a matter for the Independent Air Fares Committee to decide, having regard to its guidelines. The figure mentioned in the Holcroft report certainly was not one of the soundest aspects of that report.",82
212,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"In effect, the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is saying that since the return to those airlinesparticularly to Ansett Airlines of Australia-as measured by the means described in the Holcroft report is around about the figure that is recommended, as I have indicated, as I interpret the Minister's remarks-",82
213,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,There was not a lot of work done on that figure.,82
214,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"That may be right. I looked at the tables and the comparisons made. If what the Minister says is correct then there will have to be a substantial increase in air fares to achieve the kinds of return on revenue or profit expressed as a percentage of revenue before interest and tax as outlined in the amendment I have put to the chamber. If that is the case, there might very well be fleets of new aircraft but people will not be able to afford to travel on them. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 16 (Minor air fares review).",82
215,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"The amendment to clause 16 is identical to the amendment to clause 15 that I moved earlier. It has the effect of ensuring that the matter that I outlined in my previous address is taken into consideration in a minor fares review. The remarks I made in support of the previous amendment apply to this amendment, so 1 will not delay the House. I move: Clause 16, page 17, after paragraph (8) (a) insert the following paragraph: '(aa) the need to ensure that the profit of Ansett and the Commission, before interest and tax, excluding extraordinary items, as a proportion of revenue does not exceed 6%, given a continuation of the present levels of interest and income taxation in Australia; '.

216,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"The AusAustralia tralian National Airlines Repeal Bill deals with the conversion of Trans-Australia Airlines from statutory authority to a public company. Obvisupport ously it is the first step by the Fraser Government in the sale of all or part of the airline. When the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated as and reported in the Melbourne Herald on 3 April, that shares would not be sold to Ansett Airlines Australia, he clearly did not state to whom shares would be sold. If it was proposed that the shares were not to be sold then he would not have said they would not be sold to Ansett; he would have said they would not be sold to anybody. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) agrees with the and view of the Australian Labor Party and the ma63,583 jority of Australians that the lead inevitably to the formation of a private monopoly in major domestic airline services, higher fares for travellers and the abolition of country services. We heard from two Queensland Let members of the National Country Party earlier this evening, the honourable member for Kengovernment nedy (Mf Katter) and the honourable member interesting for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron), of their concern about the possible abolition of country air services in your State, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let us look at the history of Trans-Australia Airlines. It was established at a time when aviation was in its infancy. There was a very firm beThird Reading lief in this country, held by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Menzies, and also by the United Kingdom Government, that the provision of transport services should be carried out by a public utility. It was the decision of the government of BILL 1981 the day in 1946 that the most effective way to proSecond Reading vide a national system of safe, regular airline services was with one major airline. The total investin that airline, Trans-Australia Airlines, was some $14.8m in 1946. Not one dollar has been put into that airline since. It has developed and grown upon the basis of the service provided, on the reserves it has developed and on the profits it has made. We know that the two-airline policy Third Reading devised by the Menzies Government in 1952 was aimed at protecting Australian National Airways-later Ansett Airlines of Australiafrom the growth of TAA. In other words, it was devised to protect the private enterprise operator from the rigours of competition from another operator-as I said earlier, that is the very antithesis of what private and free enterprise is supSecond Reading posed to be all about. Despite the handicaps and the obstacles of the two-airline policy and despite the impediments and obstructions placed in the way of TransAirlines by successive conservative governments, Trans-Australia Airlines went on to a become a leader in market innovation, to gain the of the majority of air travellers and to hold that support year after year, establishing itself as a national symbol of endeavour, of spirit of identity as a successful public enterprise, as a successful Australian enterprise and as a symbol of of achievement by the Australian people. It has been supported by generations of Australians and generations of Australians have contributed to the development of that airline. Since 1946 the airline has carried some 71 million passengers, it has paid $35m in dividends to Consolidated Revenue, it has paid government charges and taxes of $423m it has established a national route network of unduplicated kilometres servicing some 53 sale of TAA would towns and cities. Let me put to rest the claim often made by air opponents of TAA because they see the airline as air a danger, that TAA does not pay the same taxes. me state, and the Minister will confirm this, I am sure, that TAA pays the same taxes and charges as any public company. It is to note the value put on TAA by those honourable members opposite who seek to snipe, undermine and sabotage this valuable public asset. Senator Peter Rae said in 1979 that the value was some $30m; $55m said his friends from IPEC-the Employees Share Ownership Plan people; Mr Murdoch was a little more realistic and said about $15Om. It is probably worth in the vicinity of $170m. What is the Government's case for forming TAA into a public company? The clear purpose is that it wants to appease those members of the back bench who are disputing with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and want to see successful public enterprises sold off to the public sector. By forming TAA into a company the task of proceeding to dispose of the airline is simplified. The interdepartmental committee report provided by the Minister shows that the prime demand of Ansett was that TAA should be sold to commercial interests. It is the view of numerous people of standing in this country that if TAA were sold-be it in two, three, four or five years' time; it does not matter-inevitably it would become part of a major private monopoly of domestic airline services. Mr Rupert Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles made the demand that TAA should be sold during the negotiations for the new two airline agreement. The reason for that demand was that TAA has always been a thorn in the side of Ansett. In the absence of proper monitoring of airline costs and performance, it has acted as a monitor of the airline industry. It has acted as a barrier to higher profits in the provision of what essentially public transport. The free enterprise fanatics in the Government ranks claim that the sale of TAA would mean greater competition and cheaper fares. They say that the public could buy shares in TAA. That is a quite spurious claim even if one assumes that greater competition would result in cheaper fares and the public could buy shares in TAA. The situation is not that TAA is a barrier to greater competition. The barrier to greater competition is the legislation that earlier this evening was enshrined for eight more years by those who sit opposite. That is the barrier to competition because this Government is committed to ensuring a higher level of return to the proprietors of Ansett in return for past services rendered in relation to elections. So the barrier to competition is not TAA. It is quite spurious also to suggest that competition by itself or the presence of more than one firm would create greater competition. If one looks at the history of the two-airline policy one finds that the Menzies Government settled upon a two-airline policy because it would not have been able to say there was any competition with a oneairline policy. Two was the minimum number they could have and still give Ansett the inside running. For that reason Australian National Airways, as it was then known, was kept alive and not sold up in 1952. As I stated earlier, the two-airline policy protects Ansett, and it is the real barrier to greater competition. Changing the form of ownership of TAA will do nothing to lessen air fares. All Australians now share in the ownership of TAA. Those who have passed on, those who have worked with airline services since 1945, those who have used the services, the taxpayers who have made contributions to the development of this country in those intervening years, those who presently use TAA-and that is the majority of air travellers-are all shareholders in TAA. Under the proposals of that segment oppositethe free enterprise fanatics-TAA is to be formed into a public company. We are asked: 'Would you not want to buy shares in TAA?' There is a very short response to that. As a taxpayer, I already have shares in TAA, and I am quite happy with that arrangement. To form TAA into a public corporation-Mr Ruddock-Tell us about the dividends you get.",83
217,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"The dividends are in social benefit and service and in the knowledge that TAA acts as a monitor on the industry, provides is service throughout Australia, and also provides, as two members of the National Country Party pointed out earlier, services to outback Queensland that otherwise would not be provided in the absence of TAA. That is part of the dividend I get, and I am quite happy to see those services provided to other Australians. It could be that such dividends do not suit the honourable member or that he is unhappy about such an arrangement. I am not here to deal with my pecuniary interests; that is more the concern and ambition in life of the honourable member. The fact is that the sale of TAA and its listing on the stock exchange will mean that 90 per cent of Australians who do not hold shares in public corporations, who do not buy and deal on the stock exchange, will lose their share of the ownership of TAA. The other point made by the proponents of the disposal of TAA is that TAA has some disabilities. I cannot make the point too strongly that in my view the people who make that kind of claim forfeit their right as members of Parliament to speak on this area. They are members of the Government. TAA is a creature of the Government. TAA must operate in the commercial environment created for it by the Government. So whatever problems and financial disabilities TAA has, we must remember that honourable members opposite are the bosses. They must db something about it. They cannot have the luxury and the hypocrisy of opting out and saying: 'They have problems; they should provide more information; the superannuation scheme is wrong'. They have been sitting on the Government side of the House for five years. Those honourable members who sit opposite have had longer than five years to remedy those disabilities and they cannot enjoy the luxury of complaining about the conditions under which they require the airline to operate. But they are selective criticisms. They are only criticisms of the public enterprise operator.",84
218,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"We are trying to fix it up, Peter.",85
219,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"That is more than some of the Minister's colleagues are trying to do. I think that even the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), who is sitting at the table beside the Minister, is trying to send it down. Again, this is chaos in Government. The Government is trying to get its act together. The financial disabilities suffered by TAA are the result of Government decisions, and the remedies lie with the government, whether it is in reporting, in entitlements to the scheme, or in funding of the scheme. The Government cannot have that luxury of then blaming the problems on the management of the airline and saying that the airline is not efficient. I would like to quote what the Minister for Transport said on 18 September 1980 when introducing the Australian National Airlines Amendment Bill (No.2) 1980. I described this Bill as an act of grovelling by the Government before the proprietors of Ansett. I want to refresh the memories of honourable members opposite about what the Minister said. He stated: Paramount amongst these changes was the need to place TAA on a more commercial basis. Since the Government aims to create a more competitive environment for the two airlines, is amending the ANA Act to ensure that TAA operates on a similar basisI underline those wordsto a privately owned airline. At the same time the Govern· ment is anxious to ensure that the ANA Commission as a statutory authority is not advantaged over its competitors. This approach is consistent with the Government's overall policy that publicly owned business undertakings should, as far as possible, be neither advantaged nor disadvantaged as compared with their competitors from the private sector. Is the Minister to tell us this evening that that was a falsehood, that what he told us on 18 September last was not true, or substantially was not true? The challenge is there for the Minister. Let me compare those words of 18 September with the Minister's words on 25 May. The Minister in his second reading speech on the Australian National Airlines Repeal Bill 1981 stated: I now acknowledge the contribution of the Australian National Airlines Commission to the development of aviation since its establishment in 1946. TAA is an airline with a great reputation. This is due to its management and staff, the people who have made and are making it a great airline. That is a pretty paltry kind of epitaph when the Government wants to send an airline down the drain. I thought that the airline would have deserved something better than four lines. The Minister went on to say: - I firmly believe that by making it a public company and freeing it of many bureaucratic controls it will go from strength to strength. Which version is correct? Is it the first speech or the second speech? I believe the first one is correct. I have looked at those amendments. The Minister was acting on the basis of fact. He had information and he spelt out in the Bill the proposed amendments, the purpose of the amendments and the reasons they were being made. The second is simply a propaganda document brought up to quieten those poor fellows from Western Australia who have been conned about the deregulation inquiry and who have now been further conned by the words 'We will make TAA into a public company. That should satisfy them. We will have a look at selling it'. The task that faces the Minister is to detail specifically the many bureaucratic controls that were not evident to him or his Department when the legislation of 1980 was submitted to the House. The major issue at stake in this whole exercise and in the thinking of the free enterprise fanatics opposite is the profit stripping of profitable public enterprises. The Government is concerned about selling off only profitable public enterprises, not the loss incurring public enterprises that are regarded as necessary services, such as railways, schools and hospitals or any other handouts to give as tax deductions. It is concerned with selling it only those services which Australians of several generations have established. This airline has been brought to a stage of development where it can be profitable. Now that the risks have been borne by past generations and taxpayers over the last 35 years, the Government says: 'Now it is profitable let us give it to our friends, the wealthy investors and stock exchange speculators'. The Government has no mandate for that action. Some Government members may feel that they would like to do that, but let me make it crystal clear to them that they have no mandate. They have a mandate to do the opposite. They said in the election campaign and have said over and over in the last few years that TAA was not for sale. This Minister for Transport, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the previous Minister for Transport are on the record as saying that TAA would not be sold. The decision to convert TAA into a public company, as I mentioned earlier, is related to a further desire to sell off the company. The Prime Minister said on the record during the election campaign that TAA was not for sale and that it would not be sold. Yet on 3 April this year in a Press interview in the street outside Parliament House he was asked by Laurie Oakes about Trans-Australia Airlines.",85
220,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,What did Laurie ask him?,86
221,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"I will read it for the Minister. It is nice. The Minister will enjoy it. Mr Oakes said: It was my impression in the election campaign, Prime Minister, that you promised that TAA would not be sold. Well, was my understanding wrong? Mr Fraser said: That had been the policy of the Government, yes. We've reexamined that over recent times what changed circumstances. Mr Oakes said: Do you think it's fair Prime Minister, to make a promise in an election campaign and then say five months later, well we've changed our mind? Mr Fraser said: Oh, I think if circumstance is different, Governments have to adjust to that. Yes I do. There it is. I knew that the Minister, as a supporter of public ownership-l 00 per cent government ownership of Trans-Australia Airlineswould enjoy that. This interview reminded me of the words of the infamous Richard Nixon--'That promise is no longer operative'. In Australia we have our own Richard Nixon in politics, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. The simple fact is that this Prime Minister will do anything or say anything to get into office and to stay in office. He is the most disbelieved politician in Australia. He and his Government cannot be trusted. It is the policy of the Liberal Federal Council, arrived at in April last year, that TAA should be sold in five years. The Prime Minister and those opposite, when I raised this in debates all through last year, said that that was not the policy of the Government; it was the policy of the party. It is clear that a substantial number of those who sit opposite, who are concerned only with private gain, have adopted it as policy. Another move by the Prime Minister in this issue has been to appease the selective free enterprise fanatics on the back bench whose support he needs to hold off the honourable member for Kooyong (Mf Peacock). As I said, this Prime Minister is prepared to sell off one of oUi most successful public enterprises-a symbol of Australian enterprise and achievement-to try to save his political neck. I do not believe he can be saved. I believe he is a temporary Prime Minister. He is prepared to allow almost any dishonesty to try to justify his actions in his manic desire to get his own way. The Melbourne Sun of 1 June contains a report of his address to the Federal Liberal Council meeting of last weekend. The report states: Selling TAA shares to the public would be regarded as a provocation by any future socialist government . He said a socialist governmentI suppose he means a Labor government--would seek to bankrupt both TAA and Ansett and thus have the option of nationalising them. No one in my memory has made that statement, certainly not since I have been a member of this place. It is not the policy of the Labor Party. It does not appear in the policy of the Labor Party. There is no reference to it. It was another fabrias a result of, T think, somecation by the Prime Minister, Australia's Richard Nixon. The report continued: Assuming TAA was sold, a socialist government would regard it as the greatest possible offence to its principles and would do what it could to re-nationalise TAA and take over the other airline as well. That is another fabrication. It was not said or heard by anybody else. It was heard only by those people who heard it out of the mouth of this Prime Minister, Australia's Richard Nixon. It is not the policy of the Australian Labor Party to nationalise the airlines system. It is the policy of the Labor Party to ensure that TAA remains a 100 per cent government owned enterprise. It is the political reality that at the moment at least two major airlines operate in this country. I do not see any way that that number can be reduced unless the Government proceeds with the sale of TAA. That would produce a private monopoly in the provision of major air services. It is important to note the sniping campaign conducted against TAA's financial account by Government members. They never criticise Ansett which produces meagre financial accounts on airline operations. They never criticise the superannuation scheme, the provisions or the lack of data in Ansett's accounts. As I mentioned earlier, the solution to whinges about TAA is in the hands of Government members. TAA is a creature of government. It operates in an environment that the Government creates for it. The purpose of the Bill as set out in the second reading speech is to enable the conversion of TAA into a public company which is to be 100 per cent owned by the Commonwealth and to repeal the Australian National Airlines Act 1945. It vides for all assets, liabilities and arrangements the Commission to be transferred to the public company. It provides transitional arrangements for conversion of the Commission to a company respect of liabilities and other arrangements, areas, employees rights and service, superannuhonourable ation, et cetera. The formation of TAA into public company, as I mentioned earlier, is marginally different from the proposal contained in the Australian National Airlines Commission Amendment Bill (No.2) of 1980. It is important to note that in this Bill or the Minister's second reading speech no details are provided of the memorandum and articles of association of the proposed public company. The memorandum, as some of us will recognise is the document that describes the objectives and purposes of the company. This Bill is a blank cheque, a blanket approval for the conversion of TAA into a public company with an undefined memorandum and articles of association and in the absence of a financial directive from the Government to indicate what its purpose will be. The Minister has said that a firm of private consultants is to be appointed to advise the Government on the practicality of selling some or all of the shares in TAA, including how this might be done in the light of the Governdorse ment's aviation policies. If anybody can undercompany stand the Government's aviation policies he has big task in front of him in carrying out the work that will be given to him by the Minister. Why a firm of private consultants? Who will the firm private consultants be? As I said, the legislation gives a blank cheque to the Government to conTAA vert TAA into a public company. We have no tails of what is proposed. Let me make the point that changing the Commission's status will not mean that it will be more efficient or have greater freedom. Qantas Airways Ltd is a public company. Its major problem has been petty interference by this GovernAmendment ment's bureaucracy. The Chairman, Mr Jim year, Leslie, is on record on numerous occasions testifyclause, ing to the problems of the airline caused by government bureaucracy and government interobjectives ference. I challenge the Minister to detail specifically and precisely the improvements in the day to day management of TAA which he would expect from forming it into a public company. His theory has not worked for Qantas because the Department of Finance, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Transport can still, and do, interfere in the operations of the company. I mentioned that a firm of private consultants prowas to be commissioned - to advise the Governof ment on the practicality of selling all or part of the shares in TAA. I ask: What firm of public consultants is to be engaged? Is it to be MCKinsey and in Co., the bosom pal of the beseiged and discredited Prime Minister and the former employer of the member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), a who is not here at the moment. The honourable only member for Mackellar, who is one of the arch proponents of the sale of TAA, the former bagman of the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party-as he is generally reputed in this place to beand a man well known to Sir Peter Abeles of Ansett Airlines. If TAA is to be examined, then as it belongs to all Australians and to all members of this Parliament, let the examination be carried out by an all party parliamentary committee, as was the case with other statutory corporations such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation and as is the case at the moment in respect of the Australian National Railways Commission. The airline belongs to all Australians and should be looked at on a non-partisan basis along with Ansett Airlines. The ultimate sole objective of this legislation is to free up TAA to provide better service to the public. Therefore, it can be understood that it would be irresponsible of this Parliament to enconversion of the airline into a public in the absence of a detailed memora andum of articles of association, especially when the policy of the major coalition partner is for the sale of the airline within four years and given the of total lack of trust in what this Government and Prime Minister say and do. The formation of into a public company is an ill-conceived, deexpensive and unnecessary gimmick. The legislation constitutes a squandering of public resources by the Prime Minister in his latest manoeuvre to head oft' yet another rebellion by Government back benchers. The Australian National Airlines Commission Bill (No.2) of 18 September last with the exclusion of the profit objective clause 17, would be supported by the Opposition. This would achieve all the important that the Minister claims this Bill will achieve. The Government has a mandate to ensure that TAA is not sold, which is the opposite of the real purpose of this legislation. Changing the form of ownership will not reduce air fares by one cent for one traveller. Converting TAA into a public company will simplify its sale and it meets the prime demands of this Government's backers, the multi-millionaire proprietors of Ansett. As I have said, the sale of TAA will result in a private monopoly and a withdrawal of country air services. This legislation was born in infamy. It should be rejected outright by this Parliament. It will be opposed at every opportunity by the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party and the majority of Australians. MI' JULL (Bowman) (11.43)-The hour is getting late and I will confine my comments to very brief statements indeed. I listened with interest to the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). I think we have to realise that this legislation fits in as part of the whole package of legislation which the Government has brought into the House tonight. I sincerely believe the package can lead to a fairer and more equitable pricing system for air fares in Australia and ultimately cheaper air fares in Australia. It would be interesting to ponder what my philosophical commitment would have been in 1946 to the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines. Perhaps I would have found some support for it at that stage. That is 30-odd years ago and the whole of the domestic as well as the international aviation scene has changed very much indeed. We have to be careful to avoid the situation that has developed in a number of overseas countries. I will cite just two examples. One relates to New Zealand and its Government owned domestic airline, and the other relates to Britain where British European Airways virtually acted as the country's domestic carrier. I am scared that if we do not have a full investigation of TAA and a proper look at its financial setup we will have such a situation. I am not denying that TAA has been operating on a shoestring for many years.",86
222,Mr HUNT,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,And doing it well too.,88
223,Mr JULL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"It has been doing it well. If we get to the stage at which BEA was at the end of the 1960s we could have an absolute disaster. The British Government's answer was to amalgamate BEA and the British Overseas Airways Corporation to form British Airways. Domestically and internationally that airline is now losing $235m a year. Those Government owned airlines got out of control. If Australia is not careful it could well have the same situation. I dare say that in some respect the Australian taxpayers might be contributing to the situation that has developed in British Airways. The airline is saying quite openly that the Kangaroo route to London is one of its major profit earners and if it does not have exclusive or semi-exclusive rights it will be in all sorts of trouble. Qantas recognises now that we are paying some of that heritage. I think it is important that we look at TAA. I think the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) has been very wise indeed to be quite open-minded about the matter. He has taken TAA into the realm of being a public company. He is going to arrange for a full and complete investigation of the whole financial structure. I do not think there is one honourable member who will deny that at the moment it is almost impossible to find out through the access we have in our everyday operations here in Parliament what really has been going on with TAA, its superannuation scheme, its restrictions on expenditure and its relationship with the Department of Transport. All these matters are adding up. This is really one of the wisest moves that could be made for the sake of TAA, whichever way it might go in the future. As I said the Bill is part of a total package lining domestic aviation up for the 1980s. The days of 1946 and the early 1950s are long gone. If we can look at the legislation in that respect and with the positive feeling that TAA will be owned by all the people of Australia, then we have to make sure they get value for money and that their investment is sound. This is the only way we can do it. I have every confidence that the Minister will follow the matter right the way through. If in fact his proposition is that part of the shareholding of TAA be sold, to the ultimate benefit of all Australians, so be it. But we do not know yet whether that will be so. We have a long way to go down the track before we know the true nature of the future of TAA. I speak very briefly tonight in support of the Bill. I am confident in the knowledge that the Bill is part of the legislative package that will lead to a much fairer and more equitable air fare arrangement for each and every Australian.",88
224,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"[n my view the Australian National Airlines Repeal Bill is one of the most iniquitous Bills brought into this House by the present Fraser Government. In some respects it is a sale of the Australian people's birth right. As the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) said, Trans-Australia Airlines was established in 1946 by the Chifley Labor Government. Since that time TAA has carried over 71 million passengers and has paid $35m in dividends to consolidated revenue. It has also paid taxes and government charges to the Commonwealth amounting to $423m. That is not bad for a company that a number of Government members are saying is on its last legs. Indeed, in the last financial year TAA showed an improvement in its passenger growth of 7.1 per cent. It carried more freight than Ansett. TAA carried about 57 million tonnes of freight and Ansett carried about 55 million tonnes. That is not bad for an airline which the Government says needs to be deregulated. When looking at the Bill one should ask why the Government is to sell an enterprise that in 1979-80 made $2.9m profit for the Australian taxpayer. In looking at the evidence before us and even the Press statements made on the subject, it is quite clear why the present Liberal-National Country Party Government-even over the National Country Party's head-wishes to sell TAA or set it up in such a fashion that the Government, at some later date, can sell it off. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and a number of speakers in previous debates here this evening have said: 'But of course we do not have any real intention of selling the airline. We are just trying to set it up in such a commercial fashion that it will be competitive'. Indeed, the Minister said in his second reading speech: The Government intends that the new company be fully commercial with the powers of the Government restricted to rights of shareholders to appoint directors. If the facts are, as I put them to Parliament just now, that TAA is making a profit, that TAA is getting more traffic than it had in the past, that TAA is doing better than Ansett, why does the Government need to set it up in such a different fashion? I put it to the Parliament and to the Australian people that the reason is that in the long run this Government intends to try to sell TAA despite the fact that many of its own supporters say that it should not do it. Indeed, one of the Government's most influential members, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony), said at Echuca at the Country Party's Victorian branch conference that the Government must run TAA. It is very interesting that since 10 April 1981 he has not said that it must not sell it. One might ask: Why is the Government wanting to sell TAA ? Why is it setting it up in such a fashion? It is quite obvious that it is because Mr Murdoch and his friends wish to buy the airline and wish to try to dominate the airline industry in Australia. A number of Government members are obviously in league with this plan-the gang of seven that voted against the Government this evening, the deregulators who wish to see the airline industry in Australia destroyed so that there can be control of the industry by Mr Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles. That would be to the great detriment of the people of Australia. Indeed, the people who will be the great losers will be the people of Queensland and the outlying areas of some of the States.",88
225,Mr GOODLUCK,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Does the gang of eight include the Labor Party too?",89
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,Mr Millar)There is no point of order.,89
227,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"I am very interested to see the behaviour of one of the Tasmanian members who so supinely agreed with the Government today that we should set up TAA in such a fashion so that it could be done away with. The Government allowed East-West Airlines Ltd to be done over in the negotiations about trunk routes. East-West Airlines, which provides a cheaper link between Tasmania and the mainland has been done over by these supine people who 'say that they stand for Tasmania. They stand for Tasmania with about as much sincerity as a person who is willing to sell out all of his or her electors. The Government has sold out East-West Airlines which was trying to do something for the Tasmanian people.",89
228,Mr GOODLUCK,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",89
229,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,Here he comes. The honourable member is going to try to make an excuse for what he has done.,89
230,Mr GOODLUCK,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,The mainlander wouldn't understand anything about Tasmania.,89
231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"Order! There is no point of order. I remind honourable members that frivolous points of order are not accepted by the Chair, especially at this late hour. The honourable member for Grayndler will keep his attention to the subject matter of the Bill.",89
232,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank you for your protection from these frivolous points of order by people with very guilty consciences here this evening. As I was s-y­ ing earlier on, the reasons the Government Intends to set TAA up in such a fashion that it can ultimately be sold are quite clear. Look at the Liberal and Country parties' election promises when they went to the people last year. How many of them are still in existence? A promise by this Government is operative until the Minister can make another statement cancelling it. I put to the Parliament tonight that it is obvious that in the near future the Government will attempt to sell TAA. It will attempt to sell what is one of the great assets of the Australian people. The conversion of TAA from a statutory authority to a public company is the first step in the sale of all or part of the airline. It is interesting to see the people who do not agree with the Government. Indeed, Sir Robert Law-Smith, the Chairman of TAA, an appointee of the present Government and a man who one might think is close to the Government's line of thinking, said that he did not see any advantage to the travelling public in the sale of TAA. Indeed, he went on to say at other stages that he does not see any advantage to the Government in changing the arrangements in the way it is at present. So said the Government's own appointee as the chief executive of TAA. It is interesting to see that the Government has even fallen out with its own people. We have seen also a proposal of the Government to put consultants into TAA. The consultants, of course, as the Labor Party spokesman on transport has said, have been put in there with only one purpose in mind and that is to bring up a report which will be favourable to the line that proponents of the sale of TAA are taking in the Government. I have no doubt that the Minister for Transport, who is sitting at the table tonight, feels that he is in a rather difficult position. He knows that the people who will be the great losers in any attempt to change the arrangements that TAA has will be the people of rural Australia, the people in Queensland represented by the Minister's party. I recently had occasion to go to Charleville on a TAA Fokker Friendship. One can only wonder what would happen if TAA gave up that route. There were many women with young children on that flight. It was a very hot day. As the Minister would be aware, air turbulence in Western Queensland is very bad. Most of the people on the flight developed air sickness. Where would we be if TAA went off that route and we had some little commuter airline operating without a hostess service? Where would those people be? They would be in rather disastrous circumstances. It was interesting to hear the member for that electorate involved saying here this evening that the Government was making a very wrong decision. For once in my life I would be happy to stand here and say that I hope the Country Party wins an argument between the Government parties. It is unfortunate that the Country Party has been run over as the people of Tasmania also have been run over. Mr Humphreys-We have a Country Party Minister.",89
233,Mr LEO MCLEAY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"The Minister, as I said earlier-my colleague the honourable member for Griffith mentioned him-must be very embarrassed to be sitting at the table this evening handling this Bill. Other honourable members wish to speak in this debate. I assure the Parliament that the Federal Labor Party\ when it is returned to power, and even before that, will use every means at its disposal to block the sale of TAA. If by any mischance this Government is able to sell part or the whole of TAA the next Labor Government will restore it to its rightful owners-the Australian people-so that TAA can continue to provide the service to the Australian people that it has been providing since 1934. I hope TAA will continue to provide those services for a long time in the future and that we will not have part or all of it sold to people who would try to stifle the development of one of the great institutions of this country.",90
234,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"The Government's real meaning and purpose with the Australian National Airlines Repeal Bill is clear. It aims to sell off Trans-Australia Airlines to the private sector and thereby effectively emasculate the quality of the air services provided in this country. However, the Bill also achieves another goal. It exposes the contradictions and incoherencies of the present Government's policies and its so-called philosophy. When looking at the policies of this Government on domestic airlines one does not know whether to laugh or to cry. Is it not contradictory and hypocritical for this Government, which has just rammed through three Bills designed to reduce competition in the airline industry, to be trying to justify this action by claiming that the Bill ensures 'that TAA operates as a competitive, commercially oriented airlines'? Thus with the Bills last before the House we were told that regulation of the industry was essential. With this Bill we are told that TAA must be made into a company, . which would deregulate its activities and free it from bureaucratic control. Why can we not get some consistency from this Government? Why does it present us with this hogwash about noble principles when what it is really out to do is to destroy the publicly owned airline altogether and to create monopoly control for a small group of rich individuals who want to control this industry? As a result of the two airlines agreement which the Government has just pushed through it is virtually impossible for TAA to compete effectively with Ansett Airlines of Australia. Yet the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in introducing the Bill before us said: By making it a public company and freeing it of many bureaucratic controls it will go from strength to strength. In other words, the Minister in the previous Bills imposed an ad hoc set of controls yet in relation to this Bill he claimed that it is necessary to make TAA a so-called public company in order to free it from ad hoc bureaucratic controls. Simple logic and coherence of principle is abandoned in the tush to sell off public, profitable assets. What is really happening is this: The Government simply determines what is in the best interest of vested interests which support it and then concocts so called philosophical arguments later. This Bill and the previous Bill, which are in blatant contradiction of each other, clearly expose the so-called philosophy as a sham.. Why is TAA to be made into company? Why is the Australian National Airlines Commission to be disbanded? The only that even resembles an argument that TAA will be subject to fewer restrictions from the Government if it becomes a so-called public company. Yet, if it is necessary to remove such restrictions, this can be done by amending the regulations governing the Commission. It is not necessary to establish this public company that purpose. If anyone denies this, let him refer to Hansard of 18 September of last year, when this same Government introduced legislation to achieve this goal of deregulating TAA while taining it as a commission. Last year the Government assured this House that TAA could be relieved of government conenterprises trols while retaining its commission has the Government now changed that view? The reason will become evident to all Australians in the next few months. This Government is converting TAA to a public company beca-se that on way it is easier to move to a situation its shares to private individuals and private companies. Thus one of the few remaining profitable public enterprises in this country is to become the private property of wealthy Australians and overseas interests. Taxpayers' investments this company over many years are to be dispensed with at the whim of the Minister. here is that the Government is being dishonest in the way it is going about achieving the goal. The Minister informed us that the Government has decided to engage consultants to examine the practicality of selling some or all of the shares TAA, including how this might be done in the light of the Government's domestic aviation cies. So we are to have private sector consultants to analyse and determine whether TAA is to remain publicly owned. That is like asking Mephistopheles to determine whether souls will go to heaven. The Government fools no one with this delaying tactic. Trans-Australia Airlines is as good as gone. I address myself to a further point. The general philosophy of getting rid of productive and fitable public enterprises is an absurd economic thesis. It is a thesis which, if carried to its tremes, results in higher taxation because more public revenue has to be found. In the last few his speech. years TAA has in fact contributed $35m in dividends to Consolidated Revenue. It has also contributed $423m in government charges and taxes.",90
235,Mr BAUME,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,Tell us about the super fund.,91
236,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,I ask honourable a so-called public members opposite-Ml' DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J. D. M. thing Dobie )-Order! Far too much interjection is for this action is taking place.,91
237,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"Honourable members opposite do not like to hear good argument. I ask honourable members opposite: Where will they find public revenue to substitute for that profit? for Do they intend to further emasculate services throughout the community, as they have already done? Is this the kind of nonsensical economics that we get from this stupid Government? It does renot even make economic sense to sell off profitable public enterprises. We give notice to these people that not only will we restore TAA to a public enterprise but we will also increase public throughout the community. It is only status. Why through increasing-Mr MCLean-What will you do with Ansett?",91
238,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,It is not our intention to take over Ansett as the Minister and other souls the other side have claimed. It is not our intenof selling off tion to take over Ansett.,91
239,Mr COLEMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,Why not?,91
240,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,I will answer the question. We believe in a competitive situation in between the private and public sectors. We do not believe in giving everything to the private sector in What is serious a monopolistic way. Mr Groom-What about the banks?,91
241,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"We also believe in competition between private and public sector in banks, and have said so. The Government is trying to destroy competition between the banks because poliit has given the go-ahead for these - Mr Morris-I raise a point of order. The hour is late and there are those opposite who are tired and emotional. Could we have some decorum in the chamber so that the address of the honourable member for Burke, which is important to him and relates to important legislation, can be heard? MI' DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no point of order. The Chair is aware of the need to keep prodecorum. The Chair is also aware of honourable members stimulating others to 'give it to them', as exI heard. I will ignore that comment. I ask the honourable member for Burke to continue with .",91
242,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES,"I could take on the whole lot of them at once, and so could every other honourable member on this side, and I am ready to do so. Let me continue with the points I am making. The fundamental point is the incoher·ence of the economic policy which attempts to sell off profitable enterprises and then increase taxation in order to pay for government services. This Government will be forced to increase taxes if it sells off profitable public enterprises, if it continues with the sale of TAA, and if it sells off sections of Telecom Australia, Australia Post, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and other public enterprises. I warn the Government that it will be forced into a position where it will have to go to the people and increase taxes on ordinary Australians if it is not prepared to accept public revenue from public enterprises. There is absolutely no reason at all why a profitable public enterprise should be sold off in this disgraceful way in order to fill the pockets of certain individuals and overseas interests. I maintain that this is a half-baked idea which has not been properly thought out but which clearly shows the extreme right wing policies to which the Liberal Party has resorted. The Liberal Party used to be an organisation which at least believed in a certain amount of moderation. We now see extremist policies being put forward, and the Australian people will reject them. The Government has no mandate for this policy. It did not go to the people with this policy. At the next election it will go down because of its attempt to sell TAA and other such enterprises.

243,Mr MORRIS,NOES,"This legislation constitutes a repudiation of firm election promises given by the Government at the last election. This legislation is grounded in conspiracy. It is legislation that is utterly opposed by the Australian Labor Party. I have already MCVeigh, D. T. outlined our arguments against the legislation, but because of the late hour I will not hold the House further by dividing on the issue. The only reason for not dividing is to save the time of the House at this late hour. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. KOONGARRA PROJECT AREA BILL 1981 Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by MrWilsol1: That the Bill be now read a second time. Ml' WEST (Cunningham) (12.16 a.m.)-The purpose of this Bill is once again to confuse the Northern Territory Aboriginals, by allowing uranium mining at Koongarra to proceed in the Kakadu National Park which has already been submitted for inclusion in the World Heritage List. This Bill amends the proclamation of the Governor General of 5 April 1979 which was made under section 7 (2) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 by which an area was excluded from the Kakadu National Park far the Kaangarra mining lease area. Ranger and Jabiluka, the two other major uranium mines, which border the Kakadu National Park, have Australia's largest uranium reserves. Ranger, if it goes ahead, would produce an estimated 110,000 tonnes of yellowcake, and Jabiluka about 206,000 tonnes of yellowcake. Mining at the Ranger proposal would be open cut with an annual production initially planned of 3,000 tonnes of yellowcake with a capacity to increase to 6,000 tonnes. It currently employs 1,560 workers. The permanent jobs are estimated to number only between 250 and 400. Jabiluka plans to use the underground mining technique, with an annual production of 3,000 tonnes of yellowcake. Permanent jobs are expected to number about 880. No other deposits approach the vastness of these reserves. The fact that these mines border the national park poses grave threats to the environmental safety of the park. Despite these threats at least one can say that these mines only border the Kakadu Park. Koongarra, on the other hand, with only 13,300 tonnes of mineable yellowcake, is geographically situated in the middle of the park. The open cut method for the No. 1 orebody is expected to be used in a rapid short term program lasting 18 months to two years. This is a considerable change from the original proposal which expected total production of Koongarra yellowcake to be about 28,000 tonnes. The original estimates aimed to produce 1,500 tonnes of yellowcake annually, but this estimate has now been dropped to 1,000 tonnes annually. Similarly, employment was expected to number 150 permanent jobs, but this has dropped to only 100 permanent jobs. The whole history of this deposit reveals shonky wheeling and dealing. The wholly owned Canadian company, Noranda, originally leased the deposits in 1970. When the Kakadu Park was declared in April 1979 the deposits were excised Second Reading from the park so that it actually became an enclave within the park. Just before the October election last year it was announced in this Parliament that Noranda had sold its interest in Koongarra to another wholly owned Canadian company, Denison. The timing of the announcement was deliberate, to avoid the inevitable uproar and debate about Australian resources being swapped around amongst foreign companies without Australian participation. Denison is still 100 per cent foreign owned. What is happening with the Government's 80called foreign investment and Australian equity policy? The machinations have not stopped there. This Bill represents the worse of these manipulative and deceitful dealings and amounts to a betrayal of the Australian public. Honourable members may remember that the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, as amended in 1978, provided for the declaration of the Kakadu National Park and for leasing of Aboriginal land, granted to traditional owners under the provision of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, by the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to become the Kakadu National Park. The disgraceful exclusion of certain areas from the park, including Ranger and Koongarra, for uranium mining purposes then occurred. Of course, at that time amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act provided for the leasing of former unalienated Crown land then held in trust for the traditional owners· by the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust to the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. By November 1978 these legislative actions had resulted in the traditional owners leasing their newly acquired land to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service minus, of course, the Ranger and Koongarra uranium bearing areas. Then we saw a succession of events. We saw stage one of the Kakadu National Park proclaimed. In April 1980 we saw the draft management plan for the Kakadu National Park released for public comment. By August last year the final management plan was tabled in this Parliament. Only in April of this year the plan of management came into effect. It required 20 days in the Parliament and should have been valid for five years. We now find that Denison Mining wishes to alter the plan of its proposal to provide for the evaporation ponds and the dam to be sited inside the park area. So the purpose of the Koongarra Project Area Bill is to alter the boundaries of Kakadu National Park retrospectively to accede to the demands of Denison Mining. The Government has chosen a particularly dishonourable manner of so proceeding. The Government really had three options and it chose the most heinous and despicable option. Let me explain the three options in case the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) and the Government do not know about them. The original Parks and Wildlife Act 1975 provided for boundary changes under sections 7, 8,9, 10, 11 and 12. Under these sections 60 days should have been allowed for public comment on the proposed boundary alterations. The Director had to consider any comments and make a report to the Executive Council. Then the Executive Council had to consider the Director's report and commend a resolution to this Parliament which then should have been passed by both Houses of Parliament to become effective. The second option for the Koongarra project to proceed involved no boundary changes to the park under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Either the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) and the Northern Land Council had given their approval in writing for uranium mining or the Governor General had declared that it was in the national interest for uranium mining to proceed. Then the Governor General could have given his approval for such operations to be carried out in the Kakadu Park under the plan of management. But if mining operations were allowed in the park under those conditions then several of the conditions would have applied as set out in the management plan and the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service would have determined the environmental standards and would have had control over the operations. But the Government chose a further optionthe most dishonourable, cowardly and precedent setting action as outlined in this Bill. The Government loses control of the Senate on 1 July. The proper option, as provided in the 1975 Act-the Government's own Act; its method and its own mechanism-was eschewed because there was no hope of concluding the arrangements for the alteration before August next. If the Government chose the next option-the mining operation inside the park without a change of boundary-of course, mining would have been under the auspices of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I know that this was recommended by the Service as the preferable option if mining was to proceed-something, however, which the Opposition does not and never will accept. Let me restate the situation. The Government, through this Bill, is retrospectively changing a Governor General's proclamation which defined the park boundaries under the Act and excluded the Ranger and Koongarra areas. The Government is changing that proclamation in retrospect. It would not even abide by its own mechanism set up in the 1975 National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. What a cynically cowardly exercise! The Government and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment will not even abide by their earlier legislation or conduct themselves according to their own rules. Mining should not proceed in Kakadu National Park. The Koongarra area is one of the most scenic places inside the park. What environmentally conscious nation could nominate an area for World Heritage listing and then proceed to mine its most scenic attraction? Only this Government-a bunch of environmental frauds if ever there were-would propose such outrageous nonsense. It is placing the Kakadu Park outside the definitive guidelines as set out by the International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and it could be placing the success of the nomination at risk for the listing has not yet been formally accepted. This Government could be putting it at risk. It is going outside the guidelines set by the World Heritage Council on these matters. Mr Hodges-What about some energy for the Third World countries?",92
244,Mr WEST,NOES,"-I ask the honourable member to wait. Now the Government tells us that we should support this undercover move to change the parameters of Kakadu National Park. It says that the legislation results in a smaller Koongarra mining area which now excludes the Nourlangie escarpment. The Minister points to clause 2 sub-clause (2) of the Bill, which requires that the measures must have the consent of the traditional owners of the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust. This is no concession at all. I hope that the Aboriginals concerned understand this. To be precise, under the existing leasing arrangements arising from both the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, this Aboriginal consent is already required. Any amending proclamation which excises an area from the park will, since the whole park is Aboriginal land, therefore, terminate the leasehold interest of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife Service in that area. Then this area would revert to its original owners, that is, the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust and the traditional owners. The particular excised land would then become subject to sections 40 and 41 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. As this is quite important and exposes the Government's subterfuge in this matter I ask leave of the House to incorporate those sections in Hansard, which will save me reading them out and save the time of the House. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsPART IV-MINING INTERESTS AND MINING 40. (I) A mining interest in not be granted unless(a) both the Minister and the Land Council for the area in which the land is situated have consented, in writing. to the making of the grant; or (b) the Governor General has, by Proclamation, declared that the national interest requires that the grant be made. (2) Where the Minister and a Land Council, after considering proposals placed before them by an applicant for an exploration licence in respect of for the exploration for minerals on that land and the recovery of any minerals found as a result of the exploration, have; for the purposes of sub-section (I), consented to the grant of that licence, that sub-section does person of other mining interests in respect of that land that are in substantial accordance with those proposals. (3) Where the holder of an exploration licence in respect of land applied, before 4 June 1976, for another mining interest in respect of that land, sub-section (1) does not apply to the grant of that other interest. (4) Where, before 4 June 1976, a person was issued with a permit in respect of land under the Petroleum (Prospecting and Mining) Ordinance 1954 of the Northern Territory, as amended from time to time, sub-section (1) does not apply to the grant to that person of a lease under that Ordinance in respect of that land. (5) Sub-section (I) does not apply to the grant to a person of a lease in respect of Aboriginal land under the Petroleum (Prospecting and Mining) Ordinance 1954 of the Northern Territory, as amended from time to time, if that person applied for the grant of such a lease in respect of that land the land became Aboriginal land. (6) If the land, or part of the land, described in Schedule 2, being the land known as the Ranger Project Area, becomes Aboriginal land, sub-section (1) does not apply in relation to that land, or that part of the land. (7) Sub-section (I) does not apply in relation to the land described in Schedule 3, being the land known as the Eastern Areas on Groote Eylandt. 41. (I) The Atomic Energy Act 1953 or any other Act authorizing mining for minerals does not apply in relation to land that is Aboriginal land so as to authorize the entry or remaining of a person on the land or the doing of any act by a person on the land unless(a) the Governor General has, by Proclamation, declared that both the Minister and the Land Council for the area in which the land is situated have consented to the application of that Act in relation to entry on that land; or (b) the Governor General has, by Proclamation, declared that the national interest requires the application of that Act in relation to entry on that land. (2) If the land, or part of the land, deScribed in Schedule 2, being the land known as the Ranger Project Area, becomes Aboriginal land, sub-section (1) does not apply in relation to that land, or that part of the land.",94
245,Mr WEST,NOES,"1 thank the House. Honourable members will understand that sections 40 and 41 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act are the Aboriginal right of veto sections which require the consent of Aboriginal owners to all mining except for land for which petroleum leases were issued before the land became AborOPERATIONS iginal land, the Ranger uranium mining project area and the eastern area on Groote Eylandt. Of respect of Aboriginal land shall course, Koongarra is not included in any of these areas where the veto does not apply. So the Aboriginals have the power of veto anyway, as I have explained. There was no need for the Government to put into this Bill clause 2 sub-clause (2). It is simply a means of trying to persuade the Aboriginals that the Government is giving them something. But I am sure that they will not fall for it. It is history that the Aboriginals were not conAboriginal land, being proposals sulted until after the decision had been made; neither was the National Parks and Wildlife Service consulted. not apply to a later grant to that I wish now to refer to a statement issued by the traditional owners of the Koongarra project on 2 or 3 May this year. To save me from reading out all the statement. I seek the leave of the House to incorporate this statement in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as follows·-NA PROJECT: PRESS RELEASE On Friday I May, a large meeting of traditional owners and the Gagudgu Association Incorporated was held at Patonga in the Kakadu National Park. The meeting was held in response to a letter sent by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, to the Northern Land Council which advised that the before Federal Government had decided to excise a further area from the Kakadu National Park in response from Denison (Australia) Pty Ltd. Denison for some time had been negotiating with the traditional owners of the area through the NLC for the right to mine Koongarra 20km south of the uranium mine at Jabiru. Denison declared that the existing mining lease was unacceptable for their purposes. Denison asked the Federal Government to excise a further area from Kakadu, thereby excluding any control over their mining lease by the ANPWS which presently manages Kakadu Park under a lease from the traditional owners. On 28 April, the NLC received a letter from the Minister which advised that the Federal Government would implement Denison's request. At no time were the traditional owners of the area, the Gagudja Association (the Aboriginal owners of the entire area of the Park) nor the NLC invited to give an opinion about the application of the new lease, although the NLC was aware that a submission was to be made to the Federal Government. Indeed for the owners of the area the very first they heard of the lease question was already implemented. The day after receipt of was held at Patonga to discuss the issue. The meeting lasted two days and was attended by the traditional owners of the mine site, representativcs of the Gagudja association, members of the NLC negotiating team and representatives of the NLC. The traditional owners after considering various options decided to ask the NLC to write opposition to the granting of the new lease. They demanded that the Minister revoke his decision until such time as the traditional owners had been fully and until they had had the opportunity of having advice from their own advisors as to possible effects the excision would have on the management of the Kakadu Park. They also resolved to immediately suspend all negotiations until further notice with Denison in respect of the Koongarra project. They further demanded that Denison cease having any contact with the Aboriginal people of the area. The traditional owners expressed their absolute disappointment with the Minister regardless sultation by himself, his office and those who went before them could again make decisions about what would happen about Aboriginal land. As the traditional owners asked ""How can it be that the Minister can give our land away to a mining company without asking what we want"". This is not self determination. This is the same as always. White fellahs making their own decisions about what is good for Aborigines.",95
246,Mr WEST,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"I thank the House. I would like to quote briefly from that statement. It states: The traditional owners expressed their absolute disappointment with the Minister regardless of the rhetoric about consultation by himself, his office and those who went before them could again make decisions about what would happen about Aboriginal land . As the traditional owners asked 'How could it be that the Minister could give our land away to a mining company without asking what we want'. This is not self determination. It is the same as always. White fellahs making their own decisions about what is good for Aborigines. r trust the Aboriginals will continue to latest Government manoeuvre. After all, as I have explained, they have the power to prevent this extremely dangerous precedent from being established. 1 trust the Aboriginals will not be bamboozled by slick lawyers or Government members saying they must accede to this outrageous denial of their rights-for reasons such as that uranium mining is inevitable anyway, or that the new area is less environmentally sensitive than the current leasehold and so on. They will say anything to confuse and bamboozle the Aboriginals into accepting what the Government decided before it even consulted them. Even if this latter point were true, I trust the Aboriginals concerned-the traditional owners, the Northern Land Council and the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust-will rethe Denison application had been alise that next time the Government wishes to change the park boundaries to accommodate the lctter by the NLC a meeting overseas mining companies the area concerned may be an area of intense sacred significance to them. That will not prevent the Fraser Government from interfering with Aboriginal land by the introduction of further legislation. In short, T think the Aboriginal traditional owners will and to the Minister and declare their should remember Noonkanbah. The Opposition also opposes this legislation beconsulted regarding the matter cause of the obvious precedent it sets and the poor example it gives to future Federal and present State governments. What a great example to give to Mr Bjelke-Petersen in Queensland who now threatens Moreton Island with sand mining and the Great Barrier Reef with oil drilling! The Queensland Premier knows this Government will not stand up to him. That is why he has refused for so long even to name his Ministers-although of the rhetoric about conhe may have just done that-to attend the time wasting ministerial council meetings on the Great Barrier Reef so he can prevent any more of the reef being declared a marine park. What a wonderful bonus this Bill is to the enemies of national parks in the Northern Territory and Queensland. We do not tamely accept the Minister's statement that the new area will be less sensitive to damage; not at all. Concerning the revised open cut mining and rapid short term program, it states: I quote the report on the project circulated by the Denison mining company: A number of environmental advantages are involved, such as the reduction of the permanent workforce on site, reduction of radiation doses received by pitworkers; reduction of pit dewatering time and thus reduction of quantities of waters to be stored allowing reduced evaporation pond areas and flexibility to the water management scheme. There we have all the horrors exposed, and the bland remarks by the company as to how to reduce them. How nice it is to know that the workers' doses of radiation will be less because of resist this the reduced time scale and that the threat of water contamination is slightly reduced for the same reason! The report entitled 'Development of the Alligator Rivers Uranium Deposit', compiled by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in January 1980, assessed the Koongarra area as being 'of high national park value'. The report states: Any water pollution arising [rom the operations of Koongarra would be a potential threat to the very valuable wildlife of the W oolwonga wetlands. The proposal to build the tailings dam in a natural drainage system gives further ground for concern since it means that, over the long term, as the dam wall and other protective works deteriorated the tailings would probably be subject to erosion. Do honourable members opposite realise that tailings from uranium mining can give off radon gas, which is carcinogenic, for 100,000 years? Yet the people involved expect to store this material in clay dams in a wetlands area of the Northern Territory. How long will it stay there? Where is their responsibility to future generations? We cannot take any comfort from the statement in the Minister's speech that the most important feature of the new mining plan outlined in the environmental impact statement is that it provides for a system of water management which has a no release objective. He is talking about an area with one of the highest rainfalls in the world. Similarly, his assertions that the project has undergone comprehensive analysis in line with Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act requirements are meaningless. Such so called analysis has never yet prevented dangerous projects from proceeding. Neither can we take comfort from the Denison mining company's report on the water management system being based on this famous no release objective. The objective is fine; the question is whether such an objective can be achieved. In the words of that company's report, the objective is: There will be no intentional release of waters from the milling and run-off waters from the disturbed areas of the project to the environment. The problem remains, what if there is an unintentional release of contaminated waters? The protection offered to the environment is based entirely on the supposition that there will be no accidents and no unforeseen hazards. Of course, the answer to that assertion can be seen by everyone. We need only look as far as the Three Mile Island accident in the United States. The authorities still have not been successful in cleaning that up. Again, the report states: The water management system does not rely on the establishment of water quality standards as there will be to the environment. All this means is that there are no safeguards and no environmental protection in the case of the unexpected. Theoretical models provide no guarantee for reality. Koongarra, as I have said, is in one of the highest rainfall areas in the world. What happens if contaminated waters are released? Not only is Koongarra an enclave in the national park but also it is upsteam of the Woolwonga wildlife sanctuary. Koongarra is situated in the Nourlangie Creek catchment in a great and beautiful valley upstream from the sanctuary, in the second major catchment area in the national park. Any contamination in this area threatens, to quote the Fox report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, 'the most important refuge and habitat for aquatic wildlife in the Northern Territory'. Justice Fox opposed mining at Koongarra on the following grounds: We would oppose in principle any mining development upstream of itThat is, the Woolwonga areauntil it had been demonstrated by experience that it could take place without environmental damage. What sort of experience has been gained? None; there is no experience at all. I turn now in my concluding remarks to the economic and market effects of what is happening in Australia. Last year the United States produced over 11,000 tonnes of uranium, one and a half times domestic annual consumption, in excess of its needs for nuclear power generation. This is indicative of the overproduction throughout the world. In 1978 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated world surpluses between 1982 and 1985 of almost 24,000 tonnes each year, and overproduction will continue until the year 2000. World demand has not increased at the rate forecast in the mid-1970s. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission predicted in 1975 that world demand would be 107,500 tonnes in 1985 and 157,500 tonnes by 1990. Yet in 1980 the Commining. mission revised the estimate downwards by almost 65 per cent to 39,000 tonnes in 1985 and 54,000 tonnes by 1990. The reduced project demands coupled with a crash in the price of uranium from $43 a pound in mid-1979 to $25 a pound in January 1981 have put an economic cloud over many of these projects touted to proceed in Australia during the 1980s. Already it looks as though the Mary Kathleen project will be folding due to the drop in prices. If the nine mines which may proceed in the 1980s get the go ahead-I refer to Ranger, Jabiluka, Yeelirrie, Koongarra, Beverley, Honeymoon, Lake Way, Ben Lomond and Roxby no release Downs-Australia could be producing at least 14,200 tonnes a year, at a conservative estimate. Yet even the AAEC expects Australia to be able to capture only 20 per cent, or between 8,000 and 9,000 tonnes a year, of the world market by 1990. What will we do with the extra 6,000 tonnes of uranium produced in Australia each year? Will we stockpile it or simply flog it on the world market at bargain basement prices with the Australian public picking up the tab to subsidise the mines if necessary? Of the multiplicity of projects proposed, which ones will be approved; which ones will proceed? No doubt the States and the Northern Territory would allow them all to proceed but the companies may not be happy to proceed without guaranteed markets. The Northern Territory Minister, Mr Tuxworth, stated a few days ago that if Jabiluka and Koongarra did not go ahead by 1985 they would not be goers at all. If Jabiluka cannot proceed, what chance will projects such as Honeymoon, Beverley, Ben Lomond, et cetera have? These three aforementioned projects, as well as Koongarra, are also environmentally damaging as well as being commercially dubious. Beverley and Honeymoon use the environmentally dangerous method of in situ leaching of uranium ore, which may contaminate the water table and affect the quality of the water of the artesian basin. Koongarra, as I mentioned earlier, is in the Nourlangie catchment area upstream of the most important wildlife refuge and habitat for aquatic wildfowl in the Northern Territory. As I said, Justice Fox specifically recommended that it not proceed.Irrespective of the environmental hazards of the various projects, their economics make them millstones around the neck of Australia. Since they will have problems finding markets, their uranium may be sold off at cut rate prices, with the Commonwealth providing subsidies to cover the costs. The reduction in world demand for uranium can be attributed mainly to the problems of nuclear safety and a general turn away from nuclear power. The Japanese nuclear power industry is reeling from the disclosure that this year there have been four or five major leaks from the Tsuruga power station which were not reported by the company. Several tonnes of radioactive water leaked into the sea and caused abnormally high radioactivity in the seabed. Measurement of this heightened level of radioactivity led to the discovery of the spill and revealed the cover-up by the company. Officials believe that the ground under the plant could be contaminated and that 278 workers may have received excessive radiation. The Tsuruga reactor has been closed for six months, but its effects, like those of the more famous Three Mile Island plant, will be felt in the world's uranium market and will seriously affect the viability of new Australian projects coming on stream in the 1980s. I conclude by pointing out that the Government is not pressing for Koongarra on economic or environmental grounds, but rather to maintain its face as agung ho 'development at all costs' government and to keep in step with like minded State governments. Justice Fox recommended against Koongarra, the Aboriginal traditional owners are opposed to it, the markets are not there, yet the Government is proposing to disregard provisions of its legislation to achieve boundary changes to allow Koongarra to proceed. This is a travesty of the parliamentary system and must be condemned. Koongarra should not proceed. The Opposition will stand by its anti-uranium mining policy and will vote against this despicable legislation.",96
247,Mr TAMBLING,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"The Koongarra Project Area Bill is ofimmense importance to the Northern Territory. It is a progressive step for the Government to take in its uranium policies. Because the Bill relates to uranium mining it has engendered much emotional debate in the community-debate on issues that are far removed from what this Bill sets out to do. For that reason, I would like not only to place the Koongarra development in its context but also to dispel some of the more fanciful myths that have been peddled to belittle this legislation. This Bill has one objective-to alter the boundaries of the Koongarra project area. It does not give approval for mining to take place. It does not change the status of Aboriginal land. It does not supersede Commonwealth environmental legislation. I will deal with those matters later. Exploration for uranium in the Northern Territory first commenced in 1947. The first important discovery was made in 1949 at Rum Jungle, 64 kilometres south of Darwin. This find initiated a short but intense prospecting boom that resulted in the discovery of 12 small but high grade uranium-gold deposits in the South Alligator River area 220 kilometres south east of Darwin. Treatment plants were established in both Rum Jungle and the south east Alligator Rivers region. The latter operated between 1959 and 1964 and produced 800 tonnes of uranium oxide. The Rum Jungle plant operated between 1954 and 1971 and produced 3,500 tonnes of U 30 S' In 1967 the Government announced an export policy for uranium which was designed to encourage exploration for new uranium deposits. Subsequent exploration revealed significant new deposits at Nabarlek, Jabiru, Jabiluka and Koongarra. Those four sites contain over 330,000 tonnes of U 30 S and there is potential for further discoveries in the region. Indeed, only last week Energy Resources of Australia raised its probable and possible reserves at its No.3 ore body at Ranger by 24 per cent, or 13,800 tonnes. To gain an idea of the importance of the region and the magnitude of these projects, suffice it to say that the total estimated capital expenditure in the uranium province on these developments is in excess of $1 ,000m. In 1968 Noranda Australia Ltd began exploring for uranium in the Northern Territory as part of a wider program of mineral exploration it had begun several years earlier. In 1970 the company discovered in the Alligator Rivers region the uranium deposits now known as Koongarra. By mid-1971 investigations showed that the deposit was a major energy resource and that development was technically feasible and economically viable. In May 1972 Noranda and other companies with exploration rights in the region joined the Commonwealth in commissioning the Alligator Rivers study-a series of investigations undertaken during 1972-73 which provided a valuable inventory of the environment of the region. In 1976 Noranda applied for a special minerallease of 12.5 square kilometres, which was considered appropriate for the then proposed project area. The following year the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development directed Noranda, pursuant to the administrative procedures under the Environmental Protection Act, to prepare and submit to him an environmental impact statement. This was published in December 1978. In its environmental impact statement the company presented a revised concept requiring the tailings and evaporation ponds to be located outside the lease application area. One of the reasons for this was the reservations expressed by Mr Justice Fox in the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry about mining in this area. It certainly intrigues me that opponents of the Koongarra development are obsessed with quoting Justice Fox's reservations as a means of defeating this proposal. They completely ignore that it is partially in response to Justice Fox's reservations that the proposal to alter the boundaries has come about. The proposal contained within the Bill is to alter the boundaries of an area which has already been excised from the park following the whole review process entailed in the Ranger inquiry. Therein lies the most important feature of the new mining plan. The new boundaries provide for a system of water management which has a no-release objective. Being a self-contained system, it would not affect the Nourlangie Creek catchment or the Woolwonga Wildlife Sanctuary. Such a proposal can hardly be described as 'environmental vandalism', as the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) would like us to believe. It should be pointed out that the revised project area is actually smaller than the area now excluded from the park. Furthermore, the area to be added to the park will include the area adjacent to the Nourlangie Rock-Mt Brockman massif. Not only is this area environmentally important, but also it has great traditional significance to the Aboriginal people of the area. Critics of the Koongarra project are touting this proposal as a gift of Aboriginal land to a mining company. There is no question of this Government giving away Aboriginal land to mining companies. It should be understood that, regardless of whether the project area is in or out of the national park, it remains Aboriginal land. Moreover, no lease can be granted over the area to Denison Mines Ltd until the Aboriginals have concluded an agreement with the company. It is worth stressing that this Bill contains a specjfic provision that the changes will not take place unless Aboriginal consent to the project is forthcoming. The only confusion in the whole area is that which has been induced by the honourable member for Cunningham. As I mentioned before, this Bill in no way supersedes environment legislation, nor does it bypass the foreign investment guidelines. If anyone has any doubts about this I refer him to a question answered in this House on 24 February by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). He said: . . . the object of the environment protection legislation had been met and complied with in relation to the Koongarra project . . . On Australian ownership he said: It will be necessary for 75 per cent equity participation. On this matter where does the Australian Labor Party really stand? On 29 April this year the Northern Territory Opposition Leader, John Isaacs, issued an apology for a public statement on Koongarra, ostensibly opposing all forms of mining in the Kakadu National Park. It is the most wishy-washy statement that the Northern Territory Opposition Leader has come up with to date. He said: It's the location we object to, not mining per se. The ALP would rather write off the expected $1,OOOm capital investment in the region. That is the only conclusion I can draw from Mr Isaacs statement. He also said: The exclusion of Kakadu from any form of mining development would have an insignificant effect on the predicted value of this boom. He then apologised for such stupid ALP policies. He said: . . . the economic impact of the decision not to mine would, fortunately, be less severe. The ALP in the Northern Territory spends most of its time nowadays trying to dissociate itself from the embarrassing anti-uranium mining policies which it knows the electorate will not buy and which its federal colleagues have adopted. The Northern Territory ALP must really cherish its colleague, the honourable member for Cunningham, the alternative Minister for Environment when he says: A Federal Labor government will repudiate any commitments made by a non-Labor government for mining, processing or export of uranium and we will demand a moratorium on uranium mining. The Koongarra Project Area Bill is a sensible piece of legislation and a major step forward for the uranium industry. I urge that it be passed without delay.",98

250,Mr UREN,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. As I understood from the lists given to both the Opposition and the Government I was to be the next speaker. Can you inform me why I was not called?",100
251,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"The Chair informs the honourable member for Reid that the list currently before it indicates that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is to be next called. I point out to the honourable member for Reid that the Chair's only commitment is to alternate from left to right and call the member first rising. In this case the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Reid rose together. Established practice in this House is that a list is provided for the guidance of the Chair which, it hopes, is the product of sweet accord between the Whips and members of the respective parties. In this situation, as both members rose simultaneously, the Chair is inclined to be guided by the list which is prepared on the instruction of the Whip.",100
252,Mr UREN,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"May I correct you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I understood the list on both the Opposition side and the Government side, I was to be the next speaker. If that list has been altered it has been altered without my knowledge.",100
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,The honourable member for Reid is quite correct insomuch as the original list showed the order of speakers consistent with the case he has presented.,100

255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"The honourable member's argument is with the Whip, not the Chair. I call the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",100
256,Mr HOLDING,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"It is regrettable that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) in defending this legislation has established himself primarily as an exponent of uranium mining. Not once in his speech was he concerned to deal with the environmental factors that this proposal involves. Not once did he concern himself with the rights of traditional owners. Of all the legislation that has emanated from the Fraser Government this is the saddest and the most contemptible. It is contemptible because it contemplates a gross abuse of the legislative process. It is the saddest because it constitutes one more betrayal of Aboriginal hopes and aspirations. This Bill contemplates the Parliament's not complying with the procedures of its own legislation at the request of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson). The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act contemplates parks and reserves being established by the Governor General by proclamation. Once proclaimed, any exclusion of any area shall not be made except by resolution passed by each House of the Parliament by a motion which must be before each House for 15 sitting days before being moved. It seems to me to be extraordinary that the Parliament in its wisdom has decided the course which must be followed by this House and the Senate in dealing with any additions or alterations to the Governor General's proclamation in respect of the creation of a national park. It is extraordinary that from time to time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other Ministers say that trade unionists must comply with the law and that parliamentarians are pledged to uphold the laws made by the Parliament. Yet in this situation the very procedures which have been established by this House have not been adhered to, nor has there been any attempt to adhere to them. This is a Bill by which the Minister asks the Parliament to deem that those procedures have been followed. What a novel concept that is. Every member of this House knows that the procedures established by the will of the Parliament have not been followed. If members of parliament are not prepared to comply with the spirit and, indeed, the letter of their own legislation, how can they command respect from the rest of the community? This legislation has all the worse defects of retrospective legislation. It has one more defect. Not only is it retrospective but also it asks the Parliament-it seems to me to come very close to being a contempt of the Parliament-to support what the Minister knows is a retrospective lie. He knows that the procedures established by the Parliament have not been followed. We all know that. So we have this device by which all the members here will say to the community at large: 'Although we know the procedures established by the Parliament for dealing with this legislation have not been followed and have been deliberately ignored what we will do is deem that they have been followed'. That is a very dangerous precedent. I believe any parliament which adopts that approach on any form of legislation is bound ultimately to hold itself up to public ridicule and contempt. We cannot as parliamentarians require the average citizen to comply with the laws of the Parliament, we cannot ask the average COl'POTation, trade union, trade unionist or company director, to comply with laws which we have passed but, when it suits the Executive or the Minister, introduce a Bill and simply tear up Acts of the Parliament. What is the purpose of this? Not only does the Minister choose to legislate in this way; but also we have to ask ourselves why, when the procedures are so clearly established, does the Minister choose to legislate in this way. The answer is very simple. His purpose is simply to ram this legislation through both Houses before the political composition of the Senate changes to reflect more accurately the views of the Australian people. That in itself is a thoroughly bad principle. The honourable member for the Northern Territory referred to the environmental impact statement produced on behalf of the Koongarra project. If he had looked at that November 1977 impact statement he would have seen at page 2-180 and page 2 208 a map which accords, in all respects, with the boundaries proposed by the Bill. That is to say, in November 1979 in respect of the submission and environmental impact statement, what was contemplated by the Koongarra people was the very outlines of the very map now before this Parliament. I find it extraordinary that in the nomination dated May 1980, which goes from this Parliament to the World Heritage List, the old boundaries are indicated on the map on page 12 of the accompanying submission. Of course, that is the old map. What an extraordinary situation! Koongarra in November 1979 used the map shown in the Bill but in the submission on behalf of the Government to get the Kakadu National Park listed in the World Heritage List we are using the map which is about to be changed if the Bill is passed. I believe that that also is ation which needs some explanation. J believe that the Government's actions in regard to this legislation must put in jeopardy the seri-,)Us consideration of the Australian application for the inclusion of Kakadu in the World Heritage List. It is indeed novel that while specifying the uniqueness of the environment-the habitat of flora and fauna and the fact that this area contains one of the world's great prehistoric art collections-the Government produces legislation which must be unique-in order to extend mining within that very area. Of course, if the honourable member for the Northern Territory had been completely frank with the House he would have pointed out that the Koongarra submission concedes that if this proposal is passed three important art sites will be directly affected. They will be covered by dumped waste material. Another nine sites will be indirectly affected. It is a strange thing that the honourable member for the Northern Territory, who quoted from the environmental impact statement, misstated those very facts. My colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) will enlarge upon aspects of the Fox report. I will leave that matter to him. However, I will now turn to what I believe is the very serious treatment of the traditional owners. By legislative enactment this Parliament gave the traditional owners of the land their rights in fee simple. They are the owners of the land. Their rights are as enforceable in law as are the rights of the Prime Minister in respect of his property at Nareen. Earlier this week the Parliament was told how the Minister for Communications (Mf Sinclair) was not only concerned to discuss with Mr Murdoch and the Packer interests important legislation dealing with communication but was also happy to give them the draft legislation. We were told that that discussion was continuing. Those people made suggestions to the Minister and the Minister made suggestions to them. Pieces of draft legislation were floating around. I suppose the Prime Minister would justify that action on the basis that it involved consultation with interested and affected parties. Can there be any more serious interference with the rights of an individual-particularly by a government which prides itself on preserving the rights of the individual and talks about the rights of private property-than a situation in which the rights of an owner of property are affected by legislation of this kind without any consultation? What is it that gives the Packer and Murdoch interests the a situright to an ongoing and very considered consultation and the capacity to affect legislation that the Parliament has not even seen? On the other hand traditional Aboriginal owners can have their rights to property affected by legislation without discussion, consultation or any involvement. I refer the House to the Press release of the traditional owners of the Koongarra project. To save time. I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as followsPRESS RELEASE. BY TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF On Friday 1st Maya large meeting of Traditional Owners and the Gagudgu Association Kakadu National Park. The meeting was held in response to a letter sent by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Baume) to the Northern Land Council which advised that the Federal Government had decided to excise a further area from the Kakadu Park in response to a request from Denison (Australia) Pty Ltd. Denison have for some time been negotiating with the traditional owners of the area, through the Northern Land Council, for the right to mine uranium south of the uranium mine at J abiru. Denison declared that the able for their proposed mine. Denison asked the Federal Government to excise a further area from the Kakadu Park, thereby excluding any control over their mining lease by the ANPWS which presently manages the Kakadu Park under a lease from the traditional Aboriginal owners. On the 28th April, the letter from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume which advised that the Federal Government would implement Denison's request. At no time were the traditional owners of the area, the Kakadu Association (the Aboriginal owners of the entire area of the Park) nor the Northern Land Council invited to give an opinion about the application for the new lease, although the Northern Land Council were aware that a submission was to be made to the Federal Government. Indeed, for the owners of of the lease question was that Denison's application had been already implemented. The day after receipt of the letter by the Northern Land Council, a meeting was held at Patonga to discuss the issue. The meeting lasted two days and was attended by the traditional owners of the mine resentatives of the Gagadju Northern Land Council negotiating team and representatives of the Northern Land Council. The traditional owners, after considering various options, decided to ask the Northern Land Council to write to' the Minister and declare their opposition to the granting of the new lease. They demanded that the Minister revoke his decision until such time as the traditional owners had been fully consulted regarding the matter and until they had the opportunity of having from their own advisors as to possible effects the excision would have on the management of the Kakadu Park. They also resolved to immediately suspend all negotiations until further notice with Denison (Australia) Pty Ltd in respect of the Koongarra Project. They further demanded that Denison cease having any contact with the Aboriginal people of the area. The traditional owners expressed their absolute disappointment that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs regardless of the rhetoric about consultation by who went before them could again make decisions about what would happen to Aboriginal land. As the traditional owners ask 'How can it be that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs can give our land away to a mining company without asking what we think' this is not self determination, this is the same as always, white fellahs making their own decisions about what is good for Aboriginals. Further Enquiries: To be made through Gagadju Association, Mr Ross Hebblewhite. Phone 81 4228.",100
257,Mr HOLDING,TRADITIONAL OWNERS OF KOONGARRA,"I will quote from the very NA last sentence of the Press release. This is the voice of the traditional owners: Inc. was held at Patonga in the As the traditional owners ask 'How can it be that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs can give our land away to a mining company without asking what we think' this is not self determination, this is the same as always, white fellas making their own decisions about what is good for Aboriginals. In respect of the recommendations of the Fox report I wish only to make a comment about a matter which was not mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech. It is not for this side of at Koongarra, which is 20km the House to argue the veracity of the Fox report. existing mining lease was unsuitIf we are not going to comply with those recommendations the onus is clearly upon the Government to say why the House should ignore those findings. That has not occurred. If this legislation is passed in this form and ramroded right through this Parliament and the Senate, what it Northern Land Council received a does-Mr Fisher-Don't say it again.",102
258,Mr HOLDING,KOONGARRA PROJECT,"I suspect that if this was happening to any of the honourable member's constituents such as the farmers he would be heard to complain. I am not going to give lip service or support-no one on this side of the House the area, the very first they heard would give such support-to legislation which does not comply with the processes or the standards which the House has set itself and which interferes with the rights of owners of property. The Koongarra people are traditional Aboriginal owners. Although some members of the National site and surrounding areas, repAssociation, the members of the Country Party might choose to treat them as second class citizens with second class rights, that is not the view of the Opposition. Of course, the passage of this legislation is designed to do one more thing. The honourable member for the Northern Territory clearly gave away the intentions of the Government. Does anybody seriously believe that the honourable member does not think that mining will proceed? That was the basis of his whole speech. When this legislation goes through the Parliament all the pressure will be asserted on the traditional owners by the mining companies, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister. They will say: 'You are going to have mining; like it or leave it. Although we will make public statements saying we will not do anything without himself, his officers and those your approval, the only right you really have is to approve mining'. That is the position that this Government takes. That is what this legislation is about. The Opposition is totally opposed to this legislation because it does not comply with the processes which the House itself has established. It clearly involves a great breach of the legislative process. We are opposed to the legislation because traditional Aboriginal legal land owners are having their rights eroded in a way which constitutes a public scandal. Finally, we are opposed to it because it is simply an attempt to pressure traditional owners to give their approval to uranium mining. I will finish on this note and quote what I believe are some words of nobility by that great Australian author, Xavier Herbert, which I believe, ought to be constantly quoted in this House when we are dealing with Aboriginal affairs. He says: Until we give back to the blackman just a bit of the land that was his, and give it without provisos, without snatch it back, without complete generosity cession for the evil we have done him-until we do that, we shall remain what we have always out integrity, not a nation, but a community of thieves.",102
259,Mr UREN,KOONGARRA PROJECT,"-At this early hour in the morning in the stealth with which we are putting through this important piece of legislation, it is important to consider two important aspects. First of an the Koongarra Project Area Bill deals with one of the major gems of our national heritage and a gem of world heritage. We are also dealing with a question of substance which is basic to one of the most serious problems, which, in fact, can end mankind. Uranium mining-Government members hate to be reminded of this-cannot be divorced from the interrelationship with the nuclear industry which, in due turn, is interrelated with nuclear weapons and in turn with nuclear war. What Government members always want to forget are the recommendations and findings of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry report set out at page 185. The report states: 3. The nuclear power industry is unintentionally ting to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. It does not matter whatever one does; one cannot divorce the peaceful uses from the warlike uses of nuclear industry. That is one aspect. Another aspect of the nuclear power industry is that it is sick and stagnant in the northern hemisphere. Later I will show the House certain figures to prove the fact that the nuclear industry economically is stagnant and sick. Forecast growth is falling sadly. I will show the House reports of Australian atomic energy interests on that aspect. The real price of uranium oxide, in fact, is only half the price it was five years ago. These are just some of the aspects. I want to emphasise and interrelate the serious aspects that we are now talking about in regard to a national park with the spread of nuclear weapons which the third finding and recommendation of the Fox report deals with. Of course, at the time of the Fox inquiry's examination we knew that India had got the bomb by stealth. Now we know that Israel has got the bomb by stealth. We know that South Africa has got the bomb by stealth. We know that Pakistan is well on the way to getting the bomb by stealth. We know that during the recent conflict in the Middle East, Israel thought that Iraq was on the way to getting the bomb by stealth. Some of the major statesmen in the world believe that within a short term-a decade-anything up to 20 nations in the world could have the bomb. In these early hours, when the newspapers have been put to bed, when we strings to are not on the air, we are discussing this of spirit in COIllegislation. been so far, a people withThis Bill is a disgraceful and cynical piece of legishtion. Its purpose is to short-circuit the normal procedures for altering the boundaries of a national park. They are reasonable procedures, but this Government is sweeping them aside so that it can alter the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park to suit a 100 per cent foreign owned uranium mining company, Denison (Australia) Pty Ltd. The reason for the Government's manipulation are blatant and cynical. At the federal election last October nearly 52 per cent of the electorate voted for two parties-the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats--which oppose the mining and export of uranium. Those parties, after 30 June, will have half the seats and therefore half the votes in the Senate. That is why this legislation is being pushed through in the stealth of the night. Under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act there has to be 60 days for public comcontribu- ment on proposed changes to national park boundaries. After that both Houses of Parliament have to support the change. This procedure is a reasonable safeguard to protect national parks which have been set aside for the benefit of generations to come. National parks should not be subject to short term interests and political manipulation by governments. This Government is manipulating in the interests of wealthy mining companies and foreign mining companies at that. That is why there should be 60 days for public comment and the support of both Houses of Parliament before any changes take place. The Government's action undermines those procedures. Its intention is to thwart the majority vote against uranium mining at the last election, which will be reflected in the Senate after 30 June. This Bill is an abuse of the parliamentary institution and an affront to the Australian people. It demonstrates this Government's scant regard for democracy. The Government certainly has no understanding of the democratic procedures or environmental procedures. The Government's fiddle becomes even more serious when one considers that it was this Government which nominated the Kakadu National Park to be part of the World Hertitage List. It is a national disgrace that this Government nominates the park as part of the World Heritage List and then in such a cavalier fashion brings this piece of legislation before the House. The Government's action opens up a Pandora's box for the future. Think about it. You are a Queenslander, Mr Deputy Speaker. Think about the implications of the same attitudes on the question of the Great Barrier Reef, of what can happen with the procedures that have come down under this piece of legislation. The Government has fiddled with the boundaries of national parks to suit the conveniences and expediencies of the day. It is a shameful and irresponsible precedent which poses a threat to our national parks everywhere. The Bill highlights once again the absurdity of the Kakadu National Park as declared by this Government. The Government has left a series of mining reservations in the middle of the Kakadu National Park area out of the park. These are at Ranger, Jabiluka and Koongarra. Uranium mining is to take place at these locations. This destroys the whole concept of a national park. I stress that one cannot isolate areas in the middle of a complex and fragile ecosystem. These artificial boundaries in no way change the interrelationships of the ecological system. The uranium mines are a threat to the sensitive and beautiful wetlands which are downstream and within the national park. This is particularly true for the Koongarra project which is upstream of the Woolwonga Wildlife Sanctuary and in the South Alligator River catchment area. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) knows, the interrelationship in those wetlands is very important because of the floods that occur, because of the Aboriginal people's relationship in having to fish in the way they do, particularly in the lagoons in the dry seasons. This is the saddest thing. This is why the second report of the Fox inquiry said that if we go ahead with mining we affect all the interrelationships which are set down in that second volume. This second volume of the Fox report has been torn up and thrown out because of the hypocrisy of this Government. The Government has by-passed and prostituted this document, which set down the guidelines if mining were to proceed. With the Koongarra in operation as well as the Ranger project, both the major river systems of the region-the East Alligator and the South Alligator-would suffer the environmental effects of uranium mining. The Fox report clearly intended that if the mining were to proceed it should be restricted to the East Alligator catchment for the time being. It is envisaged that the South Alligator catchment be protected. The second Fox report also stated that the Woolwonga area is valuable ecologically and that we should oppose in principle any mining development upstream, at least until it has been demonstrated by experience that it can take place without environmental damage, and 1 stress the word 'experience'. I challenge Government members to tell me what experience they can point to as an example for saying that this legislation should go forward. Again, I draw the attention of honourable members to the second Fox report, which stated that if the Government were to go ahead with uranium mining then quite clearly the development should be sequential. The report warned against the development of both areas. If development is carried out at Koongarra and at the same time at the Ranger project, two catchment areas will be affected. That shows the stupidity and blundering of this Government. The terribly sad things about the issue is that we do not know enough about this delicate environment. We were warned that we have to be aware of what is going on. We just cannot go ahead with these procedures. We are drawing on experience. The fact is that so many blunders have been made in the past. That is why this second report went into such detail, and that is why we are asking the Government to give consideration to this matter even at this late hour. Might I say that even the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), at the time he announced the Government's uranium decision, recognised the environmental sensitivity of Koongarra. On 25 August 1977 he stated: That deposit has particular environmental problems because of the sensitivity and fragility of the environment of the area and the location of the deposit upstream of a major wetlands area. That was said by the Prime Minister on 25 August 1977. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) to tell the House what has happened since the time the Prime Minister made his statement on 25 August 1977. What has changed? The fact is that nothing has changed. The Government is under pressure from the wealthy mining companies. That is the situation. This Government really represents corporate capital. It does not represent the Australian people and our national heritage, it represents corporate capital particularly that of foreign corporations. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a Queenslander, and no doubt you are proud of it, to make sure that you express your views within your own party room. Unless you do, they will do more of this. You will find that next the Government will be into exploiting the mineral aspects of the Great Barrier Reef. As with so many of the Government's promises on uranium, it now seems that the interests of the mining companies will override environmental considerations. I think I have set the case clear on that situation. It is no good the Minister simply saying that there will be no problems because the company plans a 'no water release policy'. If there were a breach in the tailings dam at Koongarra the consequences for the wetlands in the South Alligator River could be very serious, and I give honourable members an example. There is a history of this sort of thing occurring in uranium mines. Only two years ago a modern tailings dam at the United States uranium mine at Church Rock in New Mexico burst, releasing radioactive water across Indian lands. The implications of this spill were so great that the water supply of southern California was contaminated. The consequences of such a spill occurring at Koongarra would be devastating for the Kakadu National Park. The Minister has said that his Department has examined the Koongarra environmental impact statement and the overall physical consequences of the proposal will fall within acceptable and manageable limits. That is a pretty vague statement which entails a considerable amount of judgment. Let them make the statement available for assessment and scrutiny by the Parliament. The statement has not been put before the Parliament or the public. Why does not the Minister make it available to the public? Let independent scientists examine it to see whether they agree with the Department's assessment. Let the public judge whether the limits of environmental damage are acceptable and manageable. USA Units orders Cancellations and deferrals JapanUnits ordered . West GermanyUnits ordered FranceUnits ordered These are judgments which should be made explicitly and in an open fashion, not behind the closed doors of a government department. After all, it is a part of the world heritage with which we are dealing, as well as a part of our national heritage. That is what is involved. The Minister has said that the Bill does not mean that the Government has approved the Koongarra project. That statement rings very hollow indeed. Why has the Government gone to such extraordinary lengths to thwart the will of the people if it has not made up its mind to give the go-ahead to this uranium project? It sounds like those hollow assurances of 1976, when the Fox inquiry was still under way. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) came into this House day after day and said: 'We have not made up our minds yet'. The fact is that the Government, and particularly the Deputy Prime Minister, are doing everything in their power to get the Koongarra project under way. In doing so, once again it has thrown out the key recommendations of the Fox report and gone back to one of its undertakings of 1977, as expressed in the Prime Minister's statement. It is a pity that the Government does not wake up to the real situation in the nuclear industry throughout the world. Up until the election of President Mitterrand, France was the only Western country where there had been any consistent growth in the nuclear industry. Now even that is in doubt. I am sure that the socialist government in France will eventually respond to people's questioning of and opposition to nuclear programs. Only last week President Mitterrand announced that a planned 6,000 megawatt nuclear power scheme in Brittany was to be cancelled. That is the pattern throughout the world. To give some indication of the cancellations of new orders for nuclear power stations which have occurred since 1972, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the position. Leave granted. The table read as followsNEW ORDERS OF NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS SINCE 1972 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 34 47 24 7 3 4 2 2 7 9 18 4 3 6 14 16 5 3 3 5 5 2 3 5 7 7 8 8 9 5 United Kingdom Units ordered OECDU nits ordered .",103
260,Mr UREN,KOONGARRA PROJECT,"I thank the House. I will run briefly through the list. In the US in 1978 two nuclear power station units were ordered, none in 1979, none in 1980, and six cancellations and deferrals were received in 1978. In 1979 there were 14 cancellations and in 1980 there were 16. If we look at Japan, we see that for the three-year period no new units were ordered. In West Germany no new units have been ordered since 1976. In France five units were ordered in 1980. In the UK four units were ordered, and in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries a total of nine were ordered, of course, that number is just the British and French orders. To give some indication of the annual forecasts of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in relation to the requirements of the Western world for uranium, I seek leave to incorporate a table in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsNA NA NA EACH OF THE LAST SIX YEARS. (in thousand tonnes u/yr).

261,Mr UREN,AUSTRALIAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION IN,"I thank the House. I have only a few seconds in which to run through the table. Honourable members will see that in 1975 the Atomic Energy Commission forecast that the Western world required 55.5 tonnes by 1980 and that by 1990 it would need 157.5 tonnes. But in the 1980 forecast the figure had dropped from 55.5 to 26.4.

(3) Will it be possible for the community there to utilise this repeater station for connection to television and STD telephone services.",108
265,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The microwave link planned to be established between Port Hedland-Broome-Derby by the end of 1982 and between Derby-Halls Creek-Kununurra by the end of 1983 will provide a reliable trunk system which will support the provision and continued development of telephone services throughout the region. (2) A repeater station on the Derby-Halls CreekKununurra microwave link will be located 10 km from Turkey Creek. (3) The microwave link in general, and the Turkey Creek repeater in particular, will be utilised in the provision of STD telephone services to the community at Turkey Creek. Further to the answers given above, my Department advises that, notwithstanding the installation of the microwave link to the Kimberley region, the proposed domestic communications satellite system may well prove to be the most effective means of providing adequate national television service to the North West of Western Australia generally and, in the context of this question, to the Turkey Creek area. Television and Telephone Senices: Dampier Land Peninsula Ethnic Affairs (Question No. 1156) (Question No. 1143) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 8 April 1981: (1) Has he received representations from the community of the Dampier Land Peninsula, Western Australia requesting television and telephone services for their area.

With regard to the provision of television services to the Dampier Land Peninsula, my Department has been requested to consider the communities in that area for inclusion in a future television planning program. However, the proposed domestic communications satellite system may well prove to be the most effective means of providing adequate national television service to those areas, installation of the microwave link to the Kimberley region notwithstanding. (4) The microwave links between Port Hedland-Derby and Derby-Kununurra will generally follow the Great Northern Highway. (5) and (6) See (3) above. Telecom Particular Person Call Service Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 8 April 1981 : (1) Has Telecom Australia recently altered its operation of the Particular Person Call service.

(3) Does this alteration discriminate against Kimberley residents who are not yet equipped with an STD service. (4) Will he undertake to ition on this matter if this alteration has come into effect.",110
267,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1, 2, 3 and 4) Telecom interests of improved efficiency and service to customers the operating procedures in relation to the Particular Person service were varied from February last by introducing a 'Try Again' service in place of the former 'Left Word' procedure. The 'Left Word' procedure relied on the person answering the called number advising the wanted person that the caller was wishing to make contact. Telecom was not able to ensure that the wanted person received this advice. With the 'Try Again' procedure Telecom retains responsibility for the connection of Particular Person unavailable calls. When the wanted person is unavailable the operator will advise the caller, giving all available information. The caller may theninform the operator to keep trying the call until the wanted person is available. In this case the operator will, if possible, ascertain when the attempt the call again in 30 minutes. speak to an alternative party at the same number. if it is known that the wanted person can be reached at another number anywhere in Australia, ask the operator to attempt connection to that number. advise the operator to hold the call until he wishes it tried again. cancel the call. The service outlined is available and does not in any way discriminate against customers who do not have STD access.

(3) If so, has the Chinese Government appealed to the Australian Government for assistance. (4) What was the Government's response to any appeal. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (Question No. 1157) (I) Accordingto a report issued by the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation (UNDRO) which visited China from 12 to 31 January 1981 at the request onhe Chinese Government, the flood and drought disasters experienced in 1980 affected some 173 million people in seven provinces. However, the most serious effects of the flood and drought the fa- disaster were in Hubei and Hebei Provinces respectively, where a total of 43.2 million people were affected with over 20 million most seriously affected. (2) The UNDRO report, which is based on detailed information provided by the Chinese authorities, did not seek a level of monetary commitment from international donors but did outline a number of requirements for Hubei and Hebei have Telecom reconsider its posProvinces including food, clothing, quilts/covers, seeds, fertiliser, medicines and pesticides. The food requirements were listed as follows: Rice-SOO,OOO metric tonnes; Wheat-600,000 metric tonnes; Australia has advised that in the Maize /Sorghum-440,000 metric tonnes; Soya Beans-7S,000 metric tonnes; Cooking Oil-l 0,000 metric bnnes; Milk Powder-2,000 metric tonnes. I am unaware of any further United Nations team which returned from China at the beginning of Apri11981, although I am informed that a UNICEF representative made a visit to the disaster affected areas in April to monitor the distribution of assistance being provided by that organisation. (3) The Chinese Government sought international aid through UNDRO which approached the Australian Government for assistance. (4) Bearing in mind the humanitarian aspects of the disasters, the Australian ""Government appt6ved the following response to the Chinese appeal: person will be available or will 0) the provision ofllledical supplies, valued at $100,000; and (ii) the provision of 10,000 tonnes of wheat currently valued at $1.Sm. Both the Chinese authorities and UNDRO have been to be informed of Australia's offer, and arrangements are being made for the delivery of our assistance in accordance with the wishes of the Chincse Government. to aU telephone customers Age Pensions in OECD Countries (Question No. 1178) Aid to China Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, (Question No. 1174) on 8 April 1981: (1) Is he able to state (a) how many persons are (i) in the work force and (ii) eligible for age pensions and (b) the ratio of those referred to in part (a) (i) to those referred to in part (a) (ii) in OECD countries; if so, what are the details. in China 190 million people (2) Where estimates are available what is the ratio 'for the years 1990 and 2000 (assuming no change in eligibility for age pensions).",111
268,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Information on the number of people eligible for the age pension in each able. The eligibility requirement for age pensions differs from country to country. In addition, apart from Australia and New Zealand, all OECD countries have contributory systems as an element in their age pension schemes under which entitlement is related to a person's contributions (or an employer's on their behalf) during their working life and in most cases to past earnings. The OECD has produced a study ('Demographic Trends 1950-1990', OECD 1979) which gives an estimate of the labour force and number of persons 65 and over in each member country for 1975, and projections up to 1990-a copy of the study is available in the Parliamentary Library. Projections of the population aged for most countries including OECD members for the years 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990 and 2000 are contained in 'Labour Force Estimates and Projections, 1950-2000', International Labour Office, Geneva, second edition, 1977. It must be noted that these projections are subject to a number of reservations and limitations, and given differing eligibility criteria (including different age criteria between countries) it is not possible to assume that persons of a certain age and over will be those eligible for age pensions.

Local personal calls are to be kept to a minimum and use of phones for such calls is to be monitored by supervisors. All personal trunk calls are to be booked through the switch board and paid for on completion. (2) In the Department's Central Office calls on each extension are separately recorded on a metering device. This information is regularly monitored and provides a control on the use of telephones. STD facilities are only made available to officers who have a need for frequent use of this facility. In all other offices of the Department with the exception of Melbourne, the STD facility is only made available to senior officers. In Melbourne, the Department is not responsible for the P ABX and STD access has not yet been controlled. It is understood that action is in train to implement STD barring on this P ABX. (3) The individual metering arrangements referred to above enable the Department gree of use of telephones. Preliminary consideration was given to the use of additional monitoring devices but the department did not pursue the matter because of the technical limitations of the currently available equipment. Further STD barring is under consideration. Mr Howe asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 28 April 1981: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a Swedish study published in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine, linking exposure to the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T with substantially increased risk of developing cancer of the soft tissues.

(2) This further contribution from the Swedish group does report a seventeenfold increase in the relative risk of softtissue sarcomata and exposure to 2,4,5-T. In addition, it also reports increased risks associated with a number of similar chemicals. This study is clearly important ignored. However, confirmation in other populatio.ns is urgently needed to help assess the possible causal significance of the reported association. The Public Health Advisory Committee (PHAC) at its recent meeting on 9-10 April 1981 considered the report and agreed that an investigation of cliloroplienoxy compounds Year 1975 1976 1977 1978 should be undertaken in Australia. It has been proposed that a special working group, including experts in pathology, epidemiology, toxicology and oncology, should be convened to consider the implications of this Swedish study and other recently published reports. No further comment is possible until this further expert assessment has been made of the study and its implications.

(2) What action has been taken or is contemplated by the Government to protect Australians travelling or about to travel. Sir Phillip Lynch--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following travel agencies operating in Australia are known to have collapsed during the last three years: (A) Licensed Travel Agents (NSW) Technology (i) Ta Khattar (Consolidated Travel Services) (Question No. 1614) (ii) M. and T. Fragakis (iii) AUS Student Travel Pty Ltd (iv) Kacar Entl'Orprises Pty Ltd (Contact Travel) (v) Adria Travel Agency Pty Ltd (vi) Milsons Point World Travel Pty Ltd (vii) Trail Finders Pty Ltd (viii) Comserve (No. 522) Pty Ltd (Paddington International Travel) (a) salaries and (b) other charges (B) Unlicensed Operators (NSW) (i) Travellers Facilities Ply Ltd (ii) M.

The only State/Territory to have legislated to regulate the activities of travel agents is New South Wales through its Travel Agents Registration Board. Under the New South Wales Travel Agents Act (1973) all persons, firms or corporations carrying on the business of a travel agent are required to be licensed. Members of the public have access to the travel Environment agents compensation fund in the event of a licensed travel (Question No. 1621) agent failing to account for monies entrusted to the licensee or his employee. No other State or Territory is understood to be intending to introduce similar legislation at this time. In 1978 the Commonwealth Government considered the introduction of legislation to be administered in conjunction with the States, to regulate the activities of travel agents operating in Australia, but as a result of objections raised by the States and industry and following advice from the Travel and Tourist Industry Advisory Council, decided n'ot to proceed with the legislation. In deciding not to proceed with the legislation the Commonwealth had had regard to the degree of protection for the travelling public which already existed, including Commonwealth and State laws relating to protection of the consumer, the regulation of corporate bodies and crimes matters generally. Commonwealth and State Consumer Affairs Ministers reTravel Agencies cently reviewed the desirability of licensing travel agents and (Question No. 1627) decided that it should be left to each jurisdiction to take whichever action it felt appropriate. The Australian Federation of Travel Agents is currently investigating the possibility of establishing a self-regulatory consumer protection scheme. The objective is to design, fund and administer a traveller's protection scheme which would provide the public/travellers with security in the case of financial collapse experienced by member retail travel agents, tour wholesalers and general sales agents. Consular assistance from Australia '8 overseas missions and posts is of course available to Australians travelling abroad who find themselves stranded or in distress as a result of circumstances beyond their control including the collapse of travel agencies. Protective Security Review Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 9 April 1981: What decisions have been made and what action taken on Mr Justice Hope's recommendation contained in his Protective Security Review that the organisational structure of fire safety officers should be thoroughly examined. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As stated by the Prime Minister in May 1980 in reply to a question upon notice (Hansard, 22 May 1980, p. 3225) my Department, in association with other relevant departments and organisations, is examining Mr Justice Hope's recommendations with respect to fire safety arrangements, including the career structure, training and organisational structure of fire safety officers.

(2) What criteria are needed to establish 85 per cent incapacity for persons claiming invalid pensions.",127
294,Mr HUNT,PERCENTAGE OF CITY OFFICE SPACE LOCATED,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) I do not understand the reference to 'proposed cuts in social service benefits'. The term 'people in genuine need' refers to people who are unable to provide for themselves from their own resources. (2) On 7 May 1981 revised guidelines in relation to medical evaluation for invalid pensions were issued to Commonwealth Medical Officers. The revised guidelines are: Medical Evaluation (a) Eligibility To be eligible for an invalid pension a person must be permanently incapacitated for work to the extent to not less than 85 per cent or must be permanently blind. (b) Assessment of permanence An incapacity is considered permanent if no fundamental or marked change for the better can be expected in a person's condition in the future. (c) Assessment of incapacity Incapacity is defined by the degree of permanent incapacity of a person compared with the capacity for work which that person would have had, but for his incapacity. and Commissions of Statutory Authorities under his jurisdiction. (Questiou No. 1020) Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The only Statutory Authority responsible to me as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. Details for the Institute are set out below: (b) Dates and terms (c) Salaries $ 2 years from 20.12.79 10,675 p.a. 2 years from 20.12.79 4,300p.a. 2 years from 20.12.79 4,300p.a. 2 years from 20.12.79 4,300p.a. 2 years from 20.12.79 4,300p.a. 16.1.80-19.12.81 4,300p.a. 1 year from 20.3.80 (re-appointed on 25.3.81 until 19.12.81) 4,300p.a. 5 years from 1.2.80 41,286p.a. + 1,400 allowance ex-officio nil and is paid a salary as a 'holder of public office'. paid 'annual fees' for their part-time services. The comparison is to be made with regard to all work that could reasonably be regarded by the assessor (Question No.1 067) as being within the claimant's capacity. Assessment of incapacity is made having regard to the degree of the claimant's impairment which, together with relevant facts about the applicant such as age, sex, education, lack of skills and personal disabilities, constitutes incapacity. It is important to recognise that it is permanent incapacity and not permanent impairment that is relevant for invalid pension purposes. Permanent impairment-This is a purely medical condition. Permanent impairment is an anatomic or functional abnormality of loss after maximal medical rehabilitation has been achieved, which abnormality or loss the Commonwealth Medical Officer considers stable or non-progressive at the time evaluation is made. It is always a basic consideration in the evaluation of permanent incapacity. Permanent incapacity-This is not a purely medical condition. A person is permanently incapacitated or under a permanent incapacity when his actual or presumed ability to engage in gainful employment is reduced or absent because of impairment which, in turn, mayor may not be combined with other factors. While fluctuations in the labour market are to be disregarded in the assessment of the applicant's capacity for work, that capacity must be assessed in the light of work of kinds that (subject to such fluctuations) are available in Australia, regardless of whether or not they are available at places reasonably accessible to the applicant at his current place of residence. However, age, sex, education, lack of relevant skills and personal disabilities are factors to be taken into account, together with impairment, in determining the capacity of an individual applicant for work that is not so reasonably accessible. The fact that a severely handicapped applicant might be able to get work at a time of full or over-full employment because of the scarcity of labour would not disentitle him if he was unlikely to get work at any reasonable foreseeable time given the general level of demand for labour in Australia. Self-inflicted incapacity brought about for the purpose of obtaining a pension disqualifies a person from pension. (d) Employment considerations While it is not generally possible for a person engaged in employment to be considered as being permanently incapacitated for work all relevant factors should be considered where a person is engaging in some form of employment, including the nature of employment (part time, sheltered, therapeutic, token); whether employment is within the claimant's remaining capacity for work; whether employment is compatible with the claimant's medical condition; whether employment will continue. The Department of Social Security may request a review of medical entitlement if a pensioner commences work. (e) Other considerations A person who has lost the use of both arms or legs may be considered to be permanently incapacitated, independent of their personal and employment circumstances, even when engaged in some limited employment. A similar assessment may be made if a person has suffered some other permanent impairment which is as broadly disruptive of his capacity for work as the loss of both arms or legs would be. Mr Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 7 April 1981: (I) Has the Minister's attention been drawll to a report on the problems of youth housing circulated to the media ill Adelaide on 23 March 1981 which reportedly represented the views of 30 organisations, including Commonwealth and State Government Departments and community service organisations such as Emergency Accommodation Services for Youth at the YWCA and Saint Vincent de Paul. (2) Is it a fact that in South Australia there are an estimated 6,000 homeless young persons. (3) Has the Government been approached by the South Australian Government for an increase in funding under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. (4) Will the Government consider adopting the recommendations contained in the report by the South Australian Government Working Party on Youth Housing, particularly recommendations 5 (i), 5 (ii) and 5 (iii) which respectively relate to raising the rate of unemployment benefit, providing supplementary assistance to young unemployed persons living independently and increasing the unemployment rate for persons 16 and 17 years of age to that of the single adult rate if they have been living independently for a suitable qualifying period.",128
295,Mr HUNT,PERCENTAGE OF CITY OFFICE SPACE LOCATED,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. My attention has been drawn to a Press release with attached background material, dealing with the problems of youth housing, which was issued on 23 March 1981 by a South Australian organisation called 'Shelter'. This is an organisation whose members are individuals concerned about the problems of homeless people. Many of the members are employees of welfare organisations involved in providing accommodation services, and some are employees of Government Departments. These latter are members of the organisation in their capacity as private citizens, and are not representatives of their employing Departments. (2) A report called 'Survey of Youth Homelessness in Metropolitan Adelaide', December 1979, which was released by the Council for Homeless Persons (SA), estimated that there were 6,000 homeless young persons in Metropolitan Adelaide. Another report, entitled 'Youth Housing', which was published in June 1980 by the South Australian Council of Social Service, estimated that 9,000 young people seek housing assistance each year in Metropolitan Adelaide. It is difficult, however, to estimate accurately the homeless youth population. The estimates given above were calculated from the number of homeless young people who contacted some welfare accommodation agencies in a given survey period, usually one week. An overestimate of the population size will, of course, occur if a homeless young person approaches more than one accommodation agency during the survey period, whereas there will be an underestimate if a young person seeking temporary accommodation does not contact any welfare agency. In addition, the surveys did llot contact every possible agency which might have received requests for accommodation assistance. The government nevertheless accepts that these estimates point to a problem on a scale which warrants serious concern. The Commonwealth has therefore offered assistance to the States to provide additional facilities for emergency accommodation for young people up to 18 years. This assistance is provided through the Youth Services Scheme and is jointly Youth Housing cost shared with each State Government which administers its (Question No. 1068) Commonwealth funding component. Four South Australian projects providing emergency accommodation and support for youth currently receive funding under the Scheme. (3) There is no record of an approach by the South Australian Government for an increase in funding under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. (4) The recommendations in the report of the South Australian Government Working Party on Youth Housing have been noted and will be taken into account by the Government in its current Review of Improved Opportunities for Youth and in the annual Budget context.

(2) What plans does the Government have for the Commonwealth employee currently associated with the Plague Locust Commission.",136
312,Mr SINCLAIR,PERCENTAGE OF CITY OFFICE SPACE LOCATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Control of plague locusts has always been a State responsibility. By agreement with the States, the Australian Plague Locust Commission, which consists of six Commissioners (two from the Commonwealth and one each from the contributing States) and a Director assisted by permanent staff, engages in operations designed to combat outbreaks or potential outbreaks of the Australian plague locust in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland, which in the opinion of the Commission are likely to result in damage to ruralindustries in another State. (2) The general approach and procedures concerning staffing relating to the implementation of Government decisions following the Review of Commonwealth Functions have been detailed by the Public Service Board. These include the situation where a function is to be transferred to the States. Any change in Commission staffing arrangements will be in accord with these guidelines. Expenditure on Wool Promotion (Question No. 2273) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 14 May 1981: (I) What was the level of Commonwealth expenditure on wool promotion in (a) 1978-79, (b) 1979-80 and (c) 1980-81. (2) What are the implications for wool growers of fixing expenditure for the next three years at $60m (Hansard, 30 April 1981, pages 1834 and 1847). (3) What is the level of grower contribution to wool promotion.",137
313,Mr SINCLAIR,PERCENTAGE OF CITY OFFICE SPACE LOCATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (3) The level of Government grant and grower contribution by way of Wool Tax for wool promotion in each of the three years has been as follows: the Standing Committee on Soil Commonwealth Grower Year grant contribution* $m $m 1978-79 21.3 32.7 1979-80 14.0 41.3 1980-8\ 20.0 (Est) 41.75 for soil conservation rested with contribution from Wool Tax. Contributions for 1978-79 and 1979-80 included a small component for marketing administration expenses. (2) The announced decision of the Government to contribute $20m for wool promotion in each of the next three years provides a certainty of that amount of income for wool promotion planning purposes. It enables also a firm estimation to be made of the residual amount of funding which would have to be found by the wool industry to finance proposed wool promotion programs. It provides a clear indication also of the determination of the (Question No. 2272) Australian Government to assist in ensuring the best interests of wool producers, and through the promotion of wool consumption the best interests also of the other areas of the wool trade. Storage Capacity for Wool (Question No. 2274) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 14 May 1981: (1) On what basis will minimum storage capacity for wool be determined (Ha/lsard, 30 April 1981, page 1847). (2) What action will the Government take if the minimum capacity proves to be inadequate. (3) What would be the cost of this action in comparison with maintaining existing storage capacity.",137
314,Mr SINCLAIR,PERCENTAGE OF CITY OFFICE SPACE LOCATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I have been informed that the Australian Wool Corporation regards an eight months supply of wool as the minimum storage capacity required. (2) In an emergency, by block stacking, this area could provide storage for over six million bales or about 18 months production of wool. (3) Action foreshadowed in (2) would entail some additional costs but the maintenance of existing storage capacity may also require significant capital outlays on the repair and modernisation of some stores. Use in Australia of Americallese Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 26 May 1981: (1) Did the notice placed on the Press Gallery Notice Board in Parliament House by the Honours Secretariat on 12 May 1981 say that as a mark of respect to the late General Sir John Wilton, flags will be half-masted on all Commonwealth Buildings. (2) Is half-masted a particular military expression; if so, did it originate from General Haig, the Secretary of State of the United States of America. (3) Is it more accurate to say that flags will be flown at half-mast. (4) What symbolic importance can be deduced from this apparent ad hoc adoption of Americanese. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) No. The Oxford English masted', and records an example of its usage in England in 1891.

315,Mr SINCLAIR,PERCENTAGE OF CITY OFFICE SPACE LOCATED,"-On 13 May 1981 (Hansard, page 2297) Mr Tuckey asked me as Minister for Communications the following question, without notice: I refer the Minister of Communications to the recent amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act which allow community groups to erect national television translators. Can the Minister advise the House of the number of applications that have been received as a result of this legislation? Can he further state when the residents of Howick and Condingup in the Esperance Shire might receive approval of their applications? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Expressions of interest relating to the establishment of translators which may be licensed to relay national (ABC) television programs have been received for seven such services. The group which has expressed an interest in establishing a privately funded translator to relay national (ABC) television (Question No. 2319) programs to Howick and Condingup in the Esperance Shire is presently considering the options open to it. The most expeditious of these options would appear to be donation of the transmission facility to the Government'so that it will become part of the National Broadcasting Service at the time programming commences. Under these circumstances it would not be necessary for the group to obtain a licence for the translator and the project could proceed with a minimum of delay. Should the group decide to pursue the option of applying for a licence to operate the translator as a privately owned outlet of the National television service, it is unlikely that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would be able to grant a licence until well into 1982. This delay is entirely usual and is a result of the administrative processes involved in preparation and distribution of a draft planning proposal, preparation of a final planning proposal, the calling of applications for a licence and the actuallicence inquiry by the Tribunal. In addition to the time taken for administrative proc.esses, there are statutory periods set aside to allow interested parties to comment on draft planning proposals and to allow applications for the licence to be submitted to the Tribunal.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has advertised widely for temporary field staff for the Census and it is open to anyone to apply. The ABS has also sought the assistance of the Commonwealth Employment Service in specifically drawing the attention of those registered with them to the availability of this work. However, despite the unemployment situation, in a number of localities response to the advertisement has been disappointing. Although the ABS has obtained the approval of the Public Service Board to employ public servants for this work, preference will be given, as far as practicable, to the recruitment of suitable people who are not already in employment.",138
