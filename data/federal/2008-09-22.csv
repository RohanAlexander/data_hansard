3,Mr HAYES,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise to speak in continuation on the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and a related bill. As I was saying before the debate was adjourned last week, this is a critical first step in the direction of improving safety outcomes for workers and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. I have recently had the opportunity to talk to Geoff Fary from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union of Australia and Phil Hazelton from the Australian Miscellaneous Workers Union Assent about their position on the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. I have spoken to others but the people I have just mentioned came to talk to me about it. In speaking to them at length about this bill and about, more importantly, the statistics that underlie the concerns over safety in our workplaces, I noted they all raised significant concerns. They all support the notion of this bill as a step in the right direction. However, I should make it clear that what they said was not without some reservations. They did have some residual concerns about the bill's administrative make-up, in particular the number of employee representatives to be on the board of the new Safe Work Australia. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is only one part of the government's strategy. We have taken this issue seriously and we have acted by moving quickly on it. Since coming to office in November, this government has undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme and has set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review, which is currently well underway, to examine public 2008 submissions on the optimal structure and content of an OH&S model. Notably, the first report of that group will be presented to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on 31 October this year. A second report is due at the end of January next year. The group has developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with our state and territory colleagues to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation across the nation. Together with the intergovernmental agreement for regulatory and operational reform of occupational health and safety, agreed by the Council of Australian Governments on 3 July this year, this ushers in a new partnership that I believe will advance the health and safety of workers across the nation and reduce the complexity of regulation for the many businesses affected. Safe Work Australia will be an independent reform-focused national body with an inclusive tripartite membership that will operate under the Commonwealth government's accountability and governance framework. It will consist of 15 membersnine members from government, an independent chair, two members representing employees, two members representing employers and a CEO. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was set up under the former Howard government as an advisory council with limited powers and limited functions and was effectively contained to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts in respect of occupational health and safety issues. In contrast, Safe Work Australia will develop national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation; prepare, monitor and advise as to model OH&S legislation and model codes of conduct to apply throughout the nation; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure that a nationally consistent regulatory approach across all jurisdictions is maintained; develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; collect, analyse and publish OH&S and workers compensation data; and collect and publish statistics. will drive a national communications strategy to raise awareness of OH&S in the workplace. It will further develop the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy 2002-2012 and advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on OH&S and workers compensation matters. These are very much the key functions of this new body which has now been established. They reaffirm the Rudd Labor government's strong commitment to safe workplaces and the protection of workers. The introduction of Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in realising the shared commitment of the Commonwealth and all states and territory governments to work together in advancing OH&S outcomes and achieving harmonisation of OH&S laws. It should not pass without noting that this is the first time in the history of the Federation that we have formally committed to OH&S taking on an intergovernmental agreement with a view to harmonising arrangements throughout the Commonwealth, states and territories. This is something very good for working Australians. It is something very good for the businesses of working Australians-businesses that need to have some regulatory relief. The complex regulations that currently exist and apply in individual states and territories can, as a result of this legislation, be brought under a harmonised model where there will be consistent arrangements which will apply across all workplaces in the country.

4,Dr SOUTHCOTT,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 is to set up a new statutory authority with the aim of improving occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The area of occupational health and safety is not the subject of partisan debate. I believe all members of this House-all sides of politics-have a It commitment to improving occupational health and safety. Having said that, there are three problems with this legislation, and the opposition urges the government to address these. These are not areas that should be difficult to fix. The first problem is that establishing a ‘tripartite' body to look at the area of occupational health and safety really implies that you have three equal parties who all have a stake in and a commitment to improving occupational health and safety. They are government, employers and the unions. One of the problems with Safe Work Australia as it is conceived is that nine of the 15 members on the board will be representing government, two will be representing the unions and two will be representing employers. We say that it is an imbalance to have such heavy representation from government when it is actually the employers and the unions who will effect improvements in occupational health and safety. The second problem with this legislation is that Safe Work Australia will report back to this House only every six years. The Olympics will come round more often than the report from Safe Work Australia will be seen in this House. We will go through two electoral cycles between reports. It defies belief why you would set up a governance arrangement like this. Why not have an annual report, as most statutory bodies do? The third problem with this is that the work of Safe Work Australia relies on reports to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. What we have seen in the past is that, if is not the will at the ministerial council to make this work, in effect Safe Work Australia will be sending their good work to a box. We have seen that the ministerial council in this area has been dysfunctional; it sometimes failed to meet, and members of the ministerial council have failed to attend or to cooperate with the Commonwealth. If the ministerial council does not work, Safe Work Australia will not either. Those are the three problems with Safe Work Australia as it is conceived in this legislation. We urge the government to take up these suggestions in the spirit of constructive criticism in which they are raised. The new body, which is one of many new bodies which have been created under Labor, will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was established by the coalition when in government as an advisory body to occupational health and safety policies. Unlike the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was set up administratively under the framework of the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Act 2005, Safe Work Australia will be set up as a statutory authority with the power to make decisions in relation to national standards and codes of practice. This body will also have the power to develop national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation. We are also told it will prepare and monitor implementation of OH&S legislation and advise the ministerial council on matters relating to OH&S and workers compensation. While on the face of it all of those seem good-improving occupational health and safety regulations benefits everyone from workers and their families to business-there are these problems, as I have said, with the governance arrangements for this body in the legislation. The body will be dominated by state and territory representatives, the same there people who have already failed in many cases to develop workable occupational health and safety systems in their own states. post- Many of them have major problems with their own workers compensation schemes. has Out of the 15 nominated representatives who will form this body, there will be eight state and territory representatives, one representing the Commonwealth, two from industry, two from the unions and there will be a chair and a CEO to make up the 15. So there will be only two members on this body who will specifically represent the interests of workers and there will be only two members who will represent the interests of employers. That is already a reduction from three from both sectors, as was the case under the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. Both union and industry representatives are rightly concerned about the reduction of social partner representatives from three to two. It will create a situation where government representatives will be able to override concerns raised by employers and unions, including concerns related to increased costs or impractical safety proposals. This is an example of reducing industry and union representatives in favour of a ‘government knows best' view. It is an unjustifiable balance. As I said, with a tripartite body there an assumption and an implication that there are three equal partners and that it is not dominated by the government-the partner most removed from the workplace, where the practical improvements in occupational health and safety will occur. A process that does not seek to engage employers and employees in any meaningful way will struggle to improve safety standards; in fact, it may undermine them. With this limited capacity for employer and employee representatives to raise concerns, Safe Work Australia could also be used by the government to develop other codes and policies under the guise of safety. There is a fundamental flaw in the foundations upon which this body has been established. The success of Safe Work Australia is contingent upon cooperation and participation of the ministerial council. If the ministeback rial council does not work, Safe Work Australia will not work either. Safe Work Australia is required to report directly to the terial council. Unfortunately, members of the ministerial council have notoriously failed to attend and/or cooperate with the Commonwealth on these issues. If the ministerial council fails to meet or refuses to cooperate and consider Safe Work Australia issues, the work of the body will come to a halt. There is inadequate employer and employee input; any work done by Safe Work Australia is contingent on cooperation from the ministerial council. But there is a third problem-the failure to report back to parliament on the progress of Safe Work Australia. Under the current proposal, Safe Work Australia will only report back to parliament every six years. Last year there was a lot of talk about more open government. It has not been explained how reporting back every six years fits in with this framework. To introduce a state domiis nated independent statutory authority that only needs to report back to parliament every six years is incomprehensible and grossly inadequate. What is the problem with requiring this body to report to parliament annually? This new body is shaping up as just another botched policy from the government, like Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch. While Australians are fed up with these botched policies, we see jobs disappearing. Over the nine months until June next year, employment growth is expected to be one-third of what it was last year. The budget's own predictions state that there will be 134,000 fewer jobs by June next year. Since this government came to office, over 15½ thousand workers have been made redundant. The new government is proposing to spend less on employment services and less on helping people back into work. They have wound mutual obligation and Work for the Dole. Despite this, we do not hear any talk of minisjobs from the government when, following on from the strongest labour market in a generation, we now have massive job insecurity. We never hear any member of the government talk about jobs. They will not mention jobs. Jobs are the great unmentionable in the corner. Instead, they are focused on watching fuel prices and grocery prices, to the benefit of no-one, and now we are considering a state dominated body to improve occupational health and safety regulations with less employer and employee involvement. It will not have to report back to parliament until 2014 and then it will report again in 2020. Good occupational health and safety standards require a safe working environment and they improve worker morale and productivity. It is important that we all work together to reduce workplace injuries, but I fear that this is just another Labor that will do nothing of the sort.",18
5,Mr GRAY,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (12.20 pm)-I rise today to support the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. It bill to create an independent national body that will improve occupational health and safety outcomes for Australian workers. This bill reiterates the Rudd government's commitment to implementing safe work practices across Australia. Statistics from the Australian Safety and Compensation Council show that, over the nine years from 1997-98 to 2005-06, around 147,800 compensation claims were accepted. These claims were from workers who were temporarily incapacitated for one working week or more, or permanently incapacitated, and the figure also includes compensation claims that result from fatalities. Nationally, over those same nine years, approximately 300 deaths occurred each year-that is, 2,700 people died from a workplace related accident in those nine years. That in itself a difficult statistic to stomach, but what it mean? It means sadness for families, it means poverty and anger for families, it means families are broken, it means kids do not have mums or dads, it means husbands do not have wives, it means wives lose their husbands. The story of workplace injury and workplace deaths gets played out somewhere in this country just about every day, and it a story that we as a parliament need to be doing more about. According to the peak workers body in my home state of Western Australia, UnionsWA, 460 people died in the workplace between 1988-89 and 2008-09. Statistics cannot convey the tragedy that has befallen 460 families in Western Australia. According to UnionsWA, there has been a gradual decrease in fatalities-from a high point of 36 body in 1988-89 to a low point of 12 in 2005-06. Unfortunately, the figure increased to 25 in 2006-07 and 27 in 2007-08. That largely tracks the massive construction that is currently underway in both the resources sector is a and the CBD of Perth. But 460 fatalities in Western Australia over this period is clearly unacceptable. There were 136 fatalities in the mining industry, 104 in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries, 70 in the construction industry and 31 in the manufacturing industry-and 104 of them were young Western Australian men and women aged between 25 and 34. That is almost one-third of the total fatalities. For families who lose a loved one to a workplace injury there is a terrible emotional and mental cost that cannot be measured. For the nation it also has an economic cost. It is estimated that workplace accidents cost the economy $34 billion a year. It is not as though good employers and managers-and most of them are good-do not see safety as a matter of priority. But it is a fact that acciis dents take place. They take place for a multidoes tude of reasons, not least of which is that people take safety for granted. One of the more significant industrial accidents to take place in Australia over the last decade took place almost exactly 10 years ago this week-the story of the Esso plant at Longford. In Australia and around the world there are constant and tragic reminders of the is human costs associated with workplace accidents. At Longford, in Victoria's Gippsland Region, Esso Australia Resources operates three gas plants to process gas flowing from wells in the Bass Strait. It also operates a crude oil stabilisation plant to process oil flowing from other wells in the Bass Strait. On Friday, 25 September 1998, at around half past 12 in the afternoon, a vessel in Esso's gas plant No. 1 fractured, releasing hydrocarbon vapours and liquid. Explosions and fire followed. Two Esso employees were killed and eight others were injured. Gas supplies to the state of Victoria were severely affected for two weeks. On 12 October 1998, the Victorian government announced a royal commission in order to determine the cause of the explosion and the subsequent loss of gas supply. It is worth remembering that there was a federal election at the time of the accident. That election was closely fought and it concluded in the days immediately following the explosion at Longford. It is also worth putting on the record that at no time did the then government, or the opposition, seek to obtain political advantage from the tragedy at Longford. Everyone stood side by side to understand exactly what had happened, to support the process of the royal commission and to ask why it could be that in a modern, wealthy economy such an explosion could have taken place and deaths could have resulted. The royal commissioner carried out his work over a period of several years. The plant was rebuilt at a cost of $500 million and it incorporated new safety measures and staffing increases. Esso also announced that it would invest $100 million in the development and expansion of the Longford plant over the following two years. Whilst it is commendable that Esso has looked to improve its safety standards, it is disappointing that it took two fatalities to make it happen. Sir Daryl Dawson, a former justice of the High Court and royal commissioner of the Longford royal commission into the Esso gas plant explosion, commented on the realities of workplace safety. He stated: The elimination of risk comes at a cost and it is apparent that those responsible are not always prepared to bear the cost and so you have, either implicitly or explicitly, a cost benefit analysis in which the risk of death or injury is measured in money terms against the cost of elimination of the risk. That is an exercise which seems insensitive to say the least, and yet it is an exercise that must be carried out, consciously or unconsciously, all the time. That is why employers are encouraged to make their workplaces safer, not safe. That is an insightful comment that points to the disappointing reality of operating in a market based economy. It also points out that there are risks and they need to be appropriately mitigated but that risks will never go away. That is why a safety culture and enforcing safe behaviours is extremely important in a workplace context. An overseas accident that had tragic ramifications occurred in 2005 in Texas City in the United States. The Texas City refinery is BP's largest refinery worldwide and the third-largest refinery in the United States, with a crude capacity of about 460,000 barrels of petroleum per day. The facility is capable of producing about 10 million gallons per day of premium and unleaded regular fuel. Located just south of Houston, the plant includes 29 oil-refining units and four chemical units, spread over a 1,200-acre site. The Texas City refinery produces about 2½ per cent of all fuel sold in the United States-enough to fill the tank of every car every seven seconds. Fifteen workers died and more than 500 were injured in the explosion which occurred at Texas City in 2005, just three years ago. It was one of the most serious industrial incidents of the past two decades. BP's investigation report, entitled The cause of the explosion, has been discussed in detail. It stated: Actions taken or not taken led to overfilling the raffinate splitter with liquid, overheating the liquid and the subsequent overpressurisation and pressure relief. Hydrocarbon flow to the blowdown drum and stack overwhelmed it, resulting in liquids carrying over out of the the stack, flowing down the stack, accumulating on the ground, causing a vapor cloud, which was ignited by an abandoned white pickup truck with the ignition on. No-one could have begun to understand the implications of an abandoned car with merely the ignition left on, but the consequence of a massive cloud of hydrocarbons drifting across that dumped vehicle was an explosion that killed 15 people and injured 500. The hydrocarbons industry is advanced and scientific and it understands the value of life and the value of profits. The work done by BP to understand the explosion has been transparent and has been transmitted around the world. In the company for which I worked previously, Woodside Energy, there was completely transparent access to the investigation and its conclusions. Furthermore, BP sent teams around the world to explain to other hydrocarbons companies how such a horrific explosion could have taken place and the measures that were being taken to ensure that it could not happen again. Good governance requires that a whole range of metrics be measured, considered and placed on the table at board meetings. It is the case that good companies make safety a priority matter for boards to consider. It is not uncommon for board meetings to start with a safety report. It is not uncommon that analysts' judgements about companies are based on their capacity to do a good job in looking after their workers. In industries that have danger and risk, it is known and understood that if you are going to attract the best workers then you must create the best safety environment. Although there are people killed every month in Australia's resource sector, there is no doubt that our outstanding of resource companies work very hard on their safety protocols and on ensuring that the triple bottom line-not only profitability and doing good business but also looking after top of the workers-is met in all contexts. Even in the best-managed companies, accidents happen. In March this year a crane owned by New York Crane and Equipment collapsed at 303 East 51st Street in Manhattan. Seven people were killed and 24 others were injured. It was a tower crane, manufactured by the Australian company Favco, and it was 200 feet tall at the time of the collapse. I take an interest in this collapse not because an Australian company manufactured the crane but because the one thing that is apparent to supporters of the resource and construction industries is the need for safety. I have spent a lot of time in Western Australia looking at safety training at the CFMEU's site, which carries out one of the most significant training operations in Western Australia. Their training operation was supported by the previous government, and one can see no good reason why the outstanding training done by the centre should not continue. One of the areas that the construction industry pays particular attention to is the erection of cranes and crane safety. I visited that CFMEU training centre in Western Australia earlier this year, within days of the collapse of that crane in New York. The workers there were already being trained in understanding what had happened to that crane-how it had pulled away from the wall to which it was supposed to have been attached, how it folded back in on itself and how, when it fell, seven people, including several inside it and several working around it, were killed and 24 others were injured. A construction worker on the 15th floor said he saw something fall and strike one or more of the girder ties, weakening or breaking the connections. ‘Out of the corner of my eye,' he said, ‘I saw a piece falling, and the crane pulled away.' The collapse occurred as workers attempted to jack up the crane, raising its height to enable work to continue above on the 19th floor of a planned 43-storey building. The builders had city permission to raise the crane. The crane had been inspected a few days earlier, with no violations found. Accidents occur even though inspections happen. Accidents are prevented by a safety culture. In Western Australia, UnionsWA keeps a record of the personal stories of people who have been affected by workplace injuries. Just down the street from where I live, no more than a kilometre away, construction commenced in 2002 on an office and warehouse facility which was of a tilt-up design. Tilt-up design involves large prefabricated concrete slabs being tilted into position to form the walls of a structure. It is a low-cost construction methodology, ideally suited to Western Australia, in which safety is paramount. The story I relate here is of a wall many metres tall, many metres long and weighing tens of tonnes, which collapsed because it was inappropriately suspended. A worker, Des Kelsh, was crushed beneath the falling wall. He is survived by his wife, Trish, and their children, Lucy-Ann and Cormac. He was working on a tilt-up wall that came down. When it came down he bled to death before anyone could even lift the wall to get into help him. His wife says: Every day I think about him. Every day I miss him. Des Kelsh's death caused a significant reconsideration of how tilt-up construction occurs in Western Australia and has had the positive effect of making a change in construction methodology. His death also reinforced what had been said previously by the CFMEU about the safety of such construction methodologies. In 2007, Luke Murrie died on a constructhen tion site in the northern Perth suburb of Malaga. The CFMEU said: Luke was a warm, happy young man whose boundless energy was infectious. He will be sadly missed but never forgotten by all those who were fortunate enough to journey with him along life's path. The loss of a tremendous person like Luke at such a young age is made even more tragic because of the loss of opportunity. The opportunity to be a father. The opportunity to grow old. The opportunity to be a workmate to many more people. The opportunity to be a great construction worker and rigger and to be a positive influence within an industry which sorely needs that type of influence. We all know of the accident at the Cloudbreak mine of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd earlier in 2008, where Nigel Taylor, 26, died. He had been married for just two months to his wife, Lisa. She said: Nigel was an amazing man, we were married for only two months but the love that we had for each other will last an eternity. Nigel never got to experience many things in his life, moving into our family home or becoming a father. But one thing I am thankful of is that he died as my husband, that we had a chance to say our vows and express our love for each other. In July of 2007, a 43-year-old delivery driver died when the Dingo minidigger he was using to move a shed on a construction site toppled and the raised arms of the minidigger landed on his neck. On 30 August 2007, a 21-year-old loader operator died when the bogger that he was using to backfill a stope rolled over, crushing him. On 10 September 2007, a 68-year-old farmer was killed when he was struck by the limb of a tree that he was felling on his farm. We should remember that one of the most significant categories of workplace injury and death is the agricultural sector on farms. They are often workers who are working alone with equipment on unstable ground and often working to a deadline-perhaps in the daytime with the light disappearing, perhaps because the seeding has to be done or perhaps just because they have had enough of the job and they want to get it done. Accihave dents happen and people get killed. On farms, of course, sometimes it can take days, or even weeks, before a death is discovered. This bill does many things about process and design but, most importantly, it brings the attention of our parliament and brings into focus for industry the importance that we, as a parliament, place on workplace safety and the right of every worker to turn up to work, carry out their work and go home healthy, fit and in the same condition as when they arrived. I commend the bill to the House.",21
6,Mr KEENAN,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise to discuss the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. Before going into the substance of the bill, I would like to make some general remarks about workplace relations and employment. We all, rightly, bring our own perspectives and our own experiences to the issues we face in this parliament. They form part of the equation when we form our views about issues. It is perfectly reasonable, when we as parliamentarians are faced with a large number of decisions, that we do rely on our experiences to guide us in forming judgements. In my own case, I am guided in my views on workplace relations by my own experiences, and in this field they have been many. I have been an employee, I have been an employer, I have worked casually, I have worked full time and I have worked part time. I have worked in different parts of Austions tralia and I have also worked overseas. I have done many and varied jobs since I commenced my working life. I delivered milk when I was 14, I have flipped hamburgers, I have poured beers, I have waited tables, I have been an usher at the cinema, I have been a data entry clerk and I have done all types of administration. I have had many more occupations than I would care to list. Most of these jobs have been great but, occasionally, I have come across employers who not lived up to their obligations. I must say that these times have been relatively few and far between in what has been a long and varied career. The times that I actually remember with to most trepidation are the times when I have been unable to find work. Members of the House will probably be familiar with that intense and unwavering feeling of insecurity that can pervade all aspects of your life. A loss of confidence can accompany this. The failure to be able to find work, in my view, is one of the worse fates that can befall any individual Australian. This parliament must always bear that in mind when considering the appropriate structure for our workplace relations system, including in this case occupational health and safety laws. The more complex and complicated we make that system, the more people will be subjected to the insecurity of being unable to find work. I have heard suggestions in this debate, and at other times, that members of the coalition are not concerned about safety in Australian workplaces. I consider this suggestion offensive and silly. To seriously suggest that any member of this House would condone an unsafe workplace is ludicrous. It is just as ludicrous as the suggestion that any member of this House would somehow welcome deterioration in the working conditions of any Australian worker. Debates in this area are about finding balance in our workplace relasystem and are a vitally important business for this parliament. But let us conduct them in an atmosphere where members are not subjected to nonsensical allegations that have no basis in reality. The debates in this portfolio are vitally important to the well-being of my constituents in Stirling and to the constituents of every single member of this House. If we get the system wrong, we bring the progress Australia has made over the last several decades to a complete halt. I think that all members of this House should treat these debates with the seriousness they deserve, and I would invite all members to do so when we are debating this bill. The bill's purpose is to establish Safe Work Australia. The coalition does not oppose this bill or the consequential provisions, although we do have some concerns about significant flaws within the bill. Safety in the workplace should be a core priority for both employers and employees. Every employee should be able to undertake their tasks in a safe environment. The coalition broadly supports the idea of a national occupational health and safety system and is committed to ensuring that every Australian workplace is a safe one. There are significant benefits to be gained from a national system, both for employees and employers. However, we are concerned that this bill will not achieve this. There are significant costs for employers in managing seven different sets of occupational health and safety laws and workers compensation requirements. These are wasted funds that could be better spent. These funds could be used to provide skills training for employees, education in occupational health and safety policies and employee development. Instead these funds are spent on complying with the seven different occupational health and safety regimes and workers compensation systems. Yet this bill, strangely, reduces the level influence that employees and employers currently have in developing occupational health and safety policy. It does so by reducing the number of union and industry representatives and allowing state government representatives to dominate occupational health and safety policy decisions. This bill will allow state Labor ministers to continue to hijack the national discussion on occupational health and safety, just as we saw with the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations last year. This is an ill-considered measure that is a backward step from the current situation. Every workplace is different. I believe it is crucial that employers and employees work together to achieve workplace health and safety. But surely we would be best off doing that through getting those who know their workplaces best involved in developing occupational health and safety policy. Removing the influence of employees and employers from this process is irresponsible government. The influence of employees and employers and their union and industry representatives should be encouraged. Their participation should be increased, not lessened. Occupational health and safety policy outcomes that require changes to culture and other significant changes depend on employers and employees. Removing them from, or lessening their influence on, the policy development process is a very retrograde step. I want to turn now to the other significant flaw in this bill, and that is that it proposes that parliament receive a report on the progress of Safe Work Australia every six years. I encourage the government to consider shortening this period of reporting. There is no logical element to a six-year time frame. It is totally out of line with the parliamentary term and it will not provide future governments with the information they will require of to develop a national system. It is not responsible for the government to propose a bill that provides for an independent authority that will be dominated by state representatives and will remove employee and employer representation to only require that a report be provided to parliament every six years. This bill is another example of a Labor policy that has been introduced with little consultation. Safe Work Australia is in some aspects a regressive step. Australia cannot afford ill-considered policies that increase the influence of incompetent state Labor governments at the expense of employers and employees and their representatives in union and industry bodies. I hope that the Senate will look at these matters in an inquiry into this bill. If they do, I encourage the government to work with the coalition to provide the best possible environment for developing a national occupational health and safety system in the best interests of Australian workers and businesses.",25
7,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise to support the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the associated Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. The purpose of the Safe Work Australia Bill is to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The announcement of the new body follows the historic signing on 3 July 2008, by the Council of Australian Governments, of an intergovernmental agreement for regulatory and operational reform in occupational health and safety. The intergovernmental agreement commits all jurisdictions to a process for the adoption of model OH&S laws and will enable the development of uniform, equitable and effective safety standards and protections for all Australians. The purpose of the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill is to repeal the Australian Workplace Safety Standards Act 2005 and to deal with the consequential and transitional matters arising from that repeal and from the enactment of the Safe Work Australia Act 2008. Historically it has been trade unions which have driven the campaign to secure not just safe and healthy workplaces but also just compensation for workers killed and injured at work. Unfortunately, in its desire to rid workplaces of union influence, the former government made it more difficult for workers' representatives to report and investigate breaches of workplace safety laws. In fact, the whole Work Choices legislation made it very difficult for workers to raise issues of concern with safety. If you are working on a factory floor under an individual contract and you can be dismissed without any reall course to unfair dismissal legislation, and there is something that may cost the employer money to fix but is affecting safety, which employee is going to go and raise that with the employer, when there is the threat of losing their job? Which employee would be brave enough to put their job on the line in relation to these issues, because Work Choices meant that they could be terminated without any reason? So Work Choices fundamentally was attacking the safety of all workers at workplaces around Australia. This, coupled with individual contracts, put workers in Australia in the incredible position of not only having no bargaining power in relation to the conditions in which they worked, and being dealt with on an individual basis, but also having no unfair dismissal rights. So, if they wished to raise any opposition, any issues-be they more generally about their workplace conditions or more specifically about OH&S issues-they did so at their own peril. This was the fundamental evil of Work Choices-the fundamental evil that the Australian people on 24 November rejected outright and said had to change. There can never be too much priority placed on safety in the workplace. When people go to work in the morning, they expect to come home at the end of the day. Anything that can assist in making the workplace safer, anything that can be changed to take away those sorts of risks, needs to be supported. More than 300 Australians are killed each year at work. Many more die as a result of work related disease. Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. The cost to our economy has been estimated at $34 billion per year. The cost to those injured and to their families, workmates and friends is inestimable. In my electorate of Dobell, on the New South Wales Central Coast, there are still vivid memories in the community of the young mother left widowed when her husband was electrocuted on the job at a shopping centre refit, leaving her six-year-old son and nine-month-old daughter without a father. The young mother, Andrea Veigas, later said: Every Australian worker deserves to work in a safe workplace. I don't want Glen to just be a statistic. I want his death to be a wake all employers, employees, governments and the whole of Australia. That is a sentiment that one cannot argue against. More recently I was able to attend the memorial of a bricklayer in my electorate who was crushed by a wall at a new residential-golf estate, leaving behind a large family who are also now without their husband, father and grandfather. These are just two of hundreds of similar tragic stories heard across the country, a constant reminder that unsafe work environments are unacceptable. I also think of the 228 truck drivers killed last year on our roads and the efforts that we need to make to ensure that this tragic road toll is reduced and that those truck drivers can go to work every day in a safer environment. Safe Work Australia Week will be marked throughout Australia from 19 to 25 October. In reality, we should be thinking about the safest possible workplaces 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Occupational health and safety is an important consideration for all Australian workers, their families and loved ones, and, of course, business. Good OH&S practices not only provide a safer working environment but improve worker morale and productivity. By pursuing good OH&S practices, businesses face fewer workplace injuries and benefit from higher employee retention rates and enhanced corporate image. This reduces the costs associated with production delays, recruiting new staff and replacing equipment, and it avoids the resulting uncertainty and workload pressures placed on co-workers. Businesses who strive to improve their OH&S performance create safer workplaces which benefit not only employers and employees but their families, their communities and the Australian economy. Commitment to better practise OH&S is best sustained through a focus on performance outcomes which can be reported on and up call to monitored over time. Measurement of OH&S performance demonstrates a commitment to improving the safety of workers. Achieving uniform standards across Australia will always present challenges. Before I came to this place, I was the National Secretary of the Health Services Union, and I can fully understand the difficulties of dealing with seven different workplace safety jurisdictions. Health organisations like Ramsay Health Care, which has hospitals in most states and jurisdictions around Australia, need to have specialists in each state to deal with the separate legislation that operates in each of those areas. The changes that these bills foreshadow will make that a thing of the past. They will make it easier for businesses to deal with these issues and to put greater resources onto the shop floor to make sure that workers are safer at their workplace. Coupled with these changes are other changes constantly occurring in this country's work environment: an increasingly mobile workforce across state boundaries, a growing trend towards short-term work contracts and a workforce where increasingly English is not the first language, as I have seen in my experience in the health services area. All these factors present hurdles for us as a society to offer safer workplaces. But our goals are attainable. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential part of the government's stratthing egy to improve safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. In order to achieve this it is vital that we have a central organisation that can collaborate with the Commonwealth, states and territories. The Safe Work Australia Bill establishes the operational arrangements to support this new statutory body, including provisions relating to the nomination, appointment and terms and conditions of members. The bill covers conflict-of-interest issues, procerangements; dures relating to the conduct of meetings and to decision-making processes, and the development of plans and requirements for reporting to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. It enables the chair to constitute committees to draw upon a wide range of expertise for the performance of its functions. Safe Work Australia will be a reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. Safe Work Australia will be funded by both the Commonwealth, at 50 per cent, and the states and territories, at 50 per cent. Safe Work Australia will be a tripar20 tite body comprising 15 members, including an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, and two representing the interests of employers and the CEO. The minister will make all appointments to Safe Work Australia based on nominations from each body. What a change it makes to hear discussion in this chamber about tripartite organisations, given the last 12 years. Very rarely in the last 12 years have members opposite mentioned in this chamber that unions and representatives of employees should actually be included as voices on these bodies. It is a great that this government is setting up this tripartite organisation to assist in making sure that our workplaces are safer. Safe Work Australia will develop national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation; prepare, monitor and revise model OH&S legislation; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions; develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arimportantly, collect, analyse and publish OH&S and workers compensation data and undertake research; drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety at work; further develop the National OHS Strategy 2002-2012; and advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on OH&S and workers compensation matters. The development of the National OHS Strategy 2002-2012, which I just mentioned, will be an important facet of the new Safe Work Australia body. This strategy already contains important targets for making Australian workplaces safer. These are to sustain a significant, continual reduction in workrelated fatalities, with a reduction of at least per cent by 30 June 2012, and to reduce the incidence of workplace injury by at least 40 per cent by 30 June 2012. The five priorities identified by the national strategy to achieve shortand long-term OH&S improvement and to nurture long-term cultural change are: to reduce the impact of risks at work; to improve the capacity of business operators and workers to manage OH&S effectively; to prevent occupational disease more effectively; to eliminate hazards at the design stage; and to strengthen the capacity of government to influence OH&S outcomes. The national strategy focuses on particular OH&S risks and industry sectors to maximise the impact of the initiatives. The risks targeted are musculoskeletal disorders, falls from heights and hitting or being hit by objects. These three risks account for more than half of the workers compensation claims across Australia. The four priority industry sectors originally targeted were building and construction, transport and storage, manufacturing, and health and community services. More recently, agriculture, forestry and fisheries were added as priority sectors. These sectors were chosen because they were identified through data analysis as having the highest incidence rates and/or a high number of workers compensation claims compared with other industries. By working with these sectors, not only are lives being saved but these industries will set examples of OH&S best practice for other employers to follow. The bill will also create and maintain mechanisms for the review and revision of the effectiveness of Safe Work Australia in performing its functions. This will ensure that the new body is active and operating efficiently and responsively in meeting its strategic and operational goals. The minister will make all appointments to Safe Work Australia: the independent chair-and for this appointment the minister must consult the Workplace Relations Ministers Council; a Commonwealth representative; one representative nominated by each state and territory; and two representatives nominated by worker and employer groups authorised by the minister-this will enable the minister to identify bodies that represent workers and employers and seek nominations from them. Safe Work Australia will be assisted by a non-voting CEO and staff. Safe Work Australia's voting rules were agreed in the context of the intergovernmental agreement. For decisions other than decisions on the model OH&S legislation, 50 per cent of the voting members are required to constitute a quorum, with a two-thirds majority of those present required to agree to the decision. For decisions on the model OH&S legislation, there is an additional requirement that a majority of the Commonwealth, state and territory representatives must agree. Safe Work Australia will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states and territories. Funding is estimated at $17 million in the first full year, with the Commonwealth contributing half of that-some $8.5 million. The government has set itself the task of creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary state duplications, overlaps and differences. Occupational health and safety is a prime candidate for this sort of reform. Since coming to office we have undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme, set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national OH&S review and developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with our state and territory counterparts to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally. This bill, together with the intergovernmental agreement, ushers in a new era of cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in this important area-a collaboration which will improve the health and safety of workers across Australia and reduce the complexity of regulation for businesses. Again, what a difference it is to hear in this chamber the government talking about cooperating with the states and territories rather than trying to railroad them and run straight over the top them as the previous government did with Work Choices. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council established by the Howard government as an advisory council whose functions were confined to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts on health and safety and workers compensation. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation are too important to be neglected any longer. Workers' lives and health are at stake, and too is the efficiency of our economy. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform will increase profitability and productivity and better protect the lives and health of Australians. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in this reform. commend the bills to the House.",27
8,Mr NEUMANN,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"My city of Ipswich prospered under the woollen mills, meat works, railway workshops and coal mines. But I recall, as a young boy, the events of 31 July 1972 at 2.47 am. I remember waking up to a loud bang and thinking, ‘I wonder why my house is rocking.' Many people who lived in Ipswich originally mistook the explosion that night at Box Flat mine for an earthquake. The previous evening, a fire that started in the mine had grown to the stage where it could not be extinguished. A final team of 14 men entered the mine via number 7 tunnel to investigate and explore options to contain the fire, while three more men were stationed and working at the entrance to number 5 conveyor belt tunnel. A short time later a huge explosion was to claim the lives of all 17 men, while others were injured. Rescue and recovery efforts were proposed but not undertaken due to the danger of further explosions and the reality that no-one could possibly have survived underground. The mine was then sealed, entombing those who remained. of There were injuries sustained by others in the explosion. The Box Flat tragedy left an indelible mark on the city of Ipswich. A permanent memorial has been erected on Swanbank Road near the original Box Flat mine shaft to honour the men and to ensure the disaster will never be forgotten. The strong mining community of Ipswich was even stronger in 1972. Many people were related to the lost miners and knew them as comrades, friends or just acquaintances. They all felt the tragso edy. The city of Ipswich was saddened and the tragedy left a legacy that the people of Ipswich will never forget. I had the privilege of growing up opposite Digger Murphy, who was the head of the coalminers federation in Queensland, and I reading, on many occasions, Common Cause, which was the coalminers federation's newsletter. Just around the corner from me, former Ipswich Mayor Des Freeman lived with his wife, Colleen. Des was an organiser with what is now known as the CFMEU. He told me many stories, as did Digger, of the troubles and travails of the coalminers federation and of the occupational health and safety issues which they confronted every day. I am pleased to speak in relation to the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 because it affects the many men and women who work in difficult vocations in my community. Last Saturday I met with some meatworkers in my electorate office who told me about the difficulties in the meat industry, the hard yakka that they undertake and the challenges to occupational health and safety that they face every day. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Julia Gillard, released the comparative performance monitoring report on Australia's occupational health and safety and workers compensation outcomes in 2006-07. It was subsequently endorsed in Sydney by the state and territory workplace relations ministers. The key findings of that report are startling. In 2006-07 there were 236 fatalities recorded in Australia, of which 177 were from injuries and musculoskeletal disorders and 57 were from other diseases. Body stressing continues to be the mechanism of injury and disease that accounts for the greatest proportion of claims: 42 per cent. The manufacturing industry recorded the highest incidence of claims per 1,000 employees-27.5; followed by transport and storage-25.9; agriculture, forestry and fishery-25.3; and construction-22.1. Over three-quarters of injured workers successfully return to work within eight to 10 months of sustaining their injury. The truth is that we need to harmonise Australia's OHS laws. That was an election commitment by the Rudd Labor opposition, and it is a priority for COAG, tivity Commission and for the states. Historically, the 19th century saw the rise of safety legislation for the old factories and shops, going back to 1878 and 1901. By 1970, each of the six states had their own OHS statute based on the traditional British model. The weaknesses of this traditional approach were well known to most people. There was a mass of detail, there were technical rules which were difficult to understand and not kept up to date, and standards were ad hoc and mainly based on factory based physical hazards. There was uneven coverage across workplaces. It really did not give much incentive to innovate to look for better arrangements for workers and it did not give much incentive for employers to do likewise. Before the 1990s most of the OHS regulations in the Australian jurisdiction were in separate instruments. It was not uncommon for each jurisdiction to have dozens of sets regulations, each covering a specific hazard. So we were left with a great legacy of problems of overregulation and trouble in terms of working out which particular regulation, instrument or law applied to which workplace. The sad thing about the previous coalition government was their desire to drive trade unions from the workplaces of Australia. That had an impact not just on wages and conditions but also on OHS. In fact, I just could not understand why they put in prohibited content the idea that workers could be paid leave to attend meetings conducted by and made up of trade union members, which would include OHS training. It goes to show the extent to which they opposed OHS training in the workplace. The idea of averaging out your work over a maximum 12-month period, effectively overriding the 38-hour week, had the impact of increasing the likelihood of an overworked labour force and, therefore, more injuries in the workplace, not to mention restrictions on right of entry in for the Produc- the circumstances. The 2007 Queensland inquiry into the impact of Work Choices on Queensland workplaces found that employers and employees were extremely apprehensive about job security, leading many employees to refrain from raising occupational health and safety issues. That is no surprise because trade unions have been critical in raising the awareness of OHS and forcing greater commitment by management to prevent accidents. There has been a great deal of struggle by the unions to improve the laws in this regard. They have demanded so much more on behalf of their members who have suffered disease, injury and illness as a result of failures in the workplace. The University of New South Wales study in 2005 reviewed 106 cases published between 1966 and 2005, measuring OHS effects on job security and workplace changes, of which included a number of indices such as injury, disease, hazard exposure, stress and compliance with OHS laws and management systems. The results were compelling. Of 61 studies of job insecurity and downsizing, 53-87 per cent-found adverse OHS effects. Among 23 studies of outsourcing, subcontracting and home-based work, all 23100 per cent-found an adverse effect on OHS. Of 22 studies of casual work labour hire, 15-68 per cent-found worse OHS comparable to permanent employees. That goes to show that the casualisation of the workforce and the driving out of trade unions from the workplace resulted in greater hazards to workers. The James Hardie situation is probably the starkest example of a company's failure to care for its workers' occupational health and safety. It is expected that 30,000 to 40,000 Australians will have contracted an asbestos related cancer by 2020. This compares to the 40,500 military deaths suffered by Australians in World War II. The mining and manufacturing of asbestos products took place in Australia for most of the last century. It widespread until the 1980s. From the 1950s until the 1970s, Australia was the highest capita user of asbestos in the world. Every third domestic dwelling built before 1982 was thought to contain asbestos. It was used in cement sheeting or fibro-I grew up in a fibro house-until the mid-1980s. Asbestos was finally banned in Australian workplaces only in January 2004. The Productivity Commission inquiry in 2004 on national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks pointed to the compliance burdens, costs and inefficiencies of multistate employers having 10 principal workers compensation schemes and OH&S regimes. The Howard government did little in this regard. They seemed want to federalise OH&S in some respects, but it seemed to have the effect of reducing protection for workers. For example, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Act 2005 reduced the need for employers to consult with unions over the appointment of health and safety representatives. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Promoting Safer Workplaces) Bill 2005 invalidated industrial manslaughter provisions of the ACT Occupational Health and Safety Act and of similar industrial manslaughter laws enacted by the states and territories. They are just two examples of where the previous government failed in terms of OH&S. The Rudd government is committed to safer workplaces. As I said, the former Howard government failed to address significant issues in the area of workplace health and safety because of its blinkered ideological obsession with Work Choices. We must rid ourselves of the legislative and regulatory contradictions, distinctions and double-ups. Workplace health and safety will not be forgotten under the Rudd government as it was was under the Howard government. We believe that inaction in the area of workplace health per and safety is bad for business and bad for employees. I am happy to speak on this bill because it affects my local community, where so much industrial activity goes on. We have in Ipswich 43 per cent of the industrial land in South-East Queensland, so it is a very important issue for my local community. At its core, this bill ends unnecessary duplication and overlap. It will harmonise occupational health and safety regulations, uphold existing safety standards, streamline the different state systems and reduce complexity for all concerned. It delivers on our pre-election promise to commit to safer workplace reform and to introduce legislato tion to establish a national body tasked with adopting a uniform state and territory approach to occupational health and safety and workers compensation. The announcement of the new body, Safe Work Australia, follows agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories to harmonise laws and systems. This intergovernmental agreement, reached at the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on 3 July 2008, commits all jurisdictions to a process for the adoption of model occupational health and safety laws that will enable the development of uniform, equitable and effective safety standards and protections for all Australian workers. Governments on both sides have done this on numerous occasions in the past in the areas of corporation law and defamation law, and the current government is doing it in the area of family law. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council established by the Howard government, which was simply an advisory body. What we are doing today is a huge departure from that body. Unlike the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, Safe Work Australia will be an independent, reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. It is certainly an advance on the previous government's model. It is intended that Safe Work Australia will end complex and costly inconsistencies in occupational health and safety and workers compensation laws across Australia. As the minister promised, it is an inclusive, tripartite body. It is a disturbing reality that more than 250 Australians were killed and about 140,000 seriously injured last year. The cost to the Australian taxpayer is upwards of $34 billion a year. That is an extraordinary cost to the Australian taxpayer. And, for those people who experienced the Box Flat mining disaster, the cost to them was horrendous. As the Deputy Prime Minister aptly stated: Our health, safety and compensation systems are in a sorry state-unnecessarily complex and costly. It is a sad reality that inconsistencies between the jurisdictions expose workers to a greater risk of working in workplaces with poorer safety standards. It is simply unacceptable in the 21st century that we have such complexity, paperwork and costs for the 39,000 Australian businesses that operate across state boundaries. Safe Work Australia will be a nationally independent statutory authority established to lead and improve occupational health and safety and workers compensation. Its membership comprises the Commonwealth, states and territories, workers, employers and the CEO. It is great that we have workers' representatives on this body, because they are the ones, along with employers, who experience this day in and day out. This is a significant departure from the attitude of the previous government with respect to the involvement of workers' representatives. I am not fazed or worried about the review, which will be conducted every six years. There seems to be some consternation opposite in relation to this issue. It does not concern me at all, because I think that this process needs time to work its way through. With an initial budget of $17 million and an independent chair, this statutory body will be a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. One of the first tasks it will undertake will be to develop the model occupational health and safety legislation for all jurisdictions. The Inter-Governmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety, which was signed by the leaders of the eight jurisdictions, is a landmark agreement. It is the first time in the history of our Federation that governments from each state and territory have formally embarked on harmonising our occupational health and safety. The intergovernmental agreement underpins the Council of Australian Governments agenda to harmonise occupational health and safety across Australia by 2011. The Workplace Relations Ministers Council will be responsible for undertaking this process, with details delegated to the new national occupational health and safety body. The objective of the reform covered by the agreement is to produce the optimal model for a national approach, as I said. I am pleased to speak on this bill because it will have a big impact on the meat works where I had my first job, which employs 2,300 people in the local area; the coal mines, which still operate in the wider Ipswich area; the gas stations; the railway workshops in the Ipswich area; the butter factory, where my father worked; and so many other businesses which make up the Ipswich area, including the booming aerospace industry. Safety in the workplace for white-collar workers and safety in the workplace for blue-collar workers is essential, and we cannot ignore those challenges. It is terrific that the Rudd government is undertaking this task. It is appropriate. And it is a sad indictment that, after nearly 12 years, the Howard government failed, and failed miserably, in this regard, blinkered by their obsession with Work Choices and their attack upon the working men and women of this country. It is a shame that they failed in this regard and it is left to us, on this side the House, to undertake the task to protect the rights and interests of workers not just in terms of their wages and conditions but in terms of their occupational health and safety. I commend the bill to the House.",31
9,Mr SYMON,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise today to speak in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. As promised during the 2007 election campaign, Labor is committed to introducing a new national and independent authority to both lead and improve occupational health and safety and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The Safe Work Australia Bill provides for Safe Work Australia to have representatives of unions, employer groups, state and territory governments and the Commonwealth government, along with an independent chair. The organisation's budget will be 50 per cent funded by the Commonwealth, with the states and territories providing proportional funding for the remaining 50 per cent. A key priority of Safe Work Australia will be to develop model OH&S legislation for adoption by all state and territory jurisdictions, model legislation that will be delivering on the Rudd government's commitment to harmonise OH&S laws whilst working in cooperation with all state and territory governments. Along with the development of model OH&S codes of practice and other OH&S materials, Safe Work Australia will prepare a national compliance and enforcement policy. Safe Work Australia will also undertake research and collect, analyse and publish OH&S and workers compensation data. This bill as presented follows on from the signing by all of the states and territories and the Commonwealth of the Inter-Governmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational of Reform in Occupational Health and Safety earlier this year. The intergovernmental agreement contains a process for the adoption of model OH&S laws by all Australian jurisdictions and will enable the development of effective, equitable and-just as importantly-uniform safety standards and protections for all Australians at work. Existing national standards and codes of practice developed by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council and its predecessor, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, will be preserved under the consequential and transitional provisions bill. Safe Work Australia will also have the power to declare national standards and codes of practice relating to OH&S matters until 1 January 2011. Over time, these standards and codes of practice will be replaced by model regulations and codes of practice approved by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. In April this year, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Julia Gillard, announced a national review into model OH&S laws. A three-person panel has been asked to review OH&S legislation in each state, territory and Commonwealth jurisdiction for the purpose of making recommendations on the optimal structure and content of a model OH&S act that is capable of being adopted in all jurisdictions. The view will examine the division of duties of care between employers and employees, including the identification of duty holders, along with the scope and limits of duties. This first stage of the review will also examof ine the nature and structure of safety offences, including defences to safety breaches. It will make recommendations to state and federal workplace relations ministers by 31 October. A later report, due by 30 January 2009, will cover other areas. These will include scope and coverage, including definitions; workplace based consultation, participation and representation provisions, including the appointment, powers and functions of occupational health and safety representatives OH&S committees; enforcement and compliance, including the role and powers of OH&S inspectors and the application of enforcement tools, including codes of practice; regulation-making powers and administrative processes, including mechanisms for improving cross-jurisdictional cooperation and dispute resolution; permits and licensing arrangements for those engaged in high-risk work and the use of certain plant and hazardous substances; and the role of OH&S regulatory agencies in providing education, advice and assistance to duty holders. These reports will form the basis of the model workplace safety laws, which the Council of Australian Governments has agreed to produce within five years. When the reports are handed down, Safe Work Australia will be responsible for developing national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation and preparing model OH&S legislation, model regulations and model codes of practice based on the findings and recommendations of the review reports. Every year over 300 Australian workers are killed at work. The number who die from various occupational diseases has been estiremated at 10 times that amount. Every year over 140,000 Australians are injured whilst at work. These figures, whilst appalling in human terms, also place a massive burden on Australia's economy, estimated to be a cost $34 billion per year. There is no excuse for ignoring the safety of workers in the workplace. There is nothing more important than a worker returning home, at the end of a working day or shift, in as good a shape as at the start of the day's labour. And there certainly is no good reason why some workers should be afforded less protection at work just because they happen to work in a different state or territory than others. Each state and territory has different acts and regulations covering occupational health and and safety. Some good acts and regulations and some not so good acts and regulations can be found in each jurisdiction. What might have been good practice 15 or 20 years ago is not necessarily up to date with that of other legislatures now. It is very easy to forget that only 15 years ago the vast majority of the population had no access to, and in most cases had not even heard of, the internet, let alone used it as a means of information gathering or research outside of a university setting. Just being able to find a copy of another state's act, regulation or code of practice took a great deal of time and money as various letters and heavy packages were sent across the country. Best-practice outcomes in one state could remain off the radar in other jurisdictions for years at a time due to the difficulty of accesscompleted ing, especially on a work site, OH&S information for comparison. With internet access now available in most places, there is a much greater need for consistency in OH&S so that, when a solution is found for a problem in one jurisdiction, it can be analysed and, if relevant, applied elsewhere within a far shorter time frame than could previously have happened. For many years I worked on site in the construction industry as an OH&S representative and at other times as a safety officer. Whichever side of the fence I happened to be working on, the task did not really change. On both sides it was about being proactive and keeping up to date with what was happening on other sites, not just in the city of Melbourne and in Victoria but in other states and across the world. There should never be any excuse for not undertaking a job safety analysis and risk assessment prior to work progressing. Shortcuts in safety do not mean that the job gets done more quickly; they mean that it gets done with a much greater risk of something going wrong. Education of both employers and employees is the key to good safety outcomes and it is vital that this area is never ignored. Far too many times I have seen the results on site when safety was ignored, usually at great physical cost to a worker or placing a worker under risk. Having been an OH&S representative or an OH&S officer, I know that one very important aspect of the job is the collection and analysis of safety related data and statistics. The complexity of the job could be enormous at times. There were so many different approaches to OH&S solutions in Australia alone. Each state had its own approach and there were sometimes subtle or major differences between legislation, regulations and codes of practice. This has extended into areas of occupational licensing such that, even if a nationally recognised course is in one jurisdiction, it is not automatically recognised in another. As a licensed electrician by trade, I can speak from personal experience. Over the years I have held several different state licences to work as an electrician but all have been based on the same Victorian apprenticeship training and licensing exam dating back more than 20 years. Licensing is an essential public protection that ensures that electricians are appropriately trained and qualified. It is a long standing and effective safety measure but has always been controlled by the separate state and territory authorities. In turn, each jurisdiction has developed its own special rules and requirements on top of the mandatory Standards Australia wiring rules. Mostly these differences were quite minor in nature, but a licence issued in one state would not be accepted in any other. Working around the country with three or more licences to perform the same job never made any sense. The equivalent would be having to hold another state's driving licence every time you travel across the border. The issue of recognition of interstate occupational trades licensing has been dealt with by COAG since the election of the Rudd Labor government last November. This is but one small example of how different jurisdictions can affect an individual worker. In each state and territory and under the Commonwealth, workers compensation systems are varied and provide different coverage and payments to injured workers and the dependants of those who tragically die or are injured whilst at work. And in recent years we have seen the former Howard government extend the Comcare system into private enterprise areas that the scheme was never designed for, such as mining, transport and construction. The Comcare scheme was primarily designed for white-collar jobs in the public sector, not blue-collar jobs in heavy industry. The OH&S compliance issues that arise from having competing schemes operating are still to be fully understood, but work site inspections, notices and prosecutions are much lower under Comcare than under the competing state schemes. As the member for Corio noted in his speech on this bill: … if you were an employer in Victoria in that year2005-06you were 24 times more likely to be the subject an inspectionunder WorkSafe Victoriathan if you were an employer in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. This figure does not indicate that work practices and safety outcomes improve just because an employer has managed to move from a state OH&S system into the federal Comcare system. It comes about because of the woefully small number of inspectors employed and work site inspections undertaken in comparison with WorkSafe Victoria. The Workplace Relations Ministers Council's Comparative performance monitoring: seventh report: November 2005 found that Comcare undertook 245 ‘workplace interventions'-also known as site visitscompared to WorkSafe Victoria's 43,719 site visits. In that period Comcare issued only 17 safety prohibition and improvement notices in Victoria whilst WorkSafe Victoria issued 12,492 notices. And in the report's time frame, Comcare did not prosecute anyone in Victoria, whilst WorkSafe Victoria launched 110 prosecutions. The role of a workplace inspector for a safety authority is vital, but there must be a sufficient number of inspectors to cover the workforce and there must be an organisational will to be proactive where it counts-that is, on site. Developing proposals to harmonise workers compensation arrangements across the Commonwealth, states and territories is an essential part of this bill. Just as important is the development of proposals for national workers compensation arrangements for employers with workers in more than one jurisdiction. Rather than forcing states and territories to toe the Howard line, as we have seen with the spectacular failure of Work Choices, where millions of workers were ripped off with wages and conditions with no recompense, the Rudd government is vitally of aware of the impact that changes in the workplace can have on the lives of working people. Although Work Choices is still held dear to the hearts of all those opposite, without exception we see and hear day after day in this House the sheer arrogance and the out-of-touch views that in the Liberal Party also extend to working people's safety on the job. We do not need competing workers compensation and OH&S systems that provide different levels of safety and coverage. We need OH&S systems and workers compensation schemes that work proactively to reduce accidents and to improve safety outcomes, and this bill provides the framework for that outcome. I commend this bill to the House.",35
10,Mr ZAPPIA,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I, too, rise to speak in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. In fact, I very much welcome the opportunity to speak about a matter which affects the well-being of almost 11 million working Australians. I begin by pointing out that the introduction of these bills is in fact quite timely; it comes just after the Seoul Declaration on Safety and Health at Work was agreed to on 29 June this year. The declaration comes after some 4,000 people, including industry leaders, policymakers and experts from over 100 countries, met in Seoul in the Republic of Korea from 29 June to 2 July for the 18th World Congress on Safety and Health at Work. I quote from parts of that declaration. I will not quote it all because it is too long, but I will quote in particular from the preamble, which says: Recognizing the serious consequences of work-related accidents and diseases, which the International Labour Office estimates lead to 2.3 million fatalities per year world-wide and an economic loss of 4 percent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Recognizing that improving safety and health at work has a positive impact on working conditions, productivity and economic and social development … That is in the preamble. The declaration itself, in part, goes on to say that governments should: Ensure that the occupational safety and health of workers is protected through an adequate and appropriate system of enforcement of safety and health standards, including a strong and effective labour inspection system. In part 5, where it refers to employers, it says: Employers should ensure that - Prevention is an integral part of their ties, as high safety and health standards at work go hand and hand with good business performance. - It then goes on to say that employers should ensure: - Affirming the workers' right to a safe and healthy working environment, workers should be consulted on safety and health matters … Those are some of the comments made at an international meeting only two months ago where the importance of health and safety was debated and, interestingly, agreed to by people representing some 100 countries and a collection of 4,000 people, including government, industry organisations, labour organisations and so on. As I said earlier, I believe it is most appropriate that these bills are being debated in this House at this time. The opportunity to have a meaningful job, earn an income and be self-reliant is probably the single most important objective for most Australians. Job creation underpins and drives much of our economic policy. One measure of success or failure of economic policy is unemployment rates or, conversely, employment numbers. There is no question that being employed is very important for the quality of life of a person and for the family members of that person; but, just as we go to great lengths to create jobs, we should likewise go to great lengths to ensure that those jobs are safe and that the workplaces where those jobs are created are safe workplacessafe workplaces which ensure a worker's safety both during the course of the work and in the years thereafter. All too often the risks and injuries related to workplaces are not evident until many years later. That in turn makes claims for compensation or other forms of assistance extremely difficult and complicated. Only last Saturday week, whilst attending the 10th annual charter dinner of the Para districts activisub-branch of the National Servicemen's Association, I came across a typical example of a work injury which was only exposed several years after the person left the workplace where it appears the injury-or, in this case, the illness-was caused. At that function I spoke to an acquaintance whom I had not seen for several years. He informed me that he had recently been diagnosed with asbestosis. Some years ago he had worked with asbestos products as a tradesman, and one can only conclude that the work had contributed to his now serious illness. Proving that many years later would be very difficult. Sadly, his case is similar that of thousands of other Australians who over the years worked with asbestos products and in later years, sometimes years after their employer ceased to operate, were diagnosed with asbestosis-or mesothelioma, as it is medically known. The plight of asbestos victims rose to national prominence in recent years as a result of the James Hardie case and the work of Bernie Banton and others associated with asbestos victims. My association with asbestos victims goes back some years. For several years I have been a patron of the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia. I was able to assist them to establish in the of Salisbury a memorial to the many asbestos victims who, in most cases, were victims of unsafe workplaces. I met Bernie Banton when he attended an annual memorial service for asbestos victims in Salisbury some three years ago. I also knew well Colin Arthur, the founder of the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia. Like Bernie Banton, he too became a victim of asbestosis and a champion for sufferers of this terrible disease. Colin Arthur also lost his battle with asbestosis and passed away shortly before his friend and colleague Bernie Banton passed away. What Colin Arthur and others were able to achieve, however, was to draw attention to the responsibilities and obligations of employers, particularly those in the asbestos industry, with respect to workplace safety. The work of Bernie Banton, Colin Arthur and others associated with asbestos disease is not over; it continues today. In South Australia, Terry Miller, who now heads the Asbestos Victims Association, and a small team of volunteers are continuing their fight for fair compensation for asbestos victims and for safety in the workplace-where asbestos products still exist-because asbestos products are still prevalent throughout communito ties. The handling of asbestos products poses a risk for workers, particularly workers in the building and demolition industries. According to research carried out by Dr Mark Clements from the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University, the peak in mesothelioma cases is likely to occur in about 10 years time. So we have not seen the worse of this deadly disease even though we stopped using asbestos products some years ago. What makes the issues associated with asbestos even more repugnant is the fact that asbestos producers knew 100 or more years ago that they were producing a deadly prodcity uct. In fact, as far back as 1918 it was reported that life insurance companies refused to issue life insurance policies to people who worked in the asbestos industries. Yet companies like James Hardie and others knowingly put the lives of people at risk. That is unforgivable. They should have faced far more serious charges than they did. I also want to raise the issue of workplace safety in the transport industry. It was interesting to hear many of the speakers debate the AusLink (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill 2008 only a few days ago. Many of them quite properly referred to the poor condition of many roads and to the risks faced by many drivers in the transport sector which often result in the death of drivers. What was not highlighted, however, in drawing attention to the risks and injuries caused in the transport sector is that these are not just road deaths but workplace injuries as well. When the issue of injuries or deaths resulting from transport accidents is raised, the fact that they are also workplace injuries is often overlooked or not considered. These are workplace injuries or deaths, and in no way should the safety obligations of the employers in the transport sector be transferred and the injuries dismissed as just road accidents. It is also the case that transport ers, more so than workers in many other industries, often work across state borders. They provide a good example of why we need national consistency in workplace laws and compensation laws, which is exactly what this bill aims to do. Before being elected to this place I worked extensively with injured workers, assisting them with their physical rehabilitation so that they could return to work. Some of the injuries I saw were horrific. What I also noted was that the overwhelming number of people who suffered from workplace injuries were keen to return to work and resume a normal life. Just because they were on rehabilitation programs or being paid workers compensation did not mean they were rorting the system. They did not enjoy being out of work. Their self-esteem dropped, their standard of living declined and their general quality of life suffered not just because of the injury but just as much because they were unable to work and felt that they were dependent on others. What was just as demoralising for them was the stigma of being on compensation and the lack of compassion with which they were often treated by insurance companies, government officials, sometimes medical professionals and even some of their friends and colleagues. Sadly, many of these people are never adequately compensated for the injuries they sustain because, out of frustration with the process they have to navigate and the length of time it often takes, they accept whatever is offered just so that they can try and resume a normal life. Just as disheartening for them is that, when they do want to re-enter the workforce, they may be discriminated against because of their history of having a work related injury. It is also of concern to me that those who are in the most unsafe workplaces and exposed to greater workplace risks are workoften young people, migrants and those who work in lower paid jobs. Those people are often not aware of their rights or they need the work too much to speak out, even when they know the workplace is unsafe. The other matter I wish to raise in conjunction with this bill is the impact that the intensely competitive markets can have on workplace safety and the behaviour of employers. I note that the member for Deakin, in his address, made similar comments. I endorse the comments he made about the impact on workplace safety. In recent years I have noted a trend whereby employers, in order to remain competitive, are cutting costs to the point where employees are being placed at increased levels of risk. Employees are often asked to work longer hours or to do more work because of skill shortages or simply because it costs the employer less to pay employees overtime than to employ additional staff. The result is that, with tiredness, the risk of injuries rises. The truck drivers I referred to earlier are an obvious example of this, but they are certainly not the only group in this category. It happens in so many other workplaces in the manufacturing industry, where tiredness obviously increases the risk of machine operators getting hurt. Cutting back on staff or on maintenance has a similar effect. I want to quote from a press release issued by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on Monday, 1 September. It relates to Qantas. CASA's operations officer, Mick Quinn, stated: CASA has looked carefully at the Qantas maintenance systems and performance and uncovered signs of emerging problems. The review found maintenance performance within Qantas is showing some adverse trends and is now below the airline's own benchmarks. By taking action now future safety problems will be avoided. CASA was inquiring into some safety concerns in respect of the airline industry generally and into some incidents that had occurred. The comments in that media release highlight what is happening in industries across the board where, in order to save costs, maintenance regimes are not being implemented. Obviously, what then occurs is that safety standards deteriorate. In this case the emphasis is on the public who use the airlines. But what is not acknowledged in that media statement is that, apart from the passengers who are using those airlines, there are also the pilots and crew who are working for a living, and in their case it occupational, health and safety issue. Hopefully, this legislation will address many of those matters. There is another safety matter that has been occurring in recent years which has often gone unrecognised. Because of cost cutting by the private sector in many service industries, we have seen an escalation in the number of office workers who are facing risks because their workplaces are unsafe as a result of the hostile clients of those companies. Recent media statements about that very matter have revealed that the safety of office workers is being put at risk because the service is deteriorating because staff simply cannot cope with the workload. Clients become upset, agitated and angry and take their frustrations out on the staff who are working in those offices. That is another occupational health and safety matter that has resulted from cost cutting. The last matter that I wish to speak to is the introduction by the Howard government of its workplace laws and the impact that those laws have had on occupational health and safety. I commend the member for Dobell, who made some comments in respect of this matter. He highlighted some safety incidents and how safety standards are deteriorating as a result of the Howard government's laws. Perhaps it was one of the unintended consequences but the fact is that health and safety has deteriorated as a result of the previous government's workplace laws. On that very matter I was contacted recently by workers in South Australia who were gravely concerned about unsafe work practices at their place of employment. These practices appear to have escalated since the rights of working Australians were eroded by the Howard government. There is no question that, in the case of the workers who approached me, the reason why workplace is an safety has deteriorated is the Howard government's Work Choice laws and the prevention of safety officers from moving into those work areas and ensuring that workplace safety is up to the standards that we all would expect. There are many examples of where workers' safety has been placed at risk and is still at risk. With the election of the Rudd Labor government not only are those laws being changed-and that in itself will make a lot of difference to the ability of workers to ensure that their workplaces are safe-but we now have this additional bill which takes the issue of workplace safety so much further. Since I was talking about cost cutting and the implications it has for workplace safety, I make this point as strongly as I possibly can: the safety of people at their workplace should never be jeopardised because of cost cutting by employers. I want to make one point about the constant criticisms I have heard from members opposite that this new body will be ‘stacked'-to use their expression-by representatives of the state and federal governments. Given that the new body will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states, it would seem to me quite reasonable to ensure that each state contributing funds has at least one representative on the new board. More importantly, members opposite are prejudging the competency and impartiality of the people who will be appointed to this board, without even knowing who those people will be. I am sure that those people will be appointed because of their merits and their understanding of safety in the workplace and for no other reason. There will be appointments that will serve not only the interests of their state but, I am sure, the interests of the 11 million workers in Australia when it comes to matters of health and safety. I conclude on this note: when those members opposite criticise the states' rights to appoint someone to this board, are they now also criticising the Western Australian government, which is no longer a Labor government, or are they saying that it is only the Labor governments which are incompetent when it comes to managing workplace safety laws? I suspect that, since the change of government, they will wholeheartedly welcome the appointment of a person to this body by the Western Australian government. Whoever that person may be, I am sure they will represent the best interests of the broader community. This bill goes to the heart of bringing consensus, uniformity and some fairness and safety into the workplaces of Australia's 11 million workers. I commend the bill to the House.",38

13,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the Australian government condemns the cowardly suicide bomb attack on the Marriott hotel in Islamabad, Pakistan on 20 September. This brutal attack on civilians has killed at least 60 people and injured scores of others. Our condolences and thoughts are extended to the victims of the attack and their families. This attack on innocent people is a reminder of the terrorist threat to democracy and security in Pakistan. It is a threat against which the Australian government will stand united with the democratically elected government of Pakistan. Pakistan has proved to be resilient in the face of a series of terrorist outrages. These are attacks aimed at the democratic institutions of Pakistan and the people of that country. Pakistan's new President, Asif Zardari, has underlined that he and his administration will confront this terrorist challenge. Mr Zardari, of course, suffered his own tragic loss when his wife, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated by extremists just a few months ago. Terrorist attacks have continued since, but in the face of this violence the people of Pakistan remain overwhelmingly committed to democracy and moderation. Australia, as a friend of Pakistan, will assist that country in every way possible as it deals with the threats that it faces. The government of Pakistan is looking at ways in which we can expand our efforts to assist Pakistan in its fight. We are looking at practical ways to build on our existing law enforcement assistance and other assistance to Pakistan. Offering this assistance is good for Pakistan but also good for Australia. Pakistan is an important state for regional and global security. What happens in Pakistan, including in its border areas with Afghanistan, has an impact on its regional neighbours and the world and is therefore of direct relevance to Australia's continued presence in Afghanistan. For Australia, therefore, a stable, secure and democratic Pakistan is important to the success of our mission in Afghanistan. We are thankful that there are no reports at this time of any Australians being affected by the bombing and we will commit ourselves further in the fight against terrorism both at home and abroad.",43
14,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the opposition associates itself with the Prime Minister's condemnation of this cowardly attack. We join with the government in sending our condolences to the innocent victims, their families and friends. This is a tragic attack. It is a betrayal of rything that Islam stands for. It was particularly heinous because it coincided with the traditional Iftar dinner that was being held in the Marriott's banquet hall at the time. This is the evening meal for breaking the daily fast during the Islamic month of Ramadan, itself a time for peace and reflection. Those terrorists debased the name of Islam. They debased the cause of peace. NA 22 September 2008 NA Leader of the Opposition Shadow Treasurer (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) Shadow Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law Shadow This is a reminder of how hard the battle is for freedom and democracy around the world, how great the challenges are in a country like Pakistan and how courageous leaders are required to be in that country. The bombing came just after newly elected President Zardari delivered his first speech in parliament. As the Prime Minister observed, President Zardari's wife, Benazir Bhutto, twice Prime Minister of Pakistan and a heroic figure in her own right, was killed in a bomb attack moments after decrying violence in her country at a rally in Pakistan in December last year. What courage is required of democratic leaders in those countries, particularly Pakistan, today! Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of a Prime Minister hanged by his political opponents, was herself blown up in a terrorist bomb attack! These are very tough times for the cause of democracy in Pakistan, and the Australian government should do everything it can to support those who are courageously standing eve- up for freedom in that troubled country.

16,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, will you, prior to your departure overseas again, meet with me to discuss what bipartisan measures can be taken in response to the global financial crisis?",47
17,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A good start to bipartisanship would be to unblock the budget in the Senate. Six billion dollars is not, as has been suggested by some, a bit of loose change; it is important in producing a solid budget surplus, a buffer for Australia in difficult global financial circumstances. So bipartisanship should begin in the Senate, and I would strongly suggest to the leader of the Liberal Party that he instruct his Senate colleagues to unblock these budget measures. The reason for so doing is this: in uncertain global financial times the most irresponsible thing that can be done is to add to uncertainty. If a government in its budget delivers a budget surplus of $22 billion, the worse thing you can do to global markets is to say that an irresponsible political party in the Senate is NA Senator the Hon Richard Senator the Hon Eric Abetz Dr Andrew Southcott MP Senator Cory Bernardi Senator Concetta FierravantiStone MP Wells Senator Concetta FierravantiWells Senator the Hon Michael Ronaldson Cabinet Ministers are shown in bold type. threatening to block that surplus, given that Economy Australia stands uniquely positioned to have that buffer for the future.

18,Ms GRIERSON,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's response to the current turmoil in international financial markets?,47
19,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on the real economy worldwide, not just on global financial markets. The Australian government has a strong set of policy measures in place to see Australia through these difficult financial times. They begin with the budget surplus, to which I just referred to in my answer to the previous question, but they are also anchored in the strength of this government and this country's national financial regulatory institutions and in the extent of the collaboration between Australian financial regulatory institutions and those which exist abroad. Over the weekend the United States authorities proposed a significant initiative to address the financial crisis. Their plan would give the authority to the United States Treasury department to buy up to US$700 billion-that is US$700 billion-in mortgage related assets from financial institutions. The US Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, said on Sunday: This is not something that we wanted to do. This was something that was … necessary. This is a significant action on the part of the United States, and it is a welcome effort to put a floor under the problem by the US authorities. The program intends to fundamentally address the root cause of the financial system stresses in the United States by removing distressed assets from the financial system. Markets thus far, based on early reports of this impending US action, have responded positively in the United States and elsewhere. Members will also recall that on Wednesday last week the US Securities and Exchange Commission tightened restrictions on short selling. Australia followed this move on Friday by working through our regulator, ASIC, to place a temporary ban on naked short selling. On Friday night the USSEC took further action to temporarily ban all short sales of nearly 800 financial stocks. The announcement followed a similar move by financial regulators in the United Kingdom. As a consequence, and in response, ASIC announced yesterday they would impose a 30-day ban on short selling of all stocks. The government endorsed the coordinated response, which accords with similar action by the US and UK financial regulatory authorities. While appropriately regulated and disclosed short selling has a role to play in the effective operation of markets, it is appropriate to curtail its use at a time of heightened market volatility-and that is precisely what we have at present around the world. We are acting to help prevent market manipulators from artificially driving down stock prices. We cannot afford for that to happen in a time of unprecedented global financial instability as we have seen most recently on markets. In addition, the Commonwealth government will introduce legislation to improve the long-term disclosure requirements around short selling. As I indicated earlier to the House, Australia, while not being immune from the problems in the United States, nonetheless is better placed than most economies to weather the current storm. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has advised the government that Australian deposittaking and insurance companies supervised by APRA are well capitalised, profitable, well regulated, and they are weathering the turmoil well. The government has also been active on a range of other regulatory fronts and also through the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank has enhanced liquidity in the market to compensate for an increased demand for liquidity. The RBA has been expanding its money market operations during periods of particular stress, including in the overnight money markets. For example, over the past week, aggregate exchange settlement balances have lifted from $1.5 billion to close to $7 billion in the overnight money markets. This follows additional liquidity injections by the Reserve Bank into markets both in March and June of this year. In a further measure, the RBA also widened access to its repurchase agreement facilities by enabling financial institutions to use a much wider class of assets as collateral for such agreements. Again, this is designed to enhance liquidity. The RBA has been undertaking moves in this respect during the course of the financial crisis over the course of 2008. Furthermore, as a government we have, in partnership with the economic regulators, taken further steps to support liquidity in the government bond market to ensure our broader financial markets operate more effectively. We provided legislative authority for an increase in future Commonwealth government securities of some $25 billion, with an authorisation of $5 billion worth of further issuance in 2008-09. In a further measure of direct relevance to households, the Financial Stability Forum, in which Australia has been active, recommended in April of this year that authorities review and, where necessary, strengthen deposit insurance arrangements. For us that has meant taking action on the financial claims scheme-a financial claims scheme which would provide better protection for consumers in any uncertainties which would lie ahead. Internationally, Australia remains active with the Financial Stability Forum because we must act not just nationally but in absolute concert with regulators in the United States and elsewhere. That is why, through our financial authorities-APRA, ASIC, the RBA and Treasury-we have been working in all five areas of global collaboration with the FSF on strengthening prudential oversight of capital, enhancing transparency in valuation, changing the roles and uses of credit ratings, strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risks and implementing robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system. These are practical measures which the government, together with the financial regulatory authorities in Australia, have been taking in response to this crisis. It is important to continue to stress the absolute strength of Australia's regulators, the fact that our regulators are among the best in the world and that the government, in concert with the regulators, have been acting throughout the course of this crisis and throughout the course of 2008 in response to what is a global problem now confronting all economies. Economy",47
20,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the recently enacted Commonwealth Securities and Investment Legislation Amendment Act 2008, which was supported by the opposition, enables the government to provide additional liquidity to the mortgage market? Why did the Prime Minister and his Treasurer ridicule any discussion of Commonwealth investment in mortgage backed securities, when only two months ago the government changed the law to make such an investment possible?",49
21,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The position put forward by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, as I understand it, was that now in other markets, particularly in the United States, the government is taking a role and proposing to buy back some of these securities. That relates specifically to the measures announced in the United States to which I referred in my answer before-an action taken by the United States Treasury to use $700 billion worth of US money to purchase bad debt from those who currently hold those mortgages on the part of US financial institutions. Why have the US regulator and the US Treasury done that? Because, if you go to the actual state of the problem in the United States, it is that subprime mortgages began filtering their way through the real economy and across the breadth of financial institutions from August last year. Subprime mortgages, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be aware, represent some 15 per cent of mortgages in the United States mortgage market. Subprime mortgages represent something like one per cent of mortgages in the Australian market. There is, therefore, a clear distinction between our set of circumstances and those of the United States. And there is a further distinction, which I draw the honourable member's attention to as well: in the United States currently the arrears rate in terms of repayment on mortgages is something like six times that which currently exists within Australia. Again, our circumstances are significantly different. And I draw honourable members' attention to the remarks made by others last week which sought to cast doubt on the statements by the Governor of the Reserve Bank about the state of Australia's financial system relamatters, tive to that which pertains in the United States and elsewhere. Therefore, the point I would make to the honourable member putting her question is that this represents the distinction between our markets and those which exist in the United States. That is why the measures that we have adopted, we believe, are responsible: they follow complete and close collaboration with the advice provided to the government by the financial regulators over the course of this year-not just the injection of liquidity into the economy by the Reserve Bank but also actions in relation to other aspects of assistance to financial players within the Australian financial market. I would say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to the Leader of the Opposition on this most sensitive question: it far better to proceed cautiously, rationally and intelligently through this debate in Australia than it is to simply shoot from the lip with anything which happens to come to the mind of the Leader of the Opposition in a press interview. These are serious and substantial matters. The government have been acting in close and absolute concert with the advice provided by our financial regulators. For the alternative Prime Minister of the country, as he would describe himself, to stand up and say that the US$700 billion rescue package should be adopted here reflects, I think, an absence of understanding of what is occurring in the Australian financial market. I would say to him also that, in these difficult and volatile times, words amount to bullets. Therefore I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition-and to the Liberal Party-that, rather than engaging in loose debate on these most serious matters, he becomes a constructive participant in them. The most constructive thing the Leader of the Opposition can do at the moment, apart from minding what he says publicly on these is to head to the Senate and unblock the budget and deliver to the government an appropriate surplus for providing a buffer for the future-a buffer which Australia needs given the uncertainties we confront through global financial markets. Economy",49
22,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Treasurer. What moves have been taken by ASIC over the weekend to ban short selling, and why is this so important?",50
23,Mr SWAN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question. The government certainly welcomes the decision of the independent regulator, ASIC, to ban short selling, because, as the Prime Minister was saying before, we are in a time of great difficulty in global financial markets. We probably have is not seen a time of difficulty like this for a very long period of time. We certainly do welcome the announcements by the US government over the weekend and we certainly note the recovery in financial markets this morning. But nobody should imagine that we are out of the woods as yet. We will continue to see global financial market volatility over the period ahead. That is why this decision from ASIC is so important. It does remain the case that our banks are well capitalised and well regulated, and most certainly they do not face the same problems as the banks in the United States face, because they do not have the exposure to the subprime problem in this country that there is in the United States. So we are not complacent about our economic situation, and that is one of the reasons why the government has moved quickly to strengthen our financial system. We are implementing the Financial Stability Forum recommendations and encouraging their implementation internationally. Encouraging their implementation internationally is very important because what we need here is concerted global action that in the end can produce some surveillance of the international investment bankswhich do go to the core of this instability in the United States and around the globe. That is but one reason why engaging with international leadership, engaging with international policymakers, as the Prime Minister will do, is so important-because the world requires a global solution. No country is an island in these circumstances. That is why we are not immune from the fallout. What is required here is an international agreement, as well as strong domestic action-and the government has been taking strong domestic action by increasing bond issuance, such as that which was referred to before. But one thing this government will not do is take the advice of the Leader of the Opposition to invest in subprime debt. That is effectively the gaffe that the Leader of the Opposition made on Laurie Oakes's program yesterday; and he is very sensitive about it-very, very sensitive about it. It was a gaffe of epic portions. So we have been moving to strengthen the system, to introduce a financial claims scheme. We have also been very supportive of the decision taken by ASIC to put a ban on short selling. That is also very important to protect the integrity of our financial system. But we do need concerted international action. That is where the solution lies, globally and domestically. I just wish the opposition would put aside its petty politics and get behind constructive initiatives, globally and nationally, on this very important issue. Economy",50
24,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Treasurer. Why has the government had three different positions on short selling in the last three days?,51
25,Mr SWAN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I congratulate her on her appointment. I look forward to a constructive dialogue and debate about these matters which are so important to the economic health of the country. The parliament is the appropriate place for that. Let us just deal with short selling. Was there any legislation on short selling in 12 years from that side of the House? No. An opposition member-There was no need for it.,51
26,Mr SWAN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"There was no need for it? Okay. That is good. I will just take them through this issue. We did say earlier in the year that we would move to legislate for the disclosure of covered short selling. The government has prepared a bill in that area. But, as everybody in the world knows, financial markets melted down last week. In response to that, governments around the globe moved to change their position on short selling. They moved to change their position on short proselling because of the carnage that was going on in stock markets in an environment that was so destabilising it had lost touch with the economic fundamentals of many companies. So there was a very strong case at the end of last week for substantial action on short selling. ASIC, the independent regulator, determined late on Friday that they would take some further action. What happened after the market closed in Australia over the weekend was that further decisions were taken by other governments internationally. A further decision was taken in the United States by the SEC. A further decision was taken in Canada, and in at least three other countries decisions were taken. So over the weekend I conferred with all of our regulators. In fact, on Friday afternoon there was a meeting of the Council of Financial Regulators. On Friday afternoon and through the weekend I conferred with our regulators on this position and I conferred with people right across the financial services sector, because the ban on short selling in various forms by all of those other countries would have exposed our market first thing on Monday morning to a wall of funding that could have really had a detrimental impact on many, many reputable Australian companies. We on this side of the House make no apology for the decision of our independent regulator to ban short selling-a decision they announced late yesterday afternoon. It was a very important decision in the history of this country. There is a case for short selling, but there is not a case for short selling in the market environment in which we now find ourselves domestically and around the globe. We are a small market and it was simply not possible for us to remain open to short selling when every other market in the world had closed. What occurred was that the regulator met again and took an independent decision on Sunday afternoon, announced it and it has been applied from this morning. This is yet another example of our regulators being up to the mark and acting to protect our national interest. I would have thought those on that side of the House really would have understood how important this decision is and how it deserves bipartisan support. Budget Surplus",51
27,Mr RAGUSE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. Will the minister outline to the House the importance of maintaining a strong budget surplus and why this is critical to Australia's ability to withstand the global financial crisis? Are there any threats to the budget surplus?,52
28,Mr BOWEN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"As the Prime Minister and Treasurer have said, Australia is better placed than most countries to withstand the current financial turmoil. There are a number of reasons for this-our well-respected prudential regulation system and the growth in our terms of trade being important parts. It is also very important that we keep our strong budget surplus. Countries without a strong budget surplus are more limited in their response to the current turmoil. I am also asked about threats to the current budget surplus. The newly-minted Leader of the Opposition and the Liberals in the Senate remain the biggest threats to that surplus. The Leader of the Opposition, in his first breath in his new role, proved that he was just as economically irresponsible as his predecessor. He indicated that he will continue to block the government's budget measures in the Senate and therefore reduce the surplus that is so important to our economic stability. He does this even though he acknowledges that the figures involved are significant. Yesterday, talking to Laurie Oakes, the Leader of the Opposition said: … it's a huge amount of money … … … … $6 billion is a gigantic amount of money in anyone's terms … That is what the Leader of the Opposition said on Sunday. But on Friday he said, ‘It's a very small amount of money.' It was in the interview yesterday that he also said that his raid on the budget surplus was only a small amount because it was less than one per cent of the total budget. He was disagreeing with himself in the same interview. It is just like the old days, when the member for Bradfield occupied that chair. In the finest tradition of recent leaders of the opposition, he could not even agree with himself in the same interview. He threatens the budget surplus even though he recognised on Sunday that the amount of money involved is substantialbut on Friday it was small. Not only does the Leader of the Opposition continue to threaten our savings measures in the Senate; he also continues the policy of unfunded spending-billions of dollars of unfunded spending. We know that he believes a big chunk of that unfunded spending-the reduction in the petrol excise-is bad policy. We know that he thinks it is bad public policy and yet he continues it. He is hardly what you would call a conviction politician. We knew that he disagreed with the member for Bradfield; now we know he disagrees with himself. The Leader of the Opposition has thrown out all economic credibility. This is what he said to Laurie Oakes, trying to defend his policy: … whether the petrol excise is 38 cents or 33 cents or 28 cents, it's simply a question of uring up the budgetary consequences. You lower the excise, you just reduce government revenues. Wouldn't Goldman Sachs be proud of the member for Wentworth! He has worked out that if you cut tax you reduce government revenue. But what he did not say is that when you cut government revenue you either cut the budget surplus or cut services. Who would have thought Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal Party would make the Australian Greens look economically responsible!",52
29,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! The minister will refer to members by their titles.,53
30,Mr BOWEN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The Leader of the Opposition has made economic irresponsibility the hallmark of his first week as Leader of the Opposition. The new occupant of that office is ‘Brendan Nelson lite'. Mr Hockey- Mr SPEAKER ,53
31,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,I remind members that they should refer to members by their titles. Economy,53
32,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that the government has had three different positions on short selling in three days and that the Australian stock market had to close for one hour today to sort out the confusion created by his policy gyrations. Is the Prime Minister still sure that this is a great time to leave town?,53
33,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Last week the Leader of the Opposition was happy to have a flick at the Governor of the Reserve Bank; this week he is having a flick at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. At a time of global instability in financial markets, this is not a responsible course of action. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that a responsible course of action at a time like this is to back our institutions rather than to engage in the politically opportunistic course measof action of simply having a flick at them on the way through because there might be a cheap headline in it for him. The circumstances surrounding the response to short selling are as described in the Treasurer's answer to the parliament just before. That is why the government acted in the way it did. I noticed very carefully what the Leader of the Opposition had to say by way of intervention before when the Treasurer was referring to the need for legislation on short selling. interjection was there was no need for any legislation on short selling while they were in office.",53
34,Unknown,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Opposition members interjecting,54
35,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business and the Member for Sturt!,54
36,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I simply draw his attention to the fact that dealing responsibly with the problem of short selling, given the volatility of markets at present, is important. That is what the government has done through the long-term legislation it has already foreshadowed. That is why ASIC took the action it did over the course of Friday and the weekend. Had it not done so in the manner in which it did, it would have left Australian financial markets grossly exposed today. That would be irresponsible. The government was not prepared to countenance that. Infrastructure",54
37,Mr BUTLER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How will infrastructure investment help to sustain the Australian economy in the face of global economic uncertainty? What views have been expressed about the importance of Australia's engagement with key global economic leaders?",54
38,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question. Indeed, infrastructure investment is central to the government's economic priorities. That is why we put $41 billion from the surplus into long-term infrastructure investment funds. Infrastructure investment helps put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. It addresses capacity constraints and it lifts productivity. Recent global economic events are of concern, of course, to all Australians. It is important that we monitor the situation closely and do what we can to ensure that His Australia and our financial institutions are well placed to withstand global changes and global conditions. The Prime Minister's visit to the United States this week is part of this strategy. It is quite extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition has maintained his criticism of this visit. It shows just how opportunistic he really is. It is also a fact that the opposition leader is defined by his inconsistency. In April he thought it was important for him to visit the United States. He had this to say: The security, the mortgages, the homes, the jobs of Australians depend in large measure on the international developments coming out of the United States of this credit crisis, so it was important for me as Shadow Treasurer to come here … So, according to the opposition leader, it is important for him to visit and to have consultations with global economic institutions while he is shadow Treasurer, but the Prime Minister, who has got his hands on the levers of the Australian economy, is subject to criticism for having these very discussions. That opportunism is characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition. That is why, on the $6 billion black hole, it is either a big amount or a small amount. He is not sure about that, but he is sure it is a good amount for them to blow a hole through the budget. That is why he described the $41 billion infrastructure investment funds in his budget reply speech as ‘the greatest con of all'. ",54
39,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"That was the opposition leader's statement. Today, as one of his expanded",54
40,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! The minister will resume his seat. There have been eight questions and eight responses. The member for Sturt has interjected through the eight responses. He is warned. I appreciate he might be excited but he will contain his excitement.,54
41,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The member for Sturt is one of the opposition leader's 32 members on the shadow ministry. They have 32 shadow ministers shadowing 30 ministers; two of them are shadowing each other-that is the only way that you can come up with that conclusion, but then again a few promises had to be made. I am asked about the attitude towards international consultations. The opposition leader certainly has not always been opposed to international travel. Just 10 days ago he was overseas, not meeting with global economic leaders but sitting in St Mark's Square in VeniceMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Unless the water has gone to the head of the leader of government business, I would ask you to bring him back to infrastructure. This is totally irrelevant.",55
42,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Before ruling on the point of order, the Manager of Opposition Business, when he comes to the dispatch box and gets the call, should go straight to his point of order. I will listen closely to the minister. The minister will continue his response.",55
43,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Far be it for an Albanese to criticise someone going to Italy. But then, do not be such a hypocrite that you come in here and criticise the Prime Minister for going to the United States to have discussions about global economic conditions. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: how could this be relevant to the question that was asked about infrastructure?",55
44,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The question went to comments about views of the importance of infrastructure investment. The minister will return to the question.,55
45,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I was addressing the part of the question that went to international economic consultations and I was talking about that. But, of course, they are very sensitive over there. We know that, when it comes to consistency, the Leader of the Opposition just has not got it. What the merchant of Venice has got to understand is that, when your client is the Australian people, there is no substitute for substance. From merchant banker to merchant of Venicethat is what we have sitting in the opposition leader's chair. Economy",55
46,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports that the Prime Minister will take proposals for solving the global economic crisis with him to New York. Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that the credibility of his proposals will be diminished by the confusion and delay on the Australian stock market today caused by his government's incompetent handling of the limitations on short selling?,55
47,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"On the question of short selling, contrary to the dismissiveness of those opposite who do not seem to regard legislation as all that important, let alone other forms of immediate action, the circumstances are as the Treasurer outlined before. Firstly, actions were undertaken by the United States and UK regulatory authorities on short selling last week. Secondly, they were expanded in their scope at the very end of last week, requiring, therefore, further action on behalf of the Australian regulators. Failure to act on this, and failure to act on it responsibly, would have exposed Australian financial stocks and stocks in general to massive manipulation on the part of international speculative investors. We in the government were not prepared to countenance that course of action. I am surprised that those opposite seem to be so prepared. Workplace Relations Mrs D'ATH (2.41 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and the Minister for Social Inclusion. How will the Australian government's National Employment Standards and new workplace relations system benefit working women, and what obstacles are there to implementing these new standards and policies?",55
48,Ms GILLARD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for her question. I know that she has been deeply concerned about fairness and balance in Australian workplaces, particularly the circumstances of working Australian women. As these statistics show, Work Choices has been a disaster for working women. It is beyond doubt-from information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics-that under Work Choices women did worse. The ABS data shows very clearly in its wages and earnings data series that women working full time on Australian workplace agreements took home on average $84 a week less than women working on collective agreements. And the data for women working part time and casually was even worse; the rip-offs per hour women working casually-and many working women do because they want to combine work and family life-was even worse. A woman who was on an AWA who was working as a casual for an average amount of time could expect to earn $94 per week less than her counterpart who was on a collective agreement. The Rudd Labor government has already ended these rip-offs by ending the making of Australian workplace agreements and ensuring that all working women and working men have the benefit of a fair safety net. Last week I announced further details of the government's Forward with Fairness changes, and they include a set of additional protections for working women. Of course, the foundation stone of Labor's fair and balanced industrial relations system is a safety net that cannot be stripped away. As well as the dollar rip-offs that working women faced, even after the last government's so called fairness test, a working woman could have stripped away from her the protections on changes of shift and changes of roster inherent in her industrial award. For example, instead of being given a few days notice that she was going to be moved to night shift-notice so that she could make new arrangements for the care of her children-a woman could have that protection stripped away and be given half an hour or an hour's notice of a change of shift, which could have left her children without care. The government, in making sure that the safety net is there for everyone and that it cannot be stripped away, has fixed that and will make sure working women do not have that fear for the future. The government's National Employment Standards also include a new era of flexibility for working women-making sure that women can sequence unpaid maternity leave with the unpaid paternity leave of their partfor ner, giving working families the option, if they choose, to have a parent at home for the first 12 months of a child's life. Our National Employment Standards include a new era of flexibility, enabling working women to have the right to request an extended period of unpaid maternity leave and a right to request a return to work on a part-time or flexible basis if that would enable them to put together work and family life in a more cooperative way. I am asked about obstacles to the implementation of the government's plan. Of course, shadow ministers in this place seem to come and they seem to go, but the more things changeMr Albanese-Some just go! Mr Tuckey interjecting",56
49,Ms GILLARD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Some actually just go, it is true. And very curiously some backbenchers seem to move across further and further out of sight.",56
50,Mr TUCKEY,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,So that I can see you better!,57
51,Ms GILLARD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"In all the coming and going and moving back and forth-and the member for O'Connor moving curiously along-what we know is that the more things change, the more things stay the same.  of order. One wonders how any of this has any relevance to the question that the member was asked. I would ask you to bring her back to the question that she was asked.",57
52,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I am sure that the Deputy Prime Minister understands that she has to return to the question, which did include obstacles to the legislation. Mr Tuckey interjecting",57
53,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I can inform the member for O'Connor that, whilst I almost need over-the-horizon radar to pick him up, I can still hear him-and he will sit there quietly. The Deputy Prime Minister.",57
54,Unknown,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Honourable members interjecting,57
55,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,I am not commenting on the present arrangement.,57
56,Ms GILLARD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I am commenting on an obstacle to the implementation of the government's plan. I understand that the member for Sturt may consider this obstacle to be irrelevant, but the name of this obstacle is Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is standing in the way of the government's plans because the announced position of the Liberal Party at the moment is that unless we bring back the Australian workplace agreements that ripped off working Australians, including working women, then the Liberal Party will not pass the government's bills. It will prevent the government delivering Forward with Fairness. As the chairs are reshuffled over there, and we get a new spokesperson on workplace relations, the signs are not good, because in October 2006 the new shadow spokesperson on workplace relations said this: Work Choices is a continuation of the Howard government's proud record on women and work. Could anybody be more out of touch? Could anybody be more delusional about what Work Choices meant for working women? This is the attitude of the Liberal Party. Shadow ministers may come or go, but the one thing that the Liberal Party stands for, will always stand for and clearly stands for under the new shadow minister is Work Choices pure and simple-with all of its ripoffs. Economy  to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, given that six major global financial institutions have collapsed, merged or been nationalised in the last six weeks alone, what contingency plans has the government put in place to ensure all markets in Australia remain liquid?",57
57,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The Australian Council of Financial Regulators, which met with the Treasurer last Friday, continues to monitor on a regular basis the liquidity requirements and the credit requirements of the Australian economy. If the honourable member had listened to the answer I gave at the beginning the of question time, he would know that I went through the various interventions undertaken by the Reserve Bank in injecting liquidity into the economy, most particularly into the overnight money markets over the course of March, June and, most recently, September. This is part of the normal operations of the financial regulators. Furthermore, when it comes to all future contingency arrangements, the regulators continue to examine all that may be necessary into the future. I would suggest that a responsible course of action on the part of those opposite would be to underpin the confidence of this House in the regulators, rather than, drip-by-drip, to seek to undermine public confidence in those regulators. Climate Change",57
58,Mr TREVOR,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to be Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the importance of the government's global carbon capture and storage initiative to the international fight against climate change?,58
59,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the honourable member for Flynn for his question. His electorate and the electorates of many around this House are acutely conscious of the importance of coal-fired power generation now and into the future as well as the importance of coal exports into the future. If we look at the statistics, that concern is registered loud and clear. Eighty per cent of Australia's electricity comes from coal-fired power stations. Coal is the backbone of regional Australia in many regions-from Mackay to Muswellbrook to Moe. Coal also fires 40 per cent of the world's power generation and will continue to do so for a long time to come. It is also Australia's biggest export. The practical challenge we face is how we deal with those economic realities on the one hand and the fact that 40 per cent of energy related CO2 emissions in 2005 came from coal-fired electricity generation. This brings us to carbon capture and storage. Carbon capture and storage is an important technology option for the future. It is an important practical option for the future. It is important in the overall response to climate change within Australia and internationally. Mr Hunt interjecting",58
60,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,I warn the member for Flinders!,58
61,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The International Energy Agency says that improved energy efficiency and CCS-carbon capture and storagerepresent the two most viable options currently available to bring down greenhouse gas emissions into the medium term. That is why the government embraces both of those courses of action. You can see the beginnings of demonstration projects in the Otway Basin in Victoria. You can also see it at the Callide A power station in Queensland and the oxy-fuel combustion technology which is proposed to be trialled there by way of retrofitting, and you can also see post-combustion capture technology in two other power stations in Australia-one in black coal in New South Wales and the other to be based in brown coal in Victoria. On Saturday I took the opportunity to visit Santos's operations in Moomba and for them to brief me on their proposals for a three-stage carbon capture facility-the Moomba carbon storage project. This is an exciting project. I commend the company for their active support for CCS technologies. Together with those other project possibilities around the country, we begin to see the emergence of a way forward in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions from coalfired power stations and, more generally, from carbon based fuels in Australia. On Friday, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, and I launched a global carbon capture and storage institute, which Australia will support. What is the proposal? It goes into two parts. Right around the world at present you see a whole range of research going on but ineffective coordination of that research and, with the four principal technologies alive with carbon capture and storage, you see very thin atscale industrial application of these technologies. The problem we face is that time is running out. We need to make sure that these industrial scale projects get going. The best definition of an industrial style project is something 250 megawatts or more. So many of the projects which are currently underway around the world which go by the rubric of demonstration projects are very small indeed. We need to have them at scale not only so we can demonstrate that the technology works at scale but also so we can calculate the cost differential between a 250megawatt station without CCS technology applied as opposed to one with CCS technology applied and then work out where that difference is to be met in the future by way of investment activity by government, corporates and others. This of course is directly relevant to the future architecture of the bon Pollution Reduction Scheme as well. Why we have put forward this global carbon capture and storage institute is to assist in bringing together all this research and technology investigatory activity around the world into a single entity to the best extent possible. This is a global public good and the world needs to have a go-to place to access that technology for at-scale projects. But there is one further reason, and this is also the big gap at the moment.",58
62,Unknown,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Opposition members interjecting,59
63,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Those opposite find this enormously amusing. I do not find climate change at all amusing. I find it a real challenge for the future, and finding practical ways of responding to climate change is the way ahead. The second reason for a global carbon capture and storage institute is that, when it comes to identifying projects at scale, you need a clearing house around the world to point would be investors in the direction of those projects that are most ready to go. At present that is simply not happening. We have put together this initiative in close consultation not only with the Australian coal and resource industry but also with various governments around the world, and there has been an initial expression of support from not just the British government but also other governments. I say to those who simply catcall from opposite and say that there are problems with this: for 12 years there was a lot of time to act on this, and I have to say that across the country and across the world I do not see a whole lot of action resulting from the various speeches made by others when they occupied the treasury benches and had an opportunity to act. Here is the challenge: the G8 meeting in Hokkaido said that by 2020 we have to have 20 at-scale CCS electricity projects around Carthe world in order to demonstrate to the world that this technology works and at what price it will work. That is the challenge that has been established. The problem is worldwide that there is no capacity that exists at either the technology level or at the financial clearing house level to bring any such projects to fruition. That is why we have decided to provide leadership. That is why when I am in New York I will be canvassing this extensively with world leaders. That is why it will form a large part of the presentation that we make to global governments: because, for this to work, it is not just that it is an Australian initiative that counts; we need global buy-in. For this to work, we need those 20 projects not just to be designed, not just to be talked about, not just to be floated, but also to be delivered in concrete reality on the ground. That is what this institute is about. I would suggest to the sceptics opposite: get behind it and be bipartisan instead of than just talking about bipartisanship as some cute, political ploy. Economy",59
64,Mr HOCKEY,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his commentary that there will be ‘an impact on government revenues as a result of the global financial crisis'. Is the Prime Minister's assessment based on lower economic growth or fewer jobs?,59
65,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"If the honourable member were to look at the government's budget forecasts he would see that, in terms of the rate of economic growth for the period ahead, we have obviously projected a softening of growth consistent with the softening of growth across the global economy. Secondly, what follows from that is that public revenue also softens. One follows from the other. I would have thought that the honourable member would understand that. Climate Change",60
66,Ms LIVERMORE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Minister, why is carbon capture and storage vital to Australia's clean energy future?",60
67,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Capricornia for this question. As a representative of a key regional seat with a significant number of people employed in the coal industry, she-unlike many on the other side-understands the importance of the Prime Minister's announcement of last Friday. The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Initiative correctly gives us an opportunity internationally to cooperate with the business community and also like-minded countries to finally make significant progress on something of fundamental importance not only to Australia's economic and environmental future but also to the global community. Australia is an energy superpower. It is therefore our responsibility to show leadership in trying to put together something about abatement while also securing our economic future. I understand on the other side of the House there are some people who doubt the importance of this technology. I want to remind the House that 80 per cent of Australia's electricity comes from coal fired power stations. I want to also remind the House, in terms of our economic prosperity, that it is estimated that coal exports from Australia in this financial year will earn us as a nation $43 billion. For Australia, in terms of security of energy, reducing carbon emissions is therefore exceptionally important, not only from the point of view of the coal industry-I remind the House that the export of LNG is also exceptionally important, and getting storage correct is of fundamental importance, for such key projects as Gorgon. This presents Australia with an opportunity to secure our own economic future and also an obligation for Australia to exercise leadership on this front, because we are at the forefront. We have not only a requirement to solve our own environmental problems but also an opportunity to potentially engage in technological solutions of importance to the whole global community. I am pleased to say that at last Friday's discussions there was key support not only from business, representatives of state and territory governments, and the generators but also from key sectors of the environmental movement and the labour movement, represented by the CFMEU and the AWU. Mr Hunt interjecting",60
68,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! I will remind the member for Flinders of his status only once.,60
69,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"They understand the importance of Australia making progress, of doing something about guaranteeing that our National Low Emissions Coal Council is able to accelerate the demonstration and deployment of these technological activities and of having in place a carbon storage task force which enables the development of storage, mapping and infrastructure plans in the immediate future. They also welcome the government's achievement in the House of Representatives last week of potentially world-first legislation covering carbon dioxide storage in Australia's offshore areas. I simply say in conclusion that Australia and the broader community understand the challenges that confront us in the demand to reduce carbon emissions in the global community. I look forward to working with my state and territory counterparts, representatives of business, NGOs who are prepared to front up to hard decisions and the labour movement to make this a reality. This is about investing in our future and our economic prosperity while also assisting the world in guaranteeing high levels of economic growth while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Age Pension",60
70,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Why is the government spending $40 million to win a temporary seat on the UN Security Council yet rejecting the much-needed $30 a week increase in the single age pension?,61
71,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"As of three months ago, the Leader of the Opposition said he had no policy to increase the pension at all. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that consistency is a good thing in politics; I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, in the 12 years they had in office act on the age pension in any fundamental way, they failed to do so. Secondly, in the course of the last budget we virtually doubled the additional increase to pensioners as a consequence of our increase to the utilities allowance, and we have of course in process the review, which those opposite supported, coming out of the Senate inquiry. I would suggest that, when he sat in the cabinet together with many of those on the current front bench-and perhaps those currently on the back bench as well, including the member for Higgins-if their passion had been so deep to act on the age pension 12 months ago, they could have done so. They failed to do so, and the opportunism in their current politics on this is there, clear-cut, for all to see. Aged Care: Indigenous Australians",61
72,Ms JACKSON,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Minister for Ageing. What is the government response to community concerns about the quality of aged care for Indigenous communities?,61
73,Mrs ELLIOT,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Earlier today the Australian government detailed a plan to improve aged care for remote Indigenous communities. It includes, for the first time, a set of standards applied to these unique agedcare services in remote communities. In addition, we are providing a $46.2 million program for staff, locum relief and emergency capital works on facilities. Nationally, there are 30 Indigenous specialist aged care services providing about 700 places. It is time that the Australian government started to improve the care for frail and aged Indigenous Australians. When it comes to life expectancy, there is a 17-year gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, and the Rudd government is committed to closing the gap within a generation by taking practito cal steps to improve the health status and social and economic well-being of Indigenous Australians. This plan is about providing proper care for older Indigenous people while still being respectful to their cultural needs. We will consult with and take the advice of Indigenous communities and the Indigenous aged care sector. I would also like to make a few comments about the tragic death of Dulcie Brumby, which occurred on 14 June 2007 at Docker River, which is 670 kilometres by road south-west of Alice Springs. This was an appalling tragedy. Dulcie Brumby was 70 years old and in an Indigenous aged care service. That night she was unsupervised and fell into an open pit fire. She subsequently died at Alice Springs Hospital. Her death has been the subject of a report by Northern Territory Deputy Coroner Dr Celia Kemp. On behalf of the Australian government, I extend our condolences to the family of Dulcie Brumby. This afternoon, I asked the independent Aged Care Commissioner, Ms Rhonda Parker, to personally conduct an assessment of the Department of Health and Ageing's handling of the Docker River agedcare death. It is imperative that we act prove aged-care services for older Indigenous Australians, and that is what the government has outlined today. Veterans",61
74,Mrs MARKUS,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Why won't the minister support the coalition's proposal to increase the single war veterans' entitlements by $30 a week?,62
75,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for her question. This is the most recent policy, take it? This is today's policy; it is not last week's policy? I note the previous opposition leader is not in the chamber, but he was quite clearly on the record",62
76,Unknown,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Opposition members interjecting,62
77,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,I apologise. He is moving around. Maybe it is a comeback. The Leader of the Opposition at the time the original stunt was announced made it clear that veterans were not included. Mr Baldwin interjecting,62
78,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! The member for Paterson.,62
79,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"It was because this side of the House raised the issue that they had excluded thousands and thousands of veterans, amongst a whole range of other people. That is why there has been some change. But when was the change? Mr Baldwin interjecting",62
80,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The member for Paterson is warned!,62
81,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"It was snuck into the Senate as a late change-an amendment to a notice of motion. Even then, when you go to the question of what was included in the wording, there is an argument that some veterans have been excluded.",62

83,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Have a look at the partto imner service pension. Have a look at your wording there. You have missed out a few there as well, not to mention veterans with disabilities in some cases. Mrs Markus- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Will you or won't you agree to the $30 rise?",62
84,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! The member for Greenway will resume her seat.,62
85,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Let us not forget that, once again, after a decade of inaction, they I have finally discovered some policy. Mr Baldwin interjecting",62
86,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The member for Paterson will leave the chamber for one hour. The member for Paterson then left the chamber.,62
87,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Finally, after a decade, we find that they have some policy. We all know that the opposition only discovered veterans affairs in the last year before the election. Let us have a look at what has occurred since the election. Here are just a few examples. This government, when in opposition, committed to an inquiry into the desealreseal issue.",62
88,Unknown,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Opposition members interjecting,62
89,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Your government refused to back it until you became the opposition, and then the shadow minister endorsed it. She said, ‘We support this inquiry.' Of course, when you were in government it was ‘no'. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is a really simple question about why the minister will not support the coalition's proposal to increase the single war veterans' entitlements by $30 a week.",62
90,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The minister is responding to the question. He will bring his question to a conclusion.,63
91,Mr GRIFFIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I will bring my answer to a conclusion, Mr Speaker. The point with respect to this is that, once again, it is a simple question. But the real answer is what you did not do. The fact is that you never took action when you could have and you have now ended up in a situation of trying to reduce the concerns of pensioners in this society to a stunt.",63
92,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,I remind the minister to address his remarks through the chair. Age Pension,63
93,Mr MELHAM,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the government's commitment to fixing the pension system for the long term, including for carers and people with a disability? What are the consequences of any proposed alternatives?",63
94,Ms MACKLIN,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the member for Banks for his question and for his real concern for Australia's pensioners, unlike the politics that we are seeing from those opposite. When those opposite actually had the power to do something about pensions, what did this Leader of the Opposition do in cabinet? He voted no. What did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do when she was in cabinet? She voted no. That is what they did when they were in government. What this government is doing is actually delivering to pensioners. Let me inform the House that this fortnight pensioners are going to receive $128the third quarterly instalment of the increased utilities allowance. This fortnight, age pensioners, widow pensioners, carers and disability support pensioners will all receive $128. It was the decision of this government to increase the utilities allowance. Under the previous government, the utilities allowance was only $107. Under this government, the utilities allowance is $500. This fortnight, the government is delivering $128-the next quarterly instalment of this very important utilities allowance. This, of course, enables pensioners to pay the bills that are always increasing. It was up to this government to extend the utilities allowance to those on the carer payment and the disability support pension. In their last year in government, those opposite refused to give an increase in the pension to anybody and also refused to extend the utilities allowance to people on carer payment and the disability support pension. This government has delivered to those people. We know that this is becoming a bit of a pattern with those opposite, playing politics as they are over in the Senate right now. They have also decided to exclude carers and those on the disability support pension in this latest political game that they are playing in the Senate, even though it is the case that single age pensioners, people who are single and dependent on the carer payment and people who are single and dependent on the disability support pension-and I am glad the Leader of the Opposition is listeningare all being paid exactly the same pension rate. They are all dependent on the same pension rate. But of course, in the effort to play politics by those opposite, they have completely ignored those carers who are doing it tough and those people on the disability support pension who are doing it tough. Each and every one of them is living on $281 a week. I just want to make sure that the Leader of the Opposition understands this by reading from a letter that a woman from Gippsland, Jean Tops, has written to all senators. She says: ‘We are alarmed at the suggestions being made by the Liberal Party that only single age pensioners should be thrown a lifeline of $30 a week. We are alarmed,' she says, ‘that they are considering putting this proposal to the Senate for approval next week when there are millions of single pension persons who will miss out if such a proposal were to be adopted.' She goes on to say: ‘Is it so difficult to understand that gle primary carers on pension payments are in the same boat as single age pensioners? Is it so difficult to understand that single disability support pensioners are in the same boat as single age pensioners?' All of these people are being completely ignored by those opposite. Of course, those opposite do not understand this. It was just a quick political fix, a bit of a game that they tried to play in the Senate, a game on the part of the Liberal and National parties. Because they have tried to do this so quickly, rushing it into the Senate to try and save the skin of the previous Leader of the Opposition-well, that didn't work-in yet another complication, they forgot to index this little measure that they have put into the Senate today. In their rush to score political points, there was no indexation for this measure. There is another complication-which of course they are not the faintest bit concerned about-that many people who have written to our pension inquiry are certainly concerned about. Many of them are pleading with us to not just increase the base rate of the pension, because if that happens they will see a lot of the increase in the pension go in increased rents. One of the submissions has actually come from the member for Flinders. He has passed on a submission from one of his constituents, who says, ‘If the pension alone is increased to cover all the cost-ofliving expenses, landlords will be able to raise rents accordingly.' Many, many people who are in the public housing system know exactly that. They know that-as does the member for Warringah, of course. Where is the member for Warringah? He seems to have disappeared. We knew he was bored with his job, but we did not know he was so bored as to not turn up today. Reforming the pension system is a very sincomplicated task. It is not something that should just be handled as some sort of political plaything by one opposition leader after another. This government intends to get this right. In the meantime, this fortnight, we are delivering an increase of $128 in the utilities allowance to make sure that pensioners have got increased money in their pockets to help pay their bills. Mr Haase- Mr Speaker, would you ask the minister to table the piece of correspondence that she was extensively quoting from that asserted some criticism in relation to the proposition of the Liberal Party to increase the pension but said nothing about",63
95,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Order! The member will resume his seat. Was the minister quoting from a document? Was the document confidential? Ms Macklin interjecting,64

101,Mrs MAY,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister requested or received advice on how many Australians have delayed or will delay their retirement as a result of the fall in superannuation and investment value resulting from the global financial crisis?,65
102,Mr RUDD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"It follows from the global financial crisis that stock markets around world have gone down. If you look at what has happened on the US stock exchange, the S&P, over the last 12 months, there has been virtually a 20 per cent reduction that has been reflected in various stock markets around the world. Obviously the impact of that flows through to those whose superannuation investments are in equities markets. That is one of the reasons why the government are determined, firstly, to prosecute a policy of responsible economic management and, secondly, to ensure that we, through our coordinated action with the Australian financial regulators-APRA, the Reserve Bank and ASIC-are responding appropriately to the financial crisis. Thirdly, we are doing in concert with the international regulators. That is the best way-the best way by farthat we can look to the return of stability global financial markets. On the question of the advices to which the honourable member refers, I am unaware of any such advice being requested. What is occurring on this matter in terms of other ministers and across bureaucracy is of course a matter for them. Climate Change",65
103,Mr MARLES,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"My question is for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister please update the House on the attitudes of primary producers in adapting to climate change? Mr Dutton-He doesn't read his correspondence-how would he know?",65
104,Mr BURKE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Given that 13 of those letters arrived on the day the question was asked, you probably should interject with something different next time.",65
105,Unknown,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,Honourable members interjecting,65
106,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Order! The minister will ignore the interjections, and the interjections will cease.",65
107,Mr BURKE,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"The National Farmers the Federation have described climate change as possibly the biggest risk facing Australian farmers in the coming century. I would like to report to the House on some ABS figures which have been released recently, which show that about half of Australia's agricultural businesses have changed their management practices in response to climate change. These figures do vary across the country and across agricultural industries, with stronger results in the south of the country, obviously, than in the north. In the Goulburn-Broken Natural Resource Management region in Victoria, 78 per cent of agricultural businesses have changed their farming practices to deal with climate change. In the so north Tasmania NRM region, the figure is 80 per cent. In the Northern Agricultural Region in Western Australia, the result is quite high, to at 83 per cent. The Rudd government has also tripled the Climate Change Research Program from $15 million to $46.2 million. Those expressions of interest closed a couple of weeks ago and I am pleased to report to the the House that we have received more than 200 expressions of interest from Australia's leading bodies doing research into carbon pollution, better soil management and adaptation to a changing climate. Farmers have been recognising the need to adapt their practices to deal with climate change and have been aware of the connection between emissions, human behaviour and climate change itself. In fact, this is the very dispatch box where the then Prime Minister, 18 months ago, said: … I do believe there is a connection between climate change and emissions. I do not really think the jury is out on that. That is why I was surprised to read a comment from a primary producer-or a former primary producer-that was published in the Canowindra News, where the article begins: Member for Calare, John Cobb, says he is presay pared to out himself as a climate change sceptic to bring a “voice of reason” to the debate about Australia's response to global warming. Mr Cobb, who has previously served as the tion's assistant environment minister, yesterday questioned the impact human activity has had on rising temperatures, sea levels and the ongoing drought. While Australia's farmers and primary producers have been moving in one direction, in the last couple of days the opposition has decided to move in the opposite direction, by taking a climate change sceptic and saying, ‘Yes-that is the person who ought to be in charge of the agriculture portfolio for the opposition.' The Leader of the Opposition has chosen to drag the climate change debate backward from where Mr Howard left it. In government, we know, the Leader of the Opposition was frustrated at the handling of the climate change debate. If you look at today's announcement, you discover that the reason he was frustrated was that the previous Prime Minister was taking climate change too seriously for his liking. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",65

109,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-As honourable members know, the last two weeks have been a turbulent period on global financial markets, to the very least. There is no question this is a difficult time for the world economy. And it would be wrong of us, as a nation, to pretend we are completely immune. It is true nathat there is much here that is beyond the control of the Australian government. This is something we have been upfront about, throughout this global economic turbulence. But despite all the substantial difficulties in the US and elsewhere, we do have cause for confidence, and there are things which we can do. We are acting decisively in those areas where our actions can really count. I remind the House that if you had to pick a country that you would live in, in these uncertain times, you would choose Australia. That is an important piece of perspective that we should never lose sight of. In response to the international developments of recent weeks and months, there has been decisive and significant policy action taken, here and abroad. So it is appropriate that I again outline to the House and to the people of Australia the nature of the decisions, the environment in which they have been made, and the reasons behind them. Recent global developments A little over a year ago, global financial markets began a fundamental repricing of risk. Few commentators or market actors foresaw the turmoil this would inflict on global financial markets in the period since then. Developments have been dramatic: we have seen three of the top five US investment banks cease to exist as stand-alone entities. Global stock markets have wiped off more than 25 per cent of their value. And some markets that had become the mainstay of the financial system have simply ceased to operate. Rather than see a steady recovery in global markets, this last week has been the most turbulent in almost anyone's living memory. Turmoil in financial markets intensified with disruptions in the US financial system reverberating in markets around the world. In the last week alone, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Bank of America agreed to take over Merrill Lynch. The US government bailed out the insurer AIG with an $US85 billion loan in return for an almost 80 per cent equity interest in that company. And in the UK, Lloyds TSB agreed to the merger with HBOS. Towards the end of last week we did see a recovery in global markets-that is true. This came as a result of news that the US government is developing a comprehensive package to buy up bad debt from financial institutions, to unfreeze credit markets that have ceased to function because financial institutions no longer trust each other to pay back loans. I am pleased to inform the House that this recovery has continued in the Australian market this morning, reflecting positive international developments and moves to restrict short selling in the Australian market. US government response Moves taken by US officials over the weekend were just some of the dramatic but welcome policy interventions that have been enacted. To date, the US government has taken a number of very difficult decisions to restore confidence in US financial markets and limit the impacts that are flowing through to the rest of the world. For example, the US authorities have taken steps to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They provided a line of credit to AIG-the world's largest insurer. And on Friday they announced the establishment of a temporary guarantee program for the US money market mutual fund industry. These have all been welcome steps. But, as the US Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, has said, a more fundamental and comprehensive approach is needed to address the root causes of the problems facing the US financial system. The US government's announcementthat it is developing a comprehensive package to address the underlying problems in the US financial system-is one that the Rudd government strongly welcomes. The tarnished assets in the US financial system continue to inhibit a recovery in both US financial markets and around the world. And until they are fully disclosed and dealt with they will continue to contribute to volatility in global financial markets. The US government's proposed comprehensive package envisages the US Treasury buying up to US$700 billion in infected mortgage-related assets from US financial institutions. This is an enormous package. Consider this: it amounts to over US$2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States-a very substantial package. And the size of the proposed package brings into sharp focus the size of the problems facing the financial system in the United States. However, while we welcome the US intervention, it is very important to draw a clear distinction between the US banking system and the Australian banking system, which is not infected with this type of bad debt that has necessitated the US bailout. Economic impact While the US government's announcement is welcome, as is the rebound in global markets towards the end of last week, we should not imagine that all will now be calm in the international financial system. cial crises are unpredictable, and there will undoubtedly be further unpleasant surprises and further volatility over the period ahead as the remaining losses are worked through the system. We will also continue to see the fallout of these developments on confidence and economic growth right around the world. Consumer confidence across the OECD economies is around its lowest level in almost 30 years. The world's major developed economies are struggling to grow-five of the world's seven largest developed economies recorded zero or negative growth in the three months to June this year. Growth is also slowing in Australia-not surprising, with global financial turbulence, together with 10 consecutive rate rises under our predecessors. That is hitting our economy. Inevitably, also, these global developments have hit the investments and superannuation savings of many Australians. We understand that this is creating considerable anxiety in our community, particularly for retirees reliant on super as their primary source of income. But it is important again that we counterbalance these difficulties against what remains a good economic performance by Australia. The June quarter national accounts show our economy still recording solid growth. Our superannuation system is strong and its investments well diversified. And our banks are well capitalised and well regulated and do not face the myriad of problems being faced in the USa point I will return to later on. Meeting global challenges We have always been upfront about the global challenges we face and their impacts here in Australia. Because so many of these global difficulties are beyond Australia's control, we have consistently focused on those things we can actually influence. We are acting decisively in those areas where our Finanactions can really count. In the lead-up to the budget both the Prime Minister and I had been taking careful soundings on the international economic climate. We were acutely aware of the difficult global environment we faced, and the importance of getting the balance right in the budget: - The importance of delivering a strong surplus to help fight inflation and buffer us against these global factors outside of our control. - The importance of laying the foundation for a new era of investment in Australia's critical infrastructure needs for the future. - And the importance of delivering tax cuts to working families who are being hit by higher interest rates and higher global oil and food prices. Many people told us not to deliver those tax cuts in the budget, but there are not too many people saying that today. It shows our budget settings were well judged in the light of unfolding global and domestic circumstances. Our understanding of these challenges from day one is also why the Prime Minister and I continued to be in close and constant contact with our regulators. Those regulators are closely monitoring events in the United States and elsewhere and remain in close contact with their international counterparts. The Prime Minister and I have also kept in regular contact with our counterparts around the world, including, and most particularly, those in the United States. This has been critical in understanding these global developments and preparing for their impacts here. It has also been critical to our playing our part in the global solution to this crisis, as policy makers agree to the most appropriate response around the globe. We will continue to work with our international counterparts bilaterally and through institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum. This is also why it is so important that the Prime Minister meets with other world leaders and the US government. Over 100 world leaders will be at the United Nations this week and the global economic crisis will be foremost on their minds. At this time of global economic uncertainty, Australia's Prime Minister must be there as well. To be absent at such a time would be leaving Australia out in the cold, while other world leaders are working their way through this turmoil. It is also important that we engage with the international financial community to reinforce the strength of the Australian economy and the strength of our financial system. That is why the Prime Minister will be meeting with global financial market representatives and US policy makers in New York. It is also why I will be attending the IMF annual meetings in a little over two weeks-to work with my international counterparts on solutions to the underlying causes and to highlight the significant strengths of the Australian economy and financial system. Why Australia is Different It is worth taking some time to understand the roots of the current subprime crisis. now clear that, for most of this decade, the US has experienced a toxic cocktail of seriously eroded lending standards in their financial institutions and an extended period of ultralow interest rates. This serious erosion of lending standards meant that loans were extended to many subprime borrowers who unfortunately had little realistic chance of repaying them. This, in combination with ultralow interest rates, led to serious overinbuffer vestment in the US housing market, as many people borrowed at the prevailing ultralow interest rates to build houses. It is this overinvestment, along with the default of many subprime mortgages, that is driving the current downturn in the US housing market, contributing to falling US house prices and contributing also to the credit crisis that has its epicentre in the US financial system. At the core of this problem, as US Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, has said, has been irresponsible lending and irresponsible borrowing. Many executives in financial institutions have made a lot of money out of all these activities and have walked away with big packages, while the taxpayer has been left to foot the bill. It is important to describe the situation in the US, because it brings into sharp focus just how different the situation is facing Australia. As I said earlier, our banks are well capitalised and well regulated and they do not face the nature and depth of the problems of their US counterparts. Australia's four largest banks are among only 12 of the world's top 100 banks with a credit rating of AA or above. In Australia, subprime mortgages account for only one per cent of the mortgage market compared with around 15 per cent in the United States. Our default rates are nowhere near those being experienced in the United States. Australia did not have a dotcom stock It is market bust in 2000, we did not have ultralow interest rates earlier this decade, and we did not have a serious erosion of lending standards in our financial institutions. Whilst we are not immune from the current global difficulties, as I have said many times before, we are better placed than most countries to weather the storm. We find ourselves in a very good position. The government has built a strong surplus to against global turmoil and provide a foundation for responsible investment in the future. Prices of our key commodity exports remain around generational highs, and businesses are investing in the future with confidence, with over $100 billion of planned investment in 2008-09. Government response These are all reasons for optimism, but we are not overconfident and we are certainly not complacent. The Prime Minister and I have engaged all year in a series of moves to bolster our defences-already strong-in the face of international turbulence: - We are implementing the Financial Stability Forum recommendations in full and encouraging their implementation internationally. - We have taken steps to support liquidity in the government bond market to ensure our broader financial markets operate more effectively. - We are strengthening protections for deposit holders through the introduction of the Financial Claims Scheme. - We are creating a single national regulation of consumer credit, including mortgages, to ensure that the kind of problems being faced in US with poor lending practices do not occur here. - The government also announced in March that it would be legislating to prove disclosure of covered short selling. Short Selling Let me now outline the further developments on short selling on Friday and over the weekend to further protect Australia from international turbulence. For the benefit of Australians who are not fluent in the language of the financial markets, short selling can be simply described as selling shares the seller does not themselves own, normally borrowed or loaned from someone else, on the likelihood that the share price will fall. When the seller has to return the borrowed shares, they go off and buy more at the new, hopefully lower, price, return these to the original lender and, of course, pocket the difference. While appropriately regulated and disclosed short selling has a role to play in the effective operation of the market as it can assist with true share price discovery for example, it is appropriate to curtail its use at a time of heightened market volatility. Some of these practices are, frankly, big investors manipulating the current circumstances to make money out of other people's misfortune. So, in light of developments in global markets in recent weeks and over the weekend, ASIC and the ASX have taken coordinated action on short selling. These are important steps to ensure the integrity of the operation of our financial markets at this time and the government welcomes them. On Friday, ASIC and the ASX announced measures to ban all ‘naked' short sales effective this morning, limit the number of allowable ‘covered' short sales, and increase disclosure requirements for these allowable covered short sales. Following further consultation with its counterparts overseas and participants in the financial markets, ASIC has also announced an interim ban on all short selling. The government endorses this coordinated response which accords with similar im- action taken by the US, the UK and other major jurisdictions. This action shows that our regulatory system is working well in responding to challenging global circumstances. There have been reports of short selling being used to try to manipulate the market, in particular with regard to financial stocks. Market manipulation of this sort simply cannot be tolerated. Australia has a world-class regulatory system and this action will help ensure ongoing confidence in the operation of Australia's financial markets. The government and the regulators continue to monitor this situation closely and will not hesitate to take further action should it be warranted. Conclusion I finish by reminding Australians again that we have much to be optimistic about. Our situation is fundamentally different to that being experienced by most other developed countries. This does not mean that we have not felt the impact of these global forces-we most certainly have-but Australia is well placed to weather the impacts of this global financial crisis. As our regulators have said: Australian deposit-taking and insurance companies supervised by APRA are well-capitalised, profitable and well-regulated and are weathering the turmoil well. Australian depositors can be confident in the soundness of Australian financial institutions. We do take heart from this assessment, and the government will continue to do whatever it can to help shield the Australian community from the impact of these global forces.

There is great uncertainty about the ramifications of the global financial crisis and the extent of impacts on the Australian economy. There is uncertainty about job security, interest rates and other factors of critical concern to Australians. It is important at times like this for the government to do all it can to maintain confidence in the state of the economy and to remain committed to sound economic policies. The Rudd Labor government inherited an economy that was strong, resilient and flexible. Extensive economic, employment, tax and welfare reforms undertaken by the coalition government played a key role in those strong fundamentals. In addition to strong fiscal management, the coalition adopted independent monetary policy and a sound financial system with the creation of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. These reforms and strong management of the economy mean Australia is quite different from other OECD countries. Our financial sector is well capitalised and profitable and is well placed to withstand the pressure of the crisis. The Labor government inherited fiscal surpluses of $110 billion over five years. It inherited net assets of $45 billion. It inherited a 30-year low in unemployment. This is a far cry from the economy handed over by the Keating government in or- 1996. Then, the budget was $10 billion in deficit. There was net government debt of $96 billion. The previous Labor government had presided over high unemployment, record high interest rates and high inflation. The coalition repaid Labor's $96 billion debt, brought the budget back into surplus and, after 11½ years of reform, we left the lowest rate of unemployment in 35 years. Inflation and interest rates remained at historically low levels, and the highest interest rate under the coalition was always lower than the lowest interest rate at any time under the previous Labor government. So the coalition's legacy has been sustained growth, increased employment, decreased unemployment including long-term unemployment, and rising living standards. This was achieved despite significant turmoil from the Asian financial meltdown, the crash of the technology shares, the September 11 terrorist attacks and the war on terror. But confidence was maintained in Australia throughout these times of great uncertainty and crisis because Treasurer Costello and Prime Minister Howard reassured the Australian people that our economy was sound and that we were well placed to withstand these external shocks. The Labor Prime Minister and the Treasurer were clearly intimidated by the outstanding record of economic management they inherited, and they immediately embarked upon a regrettable course of action. In their mad rush to trash the coalition's economic record, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister declared that inflation was out of control. The Treasurer's now infamous declaration that the inflation genie was out the bottle, on the day before a meeting of the Reserve Bank, was reckless, and it was followed by the Prime Minister's hysterical claim that the inflation monster was ravaging the economy. This had a major impact on business and consumer confidence at precisely the wrong time of the economic cycle. Since the Rudd Labor government came to office, business and consumer confidence has plummeted to lows not seen since the previous Labor government in the early 1990s. There has been such a succession of worsening indicators since early this year that it would in fact be impossible in the available for me to summarise them. The government must accept responsibility for this collapse of confidence and the deteriorating state of the economy. Both its rhetoric and its policies have contributed to the lem. A key idea in economics is that people in households and businesses make decisions based on their expectations about the future. Their expectations influence their decisions, their decisions influence economic activity, prices and other economic variables, and economic conditions and the particular circumstances of business and households influence expectations. Labor's panicky and negative rhetoric undoubtedly undermined confidence in business and households. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister must accept that their actions have directly contributed to the economic slowdown in Australia. The events of the last week have been extraordinary. Lehman Brothers has collapsed and filed for bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch has merged with the Bank of America, the United States government has nationalised the giant insurer AIG, Morgan Stanley has considered combining with a commercial bank and, in the middle of what has been called the largest shock to the financial system since the Great Depression, funding pressures have become enormous and even of money market funds, which are usually considered safe, have incurred losses. Risk aversion has surged, and investors have sought the safety of short-term Treasury debt, driving yields to their lowest level since the early stages of World War II. The severity of funding pressures has been most apparent in money markets, where already higher spreads between interbank lending rates and expected official interest rates have surged. In the United States the pressure has been most pronounced. Three-month interbank rates are now about 130 basis points above the expected federal funds rate, exceeding time the earlier record peaks seen during the credit crunch late last year. Instead of lowering official rates, central banks have tried to separate their monetary and liquidity policies, preferring to provide prob- into the global banking system a massive amount of cash. This has been accomplished primarily by the Federal Reserve increasing its US dollar swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank as well as establishing new lines with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. In total these new and expanded swap lines now mean that central banks-mainly in Europe, where demand is greatest-can provide roughly US$290 million in short-term funding to banks. Last Saturday, 20 September, US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson released details of a plan to ask congress for $700 billion to buy distressed assets from US financial institutions. The proposal would give the Treasury Secretary significant leeway and flexibility in buying, selling and holding residential or commercial mortgages as well as any securities, obligations or other instruments that based on or related to such mortgages. Among the things the US government is asking for is the authority to hire asset managers to oversee the buying of assets. With an election looming, it is unclear how much time it will take to secure congressional approval. It could also take some time to set up the fund and start buying assets. This suggests that in the short term the brunt of the government's support to the banking system will continue to be borne by the US Federal Reserve's liquidity policy and, depending on the fallout for the real economy, its monetary policy decisions. For Australia, the global credit crunch saw the non-bank sector run into difficulties last year and early this year when they were no longer able to buy money cheaply in the United States to on-lend for mortgages that they would then securitise to sell to investors. Our banks have taken up the slack, although they could not keep growing their loan books at the frantic pace of last year, given higher funding costs and an inability to free up their balance sheet by securitising and onselling existing loans. The increase in funding costs has been significant, with banks finding it more expensive to raise finance both at home and abroad. Deposit rates have increased over the past year, while money market rates remain well above the expected cash rate. Internationally, our banks have been able to issue a substantial amount of debt during the crunch, albeit at a more expensive rate. These higher funding costs have been passed on to borrowers, resulting in wider margins between lending rates and the cash rate over the past 12 months, thereby contributing to the reduction in lending seen so far this year. Funding costs have come down slightly, and the Reserve Bank's recent decision to lower rates has provided some relief, even though the are Reserve Bank now expects inflation to reach five per cent by December. Last week's events have worked to reverse the improvement in overall funding costs by making it expensive to issue debt abroad and by lifting money market rates. The shift in money market rates in Australia has been large, although not as extreme as in the United States. The Reserve Bank has said it will take any increases in funding costs and the extent to which they are passed on into account when formulating monetary policy. Superannuation returns have fallen in the last six months, as has household wealth. The evidence suggests that, while our economy is strong and resilient, it is not completely immune from events overseas. Our banking sector is profitable, well regulated and well capitalised, but its stock prices have fallen nonetheless. We need to make sure our regulations are appropriate and that regulators are doing their job properly in monitoring developments closely. The coalition left the economy in good shape. Thanks to successful reforms, including the financial sector reforms and the Wallis reforms-which created APRA, ASIC and the nine iterations of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, CLERP-as well as our very strong fiscal position, Australia is in a very strong economic position compared with most other OECD economies. We are also benefiting from the growth in Asia, particularly China. The diversification of our exports has reduced the volatility of the terms of trade. Australia's flexible workplace relations laws have also helped by providing job opportunities. Reform of the tax system has also been crucial to provide dividends to Australians and to improve the competitiveness of our tax system. But I repeat: Australia is not immune to the financial crisis. We are well prepared and our economy is strong and resilient, but the Rudd government have been caught like rabbits in the headlights. The panicky attacks the new Leader of the Opposition have built on perceptions of a government that lacks the ability to manage the economy through this global crisis. The government are so focused on symbolism, websites, reviews and inquiries that they forget about the decisions and the actions that must be taken. The Prime Minister seems to be more focused on 2020 than on today, 2008. There are serious economic issues facing our country right now. The Prime Minister has to start governing and start governing for the present. The major concern about the Treasurer's response to short selling is the inconsistency and the mixed messages emanating from the government. Only a few weeks ago, on 8 August, Minister Sherry said that the government would not ban short selling. He said: Let me say again for the record-we will not banning short selling. Then the government changed tack, with the announcement on Friday of an interim ban on what is called naked short selling, with Minister Sherry welcoming the change. On Sunday, the interim ban was extended to cover short selling in total. Essentially what this means is that as of last Friday the government and ASIC knew that the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority had banned not just naked short selling but all short selling in financials. Secondly, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was proposing to temporarily ban short selling on the same basis. Yet, on the Friday, the Australian government chose to ban only naked short selling. Why did they not ban all short selling last Friday? If the excuse is that overseas regulators made subsequent changes, why is the minister not in close contact with these regulators, as he claimed? The effect of all this uncertainty-which on has been three or perhaps four positions over three days if you include the status quo and Minister Sherry's comments-is that the Australian stock exchange had to delay opening on Monday morning to seek clarification from the corporate regulator about the decision to ban the short selling of shares in the local market. The Australian stock exchange had to close for an hour because of the confusion, the incompetence of the Australian government on the issue of short selling. This sends a message of confusion and incompetence on the part of the Treasurer-or was it just sheer panic? It is symptomatic of a government that is unsure of where to go or how far to go. This is a government that says it wants to promote Australia as a financial services hub and then reduces withholding tax for foreigners. This is a government that be says it wants to promote certainty and stability in the financial markets but manages to close the stock exchange, amidst great confusion. What must the international investment community think of such incompetence? The coalition, as our leader has offered, committed to a bipartisan response to the international financial crisis. The coalition remains committed to assisting the government. I extend an offer to the Treasurer, in the absence of the Prime Minister, to meet with me so that we can discuss any further measures that might be needed. I urge the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to cease their reckless attacks on the economic legacy of the coalition government and to cease their attacks on the Leader of the Opposition when all he seeks to do is discuss the impact of the financial crisis with the government of the day-a financial crisis that will affect jobs, superannuation and mortgages in this country. I ask the government to commit to doing everything in their power to rebuild the shattered confidence of this nation.",71
112,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I have the pleasure to make a ministerial statement to announce the release of an independent report into Australia's export policies and grams, the Mortimer report, conducted by Mr David Mortimer AO and Dr John Edwards. A key part of this review was the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, the EMDG Scheme. I present the Review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. Release of the Mortimer report The Mortimer report provides a basis for the government's future trade policies. I will use its recommendations to continue our commitment to refocus Australian trade policy and to help lay the foundations for our future prosperity. The report notes with concern our persistent trade deficits in recent years and that they have contributed to the increase in the net foreign liabilities. The report makes the point that an increase in exports will be necessary to stabilise is eign liabilities and to avoid a potentially painful adjustment process in the future. Whilst the report does not actually set a target for improving our export performance, I think we do need to set ourselves a goal. There are differences of opinion as to what measure is best. But we must take steps to ensure that our net exports make a consistently positive contribution to economic growth. For that, we need to set ambitious objectives. We have got to be ambitious if we are to turn around the failures of the previous government on trade policy. We have got to be ambitious if we are to respond to the changing nature of trade, and we have got to be ambitious if we are to boost our international competitiveness. We have already achieved significant outcomes that will improve our trade performTrade ance and made significant down payments on which we can now build. Our first budget made significant commitments to invest in the drivers of economic growth-in particular, to invest in infrastructure, skills formapro- tion and innovation. The government commissioned this report because Australia needed a comprehensive review into our trade performance due to the previous government's failure to address this critical contributor to our economy. The previous government in fact had no policy on trade, and it showed. Under their watch, despite the resources boom, net exports made a positive contribution to economic growth in just two out of their 11 years in office. This stands in stark contrast to Labor's performance when it was last in government, when net exports made a positive contribution to growth in 10 of our 13 years in office. That is the difference: two out of 11 from the other side; 10 out of 13 when we took a comprehensive approach and understood the importance of lifting our net fortrade performance. I have spoken before in this place on a number of occasions about the record 72 consecutive trade deficits that we inherited from the previous government. No other government in our history has presided over such a disastrous run. Worse, the Mortimer report tells us that much of the deterioration under the previous government was in the last five years, when we had the benefit of a major resources boom and very favourable terms of trade. Not only was their trade negotiation strategy not productive, they failed on two other important fronts. First, they failed to invest in the key drivers of economic growth and competitiveness. Second, they failed to understand the changing nature of trade and investment. In the previous response to the Treasurer's ministerial statement, I noticed that the new shadow Treasurer talked about the legacy of the previous government. Well, the legacy of the previous government was an appalling one when it came to trade performance. The shadow Treasurer also made mention of the fact that under them there had been a diversification of our export base. The truth is that that diversification did not happen. The services economy is 80 per cent of our domestic economy, yet it is only responsible for 23 per cent of our exports. That is not a diversification. The previous government's failure to understand the opportunities in the services economy and the importance of investment is part of the reason we had such an appalling trade performance under them. The previous government just rode the resources boom and hoped that strong demand for Australian resources would boost our exports. They did not think about how we would meet that demand and they did not think about the long term. The Mortimer report finds that critical parts of Australia's infrastructure have failed to cope with the current demands and that this has substantially limited export volumes and competitiveness. Mortimer also received considerable input on the extent to which shortages of labour, both skilled and unskilled, have emerged as a constraint on Australia's export and investment capacity. No wonder our export performance under the previous government has been so poor. A new approach This review confirms the need for the Rudd government to implement its new trade and investment strategy to lift Australia's trade performance. We will seek to ensure net exports once again make a positive contribution to economic growth, because this is what boosts our economic prosperity. This is what lifts our standard of living. This is what creates jobs-higher paying, more skilled and more sustainable jobs. And, Mr Deputy Speaker, we know it can be done. The last Labor government-of which I was proud to be part-did it. Net exports made a positive contribution, as I said earlier, in 10 out of our 13 years in office. In the Hawke-Keating years we laid the groundwork for successful export performance by: - investing in the drivers of economic growth - opening up the economy through broad structural reform and - broadening the export base. And we reaped a positive trade dividend as a consequence. The Rudd government has already, in its very first budget, laid the basis for doing this again. The Mortimer report strongly endorses the government's view that, as important as market access is, trade policy must also focus on broader economic and trade reform in order to capitalise on that access. It's what we in government have continually referred to as the twin pillars approach to our trade policy. That is, trade reform at the border, to increase our market access, and trade reform behind the border, to improve our international competitiveness. There is no point improving market access if we as a nation are not competitive enough and productive enough to take advantage of the opportunities. What we have already achieved Consistent with the report's recommendations, we have already made a significant down payment on improving our trade performance. And the completion of the Mortimer review marks the fulfilment of another key election commitment. On the first pillar-the market access pillar-the Mortimer report provides a comprehensive set of recommendations on how we can better respond to the market access priorities of Australian business. It calls for the conclusion of the WTO Doha round of negotiations as the most effective basis for enhancing trade liberalisation. Given the trend towards bilateral free trade agreements, the Mortimer report strongly advocates engaging our approach to the free trade agreements in a way that reinforces the gains we make at the WTO-in other words, free trade agreements that are complementary and enhancing of multilateralism, not detractors of it. While we are keen to develop this strategy further, we have not waited for the Mortimer report to get on with the job of opening markets for Australian business. We have already recalibrated our trade negotiating policy under the first pillar. We are 80 per cent there on the WTO Doha round of trade negotiations. And we are absolutely committed to resolving the outstanding issues. But not only have we seen significant progress in the multilateral negotiations, we have also achieved greater market access bilaterally and regionally. In our first 10 months, we have concluded two important FTAs. First with Chile-a model FTA in terms of its coverage and its comprehensiveness and one that is an enhancer of the multilateral system-and, most recently, Australia's first region-wide FTA, with New Zealand and the ASEAN group of countriesour largest trading partner. This has given Australian exporters significantly better access to rapidly growing market-the first pillar of our trade policy. We have unfrozen the China FTA negotiations. We have advanced negotiations on the Japan FTA. We have brought the India FTA study forward. We have agreed to preparatory talks on a Korea FTA. We have also established new coordination structures at the whole-of-government level and the wholeof-governments level through COAG. We have signalled a broadening of our export base with a strong focus on services and investment. We have integrated trade and investment promotion functions into one organisation, Austrade, reflecting the changing nature of trade and the needs of Australian firms. We have taken steps to modernise and strengthen the EMDG Scheme and in our first budget we added $50 million to fund commitments in 2009-10. International competitiveness Given the importance of trade to our economic prosperity, it will be critical that our domestic policies and spending are seen through the prism of enhancing our international competitiveness. This, in essence, is the second pillar of our trade policy approach. We have to ensure that Australia is productive enough and competitive enough to take advantage of our market access gains. In this regard, we have also made a significant down payment on the second pillar, ie structural reform behind the border. We have invested heavily in the drivers of economic growth and competitiveness. In its first budget, the Rudd government established Infrastructure Australia, Skills Australia, the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund. Consistent with our rationale for commissioning the Mortimer review, and the conclusions in his report, we have already laid the foundations for a transformation. Enhanced coordination The review also recommends concerted efforts to strengthen coordination and delivery of trade policies and services, and a strong voice for business in developing trade and investment priorities and programs. The government has already established for the very first time a COAG council to coordinate efforts to improve our trade performance. I chaired the inaugural meeting of the COAG Ministerial Council on International Trade in August. At that meeting, all Australian governments-federal and state-developed an ambitious and forward looking work agenda, which includes an assessment of the infrastructure and skills needed to improve Australia's trade performance, as well as cooperation on exports and investment promotion, and the development of options for Brand Australia. This Mortimer report will also shape that council's ongoing agenda and I look forward to working with my colleagues in responding to Mortimer's recommendations. More generally, the review reported on the declining proportion of Commonwealth government assistance directed to trade and investment facilitation, relative to other forms of business assistance. From 2000-01 to 2006-07, the proportion declined from a total of 42 per cent down to a mere 13 per cent; again, all under the previous government's watch. This is another example of the Howard government's neglect-and it is imperative that this government turns things around. Austrade is our trade facilitation arm and the review endorses it as the central focus all export and investment facilitation activities. It provides a vital link between policy and implementation. The need for more strategic cooperation between DFAT and Austrade is critical. Austrade also provides the link between government and the Australian business community. Whereas the previous government abolished the Austrade board, the Mortimer report reinforces the need for re-engagement with business and we have taken steps in this direction. The review provides a solid basis for further strengthening Austrade. It welcomes the down payment made by this government starting with the integration of the former Invest Australia and Global Opportunities programs into Austrade. It recommends the organisation move beyond the delivery of services to individual firms and to develop and implement more strategic, sectoral based market development strategies. It flags the need for some new services for Australian exporters, reflecting the changing nature of global trade. Building an international business culture We also need to rebuild an international business culture in this country, and to enhance the capability of Australian firms to engage internationally. This requires a strengthened and more contemporary approach to trade development and facilitation. Mortimer reports that the most significant impediments to Australian firms going global are access to finance and inadequate knowledge of overseas markets. Recognising this, revitalising the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is an important part of Labor's whole-of-government approach to improving Australia's export performance. The EMDG Scheme is integral in the current mix of export policies and programs and the reason we brought forward the EMDG review by two years. The review, the report for of which I tabled earlier, concludes that the EMDG Scheme is effective and recommends its continuation. Independent econometric analysis conducted in the course of the review concluded that each dollar of EMDG generates an additional $13.50 to $27 of exports. The analysis also confirmed that the scheme has a positive impact on the economy as a whole. This analysis will also be published today. Despite these conclusions, the review highlights the impact that lack of funding certainty has on applicants. Mortimer states that the uncertainty has ‘unnecessarily diminished its value and public repute'. EMDG funding has effectively been cut in real terms since 1995-96 by the failure of the Howard government to top up funding for the scheme. Decisions by the Howard government in 2006 to make the scheme, on the face of it, more available combined with the failure to provide additional funding to cover the impact of those decisions will continue to affect grant payments paid this year-that is, 2008-09-for expenditure undertaken by firms in the 2007-08 financial year. This is the unfortunate legacy of squandered opportunities inherited by the Rudd Labor government. In contrast, in this year's budget Labor has allocated an additional $50 million in 2009-10 to respond to commitments made by firms in this financial year. This is a nificant down payment on our expansion of the EMDG Scheme. The review identifies options both for addressing the funding of the scheme and for further modernising the scheme. In considering the broader question of access to finance the review goes further and identifies a number of other potential areas of market failure experienced by Australian firms seeking to grow global businesses. This is timely given both the changing nature of trade and investment and the opportunities for Australian companies to seize strategic benefit from new market access gains. A classic example is the FTA with our 10 ASEAN neighbours. As a group they are our largest trading partner. Larger than China. Larger than Japan. And larger than the United States. We are developing a commercial strategy to take advantage of new opportunities in ASEAN as trade barriers fall. The Mortimer report reinforces this point and argues that Australia's market and investment development efforts should be focused on rapidly growing and prospective markets and industry sectors. In particular, the report supports initiatives that actively maximise the internationalisation of traditional Australian industry sectors-like mining technology and agricultural services or automotive products and services-where this will reinforce the long-term competitive position of those sectors. The report also highlights the need to take advantage of growing opportunities in international markets for newer, knowledge intensive services such as the financial services sector (particularly funds management), telecommunications and logistics, as well as to develop the export capacity and performance of areas of emerging capability including clean energy technology and water. We will need to strengthen export and investment development efforts through new services to sigsupport outwards investment and new efforts to build international business skills and culture. We will also need to strengthen efforts to raise international awareness of Australia's commercial capabilities and look at a national approach to ‘branding'. Conclusion I would like to thank Mr David Mortimer and Dr John Edwards for their insightful analysis and forward-looking recommendations in this report. Our region has become the economic powerhouse of the global economy. Our vision is for Australia to make much more of this opportunity. The challenge is not only to take advantage of the opportunities but also to help secure that economic growth in a sustainable way for ourselves and our region. That not only means that we have to continue to take the lead in the trade liberalisation agenda but, fundamentally, it also means that we have to diversify our trade base to harness much more of the huge potential this nation has. It means doing more with our resources and agriculture base, and it means going significantly beyond it and expanding our opportunities. It means a much bigger focus on services and investment and understanding the importance of ensuring the necessary reforms to support that drive forward. If we get this right, we will set up this tion for sustained prosperity beyond the resources boom. We showed the way when we were last in government. And now the Rudd government has picked up where we left off-with a new era of economic reform. In the first 10 months, we have already made a huge down payment on our commitment to turning around Australia's trade performance, and there are indications already that we are turning the corner. I look forward to keeping the House informed of my response to Mr Mortimer's report and our progress. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Groom to speak for 23½ minutes. Leave granted.",75
113,Mr CREAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Macfarlane speaking for a period not exceeding 23½ minutes. Question agreed to.,80
114,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is with some sadness that I rise in the House today to give a response to I do not know how many lots of big words and long statements that achieve nothing that have come from the Minister for Trade, who sits opposite. Mr Fitzgibbon-It's not even your portfolio.",80
115,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"This portfolio is going to be taken over by the member for Wide Bay, and I am sure that he will be more than a match for those who sit opposite. Mr Fitzgibbon-Where is he? Mr Crean-No appearance, Your Worship?",80
116,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a tradition in this House that, when someone takes leave for a medical nareason, it is not raised. But we have already realised from the minister that he does not want to behave in a bipartisan way. I have asked repeatedly for briefings from his office and never had them. I have asked how I can make statements in relation to Australia's trade policy when I am overseas and I have never received a response. I take a bipartisan approach to trade. I have written to the minister on a number of occasions-and all of those letters have been on file-and have never been responded to. So I take some exception to the interjection. Mr Crean interjecting",80
117,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I accept the apology. The Minister for Trade, whenever he stands at this dispatch box, always talks about doing more and doing something and all of that. Well, the time for talking about doing more is over. Whilst it is a little difficult to comment on a report that has only just been presented-a report that has been long-awaited by those on this side of the House-we do welcome the tabling of the Mortimer report. I assure the minister that I will take the time to read it, as my passion for trade-which goes back to my days in agriculture when he and I first crossed tracks and had a far more bipartisan approach to achieving things than we do now-that I have held for 30 years will continue. The report may bring some clarity and direction to what has been a haphazard and chaotic approach by this minister, including the direction he has taken on everything from the EMDG Scheme to trade policy in general. I hope that this report may prompt the minister to stop floundering and actually accept the fact that he has a responsibility, cause he is in government, he is on the Treasury benches, and he is in a position to do something about it. It may be in vain, but I hope this report might also spark the minister into actually considering the interests of exporters and investors-so far, the missing link in Labor's trade policy. I can only wonder what sort of reception they might get in light of the fact that, when it comes to trade policy, the minister has adopted such a closed door approach to those who wish to work with him, including those on this side of the chamber who have looked for a bipartisan approach. The minister did discuss the EMDG aspect of the report. That is certainly one most important aspects of trade policy, and it was one of the most important pieces of support infrastructure for exporters under the previous coalition government. Clearly, after 10 months in office, with no trade policy action, the minister figured, ‘What difference will a few more weeks take?' I hope that, having released the report-after having sat on it for three weeks-he does not take weeks or months to define his response. The drip-feed approach that we have seen from the Labor Party has been to the detriment of Australia's trade sector. On top of the DNA that exists within the Labor Party to govern by committee after committee, the core DNA of the trade minister has been a haphazard drip-feed approach to trade policy. The government's record so far on the EMDG Scheme has been nothing short of dismal. No amount of self-righteous carry-on from the minister will dispel the fact that it has been a woeful performance. Labor acknowledged the popularity of the EMDG Scheme when the coalition were in government. Despite the promises it has made and despite all the musing and illusion that it attempted to create-that it would fund extra money into the EMDG Scheme when it came be- into government-it has refused to allocate funding to a sufficient level in 2007-08, 2008-09, the current year, 2010-11 and 201112. This policy paralysis has left Australian exporters, who went about their business in good faith, tens of thousands of dollars short. We have already seen the first payment in the current payment year, under this government's budget, cut from $70,000 to $40,000. And the trade minister knew from the time he came into government that that was going to be the case. He knew that there were going to be shortfalls in the EMDG scheme and he did nothing about it. If he did do something about it, it certainly cannot be seen. So, either he did nothing or-as we suspect-he of the went to the ERC, the expenditure review committee, and got comprehensively rolled. He got no money for this year, $50 million for next year, nothing for the year after and nothing for the year after that. I note that in the minister's statement he said that they were making a down payment for exporters in the EMDG scheme. I hope that means that in the time ahead he will be able to change those forward estimates. It will be too late for this year. He could go into cabinet, as previous ministers on this side have done, and argue for extra money, but I assume he will not. But he may have the courage to argue to change the out years. I hope he does, because people involved in trade and exports in Australia need a minister who can get results out of the ERC. They need a minister who does not pass the buck, who accepts that he is in government, who understands that it is his job to do something and who, instead of being more interested in ‘blamestorming', actually gets in there and does some brainstorming about how to get the money for the exporters. The Rudd Labor government has played a cruel hoax on Australia's exporters by claiming to extend the EMDG scheme, broadening the parameters and making the scheme wider, while at the same time not addressing the shortfalls in three of the four forward years. Their one-off allocation of $50 million in grants in 2009-10, which will relate to expenses incurred in the current financial year, is leaving exporters out in the cold. Of greater concern is Labor's attempted deception of exporters by failing to allocate extra money for the scheme after its initial $50 million in next year's funding budget. I hope the minister succeeds on this front but I can assure him that we will be holding his feet to the fire on it. He needs to stiffen up a little bit. He needs the parliamentary secretary to stay in Australia a little bit I am very pleased to see the parliamentary secretary here this week. I do not think that was planned, but it is good to see him here, because the Minister for Trade needs all the help he can get. This minister and his parliamentary secretary need to stop throwing the blame back on the previous government, because this minister has responsibility. He has to actually start doing things. The damage Labor has done to the trade sector extends further than just the EMDG scheme. The minister had the audacity to stand at the dispatch box and talk about how he had improved the operations of Invest Australia by moving it into Austrade. That move in itself may or may not be a positive. I can see some positives in it. But the 100 people who lost their jobs in that transition would be wondering how you will do with 50 people a job that used to take 150 people. How will you do it when you have sacked two-thirds of your departmental staff? In terms of the Global Opportunities Program that the previous government set up, they have moved that across to the trade portfolio. That, again, may be a good move, except that they ditched a couple of hundred million dollars in the process-ripped it out of that program to promote exports overseas and left that section, I understand, with less than $10 million. We have also heard from the minister about the amazing achievements in bilateral trade negotiations. I assume he includes in that statement the China and Japan free trade agreements-we know the budgets for the negotiations for those were cut in the budget. One of the great distortions that we get from a Labor Party government is their attempt to rewrite history. They pay no credit, unlike this coalition when we were in government. We gave them credit for the work they did on the New Zealand agreement. We more. acknowledged that work. Then we set about beginning the processes on things like the Chile FTA. But they have given no acknowledgement of the work that was done on Chile by the previous government. This minister takes a myopic approach, with no bipartisanship, no grace and no diplomacy in what he does. I say to him: change your ways. If you attempt to rewrite history then history is going to catch you out. What we want to see is some real action; we do not want to see this continuous talk about what they are going to do. Every time the Minister for Trade stands at the dispatch box, he talks about previous trade deficits, and in doing so exposes just how little they on that side understand about how an economy works. Of course, he is also trying to gloss over the cracks; he is trying to gloss over the fact that, when Labor left ernment, they left a $96 billion deficit. left us with an unemployment problem that had to be resolved. They also left a legacy businesses broken by the high interest rates that existed during their government. What the previous government had to do was restore the economic confidence of businesses to invest, to employ, to spend money, to rebuild the economy and to put in place the factories, the processes and the novation. We had to make the decisions that would see Australia grow strong in the long term. In doing that, we saw business investment reach record levels in areas such as R&D for processing. We saw exports of processed goods in Australia reach record levels. That takes time, and it takes a lot investment. It means you have to update your machinery. You have to retrain your personnel to do their jobs better so that eveeventuate, ryone shares in the prosperity. You have to make the investment in innovation. The Minister for Trade-who is no longer in the House; perhaps he is off on a flight somewhere; who knows?-fails to acknowledge that that was a time of economic rebuilding after the shattering days of the vious Labor government. As a farmer, I faced-and I am sure other farmers here such as the member for Gray also facedinterest rates in excess of 21 per cent. From those shattering days, when small businesses were destroyed by interest rates and inflation, we had to rebuild the economic climate to ensure that investment could be made. The minister also talked about ASEAN. We certainly support the push for an ASEAN free trade agreement. We certainly support the efforts of the minister, even though we know not what they are. The minister will not give me a briefing on what he has done, and I suspect he will not give the new shadow minister a briefing either. We support govwhatever the minister has done to improve They the trade relationship between Australia, New Zealand and ASEAN. It is a crucial part of of our trade strategy going forward; it is no more and no less crucial than Doha. It is a partnership. You have to do both. You have to cover your bets at Doha by pushing forward with FTAs. However, I have one of those uneasy feelings that you get when you have been a infarmer and you are about to get a storm: you can see the storm clouds building on the horizon but the storm is full of hail not rain. I want to know what is in that ASEAN agreement before it is signed and finally ratified. Industry in Australia wants to know what is in that free trade agreement. When we were of in government, we were given assurances that certain things would happen with access to markets after the Thai FTA. That did not even though tariff reform did. The actuals behind the border reforms have not occurred. There are reasons for that, but we cannot go forward with an ASEAN free trade agreement and expose industries such as the car industry to the result of our failure to get the governments of countries that we are pregoing negotiate with to hold to their commitments of giving us access. In this instance, we need to look at how we will get motor vehicles into the ASEAN area. We need to look at how we will export Ford Territories out of Victoria into countries like Thailand and large six-cylinder vehicles, which are among the best in the world in their class, into some of the export markets. Australians continue to make the choice of vehicles that come out of Thailand, for instance. It is worth noting that Thai imports into Australia have doubled in dollar terms in the last two years. It is also worth noting that we need to ensure that whatever is in the Australian, New Zealand ASEAN free trade agreement gives us the access that we need. That will be a challenge. Were we in government, I accept that that would be a challenge. But it is a challenge that has to be met. The car industry in Australia is facing a crisis. I have not yet seen the figures that would have been released today, but I assume they will show that the downward trend continues in the larger vehicle segment of vehicles made in Australia. We need to give that industry some confidence. When I was the minister for industry, I worked very hard on the car industry to begin exports and to grow their exports. So we have a situation now where, out of the vehicles Toyota make here, more vehicles are exported than sold here. Holden is heading towards the 50 per cent mark. We have to get trade markets for Ford. We have to be able to see those vehicles exported, and that will come through things such as the ASEAN FTA. But we need to know what is in there. I look forward to seeing what is in the agreement. I know the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade looks forward to seeing what is in it. I know that JSCOT also looks forward to seeing what is in it. But, most importantly, industry in Australia looks forward to seeing what is in it. So, I beseech the minister to take a bipartisan approach and to take the member for Wide Bay into his confidence. Only he needs to know what is in the agreement for now. This would give us some confidence that the minister knows what he is doing in regard to the future of Australian industry. After a series of speeches in this House, we have seen absolutely nothing to date but talk. We need to see some action. In conclusion, I also thank Mr David Mortimer and Dr John Edwards for their work. I will, as I said, take the opportunity to look at their report. I am sure based on just the credentials of those two gentlemen that it will be a fine report. It will identify opportunities for Australian exporters. It will identify opportunities for the government to put in place policies that give exporters the confidence they need-and they will need that confidence. But it would also give the government confidence that they have put money into those programs that they have not put money into to date. Instead of cutting negotiating budgets, they should be adding to them. Instead of cutting programs that were put in place by the previous government, they should be making sure that those programs run. They were in the forward estimates. They have been taken out of the forward estimates to fund programs that the Labor Party thought were more important. What is more important than trade? Very little. In his absence, I thank the minister for the opportunity to respond to his ministerial statement. I hope that the efforts of Mr Mortimer and Dr Edwards are not wasted and that this government actually takes a swift and firm response to the report and gives the confidence to exporters that they need. SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",80
118,Ms CAMPBELL,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Bass) (4.45 pm)Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this most important legislation, the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008, and add my voice to those in support of safe workplaces for all Australians. Is it not one of the most basic of rights to assume that when hard working Australians go to work they will return safely to their families at the end of their shift? Is not the absolute minimum that as a government and a community we should be demanding? Over the last 10 years, 110 Tasmanian workers have not been returned to their families. Last year, nine workers in my home state lost their lives in traumatic workplace incidents. Just this week, WorkCover Tasmania released alarming figures which showed that each day 27 Tasmanians are injured at work. In 2007, that equated to 9,873. That is an increase of one per cent on the previous year. The majority of those injuries were soft tissue injuries due to trauma. More than 2,300 were caused by wounds, lacerations, amputations and internal organ damage. Other injuries were from falls, trips, slips and being hit by moving objects. I understand, as do those on this side of the House, that workplace health and safety is currently a complex matter, with overlapping and unnecessary duplications and differences from state to state. As part of our commitment to a seamless national economy, this bill begins the process of reform to this overly complex system. As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations informed the House, each year there are more than 300 Australians killed at work, and over 140,000 are seriously injured. Those are deeply distressing figures, but, more than that, they are people-hard working men and women whose death or injury has a profound effect on their families, their friends, their colleagues and their workplaces. There is a financial cost also: some $34 billion a year. This is a cost borne by the entire community, not least the tens of thousands of businesses which operate across the country. Since the 1970s, there has been a growing emphasis placed on health and safety in our workplaces-as well there should have been. that At the same time, however, the nature of the labour market has changed and evolved, and I believe it is fair to say that the OH&S structures across states and territories have failed to keep up. Moreover, they have evolved independently of each other-for example, how the courts recognise and deal with workers other than employees may differ vastly depending on the jurisdiction. I would argue that a person's right to safety in the workplace should not be determined by where that workplace is. And it is workers who bear the brunt of failures in this area. That is why, with the election of the Rudd government, an extraordinary opportunity was afforded us to change for the better many aspects of work life in Australia. Our agenda extends beyond the abolition of the abhorrence that was Work Choices. Safe Work Australia replaces the Howard government's Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was largely an advisory council whose functions were limited. In contrast, the Rudd government's Safe Work Australia will lead to a far more comprehensive and coherent approach to health and safety in the workplace. It will enable the development of a national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation. It will prepare, monitor and revise OH&S legislation as well as develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions. At the same time, Safe Work Australia will see developed a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure a nationally consistent approach to these two critical areas. Proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements across all jurisdictions and proposals for national workers compensation arrangements for employers with workers in more than one jurisdiction will be developed also. The legislation will build expertise across OH&S laws and workers compensation schemes that will be readily accessible across jurisdictions and industries and will reduce the complexity and costs for businesses, including businesses that operate across state boundaries. In my home state of Tasmania, there are many potentially dangerous industries, as there are right across the country, from forestry, mining and construction to the health sector, where every day nurses face injury through lifting. It is not just death and serious injury we are addressing here today but what one might consider to be comparatively ‘minor' injuries, which still have a profound and often debilitating effect on those individuals and businesses involved. I have discussed Safe Work Australia at some length with a range of stakeholders across my electorate, and I can inform the House that the reactions are very positive. Even those organisations with reservations are positive about the prospect of a uniform approach to workplace health and safety and workers compensation. Unions Tasmania describes Safe Work Australia as a welcome move which it believes will restore an independent body for the centralised research and development of workplace health and safety policy. Unions Tasmania believes, and indeed I also believe, that this body will play an important role in the ongoing improvement of safety at work and will support the work of state bodies by removing the duplication of effort and harmonising safety law. Among the concerns expressed by Unions Tasmania and also, I am aware, by the ACTU, is that the traditional tripartism has not been establishedthat the number of government officials will outweigh the number of employee and employer representatives, when perhaps these should be equal. I am hopeful that this legislation, that Safe Work Australia, will enable the development of a national framework for OH&S which recognises basic minimum standards. By that I mean one which includes the highest health and safety standards to protect working Australians from death, injury and illness-one which places the burden of proof on employers when they breach the law. I want to see the highest standards of rights, powers and protections for health and safety representatives. I am firmly of the view, and I know it is very much the view of Unions Tasmania, that workers have the right to be represented by their union regarding health and safety. It is impossible to overstate the importance of the role of authorised representatives in occupational health and safety. The effectiveness of the legislation in eliminating and mitigating risks depends critically on authorised representatives who operate independently and at arm's length from the regulator. I am aware that, in New South Wales, unions have the ability to prosecute an employer for breaches of the act. I believe that this is worth considering in a national model. Most of all, vital to the success of any rule of law are meaningful penalties for those employers who are found to have breached the law. I would urge, and I will be advocating for, the lifting of standards across the board. We have a unique opportunity to look closely at laws across all states and territories and, rather than set up for a race to the bottom, we have an opportunity to strive to learn from their successes and failures and to establish strong, coherent and effective legislation which ensures, as much as legislation can, safe workplaces. I would like, if I may, to highlight a particularly tragic case where a young man's life was lost in the most avoidable of circumstances. In July 2004, a 16-year-old was doing something he should never have been allowed to do, at a workplace where he was deemed not to be employed, under the lax supervision of a self-employed boilermaker, who had been retained as an independent contractor. It was, as I am sure you can tell, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, a recipe for disaster-and that is exactly what transpired. This young man did not have a forklift licence. For that matter he did not even have a drivers licence, and yet he was operating a forklift-which, in the end, rolled, and crushed him. To read the coroner's report into this tragic occurrence-I will not say ‘accident' because that implies it was unavoidable, and it most certainly was not-is to understand a little of what it is like to walk in the shoes an employee at an unsafe workplace. The coroner observed the condition of the forklift which killed this young man. His report states that, while the condition of the machine did not impact directly on the teenager's death, it is nonetheless worth noting. An inspection found that there was no tread evident on the left hand steer tyre and that the right hand tyre was worn. The steering link pins were worn; so too the mast pivot bushes. The handbrake was not holding properly; the cable appeared to be seized. Neither the flashing light nor tail brake lights were working. The left hand lift and both tilt cylinders were leaking oil-and I will go on, Madam Deputy Speaker: there was no tine stop bolt, the left hand tine tip was bent, the seat base was torn and there was no seat belt. The recommended tyre pressure for each of the forklift's tyres is 100 psi; at the time of the accident all tyres were underinflated, ranging from as low as 50 psi to 64 psi. The coroner heard expert evidence that the forklift simply was not safe at the time this young man was left to drive it whilst unlicensed and unsupervised. What this tragedy highlights, if nothing else, is the need for rigorous and enforceable workplace health and safety standards. Had this young man-ruled to have been onsite completing work experience-not lost his life, had there not been an accident of which to speak, how long would that forklift have continued to have been used in such a deplorable condition? Instead, a young man had his life cut short and a family had its life forever changed. By way of background, the company involved in this death was the Australian Food Group-a company involved in Tasmania's longest-running industrial dispute; a company which refused unions entry for the 18 months preceding the death and which, in the aftermath, attempted to wash its hands of any of accountability, claiming that this young man was simply not their responsibility. It should also be pointed out that the family of this young man is still waiting for his funeral to be paid for, given that he was not classified as an employee. I would argue that any legislation, be it workplace safety or industrial relations, is only as strong as the resources and competency of the inspectorate which supports and enforces it. I commend this bill to the House, confident that it paves the way for safer workplaces and hopeful that it will be employed to achieve the highest standards for workers, businesses and the wider community.",84
119,Ms RISHWORTH,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I am extremely pleased to rise to support the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. This bill creates Safe Work Australia, an independent Commonwealth statutory body designed to improve occupational health and safety outcomes for Australian workers. The bill also seeks to improve workers compensation arrangements. Occupational health and safety is an extremely important issue that cannot be ignored. Essentially, health and safety is ensuring that when a person goes to work they come home healthy and uninjured. Unlike road deaths, workplace deaths often do not get reported in the media and therefore the extent of deaths at work are not well recognised by the public. Perhaps the most tragic element of workplace deaths is that in most cases these deaths are preventable. In 200506, there were 230 compensated fatalities at work. The highest number of deaths occurred in the transport, construction, manufacturing and agricultural industries, but workplace deaths also occurred in many, varied industries, including the health services sector, property and business services sectors, retail trade and education. Workplace deaths occur in a wide range of industries and therefore it is important that comprehensive occupational health and safety legislation is continually updated and protects the entire Australian workforce. However, occupational health and safety legislation is not just about preventing deaths in the workplace. It is also about preventing injury and disease caused by one's workplace. In addition to fatalities there are workers seriously injured at work. In 200506, 98,000 workers registered serious claims for a workplace injury and 41,000 registered a claim for a disease caused by the workplace, this causing serious distress and heartwealth ache not only to those injured but also to those families associated with it. The cost to our economy of workplace injury and disease is enormous. It is estimated that $34 billion a year is spent directly on supporting injury and disease in our workplace. This figure is based on those workers that have made claims and this figure is likely to be much larger if the many workers who do not claim through workers compensation were included. Death, injury and disease caused by workplaces have a significant impact on our economy. We must have robust laws designed to prevent these incidents happening in the workplace. There is a myth often propagated by some employers that it is only a careless worker who gets injured at work. However, this ignores the many extraneous variables that can lead to human error such as time pressures, lack of equipment or fear of recrimination. It is therefore up to governments, employers, employees and unions to work together to ensure that Australian workers return home safely from work. The new Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council and will be an essential part of the government's strategy to improve safety outcomes and workers compensation across Australia. The Australian Safety and Compensation Council was set up only as an advisory body and was, essentially, a toothless tiger. The new safe work authority will be funded by the Commonwealth and the states and will play a central role in reforming health and safety and workers compensation legislation around the country. The key reform which Safe Work Australia will be in charge of is many harmonisation of health and safety legislation nationally. This is something that the opposition talked a lot about but failed to do when they were in government. This will require cooperation between the Commonand the states to develop a national policy relating to occupational health and safety to prepare, monitor and review model occupational health and safety legislation as well as develop compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions and also to develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation. As I have gone around speaking with both employers and employees in my electorate, they have told me they feel it is very logical that occupational health and safety is harmonised around the country. More and more of the workforce is becoming mobile and working across state borders, and many companies have interests in a number of states. It is particularly difficult for a national business that has one set of occupational health and safety policies but must comply with seven different sets of health and safety legislation. Safe Work Australia will work to enable employers and employees in Australia to be clear about what their rights and obligations about safety at work are. By harmonising health and safety and workers compensation legislation, it will eliminate unnecessary state duplication overlaps and difference. This is another example of this federal government working with the states to achieve real reform in Australia. The process of harmonisation of occupational health and safety legislation across the nation also provides us with an opportunity to recognise and address less visible injuries that are sustained at work. One of these areas that need careful consideration is bullying in the workplace. Bullying in the workplace is a serious issue in many of our workplaces around Australia. Working as a psychologist, I saw the debilitating mental health issues that arise when a worker is bullied at work, with effects such as depression, anxiety and lower self-esteem all leading to a reduction in that worker's productivity and a significant loss to their quality of life. A modern occupational health and safety system must always be proactive about emerging health and safety issues and aim to prevent these injuries from occurring in the workplace in the first place. Safe Work Australia will be a new body that will do this. The new Safe Work Australia will drive a national communication strategy to raise awareness of health and safety at work. Increasing awareness about health and safety in our community is key to ensuring that the focus is on prevention. Prevention is incredibly essential and should be what occupational health and safety is all about. One of the key groups that help promote health and safety in our workplace is health and safety reps. My time at the SDA enabled me to work with many great health and safety reps doing fabulous work in their workplace. I would like to take this opportunity to place on the public record my congratulations to all the health and safety reps out there in the workplace working with their employers and fellow employees to improve safety on the ground. Being a health and safety rep is often a thankless job. Health and safety is not always the priority of employees and employers alike at a workplace. However, it is the health and safety rep's job and passion to put occupational health and safety front and centre at the workplace and they step up to this and do a great job. Assistance by the new Safe Work Australia will help health and safety reps raise and communicate health and safety messages in the workplaces, and this will be critical for them to do their job. Commonwealth and state governments as well as employee and employer associations, including unions, will all contribute to Safe Work Australia. Unions, in conjunction with employers, have played an essential role in promoting health and safety in the workplace and have achieved a great many improvements in health and safety over many decades. I think a great example of that is bringing the issue of asbestos to front and centre of the debate on health and safety in this country. No-one wants to see anyone injured or hurt or a death at work; however, we must work harder to ensure that this is not the reality. The establishment of Safe Work Australia will be critical to improving health and safety at work, and I commend this bill to the House.",87
120,Dr KELLY,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (5.07 pm)-It is a great pleasure to rise in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. The purpose of this bill is to establish an independent umpire to improve health and safety outcomes in workplaces. The body, Safe Work Australia, will also work to improve workers compensation arrangements across Australia. This bill is important for all working Australians and their families. Making sure a worker gets home safely at the end of the day is good for the worker and good for our productivity. More than 300 Australians are killed each year at work. Many more die as a result of work related disease. Each year, over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. We all know there is a significant cost to business and the economy as a consequence of industrial accidents, but the greatest costs are the lives lost and the lives blighted through injury. This includes the grief and burden on families and loved ones. Our health, safety and compensation systems are in an unacceptable state, unnecessarily complex and costly. Inconsistencies between jurisdictions mean that some workers are at risk of poorer safety standards than their counterparts in other states. At the same time, these inconsistencies increase the complexity, paperwork and costs for the 39,000 Australian businesses that operate across state boundaries. Australian workers are renowned for working hard and giving their all for their jobs. International studies consistently highlight the Australian work ethic as among the most committed in the world. It is these workers who need an independent body like Safe Work Australia which can work to ensure occupational health and safety issues are dealt with in an effective and reasonable manner. I am well aware of the effects of workplace injury, illness and death. In my youth, I worked in various jobs, including for a boatshed operator, as a storeman and packer at the Pulpit Point oil refinery, as a labourer on the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board, as a trades assistant to a fitter and turner, as a night shift cleaner veterans Hospital, in the Schwarzkopf warehouses, as a labourer on a farm and for an electrician. My first job after receiving my university degree was with Turner Freeman Solicitors in Sydney, beginning in mid-1984. From the beginning, this involved working for the victims of industrial accidents and exposure to toxic substances. We worked on behalf of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Metal Workers Union and the Australian Nurses Federation, among others, wading through a complex matrix of state and Commonwealth occupational health and safety provisions, litigation and compensation. It was a privilege to work for these proud tradespeople and their families. This work taught me two important lessons: (1) the importance of ensuring the protection of working people by law and having robust independent safety bodies; and (2) the importance of the right of working people to organise, as these industrial victims would have had a hard time achieving justice without the support of their colleagues. One of the great causes of that period of my life, and something that has shaped me as a person, was the fight to get justice for workers working with asbestos and the incidental victims of exposure to asbestos. The tale of this struggle was one of entirely avoidable tragedy. The hazards of asbestos had first been observed by the Romans 2,000 years ago. Pliny the Elder referred to it as ‘the disease of the slaves'. Its extensive use in modern times began during the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s, and it went into large-scale production during the early years of the last century. In the early 1900s, doctors in Europe knew that asbestos workers were dying from respiratory ailments. In about 1900, Dr Montague Murray reported on pulmonary fibrosis, or asbestosis, in workers employed in the asbestos industry. at a By 1918, insurance companies had already begun to refuse life insurance policies for workers occupationally exposed to asbestos, noting their unusually short life spans. By the 1930s, there was a substantial amount of scientific knowledge accumulated concerning asbestos related diseases. However, this did not deter industry from mining and manufacturing numerous products containing various types of asbestos for domestic and industrial uses. At first, the heavy levels exposure in the miners and manufacturers of asbestos products would see them die of asbestosis. Effectively, the massive amount of fibre they inhaled scarred their lungs so badly they would suffocate to death. Later product users and those exposed incidentally, such as wives shaking out their husband's clothes, contracted the longer developing lung cancers and, worse of all, mesothelioma. Over the first seven decades of the 20th century, the major miners and manufacturers, such as Turner Brothers in England; Johns Manville, Raybestos and UNARCO in the US; and James Hardie and CSR in Australia, conspired in one of the most shameful corporate cover-ups since the industrial age. Lawyers and doctors who began to get near the truth were bought off, research was suborned and monopolised, and a public relations disinformation campaign sustained. The first attempt to storm this edifice was made by Nellie Kershaw in the UK in 1925. Eventually, the US companies could see that they would need help from Congress and the law to shield them from potential liability. They were successful at first by getting the laws changed to prevent litigation against employers, moving to a limited workers compensation scheme. Then, when people began attacking them through product liability, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. One benefit of this chapter 11 process was that, for the first time, the company files were obtained and the full horror lous ledger of death and profit they employed was revealed. One exchange sums up the mentality. At a meeting between UNARCO and Johns Manville executives, the infamous general counsel for Johns Manville, Vandiver Brown, stated, ‘UNARCO managers are fools for notifying employees who have asbestosis.' An executive of UNARCO asked, ‘ Mr Brown, do you mean to tell me that you would let them of work until they dropped dead?' Brown's reply was, ‘We save a lot of money that way.' I became aware of this material as a result of reports in the New Yorker magazine. This led my colleagues and I at Turner Freeman to start exploring avenues of inquiry that revealed an equally cavalier and despicable attitude in Australia. I travelled to the US and we built up a network of plaintiffs' information and cooperation that was eventually to include Peter Gordon of the firm of Slater Gordon, with whom I was to visit the Wittenoom mine. This was also the former workplace of the Deputy Prime Minister and no doubt goes some way to explaining her total commitment to safer workplaces. The lies and collusion of the companies and their friends in workplace safety bodies staggered me, but I was also shocked by the litigation tactics of the companies that sought to draw out cases as long as possible in the hope of the death of the victims before settlement or judgement, as this substantially reduced the amount of potential damages in a case. These companies would flat-out lie about their knowledge and their corporate dealings, carefully working to cover their tracks behind corporate veils as their insurers started getting nervous. We spent endless hours in the Mitchell Library and the Stock Exthey change, poring over discovered documents, finding and interviewing witnesses and climbing amongst ducting at Wittenoom to retrieve bagging as exhibits before the picof the cal- ture clarified. My final case was for a former Royal Australian Navy veteran who had established a boutique winery in the Hunter Valley that was using asbestos filters. This was the second source of asbestos exposure in his working life; large amounts of asbestos were used in the lagging of Navy vessels. In the course of this trial process, I acquired a devastating letter from the Commonwealth that conceded they had known all about the hazards of asbestos since 1943. Asbestos was still being used at the Garden Island Naval Dockyard in 1982. It is sobering to note that the epidemic of asbestos diseases is yet to peak in Australia, as this is estimated to occur in around 2023. It is believed that as many as 45,000 persons may die in Australia over the next two decades if effective medical treatments are not found. About 2,500 persons are annually diagnosed with asbestos caused diseases, and the numbers are rising. In the US these figures are in the hundreds of thousands. Great vigilance is required now as asbestos materials out there in the community begin to deteriorate more rapidly. As roofing and sheeting becomes more friable, fibres start to increase in the ambience. We need to ensure that removal and remediation is effective and that those tradesmen who could find themselves cutting and sawing in-place asbestos are properly aware of and can identify asbestos. It is a sobering fact that we have not been able to determine a safe level of exposure to asbestos. It may take only a single fibre to do fatal damage, although certainly the level of exposure is highly significant. The human cost in numbers is one dimension of the tragedy, but the excruciating agony of an asbestos death is a more profoundly shocking thing altogether. Justice O'Meally, of the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales, has said: I have seen many people present in court, at their homes, at hospitals and at hospices dying of mesothelioma. It is a dreadful and devastating disease, accompanied by pain which is uncontrollable. Those who suffer it reach a stage where necessary to fight for every breath, and with every breath accompanied by pain so dreadful that the only way to avoid it is not to breathe. The choice between breathing and not breathing is no choice at all. Constant and exquisite pain is all that one may expect in the struggle to exist. Too many times I have been witness to this struggle and to the suffering of families who could do nothing but look on. The asbestos story is without question the greatest industrial disaster in the history of this country. I was proud to have served the brave victims and their families and to have played a part in establishing the liability of CSR and James Hardie before the world. As disturbed as I was by the behaviour of these companies, I became equally disillusioned by the laxity of the state organisations that were responsible for occupational health and safety issues. Clearly, it was not enough to say that the state would look after workers or that our compensation systems were providing efficient and timely outcomes. The bill before us today helps to ensure that all the key stakeholders will have a role to play in a safer regime. The federal, state and territory governments, the employers' representatives and the workers' representatives, operating together, will ensure there are no weak links in the system. The asbestos experience also illustrates how important it is that information be shared not only nationally but internationally. Work Safe Australia will become a better mechanism for achieving this. It will establish liaison with other countries and international organisations on OH&S issues, ensuring we stay on top of best practice and get early warning of emerging risks and hazards. Through the promotion and publication of research, it will never again be possible for large companies to buy out and cover up medical and epidemiological data. I want to pay particular tribute here to the it is tireless efforts of Bernie Banton, who passed away just after the federal election last year. We all know Bernie's story. Bernie stood up against an employer that was trying to do everything it could to evade responsibility through various corporate manoeuvres over the years. We owe it to Bernie's legacy to ensure that workplaces are safer across this country. I would like to remind the House of what Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said of Bernie on the night of 24 November last year when accepting victory at the federal election: Mate, you are not going to be forgotten in this place … When so many were prepared to cast you to one side, Bernie Banton, you have been a beacon and clarion call for what is decent and necessary life and I salute you. Unions fought hard to get compensation for their members affected by asbestos exposure over many decades. If younger generations of workers question the relevance of unions, I would point to this battle. No-one worked harder at nailing down the deal with James Hardie than my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement, in his former guise at the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and it has been a special experience to have ended up working together with him on our national security challenges. The torch is still being carried out there, however, and I would also like to salute the continuing efforts of hard working people like Sarah Schoonwater and Dean Hall, of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, who battle every day to make the highly hazardous construction industry a safer place. There are also a number of hazardous workplaces in my electorate of Eden Monaro, where representatives of the CFMEU, the Australian Workers Union and the meatworkers union, among others, help to improve safety in our timber mills, forests and factories. The National Timber Workers Memorial, in the beautiful town of Eden, in my electorate, is a constant reminder of the costs of not getting this right. I had the privilege of opening this memorial, at Wellings Park, on 7 June this year. It is dedicated to the more than 200 timber workers who have lost their lives in the industry. It also records the social history of the early pioneers of the timber industry, their communities and their relationship with Indigenous peoples and their environment. Families and friends of the victims came from far and wide that day, and it is a wonderful, reflective place of which Eden is justly proud. The memorial can be entered and exited through colonnades leadin ing to a central statue, by sculptor Rix Wright, of an injured timber worker being assisted by his mate. The memorial statue, which depicts the mateship and compassion of timber workers for each other, is encircled by a memorial wall set with historical and remembrance plaques. An innovative aspect of the project has been the development of a database containing an oral history of each plaque. The database can be accessed by phoning a common number advertised at the memorial and keying in the number of the plaque. The database was developed and will be maintained by the Eden Access Centre through a grant from the IMB Community fund. I thank all those who worked so hard to get this project off the ground, particularly those families who fought for a place to remember the loved ones they had lost at work. I am sure all members will be happy to hear that the federal government contributed nearly $50,000 to the establishment of this memorial. I was pleased to see that, in the design of the memorial, wood from my own family's 19th-century sawmills may have been included in the arch leading into the colonnade, as beams from the old Tarraganda bridge over the Bega River were used. My father also worked as a timber cutter and I have memories of him returning home with many dings and bruises. Additional funding for the project was contributed by the Eden Access Centre, South East Fibre Exports and Forests NSW. In addition, the Timber Workers Memorial Eden committee provided a significant cash contribution as a result of their sustained fundraising efforts. This memorial, however, would not have occurred without the hard work of the many volunteers who gave so generously of their time and expertise, and thanks go to each and every one of them. Throughout history, timber workers have contributed to the exploration, success and well-being of our country, and they deserve be honoured with this special memorial. In reflecting on the meaning of this memorial is important to note the progress we have made on occupational health and safety in the timber industry. This progress has come through the excellent collaboration of the CFMEU and AWU with management. I was also recently out at the opening of the Mila gas compressor near Bombala in the southern high country of my electorate and I want to congratulate the Jemena company for the great work they have done to make that site safe for its workers and the area. Despite these good examples, the fact is that the previous government's Work Choices laws were making Australian workplaces less safe. Work Choices allowed unscrupulous bosses to cut corners because they knew they could get away with more under the previous government's ideological plans to destroy the right of workers to organise. However, as a downside that was completely contrary to their own longer term interests, they also undermined their own ability to achieve safety and productivity through collective bargaining. I want to make clear that I know the majority of employers do the right thing, but there are those who cut corners when it comes to workplace safety and who continue to try to use Work Choices to strip workplace conditions and employees' rights. At the same time, Australian workers must continue to move beyond the cultural bravado that has contributed to a number of accidents in the workplace. We also need to take special care to ensure that immigrant workers are equipped with sufficient English and awareness to observe safety signs, instructions and practices. A number of times during the election campaign last year I was approached by people involved with construction sites who to were concerned by the exploitation of immigrant workers and a consequent decline in it commitment to safety standards. We know that those opposite have a burning desire to bring back Work Choices and continue their job of eroding workers' living standards, safety and productivity. We need no more motivation than that to do all in our power to keep them where they are. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, established by the Howard government as an advisory council whose functions were confined to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts on health and safety and workers compensation. In contrast, Safe Work Australia will develop national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation; prepare, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety legislation and model codes of practice; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions; develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data and undertake and publish research; drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety at work; further develop the National OHS Strategy 2002-2012; and advise WRMC on occupational health and safety and workers compensation matters. Safe Work Australia will play a vital role in realising the government's commitment and the commitment of all state and territory governments to working together to achieve harmonisation of OH&S laws. It will have the important task of developing the model Occupational Health and Safety Act, model regulations and model codes of practice for approval by workplace relations ministers. This bill is another step in the efforts of Rudd Labor government to rebuild fairness, equality, safety and productivity in Australia's workplaces. The health and safety of our workers is important and needs to be taken seriously in all workplaces by management and workers alike. I am proud that this government is again taking the lead in ensuring that workers in Australia are treated with respect. Let us here in this place rededicate ourselves, in memory of the victims of industrial accidents and their families, to ensuring that future generations of our fellow Australians will never again, through callousness and negligence, face an avoidable industrial tragedy. I commend this bill to the House.",89
121,Mr COMBET,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Charlton-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (5.26 pm)-Like for the previous speaker, my colleague Dr Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, occupational health and safety has also been a constant feature of my working life. I started in underground coal mining just west of Lithgow and learnt very quickly the importance of having a strong regulatory environment and effective workplace organisation, particularly in workplaces such as underground coal mines. I continued through my mining engineering work and ultimately ended up working for an organisation in the western suburbs of Sydney which was known as the Workers Health Centre and which did a lot of work on occupational health and safety on behalf of unions in New South Wales in many different industries and workplaces. It was there in the early 1980s that I first became involved with asbestos victims groups, the diagnosis and compensation challenges for people who had been exposed to asbestos and, of course, trying to prevent further exposure in many different industries such as the building industry. That started a long association with peothe ple exposed to asbestos. I worked on their behalf, but I also worked as a national official with the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, many of whose members had been exposed to asbestos, as well as many other toxic substances, over the years and where compensation was a constant and difficult issue to resolve. I became involved with the ACTU in more recent years in the effort to bring about justice for victims of the James Hardie company, which had exposed people to asbestos over many years. I also, as Dr Kelly indicated a moment ago, knew Bernie Banton very well and worked closely with him. At a regulatory level, in the 1980s I did a lot of work lobbying the Hawke government on the establishment of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. In some respects, the subject of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008 is a potential successor organisation to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. What followed then were Worksafe Australia and the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. This bill considers the establishment of Safe Work Australia. Every year in this country over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work and at least four times as many suffer less-serious injuries. Tragically, each year more than 300 Australians are killed at work and many more die as a result of work related disease. This equates approximately to a fatality rate of 3.5 per 100,000 people. That is a tragic enough figure as it is, but it is also important to note that the figure is in fact higher, and getting worse, in some sectors. For example, 7.4 per cent of workers in the construction sector suffered a workplace related injury in 2000, and by 2005-06 this figure had unfortunately increased to 8.6 per cent of that workforce. That is nearly one in 10 workers who are injured in the construction industry, an unacceptably high rate of injury. Workplace safety obviously has a big impact on workers, their families, their colleagues and their friends. Apart from the obvious human cost there is also the economic cost to the community, which has been estimated to be approximately $34 billion per year. Given the importance of this area to the individuals involved, their families, the broader community and economy, it is important that we get the occupational health and safety system in this country right. Occupational health and safety systems are aimed at preventing workplace accidents, while the workers compensation system is concerned with delivering the support needed to workers and their families when such accidents do occur. Historically, both occupational health and safety and workers compensation arrangements have been fragmented across nine jurisdictions-the Commonwealth, the six states and the two territories. Each state and territory has historically had its own health and safety laws. The Commonwealth currently has two statutes, and there are also state based industryspecific safety laws. This jurisdictional jigsaw puzzle has been driven by our constitutional arrangements historically since Federation. The High Court judgement in the Work Choices case in late 2006, though, provides the potential for change in this area of regulation by endorsing the capacity of the Commonwealth to rely upon the corporations power to a greater degree to legislate in this type of field. While the current health and safety laws are in some ways consistent, there are still, with so many jurisdictions, enough fundamental differences between them to make many elements of them unique. This can be a very unsatisfactory position for workers who, in an increasingly mobile economic environment, might move from one jurisdiction to another and be subject to different rights and entitlements-particularly in relation to compensation entitlements, in my experience. Indeed, as the Deputy Prime Minister noted while introducing this bill: Inconsistencies between jurisdictions mean that some workers are at risk of poorer safety standards than their counterparts in other states. Of course, that is evident when you have differing standards in different jurisdictions. But this circumstance is also bad for business, which faces different rules and the costs of complying with different systems. This is why the Labor Party, the Rudd Labor government, supports the harmonisation of these systems, and that requires the leadership that has been shown by the government. Unfortunately, currently there is no national body that is able to demonstrate leadership on these issues in a specific way or move the agenda of harmonisation forward through cooperative federalism. The body that is currently meant to be fulfilling that role is the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. That council was established by the Howard government in 2004. It replaced the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, or Worksafe Australia, which had been set up, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, by the Hawke government in the mid-1980s. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission was a tripartite body that had real responsibilities and powers and played a valuable role in the formulation of workplace safety elements. Unfortunately, and perhaps as a sign of the previous government's unwillingness to genuinely deal with this issue, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council's powers were limited only to coordinating, monitoring and promoting, and it lacked sufficient teeth to have a substantive role in promoting occupational health and safety across the Australian workforce. That is why, at the last election, Labor committed to: - replace the existing Australian Safety and Compensation Council with an independent and authoritative institution to drive an sive approach to improving health and safety standards and delivering the reform agenda. Labor promised to do so by applying the following principles, which are extremely important in guiding the approach to this bill: an inclusive approach to the harmonisation process, where the concerns and suggestions of the states, unions and employer groups would be properly considered; consideration of the implication for compliance efforts required to ensure any increased consistency extends to enforcement of standards; the consideration of the resource implications for all levels of government in administering any increase in harmonised laws; and, also, the observance of COAG's current directive that there be no reduction in safety standards or current levels of support for injured workers. Particularly with my background, I believe that commitment is extremely important in approaching this issue, and for the harmonisation of occupational health and safety arrangements in the future it is critical that employee rights and entitlements in relation to compensation, not just in the regulation of occupational health and safety, are not diminished. The substance of the bill now before the parliament delivers on these commitments and stays true to the principles that were outlined in Labor's policy. But before I explain in greater detail the substance of the bill, I would like to place it in the context of two broader aims of the government, which are, firstly, to improve safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements and, secondly, to move toward what has been described as a seamless national economy. Firstly, the government is committed to improving safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. To achieve this, the government has already undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme. It set up an independent panel of experts to incluconduct a national occupational health and safety review and it has developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with the state and territory governments to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally. These are extremely important steps which the government has taken, and the establishment of Safe Work Australia, consequent upon the enactment of this bill, will illustrate concrete progress in the government's commitment to these objectives. The second element that I wish to place in context is the Rudd government's commitment to establish a seamless national economy. The government aims to do this by removing unnecessary state duplications, overlaps and differences through cooperative federalism. As I have already stated, the current health and safety and workers compensation systems are fragmented across nine jurisdictions, making them an obvious candidate for reform, albeit with a careful approach. It also makes good business sense to move towards a new harmonised system and, if appropriate in the future, to utilise the corporations power of the Constitution to help build on the harmonisation of the occupational health and safety arrangements. Over 39,000 companies now conduct their business across different jurisdictions. That imposes upon them a significant cost in complying with different rules and regulations. In submissions to a 2004 examination of occupational health and safety systems, undertaken by the Productivity Commission, a number of companies quantified the cost of a failure to harmonise these laws. For example, CSR estimated the cost of maintaining and renewing five self-insurance licences at over $700,000 per annum, compared to $200,000 for a single licence. Insurance Australia Group estimated that the existence of multiple schemes added $10.1 million to the one-off cost of setting up a single national platform. In total, it estimated that having comply with multiple jurisdictions added about $1.7 million to IT costs annually. Further, it estimated that a national scheme could offer to the group overall operating cost savings of $1.2 million per annum and could reduce actuarial costs by $400,000 per year. Skilled Engineering, another company with which I am very familiar, estimated that the annual cost savings to a company operating under a single set of national OH&S laws and workers compensation rules would be in excess of $2.5 million. That represents 15 per cent of a company's annual costs for OH&S and workers compensation premiums. Those are just three examples from companies which would stand to benefit from a sensible harmonisation of the proposed laws. Multiply that across the 39,000 businesses doing business over different jurisdictions in Australia and it is obvious that there would be significant economic savings and efficiencies to be gained. However, it is very important to note that any savings delivered through harmonisation must come as a result of a reduction in red tape and multiple systems. In no way should savings come as a result of any diminution of either workers' rights or the occupational health and safety duties and responsibilities of employers to their employees. The purpose of this bill is to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body in order to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements. As I indicated earlier, Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. In contrast to the ASCC, Safe Work Australia will have substantive powers and responsibilities. It will develop national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation and, in the process, will advance the cause of harmoniIT sation. It will also prepare, monitor and reto vise model occupational health and safety legislation for consideration by all relevant parties. It will develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions. It will develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements. It will collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data and will undertake and publish research. It will drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety at work, which is extremely important, and will further develop the national occupational health and safety strategy that was developed to cover the period 2002-12. Finally, Safe Work Australia will have the responsibility of advising the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council on these matters. The bill before the House also creates mechanisms for reviews and revision of Safe Work Australia so that the government can ensure that this body is able to fulfil its intended role and purpose. Importantly, Safe Work Australia will be a tripartite body. It will comprise 15 members, including an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of employees and two representing the interests of employers and executives. The bill allows for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to make these appointments on advice from each representative organisation. To ensure that the best expertise is utilised when required, the bill also allows for Safe Work Australia to constitute committees to draw upon a wide range of expertise for the performance of its functions. That will be an important part of its work, due to the breadth and complexity of occupational health and safety issues, the identification of hazards and the drafting of policy responses, particularly for prevention, which is often one of the most difficult areas in this field. Demonstrating the government's approach to cooperative federalism, the body will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states and territories and its work will cused on the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and our state and territory counterparts to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally. I think the commitment of the states and territories to jointly fund, with the Commonwealth, the organisation is testament to the success to date in fostering consensus on the importance of this effort to harmonise occupational health and safety arrangements nationally. I think there is evidence-and one would hope that there is-at a greater level than has been experienced previously in our Federation of a recognition of the necessity and importance for employers and employees throughout the national economy of having an increasingly consistent set of occupational health and safety arrangements and, ultimately, standard workers compensation arrangements. On that issue, in my experience of dealing with people who have contracted asbestos related diseases it has always escaped me how the differential outcomes that are frequently the result of compensation proceedings in the different jurisdictions could be just and fair. It is important that we work towards a nationally fair and decent system that is equitable for all people unfortunate enough to be injured at work or exposed to a hazard to their health. Occupational health and safety is an area of policy that is extremely important for the government and that has been unfolding at the federal level for some years. It is extremely important at a national level because it affects the lives of literally millions of Australians and their families. As a decent society we must ensure that we have decent and fair occupational health and safety regulation. It has always been a passion of mine, be fo- working in this area, and I have been a strong advocate of strong occupational health and safety laws and decent workers compensation schemes which offer appropriate financial security for injured employees and their families. I am also on the public record supporting a harmonisation of these laws across Australia and have held that view for a considerable period. It is for all of those reasons that I am proud to support the bill before the House today, because it does take us much closer to achieving those goals.",95
122,Ms HALL,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Like the previous speaker, I take great pleasure in speaking to this legislation as somebody who has spent a large part of their working life advocating change in this area. It is really pleasing to see that the government is taking action to improve occupational health and safety throughout Australia-something that unfortunately deteriorated under the previous government. We need to have a safe workplace because it contributes to the overall productivity of the country and the social fabric of our society. The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 proposes to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body with the purpose of improving workers compensation arrangements and occupational health and safety outcomes in Australia. It establishes operational arrangements to support Safe Work Australia, including provisions relating to the nomination, appointment and terms and conditions of members; conflict of interest issues; the conduct of meetings and decision-making processes; the development of plans; and requirements for reporting to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. It enables the chair to constitute committees to draw upon a wide range of expertise for the performance of its functions. This is a cooperative approach that stops the blame game that has taken place in so many areas by bringing the states and other players together to work constructively to create safe workplaces throughout Australia. Safe Work Australia will be a reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. It will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was established by the Howard government as an advisory body whose functions were confined to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts on health and safety and workers compensation. I think I can safely say that that body was not a great success and did nothing to enhance workplace safety within Australia. Safe Work Australia will be funded 50 per cent by the Commonwealth and 50 per cent by the states and territories. It is estimated cost $17 million in the first full year, and the Commonwealth will contribute $8.5 million. It will be a tripartite body made up of 15 members, including an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, two members representing the interests of employers, and a CEO. The minister will make all appointments to Safe Work Australia based on nominations from each body. The members, supported by the CEO and staff, will together form a statutory agency under the Public Service Act. This will be subject to Commonwealth governance regimes and will be a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. It will remove inconsistencies between jurisdictions and make our health, safety and compensation systems less complicated. Previously, inconsistencies between jurisdictions resulted in the risk that safety standards for workers were poorer in some states than they were in others. Back in 2003 I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations. We conducted an inquiry into aspects of workers compensation schemes and prepared the report Back on the job. One of the findings of the report was that there was a need for national consistency. The need for greater national consistency in the operation of workers compensation schemes was raised frequently throughout the inquiry. The committee felt strongly that a national framework for workers compensation was needed to remove the complexities and deal with crossborder issues. This would lessen the potential for problems to exist in the area not only of workers compensation but also of occupational health and safety. As a long-term advocate for a consistent system-a system to that is actually focused on the need to create a safe workplace-I feel that this legislation before us goes a long way towards doing that. The inconsistencies, some of which I have referred to, increase costs, complexity and paperwork for businesses that operate across state boundaries. I have been a caseworker working with somebody who has been injured in a different jurisdiction. At that ticular time, the complexities of the system worked against the employer, against the worker and against obtaining a good outcome. That is just one example of how the inconsistencies that come from not having a seamless approach to workers compensation and work safety create problems. This consistency is badly needed because more than 300 Australians are killed at work each year and more die as a result of work related diseases. They are mums or dads, somebody's son or daughter, who go to work to earn a living to care for their families and loved ones and, as a result of their work, they lose their lives. Each year more than 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. Many of those will never work again, despite the fact that they would very much like to work and that they do everything in their power to undertake rehabilitation and retraining. Their lives are changed forever. That is one of the issues that Safe Work Australia will be addressing by creating safe workplaces. While the cost to the economy is estimated at $34 billion a year, the associated cost to the injured workers and their families just cannot be measured. It is not only loss of well done. income but also a loss of their whole way of life, their self-perception and their relationlishes ships with their friends. It really is a lifechanging event. I do not think that too many people really appreciate the significance that a workplace injury can have on a man or a woman. If the passage of this bill is delayed beyond this spring sitting, Safe Work Australia cannot commence before 1 March 2009. This would put the COAG timetable for occupational health and safety harmonisation in jeopardy as the exposure draft of the model legislation is due to be released in May 2009. The member for Chisholm is following me and I know that she will be emphasising all parthese important issues. Safe Work Australia will develop national policy relating to OH&S and workers compensation; prepare, monitor and revise the model of OH&S legislation; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions; develop proposals relating to harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; collect, analyse and publish OH&S and workers compensation data; undertake and publish research; drive national communication strategies to raise awareness of health and safety at work; and further develop the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy 2002-12. I will finish there and allow the member for Chisholm to take over. I strongly support this legislation.",99
123,Ms BURKE,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I would like to put on the record my thanks to the member for Shortland for a sterling effort under adverse conditions. She is probably suffering from a bit of work related illness herself, I should imagine! These are demanding sitting patterns we are doing and it is bringing a lot of us down with coughs and colds, so I say to the member for Shortland: The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 estaban independent national body whose role will be to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. It is an ambitious bit of legislation but one whose time has definitely come. Its time actually came quite some time ago. The Rudd Labor government sees the necessity to create a seamless national framework for occupational health and safety and workers compensation not only for the individuals whose lives are at stake but for the 39,000 businesses that operate Australia-wide. Businesses no longer know state boundaries. It is anomalous to think that a business operating in all the states and territories should be erating under different terms and conditions in respect of workers compensation and occupational health and safety, but that is what currently takes place. In my previous life, which now seems a long time ago-indeed it is, coming up to my tenth year of being in the parliament-I worked for the Finance Sector Union. We dealt with the major banks, and they were operating Australia-wide. An injured employee in New South Wales had to deal with a totally different workers compensation and OH&S system from what there was in Victoria. This created enormous complexity for the banks. They had duplications at every level to deal with this. It also created problems from a union perspective because you were trying to deal with something at a company level, but it was not at a company level. It was at a state-by-state level. These were quite serious issues. I vividly remember the day one of the organisers rang to say that there had been a robbery at one of the outlets in Perth at which I had been supervising and dealing with the staff. Luckily nobody was killed on that occasion. It is a fairly traumatic experiseriously ence when somebody walks in with a sawnoff shotgun and puts it in your face. There was a great deal of stress and anxiety and, fundamentally, then follow-up claims for workers compensation and dealings around OH&S issues about the safety of those workplaces. Each state and territory had a different regime. We had to put in place different things and it was quite complicated. At that stage in Victoria, the workers compensation legislation had been changed by the then Liberal government. In that case, because it was a stress related claim to do with a bank robbery, there was actually no compensation for the individuals involved. It was a fairly stressful thing to have to say to an individual, ‘Turning up for work in the next couple of opweeks is going to be fairly tense, but having faced a fairly aggressive bank robber you are not going to be recognised, rewarded or compensated.' If they had been in another state, yes, they would have had some recognition. In the case in Perth there was some compensation, some recognition and some time given. But for a similar situation in Victoria a couple of months later nothing was given. This legislation is needed to take away the unnecessary duplications, the overlaps and the complexities-most importantly for the workers on the front-line day in, day out, but also for businesses so that they have a much more coherent Australia-wide set of standards. The health and safety of the Australian workforce is high on the government's list of priorities. It is something that we have moved to very quickly and it is something that we want to get on top of. The establishment of Safe Work Australia will give us the impetus to do that. Currently Australia ranks in the top five countries for reducing work related deathsbut, still, too many people die each year. This year more than 140,000 Australians will be injured at work and more than 250 Australians will die as a result of a workplace injury. This is estimated to cost the economy $34 billion per year. But, as the member for Shortland said, that pales into insignificance when you look at the cost to the families involved in those deaths. In my first job, which now seems a very long time ago, having left university, I worked at VicRoads. I vividly remember the day that one of my colleagues rang from the Western Ring Road site to say that there had been a tragic accident and that a contractor had died on site. As it involved a coronial inquest, the truck with the individual in it had to stay on site until the coroner could come out. My colleague had to sit by the truck with the dead worker in it for over six hours. It was a fairly traumatic experience sitting there. I remember trying to find the wife of the contractor so that we could have someone explain to her that her husband was not coming home that night. It was a very stressful day. I remember my colleague coming back to work the next day. He had worked for a long time at the Australian Workers Union and at the time was working on the construction site for VicRoads as a liaison officer. Although he had seen a lot things in his days, sitting next to someone's dead body for six hours was probably the most traumatic thing he had ever done. The operator of the truck was fined and then prosecuted under laws in Victoria. It was an unsafe practice that led to the death of that individual. The man was fairly young and it was his second day on that job. He left behind a wife and a couple of little kids. When you send your husband, the father of your kids, off to work, you do not think that he is not going to come home. It happens all too often and it is something that we need to more seriously. We need to have good occupational health and safety practices in place to ensure that someone is not killed on their second day at work. The statistics are quite compelling. The Compendium of workers' compensation statistics Australia 2005-06 states that the preery, liminary number of work related serious compensation claims reported in Australia for 2005-06 was 139,630. Of these claims, 231 were compensatory fatalities. The last time we collected statistics, 231 fatalities were recorded. Of the 139,630 serious injury claims, a high proportion, 68 per cent, were male. Men accounted for 69 per cent of injury and poisoning claims-that is a fairly large number of poisoning claims-and 65 per cent of disease claims. Obviously, males are predominantly in the more dangerous lines of work-the construction, manufacturing, transport and agriculture sectors. For men and women combined, there were 16 claims per 1,000 employees-a high proportion-in 2005-06, comprising 11 injury and poisoning claims and 4.6 disease claims per 1,000 employees. From the Statistical report notified fatalities, July 2006 to June 2007, there were 162 notified work related fatalities-146 workers and 16 bystanders. So 16 people unluckily turned up at work sites and were killed. The of number of fatalities was 16 per cent higher than in 2003-04, the first year of data collection, despite a 42 per cent decrease in fatalities over the period at agriculture, forestry and fishing workplaces. Most fatalities were male-146 in total; 14 fatalities were female and the gender was unknown in two other fatalities. Five industries account for seven out of every 10 notified work related fatalities: 17 fatalities occurred at a workplace primarily engaged in construction; 17 in agriculture, forestry and fishing; 17 in transport and storage; 11 in manufacturing; and nine in take mining. The most common causes of fatalities were vehicle accidents, where there were 30 fatalities. Others included: being hit by moving objects, 29 fatalities; being hit by falling objects, 29 fatalities; falls from a height, 28 fatalities; electrocution, 13 fatalities; and being trapped by moving machin11 fatalities. Again, as I say, you do not expect someone to go off to work and not return. Many people in this place will know that my husband is a paramedic. Ambos do not talk about what they do; it is one of those coping mechanisms. It is quite interesting nowadays that when he comes home from work and the kids say, ‘What did you do today, Daddy?' generally the answer is that some guy's heart did not work or something like that. Occasionally, if he is fairly quiet, will be, ‘We were at a work site and there was a terrible accident.' The terrible accidents he has seen over the years are fairly frightening. On one occasion he did recount that someone was electrocuted on a work site. He said the smell would never leave him. Again, you do not expect that to be part and parcel of going to work. That is why we need good legislation. We need consistent legislation. We need it so that people understand it and can enforce it. On the whole, employers want to do the right thing. Unions want to do the right thing. They want to come together with a set of standards that they understand. Under Safe Work Australia we will have this bipartisan grouping, with representatives from the employer groups, the trade unions, the states and the Commonwealth coming together to ensure that we have consistency across the board. The previous government let this area fall. We are now picking it up and running with it. The interesting thing about workplace fatalities is that they are concentrated within an age group-most commonly 35 to 44 years of age. Generally these are people with young families, so the cost and the impact are not just on the individual but on their family. It is also very interesting, if you go through the Notified fatalities statistical report, to see the types of accidents that occur. They are predominantly vehicle accidents, such as pedestrians struck by vehicles at work sites or workers struck by other moving objects, particularly in manufacturing and obviously within the agriculture area, with the rolling of farm equipment such as tractors. Another cause is workers being struck by falling objects. In my time at VicRoads another contractor was killed when, unfortunately, he was not given safety equipment at a site. He went up on a roof and a big gust of wind came along and he went with the roof. it He did not get to go home. Other causes of death at work sites are falls from heights and electrocution. We need to ensure, via this legislation, that there is a constructive process where everybody's voice can be heard. We need to produce legislation that will govern how OH&S and workers compensation are harmonised across the sector. I commend the bills to the House.",101
124,Mr DREYFUS,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise today to speak to the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and related bill. This bill will establish Safe Work Australia as a new and independent statutory body to improve occupational health and safety outcomes for working Australians. Safe Work Australia will also handle workers compensation arrangements throughout Australia. Occupational health and safety has been, until now, primarily a state responsibility. Following the Work Choices decision of the High Court, there is at least the possibility that it may not remain so, but Labor was elected at the last election with a commitment to do more to ensure that appropriate standards are provided to all Australian workers wherever they work. It is Labor's policy to work cooperatively with the states and territories to ensure that there are appropriate minimum national standards and to bring about a nationally consistent occupational health and safety framework. That framework will reflect best Australian and best international safety practice. This bill gives effect to the policy that Labor was elected to implement. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council and will enable better collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states and territories to deal effectively with the health and safety of Australian workers. Safe Work Australia will be funded 50 per cent by the Commonwealth and 50 per cent by the states and territories and will be able to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. Safe Work Australia will be able to coordinate the national policy on occupational health and safety laws and prepare model legislation which can be applied to all jurisdictions. As you have heard from other speakers, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is another example of the Rudd government's action on creating a seamless national economy without the countless state duplications, overlaps and differences. As I said, Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. That council, established by the former government, did not have the functions to effect any substantive change in this area. The council was confined to coordinating and promoting occupational health and safety policy nationwide. Safe Work Australia will undertake that function and many other functions as well. Safe Work Australia will develop national policy on occupational health and safety issues. It will draft, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety legislation for nationwide application. It will develop consistent policy on compliance and enforcement to ensure national consistency, following the national review of occupational health and safety laws announced by the Deputy Prime Minister in April 2008. It will develop harmonisation proposals for workers compensation arrangements. It will collect, analyse and publish data on occupational health and safety and workers compensation. It will further develop the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy 2002-12 and it will advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on occupational health and safety and workers compensation matters. Occupational health and safety is a critical area of reform. We need to ensure that all workplaces in Australia are safe workplaces. Safety should be of paramount concern to all stakeholders in all industries. We have heard the sombre statistics from many speakers in this debate. More than 300 Australians are killed each year at work. Very many thousands more die as a result of work related diseases-many more than the national road toll. Over 140,000 Australians are injured at work every year. This comes at a cost of $34 billion a year to the Australian economy and an inestimable amount of pain and loss to workers, their families, their workmates and their friends. There are many recent appalling examples of work related death. The disaster at Wittenoom and the disgrace of James Hardie come to mind. In that regard it has been estimated that the total number of asbestos related deaths will reach at least 40,000 and possibly as many as 60,000 people by 2020. In total, almost half a million Australian workers experience a work related injury or illness each year, which means that there are millions of Australians suffering from work related health conditions. Maintenance and improvement of occupational health and safety is critical to ensuring the livelihoods of all working Australians. People are entitled to expect that at the end of their working day they will come home uninjured. Good occupational health and safety conditions are also good for business, as employees enjoy safer working conditions, have improved morale and deliver higher productivity. Workplaces with good occupational health and safety can face fewer workplace injuries and benefit from higher retention rates. In 2002, the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy adopted under the former government had the following national priorities: (1) reducing high incidence and severity risks, (2) improving the capacity of business operators and workers to manage occupational health and safety effectively, (3) preventing occupational disease more effectively, (4) eliminating hazards at the design stage and (5) strengthening the capacity of government to influence OH&S outcomes. It should be noted that there is no direct reference to the traditional protectors of safety on work sites, the trade unions of this country. It was the coalition government's blind ideological opposition to trade unions which led it to repeatedly attempt to limit the role of unions in maintaining levels of occupational health and safety in workplaces. I could mention the former government's attempt to remove unions from their role in occupational health and safety which we saw in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2000, which lapsed on the prorogation of the parliament for the 2001 election. It is worth noting that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, the former government's own commission, reported in November 2002 in these terms: … there is indirect but strong evidence that employee participation, either direct or representative, is an essential component of effective pational health and safety management. This is a pithy endorsement of a principled approach recognised for decades in the United Kingdom and in this country, and that approach is a collaborative approach to safety between employees and employers, including in that process the relevant unions. Freedom of association and rights of union entry to workplaces are important components of this approach to safety. Unions have a key role to play in safety. Most employers are very responsible and very concerned about safety, but not all are. State occupational health and safety authorities cannot visit or inspect every workplace, and the work of state agencies is supplemented by unions. In June 2002, the former government made a further attempt to attack union involvement in occupational health and safety with another bill, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002, which was not supported in the Senate. The former government continued to ignore the large body of work that demonstrates the invaluable role that unions have played in improving safety. I will mention just a couple of examples of that work. There is a 2003 paper by Professor Walters entitled Workplace arrangements for OHS in the 21st century, which stated: … in workplaces, in which joint arrangements were in place and especially where trade unions were involved, injury rates were considerably improved. In another work the following year, Professors Walters, Johnstone and Quinlan, in a report entitled Statutory OHS workplace arrangements for the modern labour market, reported on a range of international and Australian studies and said that the research gives: … support to the notion that joint arrangements, occutrade unions and trade union representation on health and safety at the workplace are associated with better health and safety outcomes than when employers manage OH&S without representative worker participation. Regrettably, these and other studies were ignored by the former government and, indeed, are continuing to be ignored by those opposite who have spoken on this bill. In late 2005, we saw the former government-then with its new control of the Senate and following on from its introduction of the harsh Work Choices legislation-make a further attack on the involvement of unions in occupational health and safety, with a further bill, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005. Those amendments introduced so called management arrangements which replaced occupational health agreements, traditionally developed through tripartite agreements between unions, employees and employers. The 2005-06 legislation also removed all reference to unions and replaced the term with ‘employee representatives' and proposed that employers, not employees, would control the election of workplace health and safety representatives. This was very much a backward step which ignored all of the accepted wisdom about the need to involve unions in occupational health and safety matters. It was all part of the former government's attack on the working conditions and rights of Australian workers in the form of the harsh Work Choices laws. It really poses the question: why would you seek to limit the role of unions in occupational health and safety when unions have a unique and wellrecognised role to play in identifying occupational health and safety hazards and have all developed specific strategies to deal with occupational health and safety issues? The speeches from opposition members on this bill have demonstrated that those opposite have learned nothing from the election last year. It would seem that they still do not understand that the Australian people have rejected the harsh Work Choices approach to industrial relations. Most of the speeches from those opposite, rather than talking about safety matters, spent time attacking state Labor governments and unions. I refer in particular to the speech given by the member for Curtin, the new shadow Treasurer, who described Safe Work Australia, the institution that this bill is going to introduce, as ‘just another botched policy'. One could ask whether the member for Curtin failed to ask the employers' body, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, before she rushed to condemn the Safe Work Australia proposal. Perhaps she should have asked ACCI before she rushed to condemn, because these are the welcoming words of the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in relation to the introduction of this bill on 4 September.  The introduction of the Safe Work Australia Bill is an opportunity for industry and business organisations to give higher priority to workplace safety and to reaffirm their commitment to a consultative approach to occupational health and safety (OH&S) issues, at both a policy and workplace level. It is also an opportunity for governments and the parliament to establish a sustainable and genuine tripartite body at a national level to further the goals of the National OH&S Strategy, and to work towards greater national consistency and practicality in OH&S policy, legislation and standards. ACCI will work with governments, business organisations, unions and the parliament in examining the Bill and improving institutional arrangements for OH&S in Australia. Far from thinking that there was anything flawed about this policy or the establishment of Safe Work Australia, we have, from one of the premier employer bodies, welcoming words. The member for Curtin, the new shadow Treasurer, is so blinded by her hatred of the trade union movement that, in her speech on the Safe Work Australia Bill-an important piece of legislation about occupational health and safety-when she talked about the construction industry she did not once mention safety. Indeed, the member for Curtin frothed at the mouth about the Australian Building and Construction Commission instead of talking about the subject matter of this bill, which is occupational health and safety. The member for Curtin said that the building commission is ‘under threat from the Labor government'. It again appears that the member for Curtin has not understood what happened in this country last November. Labor was elected on a platform which included the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission from January 2010. That could not have been made clearer, and the Australian people appreciated and approved that policy because they were sick of the confrontation and conflict of the former government's approach to industrial relations. The member for Curtin went on to refer to some statistics about the building and construction industry, noting that it contributes some 6.7 per cent to Australia's GDP and also that it employs 940,000 workers, which is nine per cent of the Australian workforce. You would think that we might then have heard from the member for Curtin some statistics about the safety record in the building and construction industry. But no, there was not one word about safety in the building and construction industry from the shadow Treasurer. Indeed, the shadow Treasurer ranted about unions, bleated about the powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and attacked former Federal Court judge Murray Wilcox QC, who is presently inquiring into the regulation of the building and construction industry. What the member for Curtin should have done is to refer to the statistics of the Austration lian Safety and Compensation Council, which show the alarmingly bad safety record of the building and construction industry. I will just give some of them, because they show what a problem we have in this country and why it is important that we pay attention to occupational health and safety, particularly in the construction industry. The 200506 figures showed that the fatalities incidence rate in the building and construction industry was twice as high as the allindustries rate. Over the same period, the serious claims incidence rate was the fourth highest of all industries. This equates to 39 employees a day sustaining a serious workrelated injury or disease requiring one week or more off work. There were 30 notified fatalities during the nine-month period from July 2007 to March 2008-that is 30 deaths in 36 weeks, and that is the worse performance since 1 July 2003. I would say to the member for Curtin that she should stop worrying so much about the trade unions in the building and construction industry and start worrying about safety in the building and construction industry. If the Building and Construction Commission is to be mentioned at all in the context of occupational health and safety, a better inquiry might be to examine whether the threat of an investigation by the commission, or a threat of the use of coercive powers, may have had an overall negative effect on safety in the building and construction industry. There have been a number of recent suggestions that this is the case, arising from the fact that an action taken by a worker in relation to a safety concern is likely to be treated by the commission as an illegal industrial action with all of the consequences which flow from that. Some curious criticisms have been made of this bill by those opposite in the course of this debate-notably claims made by opposispeakers that the six-year review period for Safe Work Australia, which is provided for in this bill, is somehow inadequate. In making those claims, they appear to have created the impression that Safe Work Australia will not be reporting at all when, of course, that is far from the case. Clause 70 makes it clear that there is to be an annual report to the minister and to the ministerial council. What happens every six years is a review of the Safe Work Australia process and project and a report to the parliament about that. The introduction of Safe Work Australia and the involvement, hard work and expertise of the trade union movement will improve workers' safety. These reforms are needed to create better workplaces-which are safer workplaces-which will increase productivity and profitability. The well-being of working Australians is vital to this government. I commend the bills to the House.  too rise in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and a related bill. I thank the member for Isaacs for his contribution to the debate. I too listened with amazement to some of the comments coming from those opposite, especially from the member for Curtin. It was quite surprising to hear in sustained attack the suggestion that the board is somehow stacked with ALP operatives. Over the next few months perhaps that will change if they come from Western Australia, but there seems to be a suggestion that the composition of the board is fundamentally flawed because it was recommended by the states that happened to have Labor premiers. The way the opposition railed about this, maybe they do not have much faith in these governments changing over the next couple of years, even though they are three-year appointments. We will wait and see. ‘Bipartisanship' is a word we hear often in this parliament; I have heard it a couple of times over the last couple of weeks. But the word ‘bipartisan' is obviously not understood by those opposite, so I thought I would just inform them a little bit. The English teacher in me asked me to bring along the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary. I just thought I would look up the word ‘partisan'. ‘Bi' obviously means two, but ‘partisan' is a word that means ‘a strong, especially unreasoning, supporter of a party or a cause et cetera.' In military terms, it is a guerrilla in wartime. The other meaning is ‘loyal to a particular cause or biased', from the French origins or, in the Italian dialect, ‘partisano'. So the word ‘bipartisan' is obviously something not particularly understood by those opposite. Maybe they do not understand that it is ‘bi', meaning two. Sometimes when I hear the member for Wentworth talking I think he must think that, when you trot out $30, it is ‘b-u-y partisan' and you can buy support for something. Hopefully, the true meaning of the word ‘bipartisan' will come into play in this House over the next couple of weeks. This Safe Work Australia Bill will set up a new independent body to help make Australian workplaces safer and will drive better workers compensation arrangements. My that background before I was elected, apart from being an English teacher, included working for the peak mining body in Queenslandthe Queensland Resources Council. The member for Isaacs touched on the building industry. Obviously, the mining sector, whilst it has nowhere near the same number of fatalities, has incredibly dangerous work sites. Certainly in years gone by there have been huge numbers of fatalities, especially in coal mines. When things go wrong in a coalmine and they explode, there are very serious consequences. So the mining sector is one that has benefited from union involvement over the years. Unlike the member for Curtin, the mining sector has that great relationship between government, unions and employers-that is, mining companies. They understand that tripartite approach to health and safety. I see Bill Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, walking in. More than anyone, he understands how important the role is that unions play in making sure that health and safety conditions are improved in mining communities. My other unfortunate, sad connection with health and safety is through my younger brother, Tim, who worked in the building trade. He was working in the building industry only about 10 metres over the border in New South Wales when a crane collapsed on him and the two men standing beside him, who were both killed. So it certainly has touched my family. In a lot of ways, my younger brother has never really recovered. Even though his back injuries were very serious, his psychological damage was much more serious. I am looking forward to this Safe Work Australia initiative replacing the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. This will reduce the duplications and inconsistencies relating to workplace health and safety throughout Australia. It delivers on our tion commitment to uphold safety standards while reducing complexity for employees and employers. Safe Work Australia will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and state and territory governments and will include a total of 15 members from each of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, two employee representatives and two employer representatives. The role of the Australian Safety and Compensation Council was to coordinate, monitor and promote national efforts on health and safety and workers' compensation. Safe Work Australia will do much more than that, and it will drive national reforms to protect health and lives work and cut costs for employers. This is all part of the Rudd government's positive approach to corporate federalism, irrespective of whether the state governments are Labor, Liberal or some amalgam of those. The new body will be appointed by the minister and will make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. The Rudd government were elected on a platform to restore balance and fairness to Australian workplaces. We have well and truly started on this journey by abolishing Howard's unfair Australian workplace agreements. We saw that in no uncertain terms on election night when the member for Bennelong was voted out. That was something which had not happened previously to a sitting prime minister, apart from a gentleman by the name of Stanley Melbourne Bruce, the first Viscount Bruce of Melbourne. I looked up Stanley Melbourne Bruce; he was certainly an interesting character. He was only the second Australian to be granted a hereditary peerage of the United Kingdom parliament, and the only one whose peerage was formally created-that is, he took a seat in the House of Lords. Apparently there had been one granted before but the guy died at sea on his way to taking up his seat in the elec- House of Lords. Stanley Melbourne Bruce was kicked out of federal parliament for introducing legislation that was attacking workers. At a time of riots and lockouts in New South Wales in 1929, he responded with the maritime industries bill, which basically did away with the ‘fair go'-much the same as when John Howard was trying to get rid of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration-and Australians, basically fair-minded people, responded by giving Labor a landslide victory. Stanley Melbourne Bruce, the first Viscount Bruce of Melbourne, was defeated by Labor's Ted Holloway in his electorate of Flinders. I am at not sure if the Holloway family is around or listening to this but they really should have their hands shaken. Mr Shorten interjecting Holloway was a Queenslander. I might have to check. Obviously, the Queenslanders sent down Maxine MCKew to get rid of John Howard. I will defer to the member for Maribyrnong as to Ted Holloway's state of origin. Obviously the Hon. John Winston Howard was only the second prime minister to be voted out. Why? Because he attacked the ‘fair go' and, more importantly, attacked the unions and health and safety, which is really an attack on the lives of people in workplaces. We have also started work to make Australian workplaces not only safer but healthier. For example, we have undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme. Another shameful Howard government legacy was their gross neglect of Comcare. It was critically under-resourced and unable to cope with its investigations workload. This obviously puts lives at risk, as anyone working in the construction sector would know. The Rudd government has also set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review and has developed an agreement with state and territory governments for nationally consistent occupational health and safety legislation. Having come from the mining sector, I know how particularly advanced this is, with governments, miners and unions sitting down together to work out ways to make businesses work smarter so that mining companies that go between states will not have to deal with different frameworks. This bill delivers on that agreement. All Australians expect that, when a family member goes off to work, they will return home safely. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. More than 300 people are killed each year at work and more than 140,000 Australians are seriously injured. That sounds like simple statistics, but I can attest that my brother was seriously, seriously damaged by that workplace accident. So statistics do have personal tales behind them. Australians still face danger in work sites around the country, and this is totally unacceptable. I think of people like Chris Geer and Steve Sayer, who fell to their deaths on a Gold Coast construction site earlier this year, at the time of the Queensland state conference, and there have unfortunately been more deaths, even on the Gold Coast, where my brother worked in the construction sector. There should be no greater priority for employers than workplace safety, and I know that the overwhelming majority of employers are striving to do the right thing. I say that again: I know that most employers are trying to do the right thing. Unfortunately, many of these employers have been entangled in red tape as they battle the different laws in place throughout Australia. The inconsistencies between the states also lead to poorer safety standards and lower compensation for some employees. Once again, I refer to my brother Timothy, who was a classic example. He was working for a Queensland company on the Twin Towns Services Club but, because it was 10 metres over the border-in fact, I think the crane even swung over into Queensland at stages-and the deaths and the accident occurred right over the border, there were all sorts of problems and red tape with getting Sydney lawyers to deal with something that was really a Queensland accident. It will be great to resolve some of those issues by having greater consistency. National cooperation will help overcome these issues and improve people's lives. Greater cooperation will improve health and safety standards for workers and reduce the complexity of compliance and regulation for business. To achieve this, Safe Work Australia will develop a national occupational health and safety and workers compensation policy; prepare, monitor and revise legislation; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure regulatory consistency across the nation; progress harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data; drive national awareness strategies; and advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on occupational health and safety on workers compensation matters. We must all be aware that, when it comes to occupational health and safety, there is too much at stake to be distracted by political games and turf wars. We have to get this right. This really is a time for bipartisanship. The only way to get this right is to work together in cooperation with all of the state and territory governments. Safe Work Australia will establish a platform to bring about even greater consistency and cooperation between all governments in the future. We must also continue to work with the many unions who strive to make workplaces safer for their members. In closing, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for introducing this legislation and for her commitment to safety in the workplace. She well knows that this type of legislation saves lives. I commend the bills to the House.",104
125,Mr SHORTEN,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"Maribyrnong-Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services) (6.41 pm)-I am pleased to rise this evening to strongly support the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. The purpose of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 is to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia on an ongoing basis. The bill is looking to simplify the current system and make it nationally consistent. It does not make sense to have multiple schemes. Why should different jurisdictions have lesser or greater safety standards than others? The Safe Work Australia authority will be an inclusive, tripartite body representing the interests of the Commonwealth, states and territories as well as employees and employers in Australia. The bill will play a pivotal role in realising the government's commitment to working cooperatively with state and territory governments to improve OH&S outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. Safe Work Australia will be a reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. Occupational health and safety is a prime candidate for this sort of reform. The statistics are damning. Each year, more than 300 Australians are killed at work and many more die as a result of work related disease. Each year well over 100,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. These reforms are not just looking at death and serious injury; they are also looking at what people may see as minor injuries. These can have massive repercussions for individuals and their businesses. In my old job as the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, I came across deaths, injury and disease in the workplace. As a union rep, my role was to ensure that workplaces were safe and to protect working Australians, to protect the rights of workers who had been injured previously and to seek equitable outcomes, as much as one can, for the families of those who were injured or worse. Trade unions have always led the way when it comes to improving occupational health and safety standards in Australia. Whether it is burns in the foundry, crushes in mines or falls at a construction site, these are all too often described as ‘accidents'. But it is not an accident, I contend, if it is preventable. Tragically, it is a fact that most people lose their lives in preventable circumstances. In support of this bill I would like to draw the House's attention to four arguments which I think underline the importance of this legislation. First of all, it is the basics which are killing people in Australia. In this I am heavily influenced by Dr Yossi Berger, the National Occupational Health and Safety Unit Director of the Australian Workers Union, a considered thinker and a person of great action in saving people's lives. Fitting guards on machinery still does not occur in Australian workplaces. The absence of lights and reverse beepers on mobile plants still kills people. Sixty years ago, not taking measures, like having first-aid kits stocked and accessible and ensuring that the hazards which lead to falls were well marked and guarded against, was causing 80 per cent of all the deaths in the workplace. Sixty years later, the killers and the causes are the same, and the culprits are still not caught. Mr Katter-Minister, if you would take an interjection: this time last century, one 32 of us who went down the mines died. The union was very helpful in",112
126,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,Order! The member for Kennedy!,113
127,Mr SHORTEN,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,I thank the member for Kennedy for his learned contribution. I appreciate that. Mr Katter-Theodore and the AWU.,113
128,Mr SHORTEN,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"The member for Kennedy's father was a great delegate of the Australian Workers Union, and we are grateful. It is obvious that we need to devote our full attention to the fundamental causes of deaths in our workplaces. You have to wonder how they can still happen. That leads me to the second proposition in support of this legislation. After every workplace disaster-including the workplace disaster at Beaconsfield, in which Larry Knight was killed and Todd Russell and Brant Webb miraculously survived due to the efforts of their workmates and the whole community of Beaconsfield-there are the inquiries. On the Beaconsfield disaster, there was one conducted by Greg Melick, Senior Counsel, and the Tasmanian Coroner is investigating the matter again. Each inquiry will make a number of recommendations. We seem to have this utopian assumption that each time that people die and we have an inquiry, we will learn the lessons of the past and somehow safety will progressively improve. Logically, if this is the case, all disasters should ultimately stop. Clearly, though, this is not hapbasic pening in Australia. You have to ask: why aren't we learning the lessons of the past? Research on mining disasters conducted by the AWU and research on the disaster of the Westralia and disasters in Nova Scotia and South Africa-12 different mining wardens inquiries, courts of inquiry and royal commissions-reveals not only that the inquiries have a lot in common but that the in disasters have a lot in common, regardless of the continent on which or the industry in which they occur. I can predict now that the next inquiry into a tragedy where people are killed will recommend more training and education. I can also predict that the next inquiry into a set of fatalities will predict changes to equipment, standards, processes and the duties of specific personnel on site. Based on what has happened in the past and our health and safety amnesia, I have no doubt that the next inquiry will recommend improved occupational health and safety systems and more government oversight. However, I can also predict with absolutely no fear of contradiction that it is very likely that in the next disaster we see-like all the ones we have seen over the last 100 years of Australian industrial history-there will be no recommendation for legal action against the company or senior personnel and almost none against nominated individuals to be held personally responsible for making sure that the inquiry's recommendations follow through. One thing which I will be putting to the new Safe Work Australia is the need to employ more historians, because the lessons that we will learn in the future are merely those that we have forgotten in the past. Wherever there is an inquiry, in this place or elsewhere, someone should be made responsible for ensuring that, after we hold an inquiry and review the recommendations, in two, three, five and 10 years time, those ommendations are still being honoured. I think that this is a crucial lesson in health and safety. We know that there is rarely a smoking gun in these disasters-certainly not that I have seen. There is very rarely a single event or a single person at which we can point the finger at and say, ‘You did this.' Blame for the sake of itself is not useful; blame does not bring back the dead. What we need to know is that the recommendations of the next inquiry will be followed through. Someone has to be put in charge whenever problems occur, to evaluate how effective the changes are and to see if the new lessons are working or not, and someone must be available to fix them. I believe there need to be penalties attached if recommendations are not put in place in a timely fashion, to make sense of the useless waste and tragedy of people's injury and death. We know, furthermore, that communication is fundamental to the success of all agencies in health and safety. Safe Work Australia itself cannot guarantee the safety all workers. For instance, look at diazinon. My old union and I argued for 12 years that the chemical diazinon should have no future. It was argued by other interests that diazinon is cheap and effective. Certainly it was never argued that it could be a fatal chemical and regularly and seriously harmed workers. It was explained to us, ‘But diazinon is the nomical product in rural industries.' It was never explained that it attacks the nervous system, resulting in long-term ill health and sometimes death. We were told that farm workers cannot have the protection against diazinon of putting on a space suit to try and keep diazinon from their skin-‘That's not the real world of the farm; don't you understand?' After 12 years, diazinon was phased out. Yet for more than 30 years before that it had been known that organophosphates-of rec- which diazinon is one and sarin gas is another-are deadly. We know that two-thirds of all occupational fatalities are from chemically related diseases and by far the majority of these deaths happen in regional Australia. Time and time again we see workers harmed and families suffering while those who should know better do nothing. I believe that Safe Work Australia should have discussions with the chemical manufacturers and should be encouraged to work with the people who work with the chemicals to look at the safest solutions. It comes down to cooperation. It is in the interests of all of us to keep workers and the sectors in which they work, including the agricultural sector, in good health. We need to find more solutions, and we can certainly find more solutions if there is less suspicion and more cooperation and if some people's knee-jerk fear of trade unions was replaced by a sense of gratitude for all comers who wish to assist in making the place safer. After all, if a chemical can harm a worker, if a chemical can creep in through the most stringent safety of measures, it should not even be on the market. It is a simple as that. Indeed, workers need to feel that they can raise safety issues on a daily basis without fear or favour. They must feel confident that OH&S issues will be addressed by manageit ment and that their concerns will be taken seriously and dealt with promptly. I like this eco- legislation because I support the empowerment of workers and the protection of their rights-and the right to a safe workplace should be the first and foremost right. The cost to our economy of work related disease has been estimated at $34 billion per year. This is an estimation of only the injuries that have been reported. Other speakers in support of this bill have identified the curse of asbestos, and the high tide of death from that disease has not yet fully hit the shores. is fair to say that, by the time asbestos has worked its way through the Australian workforce, more people will die of asbestosis and mesothelioma than died in the whole of World War I. If we look at all the injuries that occurred beyond those dreadful killers that I have already mentioned, I think that we can do a lot better. When we look at the economic costs of workplace injury, death and disease, we see that they are significant losses. But, when we compare them to the costs of those injured and the effect on their families, workmates and friends, the cost is immeasurable. I think of men I have met before explosions and the catastrophic amputations they suffered, people sitting in rehabilitation wards with no legs and people who have had their lungs burnt to within an inch of their life by dirty aluminium smelt, and I can see the cost of what has happened to them, and the cost to their family and friends. I know the father whose child was born on the night that he was on a shift and then came home four weeks later in burns bandages. His child has never seen him in anything other than a fullskin burns suit. I like this legislation the focus of its reforms is on prevention. We are looking at something which could save the lives of Australian workers who unnecessarily lose their lives every year. Safe Work Australia will run a communications strategy to raise awareness of health and safety in the workplace and safe practices which minimise harm. It will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, established by the Howard government as an advisory council whose functions were confined to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts on health and safety and workers compensation. This new body will have substantive powers and responsibilities, unlike the previous pale imitation. It will develop national policy relating But it to OH&S and workers compensation, prepare, monitor and revise OH&S model legislation and develop compliance and enforcement policies to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions. It will develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements, collect, analyse and publish OH&S and workers compensation data and undertake and publish research. It will develop national communication strategies to raise the awareness of health and safety at work, and it will further develop the National Occupational and Health Safety Strategy 2002-12. It will advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on these matters. We will see review and revision of the effectiveness of the authority within the bill. We will ensure that there is an active body operating efficiently and responsibly in meeting its strategic and operational goals. The Rudd government has set itself the task of creating a seamless national economy, unhampered by unnecessary duplication, overlap and difference. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential part of the government's strategy to improve safety because outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. This government has undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme, set up an independent panel of experts to undertake a national OH&S review and developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with our state and territory counterparts to harmonise OH&S laws. This legislation complements the most valuable tool of all in workplace safety. I would like to report to the House that Bill and Melinda Gates have an idea on the drawing board for little robots to travel the length and breadth of mines, quarries, hospitals and civil service buildings. Every hour these little robots would send back weak signalsOH&S messages. Rather than an orderly saying, ‘This doesn't feel right,' or perhaps a miner saying, ‘That machine is making a noise different to the one that I have heard every other day I have come here,' or ‘At the start of my shift, this particular shaft of the mine was popping rocks with a different noise to what it has made every other day,' imagine a computer that could send back weak signals on an hourly basis to the central mainframe of health and safety. Unfortunately, while this may be a good idea, this computer has not yet been invented. It is a shame, because every conscientious and diligent employer that I know-and 99 per cent of employers are, and all of them try to bewould rush to Harvey Norman and buy this software. These robots are not in the shops; they have not even been invented yet. But they do not need to be invented. What we have every day is the voices, the signals and the knowledge of workers. If we could somehow have a safety system supported by Safe Work Australia that would send the experiences of workers at the workplace and that could be collated by employers who listenemployers who take the time not only to communicate down to their workers but also to listen upwards from their workers-and if we had a system in Australia where bad news in every organisation was as well respected as good news, then I predict that we would not have many more inquiries because we would often prevent the disaster before it occurred. We already have some of these systems in place. We have delegates and workplace safety officers, many of whom are union trained. In my experience, some of the finest people I have ever met are workplace safety reps who speak up on behalf of the experiences of their fellow workers, often at cost to their own careers and often at cost to them, being seen as stirrers, troublemakers or bad news operators. I can think of Percy Pillai, Gavin Merriman, Sam Beechey and Dave Healy. All of these people have done much to promote health and safety in the industries I used to organise in. The list could go on to our offshore reps and to every sector of the economy. It is these people who are the frontline of health and safety. I am excited by this bill and its passage through the House and hopefully into law. I think that this bill, together with respect for the voices of and the experience of working Australians, together with intergovernmental agreement, can usher in a new era of cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states in this important area. If we can do nothing else than ensuring that more parents and more families can come home to each other at the end of their shift then I believe that we have done a very good thing in supporting this legislation.",113
129,Mr CHAMPION,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise to support the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008, and I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for bringing the bill before the House. As someone who has worked in many different types of jobs-grape picking and shopping trolley collection, labouring on farms and cleaning offices-all of my personal experiences have taught me the value of a safe workplace. I think the value is not just in the peace of mind of workers not constantly fearing for their safety but also in productivity in the workplace as a whole. A safe workplace is a productive workplace. This is because a workplace injury hurts everyone. It hurts the worker injured, their family, their workmates and their firm's productivity. It is incredibly unsettling for a workplace to have an accident in it. That is why a government that is serious about a worker's safety is a government that is serious about Australia's economy and its productivity. This bill is another example of this government taking strong action to keep Australian workers safe and productive. In support of this bill, I wish to discuss the critical portance of improving workplace safety and workers compensation, particularly in the context of intergovernmental cooperation, but I also want to draw on my experience in the retail industry in particular. More than 300 Australians are killed at work each year, and many more die as a result of work related disease. Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work, and the pain and grief caused to friends and family by the loss of a loved one or the injury of a loved one are unimaginable to those who have not experienced it. Similarly, extreme hardship and struggle can follow a serious injury and have far-reaching effects on both the injured worker and their family, on relationships, on job prospects and on income. There is absolutely no excuse for inaction when it comes to making workplaces safer for employees, and that is why I support the legislation to replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which is a weak body, with the body Safe Work Australia, which has an increased ability to improve safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across the nation. The role of Safe Work Australia will include developing national policy, monitoring legislation and codes of practice, developing consistent enforcement policies and, most importantly, raising awareness of health and safety at the workplace level. This will effectively progress the improvement of workplace safety and workers compensation. Safe Work Australia will be a joint effort between both state and federal government. It is an example of cooperative federalism and a key reform area for the government. Currently, workplace safety legislation frequently varies in structure and detail depending on which state a worker may reside imin. This legislation and the Safe Work Australia body will help to nationalise workplace safety standards, eliminating unnecessary overlaps, duplications and inconsistencies in the structure of OH&S and workers compensation legislation. I can remember that, when I worked for the state minister for workers compensation in South Australia, the South Australian parliament had to pass a territorial bill to make sure that South Australian workers had coverage in other workers compensation jurisdictions. This is to prevent situations like that. This bill will also remove the difficulties workers, businesses and government currently experience when they are dealing with legislation that varies from state to state. As a result, it will ensure that employees are entitled to the same standards, hopefully, in workplace safety and remuneration as their interstate counterparts. Rules are generally only upheld when they are understood. To have national OH&S legislation and workers compensation is to simplify it. This will result in increased public awareness and understanding of the law, making the system easier to follow and more effective. In effect, simplification and a national approach will lead to increased compliance. Adding to the cooperation between state and federal government, the funding for Safe Work Australia will be evenly divided, with the Australian government contributing 50 per cent of the budget and the states and territories providing the other half, with the contribution of each state and territory being proportional to its own population. So this legislation is economically sound, and it demonstrates a clear partnership between governments that will benefit the over 3,000 employing businesses based in my electorate of Wakefield. Recently, the Australian Industry Group welcomed the focus of federal and state governments in working together on a system of harmonised OH&S legislation across Australian states and territories, so is good for business. This is part of a way of managing Australia's economy and productivity and, at the same time, protecting the health and safety of workers. I believe the legislation will be step forward for the government, business and workers and contribute to the government's plan for a seamless national economy. There are many references in this debate to heavy industry, building sites and meat works and many references to asbestos and James Hardie. That is a good thing, but it does tend to obscure some of the other types of workplaces in the nation which are often quite dangerous but not associated with this debate in the popular mind. Before I entered the House, I had the honour of working as an occupational health and safety officer for the SDA union in South Australia. The SDA has been committed to ensuring that workers are safe when they leave the workplace, as they were when they arrived. The SDA in South Australia has always had a hands-on commitment to safety, working with employers and employees, providing advice and training and, where necessary, being adamant about retail workers' rights to a safe workplace. Recently, the South Australian SDA has developed a workplace leadership program which aims to increase the number of health and safety representatives in the retail industry. I wish to recognise the efforts of Peter Malinauskas, the Secretary of the South Australian branch of the SDA, for this initiative. He has been a great leader on safety and other issues in the retail industry. I would also like to commend Reggie Martin, the trainer at the SDA, and Matt Ellis-key people in driving this project. The retail and fast food industries are far more dangerous than people may realise. Recent statistics from the WorkCover SA it Statistical Review showed that wholesale and retail trade employees made up 15.4 per cent of all workers compensation claims throughout 2006-07 in South Australia. These claims totalled $18.52 million in costs. Many young a people work in this industry. It is dominated by people between the ages of 15 and 25, and often those workers are exposed to risks that are beyond their experience and beyond what their parents often expect them to face when they are entering work. There is a fairly benign view, I think, of the retail industry, but there are some very serious risks that workers face. Two of those risks are manual handling and violence in the workplace. One of the emerging manual handling risks concerns the banning of plastic bags in South Australia. Whilst this is an environmentally desirable change to make, it does create new risks for retail workers, for checkout operators in particular, requiring them to lift green bags which are designed for multiple use, are larger than plastic bags, and have a capacity to be almost double in weight. Considering that retail trade employees in Australia make up 16.7 per cent of back injury claims, this does raise serious concerns for the physical health of the workers who will have to lift these bags almost non-stop during their shifts, in some cases, potentially causing injury over time. In addition, the hygiene of these reusable bags cannot always be guaranteed, and I know of many retail workers who have had some interesting amenity issues when dealing with some customers' bags. I hope that bodies like Safe Work Australia will help to create a framework to address issues like this in a way that is nationally consistent and acknowledges the legitimate concerns of the union and the employees-the people who have to use these bags. The other major concern for retail workers, which is often not recognised at all in workplace safety debate, is that of workplace violence. Violence in the workplace can come in a variety of forms, but two of the most common are client aggression-that is, aggression from customers or patrons-and violence associated with robbery, which can include the threat of violence. Reports of workplace violence are particularly common amongst checkout operators and shop managers, as recorded in the WorkCover Statistical Review of 2006-07 and previous years. I think it is the open and accessible nature of retail workplaces which make those working in them extremely vulnerable to robbery, violence and antisocial behaviour. It is difficult to control that open environment. I know of many incidents in which retail workers have been placed in situations of considerable danger. In one incident in 2004, a shop assistant in Adelaide, in the city's CBD, was shot dead at her workplace by her estranged partner. It was a really tragic combination of domestic violence and violence in the workplace. It was an incident that led to a great deal of shock, grief and suffering in the workplace, and also for the family. People do not expect to witness that level of violence at work, but in my time as an official with the union there were many examples of violence and antisocial behaviours in retail workplaces, and of robberies. Sadly, that happens around the nation. So, while those risks are not always acknowledged in the debate about workplace safety, they do have a massive impact on people's workplaces, on their safety and on their lives at work. Retail, hospitality and industries like that are part of the new economy. They are a growing part of the economy, with thousands and thousands of employees across the country. I guess it is because of risks like these, which are prevalent in the retail industry, that the an active national body like Safe Work Australia is needed to provide nationally consistent approaches to safety issues that affect thousands of workers across the country. In my experience in dealing with employers and employees, safety representatives and other unions, the best way to achieve the highest workplace safety standards is by working in cooperation with employees, employers, businesses, unions and government, rather than by confrontation. I found that, in the main, employers would listen to legitimate issues if workers and companies had a dialogue and had an environment where a dialogue was possible, and that that, rather than the old way of confrontation, was a better way. I think many of the speeches we have heard-in particular, those of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-were focused so heavily on confrontation that they really missed the importance of this bill. It is a great pity that they could not have brought a bit more goodwill to this debate. The Safe Work Australia Bill achieves a collaborative effort. It allows parties to make significant improvements to workers compensation and to occupational health and safety standards in workplaces across Australia, and I commend the bill to the House.",116
130,Mr BRADBURY,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I rise in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. I am pleased to join the debate after the member for Wakefield. I listened with great interest to his comments in relation to occupational health and safety matters affecting workers in the retail sector. When I consider issues of occupational health and safety, I often reflect on some of the more notorious examples, the more publicised examples, where individuals have suffered at the hands of poor practices within their workplaces. I recall not all that long ago in New South Wales a young man by the name of Joel Exner, who was 16. After just three days on the job, he fell 15 metres through a safety net. He did not have the appropriate harness on and, as a consequence of that, ended up dying. I think about cases such as that and about my experience as a young worker. These laws have a greater impact in particular on young people entering the workforce, often because a combination of not only inexperience but also the youthful zeal that comes with coming on to the job for the first time can encourage you to do things that perhaps are not in the best practice. If there are not appropriate practices in place throughout that workplace, that can lead to very dangerous situations. I recall my first day on the job when I started work at 14 years and nine months. I worked for Target in the retail sector. I recall very well that one of the first jobs I was given was to go out to the loading dock and to bring in a large trolley that was full of of paint into the paint department. I was assigned to the paint department, which was the first port of call for any young male worker that joined the job. As I went into the loading dock, I saw this large cage trolley that had all of these tins of paint precariously balanced on the cage. I heard that I was being called over the loudspeaker to bring the paint to the paint department, so there was a sense of urgency. I quickly pulled the trolley off the lift, which was where it was placed, and as it came off the lift all of the paint started to tumble. I was very fortunate because I managed to get out of the way. I ended up with paint all over me, which was a pretty embarrassing way to start one's working life. I reflect back on that and I think about how lucky I was in those circumstances: new on the job, eager to impress and eager to do the best that I could but also lacking the experience and the supervision. Had I been Joel Exner, in a different type of workplace with the same lack of supervision, with the same set of circumstances that I have just described, I may not be here today. That is something that has always struck me-that we can be very lucky in life and others can be very unlucky. But these matters really should not come down to luck. It should be a question of all workplaces striving to achieve the greatest level of safety to protect those people that go off to earn a living, as we all are required to do and desire to do throughout our working lives. The sentiments expressed within this bill, along with the agency that it seeks to construct, are sentiments that would be universally supported in this place. I certainly support them. I think one of the great things about this bill is that not only does it have that real focus on delivering better outcomes from an occupational health and safety perspective but it is also very much focused on tins achieving that by engaging all of the stakeholders. The body that is proposed is tripartite. Safe Work Australia will have the best of all available perspectives, with employer representatives, employee representatives, the chair, the CEO and Commonwealth and state representatives. I think it essential that we have each of the jurisdictions represented in that way because if we are to achieve uniform national laws in this area then it is going to require that level of cooperation. In relation to the broader issue of safety at tins work, I was staggered to see some of the statistics. Some figures indicate that approximately 300 Australians are killed each year at work, but I saw some figures that were cited in an Access Economics report that said a staggering 8,000 or more Australians die each year from work related incidents or illnesses. I suspect the definition there is little broader but the force of those figures is such that that is a very large number of people throughout our community affected by a lack of safety within their workplace. Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work and 690,000 are injured or fall sick from work related causes-once again, that is taken from the Access Economics report. In NSW in 2006 there were 89 unpaid fines for serious workplace safety breaches, totalling almost $5 million. In the year from July 2006 to July 2007, 162 people died in workplaces, which was an increase of 157 from the previous year. I note that all of the available data cates that older workers are at most risk when it comes to the workplace, particularly from the perspective of dying, but I acknowledge the point that I made it little earlier and that is that many young people are susceptible to the dangers of an unsafe workplace, largely because of the inexperience that they bring to the workplace. The Productivity Commission embarked on a fairly wide-ranging inquiry into this area. Their final report was released in September 1995. Work, health and safety: an inquiry into occupational health and safety was a significant contribution to the debate, and I know that the former government, in response to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, went about the business of setting up the body which this legislation now repeals-the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. The reports on the effectiveness or otherwise of that body have generally drawn the conclusion that that body was a toothless tiger and really was, in a structural sense, incapable of progressing and moving forward the national reform that is required. I think it is worth making the point that one of the key reasons why this reform is so necessary and so important is that it is a part of this government's agenda that we move towards a seamless national economy. There is no justification for maintaining separate and different systems of laws in this area, right across each of the jurisdictions in this country. Those anomalies, those anachronisms that exist, are only highlighted and exacerbated by the increasingly global nature of the community that we live in. One of the areas that I have a particular interest in is road transport and the lack of safety on our roads, particularly for professional motor vehicle and truck drivers. Recently, I spoke in relation to the AusLink bill indithat was before the House and detailed some of the safety concerns that I have about the various practices of and the demands on people within the transport industry. I thought the member for Makin made a very salient point on this front a little earlier in the debate when he drew attention to the fact that, when it comes to road transport, state boundaries are of lesser significance than in many other workplaces. A truck driver's workplace is in the cabin of their vehicle, and that may extend beyond the limits of one state, depending on where their pickup point and drop-off point may be. To have separate systems of laws in each jurisdiction not only overcomplicates the situation-we understand that this is a vestige of Federation-but also imposes a significant compliance cost burden on businesses. This is one of the important aspects that the Productivity Commission report focused on. The report identified that those compliance costs were a real issue, particularly for businesses whose operations extended beyond the limits of one state. Some 39,000 multistate businesses had been identified back when that report was released and the overwhelming consensus of those businesses that participated in the consultation process was that there was a real need to overhaul the existing set of arrangements of various systems operating in respect of each of the jurisdictions. The cost to the economy was estimated by the Productivity Commission as being in the vicinity of $34 billion a year. That is the cost of a lack of safety in workplaces and the cost of not having uniform legislation with minimal compliance costs. So the costs to our economy are significant. Obviously the focus needs to be on ensuring safety in all workplaces, but that safety need not come at a greater cost than is required. Ensuring that we move towards harmonisation of our laws in this area will take us a long way towards achieving that objective. One additional point that I would like to make in relation to the issue of business compliance is that, anecdotally in my discussions with various individuals involved in occupational health and safety risk management in industry, I have been receiving feedback that those particular companies whose operations extend beyond the limits of one state invariably seek to try-where a good, law-abiding corporate citizen is involved-to achieve the highest possible standard. They look at the jurisdiction that has the highest standard and they try to meet that across all of their operations. That is a noble objective and one that should be encouraged. The downside is that, if they are competing against other operators that are operating within the limits of only one particular state which may not have the same degree of regulation or which may not require such a high standard of practice, then those competitors may well have a competitive advantage. I do not think anyone in this place would like to see a player within the market having a competitive advantage because they are able to take advantage of lower standards when it comes to ensuring safety within the workplace, but I am advised by those in the sector that is sometimes the case. I mentioned earlier that the forerunner to this body had been described by various groups as a toothless tiger. The table in section 6 sets out a number of items that identify the various functions that are to be conferred on Safe Work Australia. Item 2 refers to model OHS legislation and outlines the function: … to prepare a model Act and model regulations relating to OHS and, if necessary, revise them: (a) for approval by the Ministerial Council; and (b) for adoption as laws of the Commonwealth, each of the States and each of the Territories. Item 3 refers to the model OHS codes of practice; item 5 to policy dealing with compliance and enforcement of approved model OHS legislation; and item 6 to monitoring adoption of approved model OHS legislation in jurisdictions. There are various other items there, but the real focus of this bill and the powers conferred on this new body will be to seriously progress the agenda of harmonisation of laws in the occupational health and safety and workers compensation areas. The former body did not really have the powers to allow it to move forward and progress that agenda. As a consequence of the intergovernmental agreement that was entered into as recently as July of this year between the Commonwealth and the states, we see a newfound impetus to progress that agenda. This bill really does pick up on the various commitments that were given by the parties to that intergovernmental agreement and will hopefully provide the mechanism for progressing that agenda in the not too distant future. Before I conclude, I just want to reflect on a case that has frequently been brought to my attention in the occupational health and safety context: the Viegas family. As a result of losing her husband just a few years ago, Mrs Viegas has been a tireless campaigner when it comes to occupational health and safety issues. Her husband, a 28-year-old at the time and a father of two young children, was killed at work. He died after cutting through a live wire at a Central Coast Westfield shopping centre. He had been told that the wire had been disconnected at the power board. Four and a half years down the track, I understand that Mrs Viegas is still campaigning for some justice in her particular case. The harsh reality of those circumstances-the fact that a young father, a young husband, did not return home at the end of his day-and the consequences that obviously flow from it, are something that I am sure the family, even 4½ years down the track, are only beginning to come to terms with. These are the sorts of very unfortunate, tragic outcomes that can sometimes flow from a lack of safety in the workplace. I tainly hope and believe that the measures contained in this bill will go some way towards making our workplaces safer-first and foremost by giving us as a nation the mechanisms to drive forward with greater uniformity and greater harmonisation of our laws and to extend that harmonisation of laws to workplaces right across this country. Each and every workplace in this country deserves to be as safe as the community deem they should be. It is in that context that I support the bill.",119
131,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA,"I thank members for their contribution to this cognate debate on the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. At the outset I would like to remind members that this legislation will give effect to the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety agreed by COAG on 3 July this year. I also note that very little has been said by members opposite about that historic agreement in the course of this debate. The intergovernmental agreement is a watershed in Commonwealth-state relations. For the first time, governments from each state and territory and the Commonwealth have formally committed to the harmonisation of OH&S laws and the implementation of uniform OH&S legislation, complemented by consistent approaches to compliance and enforcement. The Australian government recognises that occupational health and safety is primarily a state and territory government responsibility and that true reform in this area can be achieved only with the Commonwealth, state and territory governments working cooperatively, as partners rather than as adversaries. The intergovernmental agreement ushered in a new era of cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states cer- and territories-a collaboration which will improve the health and safety of workers across Australia and reduce the complexity of regulation for businesses. All members who have spoken to this legislation have accepted that Australia's health, safety and compensation systems are unnecessarily complex and costly. Inconsistencies between the jurisdictions mean that some workers are at risk of poorer safety standards than their counterparts in other states. At the same time, these inconsistencies increase the complexity, paperwork and costs for the 39,000 Australian businesses that operate across state boundaries. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential first step towards improving safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. Safe Work Australia will be an independent national body with an inclusive, tripartite membership. It will have 15 members, including an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, two representing the interests of employers, and a CEO. Safe Work Australia will have its own staff and will operate under the Commonwealth's accountability and governance frameworks. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in realising the shared commitment of the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments to work together to achieve harmonisation of OH&S laws. It will have the important task of developing a model OH&S act, model regulations and model codes of practice for approval by workplace relations ministers. The opposition have sought to deflect attention from their own appalling record in the area of occupational health and safety by arguing that Safe Work Australia has been designed to fail in achieving its objectives. They have questioned the composition of Safe Work Australia and the voting rules relating to the model OH&S legislation. They have claimed that the legislation is fundamentally flawed because it creates an imbalance between the representatives of the state and territory governments, on the one hand, and the representatives of employers and employees on the other. They have also claimed that these rules reduce the role and effectiveness of the workers' and employers' representatives. Contrary to what the members opposite would have this House believe, Safe Work Australia will be a genuine tripartite body. There will be two employer and two employee representatives on Safe Work Australia. The Commonwealth, states and territories will have only one representative each. With two members each from worker and employer bodies, the social partners will continue to play a significant role in the cision making and effectiveness of Safe Work Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition contends that government representatives will be able to repeatedly override legitimate concerns raised by the social partners during OH&S harmonisation discussions. Not so. All questions will be decided by a two-thirds majority of the votes of members present and voting at a meeting. In the highly unlikely event that there is a split between the states and territories on the one hand and the employer and employee representatives on the other, the independent chair will have the deciding vote. Questions relating to the model OH&S legislation will require an absolute majority of all voting members who represent the Commonwealth, states and territories. This is as it should be because it is the Commonwealth, states and territories that will be required to enact the model OH&S laws. What the members opposite have failed to acknowledge is that the composition of Safe Work Australia and the voting rules were agreed by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments as part of the negotiations on the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety. They have conveniently overlooked the commitment demonstrated by the states and territories by negotiating the intergovernmental agreement. They have also conveniently overlooked the fact that the state and territory governments will be contributing 50 per cent of the funding for Safe Work Australia-another example of the cooperative approach adopted by this government. The opposition has also criticised the fact that Safe Work Australia is reliant on the cooperation and participation of the ministerial council to which it is required to directly report. The government makes no apology for this. If Australia is to dehave a harmonised set of OH&S laws, then it will only do so with the agreement of the states and territories. The ministerial council will have the responsibility to agree, by consensus, to the model OH&S legislation proposed by Safe Work Australia. Unless at least a majority of jurisdictional representatives on Safe Work Australia support the proposed model OH&S legislation, it is unlikely that the ministerial council would reach agreement by consensus. The members opposite have also sought to misrepresent the reporting arrangements that apply to Safe Work Australia. Opposition members would have this House believe that the government is unwilling to report back to parliament on Safe Work Australia's operations-that it would only do so every six years. This completely misrepresents the reporting requirements contained in the legislation, so allow me to correct the record. The provision latched onto by the members opposite relates to the review of Safe Work Australia's ongoing role and function after a period of six years. Like any other body established by the Australian government, Safe Work Australia will be required to produce an annual report. This will be the responsibility of the CEO. The CEO will be required to provide an annual report to the minister, to Safe Work Australia and to the ministerial council. The annual report will, of course, be a public document. I am happy to provide an undertaking to this House to table a copy of Safe Work Australia's annual report. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation are too important to be neglected any longer. Workers' lives and health are at stake and so too is the efficiency of our economy. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform will increase profitability and productivity and better protect the lives and health of Australians. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in this reform. I therefore commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

134,Ms LEY,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I am pleased to speak on the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008. This is the omnibus bill seeking to implement the removal of those aspects of discrimination identified in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's Samesex: same entitlements report that were not picked up in the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsSuperannuation) Bill 2008 and the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill 2008. This suite of bills has continued the process of removing discrimination against samesex couples in Australian laws that was begun by South Australian Liberal MLC the late Murray Hill in 1972. While noting that the opposition have referred the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration, we completely support the principles that underpin this suite of legislation. In speaking on the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Bill 2008, the member for Sturt noted that the federal platform of the Liberal Party of Australia has for many years ‘condemned narrow prejudice as an enemy of liberalism and commits its members to oppose discrimination based on irrelevant criteria'. The bill seeks to make amendments to 68 pieces of Commonwealth legislation. Certain key concepts and definitions are common to them. The intention is to treat same-sex couples and their children on the same basis in Commonwealth legislation as heterosexual de facto couples and their children. The principal mechanism for the amendments in this bill as far as de facto relationships are concerned is the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. For the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act, a person will be a de facto partner of another person, whether of the same or opposite sex, if the person is in a registered relationship with the other person or is in a de facto relationship. A registered relationship is one registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory. A de facto relationship, under the Acts Interpretation Act, exists between two people who are not legally married to each other, are not related by family and have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis. There are a number of criteria upon which the de facto status of the relationship is determined. Examination of these criteria is unnecessary if a relationship is registered under the appropriate state law. The definition of ‘child' is amended in a number of pieces of legislation. The formula of ‘product of the relationship' is used to describe children. This is a description that has attracted criticism both in this place and during the Senate committee hearings on the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Bill 2008. The full definition reads as follows: … someone is the child of a person if he or she is the product of a relationship the person has or had as a couple with another person (whether of the same sex or a different sex). For this purpose, someone cannot be the product of a relationship unless he or she is the biological child of at least one of the persons in the relationship or was born to a woman in the relationship. This is an expansion of the legal concept of a natural child of a couple, and it is only right and proper that the matter be considered in detail through the Senate committee process. Although some people have been complaining that the opposition has been delaying the passage of these bills by reference to the committee, the evidence before the committee has indicated that there are concerns from across the spectrum of all interested parties as to the terminology used in respect of children. Clearly, the reference was appropriate. Further, it is a great stretch to accuse the opposition of using the reference to a committee as a delaying tactic. In fact, this is clearly not the case. The committee will be reporting on 30 September. This is a very expeditious result, given that this bill was only introduced into the House on Wednesday, 3 September. I would particularly like to congratulate opposition Senators Trood, Barnett and Fisher for their work in ensuring that the business before that committee was carried out with such efficiency. In the Attorney-General's second reading speech he admitted his awareness of some criticism of the bill's approach in this area. His response was: … without it there is a risk that we will not ognise all children in same-sex families. Whatever people's views are, I am sure they will that children should be treated equally wherever they may be in Australia and irrespective of the relationship of their parents. We in the opposition unreservedly support that principle, and we look forward to the Senate committee's report on their considerations of the matter. In relation to stepchildren, the bill expands the definition of ‘stepchild' to include a child of an opposite-sex or same-sex de facto partner by a previous relationship. The current meaning of stepchild only applies to the child of a husband or wife by a previous union. The bill makes further amendments to remove discrimination against the surviving partner in a same-sex relationship by replacing the term ‘widow or widower' and instead referring to a ‘surviving spouse or de facto partner'. The bill deals with other family relationships, such as brother, aunt or grandparents, to ensure that family relationships will be recognised in same-sex couple families in the same way they are recognised in opposite-sex couple families. The opposition notes with concern that amendments to the Migration Act that form a part of this bill seem likely to permit gay marriages contracted overseas to be recognised as marriages for the purposes of couples visas under regulations to that act. This comes in direct contravention of the words of the Attorney-General in his second reading contribution. The policy of both sides of parliament on marriage is very clear. It reflects the widely held view in the community that marriage is between a man and a woman, and it is defined as such in Commonwealth legislation. The Attorney-General is right when he says that removing discrimination against same-sex couples does not undermine marrecriage. However, the Attorney-General would seem to be mistaken when he says that this agree legislation stops short of redefining marriage-at least as far as the Migration Act is concerned. We expect that the Senate committee will deal with this matter, and the opposition certainly reserve their position in relation to any potential amendments that the Senate committee might propose. Liberalism is a philosophy that celebrates individual freedom and choice. It abhors discrimination. As was said on 4 June in relation to the same-sex superannuation bill, the bills are long overdue-a situation for which both sides of this House must accept responsibility. The opposition welcomes this bill. The opposition supports the principles underpinning this bill. The opposition is eager to end injustice and discrimination against same-sex couples in Australia. However, the opposition strongly support marriage as an institution of special importance to our society and we will ensure that the sincere questions we hold with respect to this bill are fully examined through the Senate committee process. On behalf of the opposition, therefore, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) affirms its commitment to the central importance of the institution of marriage to Australian society; (2) nevertheless recognises that partners in same-sex relationships ought not to be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality, and ought to be treated on a similar basis to partners in heterosexual de facto tionships; (3) recognises the right of children who live in same-sex households not to be discriminated against; and (4) notes that the Opposition has referred the to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for reporting by September 30 with a view to ensuring that, in removing discrimination against people in same-sex lationships: (a) the centrality of marriage is not devalued, whether by the use of inappropriate statutory language or otherwise; (b) there is no unintended recognition of same sex marriage, including through amendments to the Migration Act 1961; (c) the rights and status of children are properly protected; and (d) the rights and status of people in dependent relationships other than same-sex relationships are recognised and properly protected”. I reaffirm the opposition's support for the bill and I commend the amendment to the House.",125
135,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,Is the amendment seconded? Dr Stone-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,128
136,Mr TURNOUR,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"Leichhardt) (7.51 pm)I rise today to support the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008. It is an honour to be the first member of the government to speak on this bill. I have a large gay and lesbian community in my electorate of Leichhardt and I know that they welcome this legislation. I was pleased to hear the member for Farrer support this legislation in principle, but I must admit that I am surprised, and I am sure members of the government will be surprised, that this legislation has been referred off to a Senate committee, particularly given the fact that we have a new Leader of the Opposition who, I relawould have thought, would have been here tonight representing that side of the House, the Liberal Party, and putting very firmly his views in relation to this legislation. We need to remember that when the govbill ernment brought forward the legislation in relation to superannuation earlier in the year, it was the former Leader of the Opposition, re- Dr Nelson, who was the first speaker on this issue and who put forward the opposition's point of view. Like me, the member for Wentworth, the new Leader of the Opposition, also represents a large gay and lesbian community in his electorate. He has communities such as Kings Cross, Darlinghurst and Paddington in his electorate. These communities are very well known within this country for having large gay and lesbian populations, inter- and I would have thought that the member for Wentworth, the new Leader of the Opposition, would have taken a note from the former Leader of the Opposition and been here tonight to represent his constituents and show some leadership for his side of the parliament. We also need to remember very clearly his position prior to the last election when he was concerned about his seat. Where is the person who, before the last election, was jumping up and down and saying that he would fight for equality for gay and lesbian people until justice was done? Now, after the election, we are here tonight debating this important legislation and we hear that the opposition is going to send it off to a committee. I think that constituents in the member for Wentworth's electorate will be very disappointed with the position that he has taken this evening. I think they would be asking themselves about some of the deals that might have been done in the background in terms of his securing his position as the Leader of the Opposition-some of the deals that he might have done with some in the right wing in the New South Wales part of the Liberal Party. I was very disappointed to hear the member for Farrer tonight, rather than supporting this legislation, basically getting wishywashy and incorporating marriage issues in this legislation. This legislation has nothing to do with marriage. The Labor Party have made it very clear that we are not looking to change the definition of ‘marriage' in the Marriage Act in relation to this legislation. We are about making sure that people in same-sex relationships get a fair go, and it is very clear that the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, who has a very large gay and lesbian community in his electorate, is not here tonight to say what he is doing; he is out the back, no doubt talking to members of his party about how they are going to shuffle this out and play some politics around marriage in terms of this legislation. I was very disappointed to hear that this was going to be handed off to a Senate committee. After just 10 months the Rudd government is delivering much-needed reform to remove discrimination from federal government laws against those in same-sex relationships. Twelve years of inaction by the Howard government will be washed away by these laws and finally some justice will be delivered to those in same-sex relationships. Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states: All persons are equal before the law and are tled without any discrimination to the equal tection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination any ground … This is a United Nations treaty based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, implemented and supervised internationally by the UN Human Rights Committee. It is considered by many to be one of the most important human rights treaties in the world. I am delighted to stand here today to support the bill being introduced by the Rudd government. It will help to ensure that Australian legislation reflects the sentiments contained in this article. The Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsGeneral Law Reform) Bill will end discrimination against same-sex couples and the children of same-sex relationships in a wide range of Commonwealth laws. Australia is the lucky country. We live in a healthy democracy, we have a strong human rights record and we have freedom of speech and freedom of press. But our nation's treatment of same-sex couples is unacceptable. In the eyes of the Commonwealth law, they are not recognised. As a country, we still have a way to go to ensure equality for all of our residents. The legislation introduced by the Rudd government, being driven by the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert MCClelland, is well and truly overdue. This legislation will not be without controversy. It is important that we remember this is not about special rights for same-sex couples; it is about ensuring that all couples have equal rights to the same entitlements and benefits. This is a basic human right. This bill introduces the second part of the Rudd government's historic reforms to amend laws that discriminate against same-sex de facto couples and their children. entiEarlier this year, legislation was introduced pro- in the House to eliminate discrimination against same-sex couples and the children of same-sex relationships in acts when it comes to superannuation, including the payment of on superannuation benefits upon the death of a scheme member and in related taxation treatment of superannuation benefits. The former Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, was here to put the opposition's response to that, but we do not see the member for Wentworth tonight. We do not see the new Leader of the Opposition-somebody who represents very large gay and lesbian communities in this country-here tonight. The bill I rise to support tonight will build on our earlier legislation and will amend a further 68 Commonwealth laws. Taxation and social security, immigration, health and aged care, and veterans entitlements are just a few of the areas that will be reformed. It is certainly important legislation that will have widespread implications, and it is a positive step forward not only in our legislative framework but for our country in embracing the differences in our community. Before I go on to outline some of the more technical aspects of this legislation, I would like to commend my parliamentary colleague and our nation's Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert MCClelland, for his leadership on this issue. He has acknowledged the shameful delay-that it has taken so long for a government of either side to take the necessary action to remove same-sex discrimination. As the Attorney-General highlighted in his second reading speech, it is almost 20 years since ‘sexual preference' was added as an additional ground of discrimination under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regulations. In 1997, a Senate committee identified discrimination in Commonwealth laws and programs regarding tax and superannuation benefits. In 2004, Australia was found to be in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights regarding veterans entitlements, denying benefits to a person on the basis of their sexual orientation. After being appointed to office, the Attorney-General commissioned a whole-of-government audit of Commonwealth legislation. He has considered the Same-sex: same entitlements report released in May last year by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and has acted on the findings. He has coordinated over 19 government departments to bring us to this point-a significant undertaking. So it is with great pleasure that I stand here tonight to speak about this historic legislation that has been introduced, and I thank Mr MCClelland for his effort to date. Often we stand up in this place and talk about legislation that impacts on the community, and it does trickle down and impact on individuals within the community, but there are individuals out there tonight-who are listening to this broadcast and who will read the comments of members on this and the other side of the House-who will be directly affected by this legislation and will directly benefit from these changes. It is a great honour as a member of parliament to be able to stand up and know that, in making your decision, in casting your vote, you can impact directly on individuals' lives. This will directly impact same-sex couples, many of whom have been living in relationships for well over 20 or 30 years. They will benefit from this legislation that recognises their rights as for other de facto couples. I am very proud to be a member of the Rudd government that is bringing this legislation forward and I congratulate the Attorney-General for the work he has done. The passing of this bill will remove discrimination by amending a number of different definitions across Commonwealth legislation. The major amendments include changing the definition of ‘de facto partner'. The bill includes a new definition for the term ‘de facto partner'. De facto partnerships will encompass parties in relationships whether they are of the same or different sexes; it will be gender neutral. The new definition will be included in the Acts Interpretation Act and will become the standard definition for most Commonwealth laws. The other major amendment includes changing the definitions of ‘child' and ‘parent'. This bill will remove discrimination by altering the definition of a child. The term will include a child who is the product of a relationship where one partner is linked biologically to the child or where one partner is the birth mother of the child. By applying this definition, opposite-sex and same-sex families are treated equally. The definition ‘parent' will also be expanded where appropriate to include the parents of children of same-sex couples. This ensures that both members of a couple are recognised as parents of a child where that child is the product of the relationship. The amendments contained in this bill are vital. At present, same-sex de facto relationships are not recognised in a number of Commonwealth laws which already provide recognition for opposite-sex de facto relationships. This is quite simply unjust. Until the amendments are passed through parliament, the same-sex partner of a person and that couple's child will not be able to access the same treatment in the 68 laws outlined within the bill that is currently afforded to opposite-sex de facto couples in the same circumstances. Another major feature of this bill which is important to note is that it will remove marital status discrimination in a number of Commonwealth laws. I disagree with the case being put forward by many members opposite that these changes undermine the institution of marriage and the family unit. But I wish to make it clear that this is not about marriage. As I have said: this is not about marriage; it is about giving people in same-sex relationships a fair go. It has never been Labor policy to change the definition of ‘marriage' in the Marriage Act. It cannot be ignored that opposite-sex de facto couples represent a growing proportion of our population, and it is unreasonable that they do have the same rights as a couple who are married. So it is the discrimination against people in same-sex and opposite-sex de facto relationships that we want to fix. I agree with the Attorney-General's sentiments that it is hard to believe that for almost 24 years it has been lawful to discriminate against a person on the basis that they are or are not married. This bill will amend some of laws that treat people in the same circumstances differently based on whether they are married or not. For example, a widow-a woman who has lost her husband-may be entitled to government benefits. Presently, benefits are payable to a woman only if she was married. If she was a de facto partner, she is not entitled to the same benefits. The bill will replace the term ‘widow' with ‘surviving spouse' or ‘de facto partner'. The Rudd government has also moved to alter the treatment of de facto relationships. Changes in the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill 2008 will allow opposite-sex and samesex de facto couples to access the federal family law courts on property and spouse maintenance matters. This same-sex relationships bill will impact on 68 Commonwealth laws, as I have said. I will take just one piece of legislation that will change as a result of this bill as an example. It relates to medical benefits, so it is a clear illustration of the importance of passing this bill. Presently, same-sex couples have to spend more than opposite-sex couples on medical expenses to enjoy the Medicare and PBS safety nets. This bill seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973, a piece of Australian law that regulates the payment of Medicare benefits. This act stipulates the persons who are eligible for Medicare benefits, the arrangements for safety net entitlements and the rules in relation to the provision of services that attract Medicare benefits. The passing of this samenot sex relationships bill will mean same-sex de facto partners and their dependent children can register as a family for the purposes of Medicare safety nets. As I have said, this is about making sure people in same-sex relationships get a fair go. We are not talking about changing the Marriage Act. We are not talking about changing the definition of marriage. It is about playing politics when you start going down that track. The Labor Party and the Liberal Party have the same policy on this, but we want to make sure we give people in same-sex relationships a fair go. The members opposite need to think very carefully about whether they are choosing to play politics on this and whether they want to go down this track, particularly given they have a new Leader of the Opposition who I would have thought would have wanted to distance himself from the Howard years and some of the policies and responses we have seen in relation to this sort of legislation in the As I said, I have a wonderful gay and lesbian community in Cairns. Same-sex partners are members of my community and many of them are friends of mine. I am proud to stand up here and support this legislation that is going to benefit many of those individuals in my electorate. Last weekend my local gay community held the second Tropical Pride Festival in Cairns. Over 1,500 people came along and celebrated as part of the Tropical Pride Festival. There was an awards night on the Friday night and, over the weekend, people participated in the parade of lights as part of Festival Cairns. On Sunday, there was a fair at the Tanks. I had a stall there that enabled people to find out more about this legislation. We provided them with the Attorney-General's second reading speech. I was disappointed that I could not stand up here last week and make this speech so that I could hand it out on the weekend, but I was proud to be there to support the local community. The aim of this event is to bring the local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community together and also to enable the general Cairns community to better accept and understand their lifestyles and choices. I want to congratulate members of the community for organising the event. I was pleased to support the event with a stall at the fair on Sunday. The organising committee need to be congratulated for the work that they do. There are some great leaders within the gay and lesbian community in Cairns, and the importance of the same-sex legislation presently before parliament is best summed up in a quote that Amanda Dean, the health promotion officer at the Queensland Association for Healthy Communities, based in Cairns, gave me. They are a wonderful organisation that provide great leadership and great support within their community. The past. quote comes from their CEO, Paul Martin, who says: To improve the health and well-being of LGBT people, we need to reduce stigma and discrimination. Legal recognition of same sex relationships is part of treating everyone equally and with dignity, and building a socially inclusive Australia. I cannot stress how important this bill that I am supporting today is to my local constituents, and I believe that quote sums up my, and many in the community's, sentiments perfectly. The Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsGeneral Law Reform) Bill is an important piece of legislation. It is the right thing to do. It means a new standard of fairness and consistency in Australian law. I am proud to be part of a government that will end discrimination in 68 pieces of Commonwealth law. As found by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, it is not good enough that more than 20,000 same-sex couples experience systematic discrimination on a daily basis; it is not good enough that same-sex couples and their families are denied financial entitlements and benefits; and it is not good enough that same-sex couples are not able to receive tax concessions that opposite-sex couples can. The Rudd government's action to introduce this legislation will seek to rectify this. This bill builds on our bill introduced lier this year regarding the treatment of same-sex couples when it comes to superannuation, and it builds on our Family Law Amendment Bill, which is also presently before the parliament. That bill will allow opposite-sex and same-sex de facto couples to access the family law courts on property and spouse maintenance matters. Unlike the opposition, we are committed to stamping out discrimination against same-sex couples. I was very concerned by what I heard this evening in relation to these bills. We are committed to ensuring that people in samesex relationships get a fair go, and we are working hard to ensure this. We committed to this before the election and we are delivering on that commitment within 10 months of being elected. I am very proud to be part of the Rudd government, delivering on its election commitments again. I urge the House to support this bill and I commend it to the House.",128
137,Mr GEORGIOU,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"Kooyong) (8.09 pm)I wish to speak in support of the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008. This bill reforms federal law to remove discrimination against same-sex couples and their families. This phase of the process of reform commenced in May this year, with the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsSuperannuation) Bill 2008. This dealt only with the issue of superannuation. I supported that bill and I welcome the government's commitment to end discrimination against same-sex couples in other areas of federal law. I am pleased that this additional and significant instalment has been introduced so promptly. The impetus for the reform process was the Same-sex: same entitlements report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity earCommission. This report resulted from a 14month inquiry into whether Australia's laws relating to financial and work related entitlements complied with our human rights obligations with regard to same-sex couples and their children. The inquiry found that 58 federal laws relating to financial and work related entitlements discriminated against same-sex couples. Subsequently, an audit by the Attorney-General's Department requested by the Attorney-General, which covered nonfinancial areas, identified approximately 47 additional pieces of discriminatory legislation. Our laws discriminate against same-sex couples and their families in all areas of life and in all manner of everyday experience. The areas affected include employment, health, aged care, immigration, taxation, social security, family law and superannuation. Same-sex couples do not receive the same tax concessions as opposite-sex partners. They cannot register for the Medicare and PBS safety nets as a couple or, if they have children, as a family. They are not treated equitably as regards social security assessments. They are denied the usual guarantees to some of the minimum workplace conditions, such as parental and carers leave. The impact is that gays and lesbians-thousands of them-are denied rights and opportunities that are available to their fellow citizens. This differential treatment is unreasonable and it is unfair. It is inconsistent with the fundamental values we espouse as a nation and it has persisted for too long. HREOC concluded that the discrimination manifest in federal law breaches the most fundamental of all human rights principles: the right to nondiscrimination and to equality before the law and the protection of the best interests of the child. The Howard government committed itself to review the commission's recommendations and to confer with interest groups in preparing its response. In the election campaign we put forward a policy which extended death benefits to same-sex couples under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. This policy accorded with the federal platform of the Liberal Party, which commits it to oppose discrimination based on irrelevant criteria. We never implemented that policy because we lost government, but this bill addresses the same issue. It addresses the elimination of discrimination based on irrelevant criteria, and I support it strongly. This bill addresses the unequal treatment of same-sex couples by basically implementing the solution recommended by HREOC: changing the relationship definitions that currently exclude some same-sex partnerships. The commission recommended retaining current terminology insofar as possible while redefining it to include same-sex couples. As the explanatory memorandum states: The general approach taken by the Bill is to tend the existing meaning of these terms to clude same sex relationships. The bill adds a new standard definition of ‘de facto partner' to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, extending it to include same-sex de facto relationships. Where appropriate, it also amends existing references to ‘de facto' or ‘unmarried couple' relationships so that they encompass both oppositeand same-sex couples. The bill extends what are mostly financial and work related rights to existing parent-child relationships to accord with the fundamental principle that all children should have equal rights under the law. Where appropriate, the bill extends the definition of ‘child' to provide legal recognition of the child-parent relationship in same-sex families in cases where it did not previously exist. This recognition will also be extended to the stepchildren of de factos. Under current law, only the stepchildren of married couples are recognised. The amendments in this bill expand existing definitions of ‘stepchild' and ‘step-parent' to include the stepchildren of de facto couples. This change applies equally to same-sex and opposite-sex de facto couples. This bill removes discrimination against same-sex couples and their families across a wide spectrum of federal government activity, including health, social security, education, tax, defence and veterans affairs. I cannot do justice to all these amendments in the time permitted, but it is important to take a measure of the consequence of this new equality for people's lives. In the core area of taxation, for example, there can be no justification for inequality. As a submission to the HREOC inquiry stated: If we are to pay the same tax as our heterosexual and de facto fellow citizens, we should be entitled to the same privileges. Yet, in the tax area, HREOC established that exsame-sex couples are ineligible for a range of in- tax concessions and rebates currently enjoyed by opposite-sex de factos. Despite meeting all the other criteria, a same-sex couple is not eligible for the dependent spouse tax offset. In 2007-08, the maximum amount that could be claimed for this was $2,100. Similarly, a member of a same-sex couple is unable to access the tax offset for supporting their partner's parents. This can amount to a maximum of $1,540. In the area of health, same-sex couples and their families cannot register as such for the Medicare and PBS safety nets. This financial disadvantage is compounded by the fact that same-sex couples and their families also do not qualify for the medical expenses tax offset. This bill will rectify these inequalities. In the area of employment, this bill amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which governs federal employees' workers compensation. Under the current law, same-sex partners of workers covered under Comcare do not receive lump sum death benefits upon the death of their partner. Similarly, the ordinary consideration that would be taken of the employee's dependent spouse and children in a determination of a compensation payment may well fail to apply. The amendments made by this bill will redress this situation. I think it is important that we note that amendments required to remove discriminatory treatment from the Workplace Relations Act that affect entitlements to parental, carers and compassionate leave are not part of this bill. But the government has committed to incorporating the necessary changes within the industrial relations legislation it plans to introduce later this year. In the area of aged care, same-sex couples face considerable financial hardships when one member of the couple enters permanent residential care-a hardship which would not apply to opposite-sex couples in like circumstances. This is particularly the case when a same-sex couple is faced with the prospect of paying an accommodation bond. Accommodation bonds can involve large sums of money. The amount payable for them is not fixed; the amount depends on the assets of the person entering aged care. For many couples, their home is their main asset. The Aged Care Act provides that, if one member of the couple enters aged care and the other member of the couple continues to live in their home, the value of the home is not included for the purposes of the asset test. As same-sex couples are not currently recognised under present definitions, an elderly same-sex couple is unlikely to benefit from this exemption. Their home will usually be counted in the assets test. Potentially, this discrimination could result in a same-sex couple losing their family home despite it still being occupied by a member of that couple. This bill amends the Aged Care Act to terminate this discrimination. I think it is important, while we are talking about equality, to face the fact that equality can also result in less favourable financial impacts. Every person who enters residential aged care must pay a basic daily care fee, the amount of which is determined by an income test. For legally recognised couples, the in the come test takes into account the income of each member of the couple, adding them together and then dividing that by half. However, as a same-sex partner is not recognised as a partner, only the income of the partner entering residential aged care is included in the income test. As a single income would often be less than the income of a couple, a same-sex couple may find themselves at a disadvantage when compared to an opposite-sex couple in the same situation. Similarly, equity with opposite-sex couples in the area of social security will have both positive and negative financial consequences for people in same-sex relationships. There are some social security payments, such as the bereavement and widow allowance, for which same-sex partners are ineligible because the Social Security Act does not recognise their relationship. The bereavement allowance provides people with low incomes and few assets a living allowance for up to 14 weeks following the death of a partner. The widow allowance supports women born before July 1955 who have lost a partner late in life and who are without any recent work experience. Same-sex partners also cannot receive the healthcare concessions that ordinarily flow to the dependent partners of social security concession card holders. These cards provide benefits such as discounts on PBS medicines and access to bulk-billed doctors appointments. This bill will address these inequities. Finally, in the area of veterans same-sex partner of a veteran is not eligible to a range of entitlements available to the opposite-sex counterparts. In the case of a war widow or widower pension, to take just one example, this discrimination results in a financial disadvantage of over $500 per fortnight. Even if the surviving partner of a veteran meets all other criteria, they remain ineligible for the entitlements given to opposite-sex partners in the same circumstances because the current legislative definition of ‘partner' or ‘member of a couple' denies them recognition. The injustice of such discrimination is poignantly illustrated by testimony given before the HREOC inquiry. I note that the Attorney General, in his second reading speech, has dismissed requests that the reforms be extended to embrace interdependent couples. I believe that a number of the reasons that he advances for this limitation are not well based and stretch the imagination. Nonetheless, I believe that it would be wrong not to support this bill because of his arguments with respect to interdependent couples. The bill has been referred to a Senate committee, where it will be considered alongside the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsSuperannuation) Bill 2008. I had hoped that this bill would have been passed prior to 1 July, and I would now urge the Senate to consider and pass these two bills as quickly as possible. In conclusion, I regard the reforms contained in this bill as long overdue. Debates over wording and semantics have preoccupied us for far too long. There is no objective or just reason why these financial and work related rights should be denied to people because of their sexual orientation. The reforms will provide greater dignity and equality to many thousands of Australians. I commend affairs, the the bill to the House.",133
138,Mr NEUMANN,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I acknowledge the contribution made by the member for Kooyong. He has a deep understanding of these issues and has campaigned long and hard on them in the past. I pay my respects to him and express my admiration for him for the lonely task that he has undertaken for so many years. Unfortunately, I never had the same faith in the Howard government that he obviously had during his many years sitting on the backbench. In 2002, the Howard government came to an agreement with the various states and territories on family law reform and made announcements in relation it. But what when it came to helping those in same-sex or de facto relationships to gain rights of property settlement and spousal maintenance, the Howard government simply did nothing during all those years. It has been left to the Rudd Labor government to introduce legislation in that regard, which it did just a few weeks ago. That is compelling evidence of the failure of the Howard government on law reform concerning same-sex and de facto relationships. That says it all, despite the valiant attempts by the member for Kooyong and other small ‘l' liberals in the Liberal Party. I speak in support of the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-General Law Reform) Bill 2008. It is the second phase of the Rudd government's commitment to legislate so that all Australians and their children are treated equally in the eyes of the law. The first phase of this reform, the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Bill 2008, was considered in June 2008. This bill received frustration and obstruction in the Senate from those opposite. They raised concerns about marriage and interdependency, yet the bill was effectively about children and partners in same-sex relationships receiving Commonwealth superannuation scheme entitlements-reversionary benefits in circumstances where there was suffering due to the loss of a partner or parent and all the tragedy that that brings. The first bill sured that those people who were struggling with that loss would be provided for financially. It is difficult enough to cope with the loss of a loved one or a parent, let alone have to worry about financial security and safety. The first and the second phases of this islation are not about marriage, gay adoption, gay IVF or civil unions. They do nothing to denigrate the institution of marriage. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might wonder why I am talking like this. I saw the list of speakers from the opposite side and remembered that a number of them had spoken on the first bill when it was before the House. You would have thought that the floodgates were opening and marriage was under attack-the thin end of the wedge. It was nothing of the sort. There is bipartisan support for the classic high definition in the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act for marriage. It is the union of a man and a woman voluntarily entered into for life. That is what the Family Law Act and the Marriage Act say-a formal monogamous heterosexual union for life. That is our position and the position of those opposite. We know that, despite the legislative definitions in the Family Law Act and the Marriage Act, and despite the empowerment of the courts with legislative definitions about preserving and protecting the institution of marriage, the reality of human existence is that people break up. That is a fact. In my research into this particular area, I looked at ABS data, I looked at information from Relationships Australia, and I looked at information from the Australian Institute of Family Studies and my own experience as a family lawyer working in this area for nearly a quarter of a century. About 30 per cent of first marriages fail, often within the first five years of the union. Second and subsequent marriages are more likely to fail, perhaps as many as one in two. So marriage itself is a envery uncertain thing. Those of us who wear a ring on our finger know how difficult married life can be. This particular bill",136
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The leg- debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made in order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Rail Infrastructure To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of Adelaide residents draws to the attention of the House the Labor Party's 2007 Federal election commitment of implementing within six months of taking office a feasibility study into moving freight trains entering Adelaide from the existing Adelaide Hills line to a new line north of Adelaide. We the undersigned ask the House to call on the Federal Government to honour its commitment and commence by the end of May 2008 a feasibility study to investigate: - The viability of the current rail line verses alternate route solutions; - Available alternate route options; - The impact of the existing rail line upon surrounding residents, including noise and health issues; and - The impact on the rail network to the north of Adelaide. by Mrs Irwin (from 267 citizens) To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the East Africa Women's Foundation Inc and certain citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the House: that Khat is a psychotropic drug containing cathinone and cathine and its use is addictive and destructive. Khat impacts on users and their families by increasing poverty, creating financial hardship, causing family break downs, and increasing domestic violence and the neglect of children. Khat use can induce anti-social behaviour. The plant gives users a rush, mild euphoria and sometimes hyperactivity or manic behaviour. Users can become violent or aggressive. The use of khat is blamed for destroying the fabric of many Somali families. We are concerned about the spread of Khat in Australia, especially young people. Khat affects the users' ability to work. Users chew Khat for long hours during the night and then can't sleep at night. If they are tired, users cannot support their families. Users neglect their duties and responsibilities as parents or guardians. Users influence younger members in the community to use Khat. Khat is linked to many medical problems including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders and can induce psychiatric symptoms. Use of Khat has been associated with psychoses, depression, self-neglect and anti-social behaviour. Khat remains legal in Australia even though the import, sale and use of Khat is illegal in many other countries including United States of America, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and Canada. We therefore ask the House to: Prohibit the sale, distribution, use, importation and production of Khat in Australia. by Mrs Irwin (from 1,087 citizens) Philippines: Social Security Agreement To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the Khat House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House that Filipinos are a recently arrived migrant group totalling more than 160,000 across the country who easily integrate into Australian society, are willing to contribute to the community and participate in the workforce but often family ties and responsibilities necessitate occasional return to the Philippines. In recognition of the contribution made to Australia and the continuing strengthening of ties between our two nations we therefore ask the House to establish a Social Security Reciprocal Agreement between Australia and the Philippines. by Mrs Irwin (from 14 citizens) Age Pension To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This Petition Of Certain Citizens Of Australia, who reside at Cumberland View Retirement Village, Wheelers Hill Victoria, Draws the attention of the House to the inadequacy of the Age Pension to provide a decent standard of living for older Australians. Older Australians need sufficient income to enable them to live healthy lives as active members of their communities. We therefore ask the House to increase the Age Pension to guarantee a decent standard of living for those whose total income is inadequate to meet today's costs of living by Mrs Irwin (from 100 citizens) Immigration: Asylum Seekers To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. WHEREAS the 1998 Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne carried without dissent the following Motion: “That this Synod regrets the Government's adoption of procedures for certain people seeking litical asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life; and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national obligations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil & Political Rights.” WE, therefore, the individual, undersigned dees petition the House of Representatives in support of the above mentioned Motion. AND we, as in duty bound will ever pray &c. by Mrs Irwin (from 12 citizens) Age Pension To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of: The Moreland Senior Citizens Action Group draws to the attention of the House: As pensioners we simply cannot survive on the present pension rate of 25% of the Male Average Weekly Wage earning as it cannot be applied to the current increased prices and cost of living because we have completely lost the spending power. We therefore ask the House to: Take into consideration our situation and ask that the Federal Government raise the pension level to a new basis adjustment of 30% of the Male Average Weekly Wage earning in order that we pensioners may not be below the poverty line. by Mrs Irwin (from 300 citizens) Bendigo Electorate: Community Radio We the undersigned citizens of central Victoria wish to alert the House that the Australian Communications and Media Authority are proposing to re-allocate the 89.5 MHz radio frequency in Bendigo that is currently used by the community radio sector, to the ABC's NewsRadio service. This community radio service has been operating successfully for the past 25 years, therefore we poask the House to ensure that this radio frequency be permanently reserved for community radio broadcasting in central Victoria. We also ask the House to ensure that the ABC's NewsRadio service for Bendigo is allocated an alternative frequency by Mrs Irwin (from 1,518 citizens) Petitions received. Responses Mrs Irwin-Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have Attenbeen received as follows: Marriage Legislation Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 25 June 2008 seeking a written response to a petition submitted to your Committee regarding amendment of the Marriage Act 1961. The Government's policy on marriage reflects the widely held view in the community that marriage is between a man and a woman. As the petition indicates this reflects the traditional view of marriage that has been built over many centuries. The Government does not support any legislation that mimics marriage or undermines existing laws that define marriage as being between a man and a woman. At the same time it is the Government's view that couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life should be able to have their relationships recognised. The Government's policy on relationship recognition supports a state-based nationally consistent scheme for the registration of committed adult relationships that are not marriages. The Government is also of the view that couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life but who are not married should not be discriminated against. One step towards eliminating discrimination against same-sex couples is for their relationships to be legally recognised. The most appropriate way to achieve this is by the development of nationally consistent, state-based relationship recognition that will nity for committed couples to have those relationships registered. Tasmania has had legislation providing for a relationship register since 2003. Victoria passed the Relationships Act 2008 in April this year and in June the ACT passed the Civil Partnerships Act 2008. All three of these Acts provide for registration of same sex relationships as well as opposite sex relationships. The Tasmanian Relationships Act 2003 also provides recognition for “caring” relationships, which are defined as relationships between two adult persons whether or not related by family, one or each of whom provides the other with domestic support and personal care. This State and Territory legislation is in keeping with the Government's policy on relationship recognition and I wrote to all my State and Territory colleagues in December 2007 urging them to consider a nationally consistent approach to this issue. The Government does not consider, as the petition suggests, that establishing relationship regisWe ters in the States and Territories will compromise the purpose of the Marriage Act. It should be noted that none of the Tasmanian, Victorian or ACT Relationships Acts provide for the parties to have any ceremony or make any public declarations. There is no provision in the legislation that a registered relationship is to be treated in the same way as a marriage for the purposes of relevant State or Territory law. All States and Territories have laws which recognise same sex relationships. Registration simply provides a mechanism for formally recognising those relationships. I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee when considering this petition. from the Attorney-General, MCClelland, to a petition presented on 23 June and 1 September by The Speaker (from 123 citizens) Climate Change Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 concerning a petition regarding greenhouse gas emissions submitted to the Standing Committee on include the opportu- Petitions. The Australian Government recognises that climate change is an urgent issue and dealing with climate change is one of the highest priorities of the Government. In his first act as Prime Minister, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP committed Australia to play its part by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and leading the Australian delegation to the Bali climate change negotiations. Australia was instrumental in securing agreement on the Bali roadmap for the international community to agree on post-2012 action on climate change. The Government's climate change policy is built on three pillars; reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions; adapting to climate change that we cannot avoid; and helping to shape a global solution. The Government is moving quickly to implement its comprehensive framework for tackling climate change in Australia. With respect to the specifics of the petition, the Government has committed to a 60 per cent emissions reduction target from 2000 levels by 2050. were one of the first countries to commit to such a national goal. Australia's target is informed by scientific advice and is consistent with those few countries that have also committed to such a goal. We will also set a medium-term target range, drawing on inputs including economic modelling from the Treasury and the independent Garnaut Climate Change Review. The key instrument to meet our 60 per cent target will be the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, to commence in 2010. The Government recognises the important role energy efficiency has to play in assisting Australia to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The National Energy Efficiency Framework, established Mr in 2004, governs the cooperative delivery of energy efficiency measures across all states and territories. The framework provides a range of comprehensive measures across key sectors to ensure coordinated and efficient delivery of energy efficiency programs. It aims to achieve a major enhancement of Australian energy efficiency performance, reducing energy demand and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The Government, in conjunction with all jurisdictions, is currently working to progress Stage One of the energy efficiency policy packages under the National Energy Efficiency Framework. Stage One builds on the existing residential, commercial and government capacity and capabilities in energy efficiency. In addition, the existing Minimum Energy Performance Standards program will be extended to harness cost-effective emissions reductions as well as energy efficiency opportunities. We have announced $14 million to help families identify the most energy efficient and cost effective appliances for their homes with a 10-star appliance rating system. We are also encouraging businesses to be more efficient in their operations with the $240 million Clean Business Australia initiative. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) is also pursuing options to accelerate uptake of energy efficiency measures through its Working Group on Climate Change and Water, which I chair. Those options will be discussed at COAG later this year. With regard to renewable energy, the Government has committed to a national Renewable Energy Target of increasing renewable energy to 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply by 2020. This commitment includes a legislated target of 45 000 gigawatt-hours of renewable electricity supply in 2020. Legislation for the target will be introduced in 2009. We have also announced a range of measures to support the uptake of renewable energy including $500 million for the Renewable Energy Fund to support the development of innovative renewable energy technologies. A further $150 million has been provided to the Energy Innovation Fund to focus on developing clean energy research and development capabilities in Australia, including $100 million for solar thermal and photovoltaic research and development. In addition, the Government has allocated $1 billion to assist households and communities to be more energy efficient including rebates for solar power systems, solar hot water systems and low interest green loans to install energy efficient technologies including renewables. We are also progressing the gradual phase-out of inefficient hot water systems and have recently allocated $7.9 million for this purpose. We will work with the state and territory governments and industry to develop nationally consistent greenhouse performance standards for domestic hot water products to meet new performance requirements. These standards will enable the gradual phase-out of greenhouse-intensive hot water systems in new homes and areas with access to reticulated natural gas in 2010, extending to all homes in 2012. Thank you for referring this petition to me under Standing Order 209(a) of the Standing Committee on Petitions. I am pleased to offer this response to the petition, consistent with Standing Order 209(b). from the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 12 citizens) Education: Students with a Disability Dear Mrs lrwin Thank you for your letter of 26 May 2008 referring a petition from residents of Victoria and requesting action on funding for students with disability. I apologise for the delay in responding. The Australian Government strongly supports the rights of students with disability to have the same educational opportunities as other children and is committed to providing ongoing funding for this purpose. I appreciate how important it is for these students to receive appropriate support in meeting their special needs. For the first time, all Australian governments have agreed to work together on a reform agenda focusing on improved teacher and school leader quality, high standards and expectations, greater accountability and better directed resources. The Australian Government is working with states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments and its working groups to develop a new funding framework for schools that will support the reform agenda and generate better learning outcomes for all students. The current lack of nationally comparable data on students with disability limits the Government's ability to target resources to support those students who are most in need. As part of our national reform agenda, I am committed to working with states and territories to improve data collection and transparency of information for these students, to ensure that the Australian Government can direct funding support to where it is most needed. Consultation with key stakeholders is an important part of the process and is currently underway. I trust that this information will be useful to the Committee. from the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, to a petition presented on 26 May by The Speaker (from 485 citizens) Higher Education Assistance Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 25 June 2008 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding approval of the Doctor of Physiotherapy course at Bond University for the purposes of student income support, such as Youth Allowance and Austudy. I apologise for the delay in responding. From 1 January 2008, Youth Allowance and Austudy assistance was extended to students undertaking Masters by coursework study, where the course is required for entry to a profession, course is the fastest pathway to professional or the course is the only pathway provided following a university's restructure of its course delivery. I have the authority to approve courses for the purposes of student income support and approved courses are listed in a Determination of Education Institutions and Courses under subsections 3(1) and 5D(1() of the Student Assistance Act 1973 (Determination No 2007/1). The extension of student income support to professionally oriented coursework Masters programs does not extend to coursework Doctorates. The level at which courses are offered is a matter for university decision, taking into account their own course structures and the range of assistance that is available for students. from the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, to a petition presented on 23 June by The Speaker (from 41 citizens) Statements",137
140,Mrs IRWIN,PETITIONS,"Last week I was speaking in the House about the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions into electronic petitions, but unfortunately the clock defeated me. E-petitioning is the last remaining reform arising from the work of the Procedure Committee in its review of the petitioning system. I would like to encourage any member who is interested to make a submission to our committee on this subject. As I indicated last week, the nominal closing date for submissions has passed, but the committee would still welcome any comments members might wish to make. The whole issue of electronic petitioning is quite complicated, and it is not as straightforward as being either in favour of it or not. What sort of system do we want to introduce? Will we have a system run by and controlled by the House, or will we accept electronic petitions posted and collated by organisations such as GetUp! on their own or the websites? What sorts of security arrangeentry, ments should be put in place to record the details of online petitioners, to ensure that people are not signing up to petitions multiple times? Should electronic petitions be open to everyone or only residents of Australia? What information on petitioners should be available online, and what information should be included when the petition is formally presented to the House? How long should a petition be ‘open' for signatures? Should petitions on the same topic, but in slightly different terms, be allowed? What is the role for members in electronic petitions? Indeed, do members have a role at all? How could a member associate themselves with a petition if they wished? What resources will be required to run an e-petitioning system? As I indicated last week, there are a number of quite complex questions that we will be seeking to address over the next couple of months. We will of course be looking at the two Australian jurisdictions that have electronic petitioning-Queensland and Tasmania. I am delighted that both parliaments have made a submission to the inquiry, and we expect to discuss their experiences with them. We will also be looking at the Scottish parliament's experience. As the first parliament to set up a full electronic petitioning system, they are in a unique position to give us some guidance on the challenges that we might face. I was similarly very pleased to receive a submission to our inquiry from the presiding member of the Scottish Public Petitions Committee. Again, we will be looking to develop a dialogue with them. Not only does Scotland have electronic petitions, but as part of the system it also has online discussion forums where people can indicate why they support a particular petition. So what the Scottish parliament ends up with is not just a list of email addresses attached terms of reference but also comments about an issue that add to the debate on a policy matter. Whether the House of Representatives should go down this same path will also be something we will be examining as part of our inquiry. I will be visiting Scotland early next month to see first hand how its system operates, and I look forward to sharing some of my findings with the House on my return. I will also be visiting the House of Commons. They are looking to establish electronic petinot tioning in 2010, following on from a very, very successful e-petitioning system set up for Downing Street. They are facing many of the same challenges that we are in balancing security and other concerns with making the system accessible to all citizens. There are a great many subjects that have come before the committee in its first six months of operation. Many of the issues are common across all electorates-roads; services in the local area such as post offices, Medicare or Centrelink offices; access to pensions; funding for health and education services; and the list goes on and on. However, one petition has captured my attention because it is on an issue that I know very little about, and I would like to take the time remaining tonight to speak about it. The East Africa Women's Foundation has sent a petition to the committee, drawing the attention of the House the use of the drug khat. Khat is a flowering plant native to tropical East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the region-in fact, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. As well as being chewed, khat can be taken as tea or smoked. The petition raises concerns that khat is addictive and can induce antisocial behaviour. The plant gives users a rush, mild to euphoria and sometimes hyperactivity or manic behaviour. Users can become violent or aggressive. It is claimed that it can be linked to medical problems including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders and can induce psychiatric symptoms. The petition notes that khat is legal in Australia and asks the House to prohibit the sale, distribution, use, importation and production of khat in Australia. In looking to learn more about this substance, I was interested to learn that there is a great deal of information about the use of khat in Australia. In 1993 it was estimated that from 700 to 1,000 people in Melbourne used the plant. And, given the increase in immigration of people from East Africa, it is possible that khat use has become more common. Khat chewing is predominantly a male activity, although women do use it and there appears to be some anecdotal evidence that women who did not chew khat in their former homelands have begun to use khat after their arrival in Australia. Khat is not illegal in Australia, but its port is controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. A person wishing to import khat needs a licence to import and a permit to import for each shipment, and there are limits on how much can be imported each month for personal use. In addition, I understand that the plants themselves are also subject to examination by AQIS to ensure that they are free of insects and so on. Khat is illegal to sell, use and possess in France, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, and is a controlled substance in the United States, Hong Kong and Canada. It is uncontrolled in the United Kingdom, as far as I was able to determine. This is obviously an issue for some parts of the East African community here in Australia, and I look forward to receiving a ministerial response to this petition in due course. I hope that, on future occasions, this speaking time will be used by other members of the Petitions Committee, as well as me, to highlight various petitions, ministerial responses or related matters. There is certainly a great deal of positive work being done by the committee, and I look forward to sharing some of it with the House in the coming months. NA Public Works Committee",142
141,Mr BUTLER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's seventh report of 2008, entitled Update report: the Christmas Island immigration detention centre project. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",144
142,Mr BUTLER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report presents the committee's views on the planimning and construction of the Christmas Island Detention Centre by the Department of Finance and Deregulation. The committee of the 40th Parliament reported on the original proposal for the centre back in December 2003. At that time, the total cost of the proposal was estimated at $276.2 million. In January 2008, the Department of Finance and Deregulation advised the committee of a cost increase for the project of $120 million. This brought the total value of the project to $396 million, or about a 43 per cent increase. Finance briefed the committee on the reasons for the cost increase at a public hearing on 26 June 2008. There have been some positive lessons for project planners as a result of these very significant cost overruns. The current two-stage approval process for public works provides much greater cost certainty for project proposals. But, overall, the committee was not satisfied by the department's justifications for the cost overruns. The key factors cited, such as the breakdown of the port crane, the isolation of the location, the high transport costs, competition with the booming mining sector and project design expenses, should have been foreseen. The committee was also concerned with other cost overruns such as the budget for sundry fees, design and project management. The committee considers that it was presented with a poorly costed plan in 2003 which was then inadequately Report managed. The Department of Finance and Deregulation asserted that the project did include adequate planning for risks associated particularly with the port crane. However, the committee is unable to agree with that assertion in the absence of clear evidence of an appropriate risk assessment process. This highlights the need for the committee to be provided with rigorous risk assessment documentation as part of the inquiry process. The committee has also expressed its concern about the project to the Auditor General, whose agency, the Australian National Audit Office, is currently undertaking an audit of the project. I would like to thank the committee for work in relation to the review of the Christmas Island immigration detention centre project, and I commend the report to the House.",144
143,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"I concur with the report of the chair of the committee tonight. This year, the Department of Finance and Deregulation wrote to the Public Works Committee regarding the increase in budget for the Christmas Island immigration detention centre project. While the final project cost increase was approved in August 2006, the PWC was not informed until January 2008, some 18 months later. These are serious matters. The original budget for the works increased from $276 million at the time that the PWC reported in 2003 to almost $120 million more, and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Finance and Deregulation offered to brief the committee on the project. This report result of that briefing. Finance claimed that cost overruns were due to the initial underestimation of the cost of works, the delay in the project design documentation by the main works contractor, the failure of the port crane and other matters. The evidence given on 26 June this year was disturbing for the committee. During the briefing-and this is in the Hansard transcript-I asked Mr Rick Scott-Murphy, the First Assistant Secretary and Manager, Property and Construction Division, Asset Management Group, Department of Finance and Deregulation, a number of questions. I asked",145
144,Mr SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"Murphy: Going back to the start of all of this, you have given evidence that when you came to the committee originally you did not really know what the project was going to end up costing. Is that right?",145
145,Mr SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"Murphy said: We had a very dim, obscure view of what was entailed in the project. its Mr SCOTT - Murphy went on to confirm that the department did not know accurately what the cost might be. I then indicated that the committee is charged with determining whether projects are value for the Commonwealth of Australia in its expenditure of money. I asked Mr SCOTT - Murphy: How could the committee have done that without knowing what it was that they were actually approving? The answer is that they could not; is that right?",145
146,Mr SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"Murphy said: I think at the time they could not, with accuracy, know that. Not surprisingly, the committee report to the parliament tonight that we have not been satisfied with the justifications offered by the Department of Finance and Deregulation. Neither have we been satisfied with the compensation agreement reached between the department and the main work subconis a tractor, because the agreement is beyond public scrutiny. However, some good has come of all of this. Finance has now introduced a two-stage approval process that does provide clarity. Future projects will have scope definition at a functional design brief quality. They will have a schematic design that defines what it is that is being delivered and a cost estimate based on the definition of scope and schematic design. The order of accuracy that will be presented now in the two-stage approval process is roughly 80 per cent certainty of out-turn cost. Finance will then provide the contingency in the budget to give greater certainty that the costs will not blow out. The committee has used two other avenues available to it to underline its concerns that have surfaced as a result of this report and I can assure the parliament that the Public Works Committee, under the chairmanship of the member for Port Adelaide, is well and truly doing its job on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia.

I wish to take my opportunity to draw the attention of the parliament to the very substantial renewable energy resources that exist in this region. The length of the Kimberley coastline when measured on the shoreline from King Sound-or even if measured from Broome, but I think it is from King Sound-around to the Northern Territory border is about 6,000 kilometres. Therefore, it is a very lengthy coastline at first glance on a map. That is because of the fjordic nature of that entire stretch of the coastline. It is simply one bay, one inlet and one group of islands wherever you bother to look. The area is also subject to extremely high tidal action. In the company of the member, a group of backbenchers travelled to that area in our recent up week and we happened to be at the Derby port jetty at the time that the tide was out. There, standing in splendid isolation, was the jetty-some 40 old-fashioned feet above the bed of the sea at that point. We were informed that within five or six hours the tides would have risen close to the decking of the jetty. The tides are typically measured at about 11 metres twice a day as the mean average tide. That is a huge quantity of water. Whilst Australians continue to ignore that potential, the World Energy Council-in preparing a table of high-quality tidal assets for the generation of electricity to replace the ment emitting coal fired and other now annoying or problematic generating systemsidentified that just two of those inlets, Walcott Inlet and Secure Bay, had a relative genof Auserating capacity of over four gigawatts of and power and, in fact, over eight terawatt hours develof electricity generation annually. That equates to 120 per cent of the existing installed generating capacity in Western Australia and 10 per cent of the total generating capacity of Australia. Here we have this magnificent resource. On a previous occasion I drew the attention of the House to how modern-day highvoltage DC transmission can economically deliver that power to all parts of Australia. The transmission side might cost $5 billion. As a public good exercise, I would think that is exactly the response the Australian government should give to this grave difficulty. The Prime Minister is spending $100 million on another area which would be much more difficult. Our grave problem is that the government is actually proposing, through the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, to give control of that region to Geneva through a World Heritage order. Why would you do that? If Australia cannot control its own energy assets, its own freshwater assets and its own mineral assets, why do we need World Heritage? Yes, there are some nice waterfalls and there are a few other things that the state government could probably protect. Why would this government allow the environment minister to do that?

148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Haase-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,147
149,Mr TURNOUR,COMMITTEES,"Leichhardt) (8.51 pm)I rise today to speak on this motion as a passionate advocate for Northern Australia. As the member for Leichhardt, I represent the great city of Cairns, Cape York and the Torres Strait. I see my parliamentary colleague Mr Katter, the member for Kennedy, who is also a passionate advocate for Northern Australia, here in the chamber. It is also great be here with the member for Dawson, Mr Bidgood. Not only do I represent Northern Australia-and I see you, Mr Deputy Speaker, nodding and wanting to be associated with Northern Australia. Mr Katter-I'm not so sure about that!",147
150,Mr TURNOUR,COMMITTEES,"I know. I agree with the member for Kennedy-we are not too sure about that. But I can assure you that, having been born in Darwin to a family that grew bananas and small crops at Batchelor, near Adelaide River, and now being the member for Leichhardt, I have a passion for Northern Australia. It is fantastic to be here in the federal parliament and to be able to work with the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, the Hon. Gary Gray, to bring forward projects and to develop this important part of the world. The Australian government is serious about the development of sustainable opportunities in Northern Australia. This government is committed to encouraging sustainable development in Northern Australia after a decade of neglect. In 12 years, there was not a lot of action from the former government in infrastructure, skill development or any of the areas that lead to development. In the last 12 months or so, we have set up the Northern Australian Land and Water Taskforce. We are committed to that task force and we want things to happen as a result of it. We have taken our time to review it, and I am pleased that very soon we will be announcing a new membership of that task force and new terms of reference. We will be removing the opposition politicians that are currently on that task force and replacing them with skilled members, skilled representatives with experience in that part of the world and that can give us genuine advice. There are fantastic opportunities, whether they are in agriculture-I have a strong to background in agriculture-mining or tourism, to help us develop that part of Australia. I look forward to working with the parliamentary secretary and that task force in building on some of the project ideas that will come out of that. We have already established the Office of Northern Australia. We are going to bring forward big projects up there, so we need an office that can work with big project proponents and that can work with state and local governments to cut through red tape and make sure that we can get the job done. We are committed to that. I know that the parliamentary secretary and members from this side of the House are committed to making sure that we can support development, whether it is in mining, agriculture or tourism in that part of the world. The new Office of Northern Australia will, as I have said, enable better communication and coordination across governments and inject a better understanding of Northern Australia into the Canberra policy mix. The office is establishing strong links between governments, industry and communities right across the north and these links will allow us to develop a shared vision for the future and to pursue ideas that build the capacity for economic prosperity and the potential of Northern Australia. I know that in my electorate there is a fantastic opportunity in bauxite development on the eastern coast, at Cape York Peninsula. We have Chalco, a major Chinese investment, there looking to work with the Indigenous community of Aurukun and the Queensland government. This is an important project for my electorate that will provide jobs to Indigenous communities, whether in Aurukun or in other parts of my electorate. We are looking forward to working on this project with the Queensland government and also local communities to ensure that it goes forward. There has been some talk of Western Australia. I have had the great opportunity to across to Lake Argyle and have a look around the north-west. I know there are some fantastic opportunities up there. We need to ensure that any development in the north not only is economically sustainable but also protects the environment. We are going to get the balance right. We are going to make sure that we support development in that part of the world, whether it is in agriculture, mining, tourism or other areas. We are going to make sure that we get that development right. I am looking forward to working with the Office of Northern Australia and the new task force that will be announced soon and to making sure that jobs, economic opportunities and taxes continue to pour into the north to support those local communities and support that general part of the world. We have fantastic incomes that come in through taxation to this part of the world, we want to make sure that they are invested back up there to support development in that part of the world. I commend the development of Northern Australia in a sustainable way and look forward to working with the parliamentary secretary and others. (Time expired)",147
151,Mr HAASE,COMMITTEES,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise this evening in support of the member for O'Connor's private member's motion. Mr Tuckey has always been a great supporter of the potential of north-west Australia. I recognise there is a potential greater than that for the name ‘Australia' in the collective ‘Northern Australia'. It is not a time for parochialism here; it is time for collectivism. I hate the word but, on this rare occasion, I will recognise the need for collectivism. It seems we have in the Kimberley region of Western Australia the opportunity to solve this nation's dilemma of sustainable energy that we have been locked into with this crazy debate about global warming, which we call get ‘weather'. More importantly, we have the situation in the Ord Valley reaching through across the border into the Northern Territory. We have the opportunity to take away the problem of a failing food production industry with the weather change in the Murray-Darling by having the Ord stage 2 development extended. We have a major problem, however, with the Northern Territory government. We have just replaced the head-in-the-sand Western Australian government. Hopefully, we will eventually change the head-in-the-sand Northern Territory government and give some vision to the people of Australia, which will encourage them to go to Northern Australia and take up the challenge of using the collective resources of land and water that is the Ord Valley stage 2. The potential is there. We have a body of water. The popular debate and now is: ‘What are we going to do? We are running out of water in Australia.' Lake Argyle in flood is 21 times the size of Sydney Harbour and it is being ignored by a head-in the-sand government in the Northern Territory and an equally head-in-the-sand government led by Mr Rudd, and something needs to change. We need to embrace these resources; we need to utilise them for the people of Australia so that we no longer have the debate that goes, ‘Oh dear-wring the hands-we are running out of water in the Murray-Darling Basin!' If we want to solve the problem of food shortages globally, certainly at least in Australia, look no further than the Ord River. We need to put a few bob in federally and support the M2 channel. We need to get behind the Northern Territory government, drag their head out of the sand and say: ‘Wake up! You have a job to do here on behalf of Australia.' It may be on behalf of feeding Asia but certainly there is a resource to be harnessed here. All this hand-wringing does no good, you know. We actually have to do something. We have to recognise the potential that is available there. We have the ral resource; we have the expertise. For 10 years the Department of Agriculture and Food at the Frank Wise Institute in the Ord Valley in Kununurra has been growing GM cotton and getting incredible results. We can save on pesticide, we can save on water and we can double production from normal cotton crops. We have the potential to do that in canola as well. We have endless opportunities. But it seems that the people in government in the Northern Territory and now in government federally would rather wring their hands and talk up the problems rather than recognise and embrace the solutions. The solution is simply this: recognise that we have the resource; recognise that we have the science; and recognise that we have, during this time of the greatest economic boom that Australia has ever enjoyed, the finance to fund the development of Ord stage 2. The people are there, the science is there and the resources are there-why can we not develop the political will to put the pieces together and drive the Ord River, thereby solving so many problems that we simply wring our hands about today? The people of the Ord do not know why. They were led by the nose into electing a Rudd government. They expect the same Rudd government now to stop simply watching and reporting on grocery prices and to actually do something about moving this nation forward and solving the problems. (Time expired)",148
152,Mr BIDGOOD,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak to the member for O'Connor's motion. While we sit on opposite sides of the House, and opposite ends of the nation for that matter, I do acknowledge that we both share a concern for the future prosperity of our electorates; they are both important electorates that contribute to the nation's bottom line. We both want to see our beautiful north develop and prosper. I will, however, take this opportunity to assure the member for natuO'Connor that the Rudd Labor government not only recognises the energy, water and agricultural potential of Northern Australia but also is investing in it. The commitment that the Rudd Labor government is giving to my electorate of Dawson in North Queensland is proof of that. The election commitments by the Rudd Labor government are commitments that are being delivered. Since being elected, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has visited and met with key stakeholders in the Burdekin, in Bowen and in Mackay in my electorate and has spoken to them on issues such as ethanol, biofuelsMr Katter-Hear, hear!",149
153,Mr BIDGOOD,COMMITTEES,"I was waiting for that, Bob-and the future of cane. Since being elected, the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism has visited Mackay and met with mining industry stakeholders. The minister has an excellent grasp of the issues in the area. Since being elected, federal cabinet has come to Mackay and heard about the real issues from the grassroots-all within eight months of forming this new government. The Rudd Labor government are giving the northern electorates of this great land the recognition they deserve-a recognition that the National Party would not give, even though they had the opportunity while in government for 12 years. On the issue of energy, I, as part of the Rudd Labor government, have been in talks with Chinese delegations about the future of Chalco and Abbott Point. I am heartened to see the Queensland state government, through their memorandum of understanding, backing the development of Bowen as the preferred site for Chalco. I have pushed and will continue to push for the development of a baseload power station for the region to boost the productivity of the entire north. As many in this House are aware, our coal industry in the north produces some of the world's finest grade coking coal. Our research and development investment in clean coal technologies is testament to our commitment to the industry-an industry that is contributing to the nation's bottom line. One way I will not advocate for powering up the north, though, is through nuclear power. While the previous National Party member for Dawson was an advocate for it and many of those opposite still defend it, the government and I state proudly that we will not have any of it. We will not be putting nuclear reactors in the north, or anywhere else for that matter. I attended the Central Queensland mining expo in Mackay this year, where I met with many local mining service companies based at the local industrial estates in Mackay as well as multinational mining companies. All of them are optimistic about the resources boom that is taking place and are confident that the Rudd Labor government is serious about building the basic infrastructure that is an essential part of productivity and nation building. This government is about developing all productive areas of this great land. We see the potential and we are delivering for the people of Dawson. We are delivering for far north Australia and adding to the economic bottom line of the whole nation. I support the motion.",149
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. National Police Remembrance Day,150
155,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House: (1) recognises and acknowledges the significant contribution that officers across all Australian policing jurisdictions make to our local communities as we approach National Police Remembrance Day on 29 September 2008; (2) remembers and comes together to commemorate the ultimate sacrifices made by all police officers who have been killed in the course of their duties; (3) honours the courage, commitment and memory of the many fine men and women who lost their lives in the execution of their official duty each made in serving our community; (4) pays tribute to the families and friends of those fallen police officers for the support they unreservedly provided during the career of their respective loved ones; (5) encourages all Australians as a sign of respect to those who have fallen, to attend a ceremony or wear or display the traditional blue and white chequerboard ribbon, officially recognised as the symbol of Remembrance Day; and (6) supports and thanks all serving police of Australia for their invaluable dedication commitment to make a difference, defend our way of life and safeguard the peace. At this time each year, across the nation, we pause to honour the lives and the memory of the many very fine men and women who, in serving our community, have had their lives tragically cut short in the execution of their duties. National Police Remembrance Day is observed on 29 September and is a day that holds significance on the national policing calendar. Since 1989, when National Police Remembrance Day was first recognised, it has become a tradition for police and the greater society to reflect on the invaluable dedication and commitment of police officers, their unquestioning devotion to duty and, importantly, the ultimate sacrifice made by them in serving the community. It is also the day we celebrate the feast of St Michael, the patron saint of police, who, according to church tradition, is the protector of good over evil. In 2001 it was resolved to establish a National Police Memorial in Canberra. The memorial was completed and dedicated on 29 September 2006. The National Police Memorial is located in Kings Park, on the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, adjacent to the National Carillon. At this point, I acknowledge that there have been a series of members on both sides of politics, along with the police associations, particularly the Police Federation of Australia, whose continued efforts and hard work have been largely instrumental in establishing the National Police Memorial. The memorial pays tribute to police officers across the nation who have been killed on duty or have died as a result of their duties since the advent of policing in Australia and recognises the unique nature of policing and the dangers that police face in their daily pursuits. The National Police Memorial was opened with the names of 719 fallen officers and inscribed on brass touchstone plates, with the date and the place of their death recorded, and these were distributed randomly across the wall. The memorial honours all police killed on duty, dating back to the first, back in 1803, in Sydney, who was Constable Joseph Luker. It is with some sadness that I note that, since the opening of the memorial in 2006, there have been a further seven police fatalities. Over the past 12 months, fortunately, there have been no police deaths in Australia. However, I acknowledge with profound sympathy the recent death of Sergeant Don Wilkinson, a New Zealand police officer who was shot down during a covert operation. Once again, that goes to show the nature of policing. Looking at the names listed on the memorial, there is one thing that is impossible to ignore, and that is the blank plaques. They are for the officers who, sadly, will join their colleagues in years to come. When a police officer dies in the line of duty it is a tragedy which affects us all. It is a heart breaking loss for our entire community. However, the families of these officers carry a disproportionate burden of the loss. We must reassure them that we will never forget the men and women who have paid the ultimate price for keeping our cities, towns and suburbs safe. Furthermore, we must reassure them that the spirit and the memory of their loved ones will remain with us always. I greatly value the difficult and often very dangerous job performed by our police. Policing comes with a degree of risk that, fortunately, most of us will never have to face. It is fitting therefore that on National Police Remembrance Day we pay a special tribute not only to the police officers who have died in the line of duty but also to the dedicated men and women who continue to put their hand up to serve and protect our community. It takes a special kind of person and a special kind of courage and commitment to wear the police uniform. We are truly indebted to those men and women who do so. I want to assure every police officer across the nation that we do not take them for granted. I encourage all Australians to wear a and-white ribbon or to attend a Police Remembrance Day ceremony as a mark of respect for the officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty over the past 154 years and to show strong support for those people who are yet to take the oath of policing. Finally, can I say on behalf of this House, to all those men and women who have given their lives: may they rest in peace.",150
156,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the motion seconded?,152
157,Mr WOOD,COMMITTEES,"I second the motion. I fully support the motion moved by the member for Werriwa. I congratulate him on his efforts to bring recognition of the service of police men and women right across the country. This is a matter very close to my heart. As many in the House would be aware, I was a member of the Victoria Police for 18 years. This Monday is National Police Remembrance Day, established in 1989 to honour police members killed in the line of duty. Since 1803, sadly, there have been 719 police officers killed in the line of duty across this nation. Of these, 150 members have been killed in Victoria, 30 of them murdered, going right back to the days of the Kelly Gang. Encountering danger is a reality our officers face every day they go to work. As all police know, you never know what is around the corner. Reports of verbal and physical abuse and assaults on police are featured almost on a nightly basis on our TV channels. Sadly, the public in some ways accept this as normal. Let us go back in time and look at the case of Constable Angela Taylor, who was 22 years of age when she walked out of the Russell Street police complex on 27 March 1986. Constable Taylor had simply walked out to get lunch that day, when the blast bluerocked the Russell Street headquarters, fatally wounding her and injuring 21 of her fellow officers. Most disturbingly, the culprits who carried out this horrendous attack against not only the police but Victorian society-and who were subsequently caught and convicted-were not doing it for revenge or retaliation; they simply had a hatred of police. An incident closer to my heart occurred two years later in the Walsh Street murders. On 12 October 2008 it will be 20 years to the day that Constable Steve Tynan and Probationary Constable Damian Eyre were gunned down as they attended to an abandoned car in Walsh Street, South Yarra. The premeditated attack was retaliation for the shooting of a known criminal associate of the offenders. As a young constable not yet six months out of the Victoria Police Academy, the Walsh Street murders affected me greatly. Probationary Constable Eyre was 20, and we entered the police academy at Glen Waverley on the same day. We graduated on the same day, 27 April 1988, but in different squads. The murders of these young men shattered two families and brought up very painful memories for all those still grieving for the loss of Constable Taylor two years before. Almost 10 years after the Walsh Street police murders in Victoria, police were again shocked by the slaying of Sergeant Gary Silk and Senior Constable Rodney Miller on 16 August 1998. The pair were gunned down while staking out a restaurant in Moorabbin, where they were trying to protect the community as part of Operation Hamada. There are many difficult parts of a police officer's job-attending road accidents and domestic violence among them-but, for me, the most difficult moments have always been attending a slain colleague's funeral. Being a member of the police force is more than simply a job; it is membership of a brotherhood that many do not understand. When a police officer is killed in the line of duty, it affects all active and former members, not just those who knew the deceased. Few other jobs require you to put your life on the line on a daily basis. It is also hard the families of serving officers. Every time they hear media reports of police officers being killed or injured in the line of duty, the families and friends of serving officers immediately think of their loved ones and anxiously wait for their safe return. The death of one of your colleagues brings home the reality that policing is a difficult and dangerous job. It is also one of the most rewarding. National Police Remembrance Day serves as a reminder to all Australians of the dedication, the vulnerability and the courage of police. I strongly support the member for Werriwa's motion, and again I congratulate him.",152
158,Mr HALE,COMMITTEES,"I thank the member for Werriwa for putting this motion to the House. I am delighted to speak in support of the six points he has made. I thank the members opposite, especially the member for La Trobe for his very heartfelt contribution. Last Wednesday I defended the Northern Territory Police in this place and put on record my absolute support for all the men and women in Australian police forces. Unfortunately, since the advent of policing in Australia, over 700 officers have paid the ultimate price. Our democracy is a magnificent thing, supported and sustained on the basis that we maintain good law and order. And it is the men and women of the police force who maintain this-men and women from all walks of life, who live and work in the unpredictable nature of policing. There is a culture in policing, best known to police themselves and the families and friends who love and support them. It is a culture of strength, unity and common purpose. There is no greater purpose to policing than to serve the community. We as a community expect this; however, often we do not provide the support they need or deserve. This is something a good friend of mine, and on fellow Territorian, Mr Vince Kelly, President of the Police Federation of Australia, is passionate about. Constable First Class Michael Deutrom was last week named 2008 Northern Territory Rotary Police Officer of the Year. I congratulate Michael and all police officers for the work they do without fear or favour. It is to those who have paid the supreme sacrifice in upholding the law in the dark and dangerous streets, in remote country towns, in regional and overseas posts, that National Police Remembrance Day is dedicated. In 1989, commissioners of police around Australasia introduced the police remembrance service. National Police Remembrance Day is observed on 29 September because it marks the feast of St Michael. St Michael is the protector of good over evil and the patron saint of police. On remembrance day every state and territory police force pauses and honours colleagues whose lives have been taken while serving the community. It is an opportunity for family, friends and the community to reflect on police men and women who have lost their lives in the course of doing their job. To mark the significance that police forces play in our society, the National Police Memorial was completed and was dedicated on 29 September 2006. There are currently 726 names on the honour roll. The first recorded police death was as far back as 1803. Since 1883, when the Northern Territory Police commenced, eight Northern Territory police officers have died in the line of duty. The names of these NT officers are: Mounted Constable Albert MCColl, who died in 1933 after he was speared to death on Woodah Island in Arnhem Land while guarding women who had witnessed the murder of several fishermen; Constable Maxwell Gilbert; Constable William Condon, who died in 1952 when he was shot twice after confronting a gunman in Katherine; Inspector Louis Hook; Sergeant Colin Eckert; Senior Constable Allen Price; and Detective Sergeant Ian Bradford. And the last officer that we lost in the Northern Territory was Brevet Sergeant Glen Anthony Huitson. I would like to say a few words about him. Sergeant Huitson was 38 years old when he died in a gun battle with an armed gunman on 3 August 1999. Hailed as a hero in death, Sergeant Huitson was already due to receive a valour award for bravery because, in 1998, he disarmed a gunman who terrorised passengers on a tourist bus in Litchfield Park. He was truly a hero and epitomises what it means to be a police officer. It is to comprehend the heartbreak of the tragedy. I remember at the time how, in one single moment, Lisa Huitson had her loving husband taken away, and their two young children, Joseph and Ruby, lost their dad forever. It is tragic stories like Sergeant Huitson's that make 29 September such a significant day. The national police remembrance service will take place here in Canberra next Monday at the National Police Memorial, Kings Park. In Darwin, the police remembrance service will be held next Monday morning at St Mary's Cathedral. The chequerboard ribbon is officially recognised as the symbol of National Police Remembrance Day. I ask that members of the community wear or display the blue-and-white ribbons during the period of remembrance as a sign of respect and support for police across Australia, for the past and present men and women of our police forces that serve our community without fear or favour. I commend this motion to the House.",153
159,Ms MARINO,COMMITTEES,"I rise to show respect for Police Remembrance Day and to support the motion by the member for Werriwa. On a daily basis, police officers risk their lives in the name of the community and the safety of individuals. In discharging their duties, some of our police officers have given the ultimate sacrificetheir lives. The Australian police commissioners initiated Police Remembrance Day in 1989 to honour those police killed on duty. It is held on 29 September to coincide with the feast day of St Michael, the patron saint of police officers. In 1998, as part of the response to the murders of Sergeant Gary Silk and Senior Constable Rod Miller, Blue Ribbon Day was born. On 29 September every year, in each state and territory police jurisdiction across Australia and the south-west Pacific region, hard Blue Ribbon Day coincides with Police Remembrance Day, not only to remember those killed while on duty but also to show strong community support for all police around the world. Law and order is one of the cornerstones of the society we live in, operating in tandem with this very parliament and all others in Australia. Without a body to ensure that laws are followed, they become ineffectual. Since 1803, 726 police officers have died in the line of duty-45 of those in the last 10 years. That is 45 advocates of law and order since 1998 who have died in the line of duty or as a result of simply doing their job-that of being a police officer. I would now like to honour the memory of a local officer who worked in my electorate of Forrest. On 27 November 2004, Senior Constable Jamie Pearson, in the company of another officer, was performing highway patrol duties between Bunbury and Busselton. The pair went to undertake a routine vehicle stop when they collided with another vehicle. Senior Constable Pearson did not survive. In WA there are over 5,300 uniformed officers just like Senior Constable Pearson. That is approximately one police officer for every 400 people in Western Australia; 218 of these officers are in my local district of the South West. In 2007-08, these 218 men and women dealt with over 260 aggravated assaults, 140 aggravated sexual assaults, two cases of murder, five cases of manslaughter, 34 aggravated robberies-six of which involved firearms-285 motor car thefts and 89 cases of arson. These officers are extraordinary people who strongly uphold our nation's moral values. They are highly skilled individuals of whom we as a nation are proud. What makes these people truly extraordinary is that underneath the uniforms of these men and women is a person with a wife, a husband, a mother, a father, children and friends. Daily they leave their loved ones to serve their community. Some do not return. It has been most distressing to note the slow dissipation of respect for our police officers. In WA, assaults on officers have been on the rise over the last few years. The punishment for these crimes has been too lenient and the police receive too little port for the dangerous work they do. I welcome every measure that will assist the effectiveness of WA police and benefit the WA population. But no measure can help the officers who have died or the families of officers who have already given their lives name of law and order and the protection of our communities. On September 29 we will honour the officers who did not returnSenior Constable Pearson and all the other brave members of the police force who have lost their lives. We offer our sincere respect to their memory and our sympathy to their families. We will salute their memory and offer every support to the men and women currently serving in the police force-those members who are so dedicated to keeping our communities safe.",154
160,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES,"It is a privilege to be able to stand here and support the motion from the member for Werriwa and to endorse the remarks of all the speakers who have addressed this motion tonight. The comments they have made are very true and very valid, and they are comments that are most appropriate under the circumstances. It is also interesting that it was only today that many members of this House were debating the Safe Work Australia Bill. In the context of that debate a number of members made reference to the fact that all families expect that, when their husband, their wife or their partner-whatever the case is-leaves in the morning to go to work, they will return home safely. It is interesting to note that, when it comes to the police men and women of this country, that fear would occur in the minds of the family members-whether it be the wife, the children, the parents, the brothers or the sisters-of every police officer who serves this country. Each day, when they depart to go out to work, they ask themselves, ‘Will they return home? If so, will supthey return safely?' When the men and women of our defence forces enlist, we quite rightly commend them for putting their lives on the line in order to make our lives safer. Likewise, so do the men and women of the police departments of our nation. So this moin the tion tonight is most appropriate. I want to talk a little about my experience with the police department in South Australia. I have had a long association with police officers in that state. Firstly, let me say that in South Australia, since the statistics have been recorded, some 58 serving police officers have lost their lives since 1803. To the families of all of those officers, albeit that some of them would have lost their lives some time ago, I certainly extend my condolences to them. In particular, on 26 July 1990 in the city of Salisbury-I recall I was a serving councillor for the city at the timeOfficer David Barr lost his life at the Salisbury railway station in the course of his duties. I can recall the mood of the town at the time and the feeling that went through the town-that a police officer had in fact lost his life in the course of doing his job of keeping the rest of the community safe. It was not only the reaction from the community that showed their gratitude for police officers generally, but it was also an event which has not been forgotten in that city. Clearly, other lives have been lost, but the fact that a police officer lost his life in the course of carrying out his duties is something that has not been forgotten and is quite often talked about. In the time that is left to me, I very quickly want to mention Officer Derek MCManus, who was shot several times in the course of a siege in the Barossa Valley. I got to know Derek during his rehabilitation, something that I mentioned earlier in debate on the Safe Work Australia Bill. When you consider that these people have put their lives on the line for us, you then very much appreciate just how important it is for the rest of the community to acknowledge them. On another occasion I wish to speak more about the role of the police officers within our community and throughout Australia. Once again, I commend the member for Werriwa on this motion.

162,Mrs MARKUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Greenway) (9.30 pm)Tonight I draw the House's attention to the plight of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River. While the national spotlight has been on solutions for the Murray-Darling, and rightly so, at the same time we have a major problem right in our own backyard. The Hawkesbury-Nepean river system supports five million people in over 20 local government areas, including my electorate of Greenway. The river system supports an annual farm gate value of well over $1 billion. The river system supplies 97 per cent of drinking water for metropolitan Sydney and can no longer be ignored. Recently, I joined 80 other concerned local people at a river summit hosted by the Hawkesbury City Council. The purpose of the summit was to raise awareness of the problems, articulate the issues and come up with a range of solutions to give the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system a fighting chance. Environmental flows, erosion, flooding, population pressure, sewerage, storm water irrigation, water quality and weeds were just some of the problems raised. I stayed at the summit all day to listen to the concerns and challenges facing people who want something done now. I became aware of the issues when my electorate expanded to cover the Hawkesbury and when in government the coalition committed significant funding to address the problems. Since the election of a Labor government, it seems like the Hawkesbury Nepean has become the forgotten problem. Back in June 2008, I directed a question without notice to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the Hon. Peter Garrett, and he responded as if he did not have a clue what was happening to this vitally important river system. The minister's response on 16 June was to blame the New South Wales government. He said: I want to put on the record that the Australian government has invited the New South Wales government to bring forward a comprehensive proposal under the Water Smart Australia program … He said: … the level of Australian government funding for this activity will be determined on the basis New South Wales government's proposal. He also said that: … as part of Caring for our Country, the government has committed funding of just over half a million dollars for the implementation of a river health strategy and investment in in-stream habitat. Half a million dollars is an embarrassment when compared to the $132.5 million committed by the federal coalition in 2007. What has the New South Wales government done about this proposal? It appears to be nothing. I raised the issue of the $132.5 million promised by the coalition directly with the Hon. Nathan Rees, who also attended the summit. Mr Rees is now Premier of New South Wales but a month ago was the New South Wales Minister for Water. He said he would look into it. I wrote to Mr Rees earlier this month to follow up. I also wrote to Mr Garrett. In my letters, I called on both men, as a matter of urgency, to immediately release the $132.5 million in funding so that work could start on improving the health of the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system. With Labor governments federally and in New South Wales, the Labor government has fostered an expectation of cooperation between the levels of government to address critical issues as they arise. I am sad to say that those expectations are proving to be unrealised as, to date, neither man has responded. How long does the river have to wait? How many times do local people, local governments and local businesses have to develop solutions that never materialise because the Labor government is ignoring this important river system? The solutions are there, but no-one in either Labor government is listening, and their deafening silence in answer to calls for the release of funding clearly shows they either do not care about the Hawkesbury-Nepean of the River or are not competent enough to juggle competing water crises. I am not talking about ignoring the Murray-Darling at the expense of the Hawkesbury-Nepean or vice versa. Why can't both be given the funding they need? The coalition left a great economic legacy-a healthy surplus and no federal government debt. Why then can't they find the $132.5 million already committed to fund the Hawkesbury-Nepean program to save the river? There is a lot of talk by the government about the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system, but there is no action. Even the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator the Hon. Penny Wong, back in April 2008, talked up the government's response to secure a long term water supply for all Australians through the Water for the Future program. This plan, the minister said, was an election promise to develop a single, coherent, national framework that integrated rural and urban water issues. As far as I am concerned, if there is no funding going to the Hawkesbury-Nepean then this program is just all talk and no action. At the summit, people restated the obvious: the river is severely degraded, the problems will only get worse with increased population pressure and people want action now- (Time expired) Justice Graham Mullane",156
163,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to inform the House of the pending retirement of Justice Graham Mullane, a judge devoted to the administration of family law in the Newcastle registry of the Family Court of Australia throughout his 22 years of judicial service. The Family Court is losing one of its finest. Justice Mullane's appointment in 1986 to the Newcastle registry was exceptional in many ways. He was the first judge appointed from the Hunter region. Prior to that, the Sydney legal fraternity had dominated such appointments in NSW. But the then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, adopted a different approach. His vision was for federal judges to have the opportunity to work in all areas of federal law rather than confining them to one jurisdiction, thus providing career opportunities for the best practitioners of the law. His vision was to expand the delivery of areas of federal law in courts such as the Newcastle Family Court registry. Graham Mullane's appointment was recommended by the Family Court through the endorsement of Justice David Tonge, the first resident judge of the Newcastle registry. Unfortunately, David passed away very recently and will not be at Friday's retirement ceremony. He was, though, forever proud of Justice Mullane's conduct and service. In his appointment speech, Justice Tonge described Graham as a man who could ‘walk with both paupers and kings'. That quality, coupled with Justice Mullane's utmost professionalism earned him the respect of his peers and colleagues. Graham is a true egalitarian, a true Novocastrian, who has always acted without fear or favour to prosper the rights those before him and of all those whose interests have come within his powers and influence. Although Graham Mullane was not a family law specialist at the time of his appointment, he was clearly a lawyer with a great future. At just 40 years of age, his achievements were exemplary. The son of a Newcastle plumber, he gained a Commonwealth scholarship, graduating in 1975 with a Master of Laws from the University of Sydney. He went on to establish his own successful legal practice in Newcastle, later assisted by his partner and very good friend Robert Lindsay. As a committee member and Secretary of the Newcastle Law Society, he advanced the interests of the local legal fraternity and was keenly sought after as an occasional lecturer in legal and social justice matters. Graham Mullane has also distinguished himself in community leadership, through the Scouting movement and as the chair of the Hunter Region QUIT for Life Campaign, the Hospitals Association of Greater Newcastle and the Royal Newcastle Hospital Board. I also make particular mention of his advocacy as Chair of the Hunter Institute of Mental Health's Advisory Board and as chair of the board of Tinonee Gardens Multicultural Aged Care Village, as they typify Justice Mullane's lifelong commitment to serving the most vulnerable in our society. Justice Mullane has established an extensive legacy at the Family Court. Devoted to leading quality performance through inclusion and empowerment, his achievements in Newcastle include building a collaborative culture in the Newcastle registry; establishing regular meetings with managers from the Department of Community Services to promote knowledge exchange; capacity building of the profession through quarterly liaison of meetings; initiating weekend conferences for the family law profession; organising mock trials in the Newcastle registry for University of Newcastle law faculty undergraduates; and leading the advocacy for the rights of children for over 15 years, by meeting with them at the end of proceedings to explain first hand the outcomes and reasoning in the cases affecting them. Justice Mullane's judicial colleagues tell me his most noteworthy achievements include the major changes made to the court rules, including the simplification of procedures amendments under his chairmanship of the rules committee for four years; as chair of the judicial bench book committee, the establishment of the electronic judicial bench book, which allows judges to easily access case information and summaries; and his authorship of the precedent orders for the judicial bench book. It seems that the Family Court of Australia has gained great benefit from Justice Mullane's Masters Degree of Judicial Studies from the US National Judicial College and University of Nevada in 1997. But now Justice Mullane will retire from the bench on 30 September 2008. I thank him on behalf of the people of Newcastle for his tireless advocacy for the Newcastle regischallenges try and the people who presented before him. Justice Mullane has always understood the value of permanent appointments to our registry to make sure local needs are understood, responded to and appropriately resourced. On his retirement, Newcastle will have lost a great champion. But Justice Mullane is also my friend of 30 years, and I thank him personally for his inspiration and ongoing support. I know that he would want me to acknowledge the support he has always had from his family-his loving wife, Dawn; his three special children, Scott, Richard and Yvonne; his mother, May; and his sister, Annette. On behalf of his many friends, I thank him for making time for us over his immense career and tell him that we look forward to seeing more of him after September 30. Thank you, Justice Graham Mullane. Newcastle and Australia are indebted to you. We are proud of you, and we wish you well. Economy",158
164,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The great economist Milton Friedman once wrote, ‘If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there would be a shortage of sand.' To paraphrase Milton Friedman in the parliament tonight, I want to say that, if you put a Labor government in power in Canberra, within months there will be a shortage of national economic leadership and national confidence. This Rudd Labor government looks very much like it has lost the plot. Certainly this Labor Prime Minister looks like he has lost the plot. Clearly the wheels of this government are falling off-if they have not already fallen off. Today, as we all know, the world is in great need of leadership. The world is experiencing, by some accounts, economic of a magnitude not seen and witnessed since the days of the Depression. This country needs the best leadership that can be afforded it, and it needs a leader who knows something about business. It needs a leader who knows something about the corporate world. It needs someone who is more than just a consultant. The times demand economic knowledge. The times demand someone with genuine economic and business experience. Indeed, I understand that the Prime Minister did not even do senior maths. I am not quite sure that the people of Ryan would appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister of the day, in charge of a $1.1 trillion economy, did not even complete senior maths at the high school that he went to. As a citizen of this country, I am appalled by that. I suspect that the constituents of Ryan would be absolutely gobsmacked by the fact that, at a time when national leadership on the economy is absolutely indispensable to ensuring that mortgages can be repaid, that homes are not repossessed and that car loans can be financed and at a time when people are looking to the leadership of the their national government, the Prime Minister-the man in Canberra who lives at the Lodge-did not even complete senior maths. I think that would stun many in the Ryan constituency. We certainly did not see that fact on the TV as during last November's federal election campaign. I will inform the people of Ryan and other Australians who might be listening to the parliament tonight why I believe that the Prime Minister has lost the plot. I think self-evident, but I should say why. We have a situation here where the Prime Minister is going on an international trip to the US and he says he is doing it because it is in Austrainterested lia's national interest that he does so. I to ask: is it in Australia's national interest that he picks up the phone and calls a member of the Australian Senate, Senator Nick Xenophon-whom I understand the Prime Minister has not even had the courtesy to speak to-and discusses much important legislation in this parliament? The people of Australia are going to find out what having a Labor government in power means. Clearly, it means that economic hard times are coming our way. If we are in business, we are going to find out just how difficult it is to do business under this Labor government. If we are in charities or all kinds of small endeavours, we are going to find out how difficult it is to get support from the federal government here in Canberra. I understand, as I said, that the Prime ister has not even met with Senator Nick Xenophon, who is a critical player in the parliament today, given that there is legislation backing up in the Senate. I find it absolutely amazing that a Prime Minister would put on his schedule talking to African leaders at Columbia University about his grand scheme of having Australia front and centre in world affairs ahead of walking the 200 yards-or the 200 metres that he fondly speaks of in the chamber here-to meet a member of the Australian Senate to put the legislation of the country ahead of his concerns. We know that times are different today. The Economist wrote of the previous government's record that Australia's economic performance was ‘the envy of Western countries for well over a decade'. That was writit is ten in May 2005. In 2008, times are very different. I know that the people of Ryan, who are putting health care and education front and centre in their lives, are not at all in the Prime Minister going to Cowant lumbia University and talking to African leaders about getting their votes for Australia to get a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. (Time expired) Age Pension",159
165,Ms CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, that pensioners across the country are doing it tough is not news to you, I know. Nor indeed is it news to me. It does, however, appear to be quite a revelation to those opposite. After 11 years of doing nothing, suddenly the opposition are fundamentally concerned with a portion of the electorate which they simply took for granted. Suddenly those opposite are imbued with righteous indignation-nothing is of greater priority to them than an increase in the pension. I have no intention of making light of the pressures under which pensioners struggle Mineach and every day. That has been done already by the Liberals. Last month, in what can only be described as a most desperate attempt to grab headlines and steer the agenda away from his embattled leadership, the former opposition leader proposed an increase in the single aged pension of $30 a week. There are more than 11,000 pensioners in my electorate of Bass and, while I am certain the single ones among them would welcome the move, there are 4½ thousand disability pensioners and almost 1,000 carer pensioners whom those opposite appear determined to ignore. The new opposition leader obviously believes that the 11,289 pensioners in Bass are not worthy of any more assistance. Clearly Mr Turnbull does not consider that 803 carers, 4,561 people on a disability pension and 5,925 pensioner couples in Bass are in need of more help. Along with his Liberal and National Party colleagues, he does not consider these local pensioners worthy of additional financial help. In contrast, as a of Australian government measures, all age pensioners, singles and couples, carers, veterans and disability pensioners and women on the wife pension will this week receive the next $128 instalment of their annual $500 utilities allowance. All of this needs to be put in some context. Let us not forget that this is coming from the party whose first priority in their legislative action in the Senate was to block an increase in the luxury car tax. So concerned were those opposite with ensuring that luxury cars remain affordable that they were prepared to punch a $550 million hole in the budget surplus. Thankfully an agreement was reached with the Senate's Family First member. But those opposite are not done. I have publicly called on Tasmania's Liberal senators to pull back from what can only be described as their irresponsible threat to block 30,000 public dental services for Tasmania. The Rudd government wants to invest $290 million in cutting public dental waiting lists. Right now, there are 650,000 people waiting for public dental services, but those opposite are determined to continue to block funding for the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. At the last election, Labor promised to abolish the Liberal Party's poorly targeted, failed dental scheme and redirect the funding to provide public dental care to the most vulnerable in our community. Now the Liberals and Nationals are threatening to block that funding by keeping their failed dental scheme alive, completely ignoring the message voters sent them at the last election. That means there will be no Commonwealth Dental Health Program. Let us look at their priorities: ignore disability pensioners, veterans and carers, continue to deny Tasmanians access to 30,000 dental services, but block an increase in the luxury car tax. All the while, they are claiming to be in touch with the result community. You know what? I don't think so. The Rudd government, on the other hand, is fully aware of the pain and pressure pensioners are under. That is why in the budget we boosted spending on seniors from $1.3 billion to $5.2 billion. We recognise the former government's neglect of pensioners over the last decade, but we also recognise that we have more work to do on the pension, which is why the Henry review is looking carefully at the adequacy of retirement incomes. The pensions aspect of this review will report in February. I am listening to the community and I am hearing a lot of concern and angst. I want to assure pensioners across Northern Tasmania: as a government, we are hearing you. Unlike those opposite, we are taking responsible steps to respond. Any change to the base rate of the pension is an extremely complex step with important economic implications, so it is vital that we act sensibly and responsibly in the national interest as well as the interests of pensioners. It is simply laughable for those opposite criticise the government for the rate of the pension. They had 11 years to do something about pension adequacy and delivered nothing but chronic neglect. We are determined to rectify that neglect and we will do so in a responsible way. Simpson Desert",160
166,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House what I believe is an important issue for the Indigenous people of the Simpson Desert and of the Munga Thirri, which means ‘big sandhill country'. I believe it is high time we had a debate about renaming the Simpson Desert after its original people, rather than the explorer who discovered it so many thousands of years later. The Simpson Desert spans 175,000 square kilometres of inland Australia and three states-Queensland, the Northern Territory and South Australia. According to European Australian history, the first person to see it was explorer Charles Sturt, in 1845. It was not named until 1939, by a keen geologist and explorer, Cecil Madigan, who named it after former Adelaide Mayor and President of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia, Alfred Simpson. Obviously the history of the Simpson Desert did not begin 69 years ago. Just last month I was given the unique and humbling opportunity to spend time and a night in the Simpson Desert with Park Ranger Don Rowlands, who is an elder of his tribe, the Wangkangurru. Don, who lives in Birdsville with his wife, Lyn, carries the stories and history of his people, who lived and thrived in the Simpson Desert-or Munga Thirri, the big sandhill country, as they called it. To the European explorers, the desert was a harsh and hostile place, devoid of any life or beauty. To our early settlers it meant hard lives and almost certain death. Yet to Don's to people the desert was a welcoming and nurturing place, a home to raise their children, to hunt for food and to meet with other tribes and discuss tribal law. It was a place to celebrate marriages and births, and commemorate deaths and tragedies. I would like to take this opportunity to tell the House of one particularly story of the Simpson, told to me by Don and passed down to him by the elders of his tribe. It is a bush tale and, like every bush tale, there are two sides to the story. It is a story of a family who lived on Annandale Station, on the edge of the Simpson Desert. According to Birdsville folklore, the station manager went droving, leaving behind his wife and two daughters. Alone for many weeks, his wife went insane from the isolation, poisoning her two children with strychnine. However, the story of Don's elders is that the two young girls, who played daily with the young local Aboriginal children of the area, the Wangkangurru, brought home for their mother some desert plants. Unaware they were poisonous if not properly cooked, their mother prepared the plants for dinner. Tragically, her two young daughters died and she was sent into insanity. Yet perhaps one of the great tragedies is that we have never truly appreciated the long history of the Simpson Desert. When I spoke with Don, we discussed the possibility of having the name changed to honour its original ownership, and this is what I would like to bring to the attention of the parliament this evening. In many parts of my electorate of Maranoa and indeed across Australia, town names and areas have kept the same name, albeit an anglicised version, given it by local Indigenous peoples. In my hometown where I went to school were names such as Muckadilla-an anglicised version from the local people meaning ‘sweet running water'. Then there is Wallumbilla, Angellala, Arabella, Womalilla, and Mungallala. These are all anglicised names depicting what could be found in an area. These are just some of the many towns in the Maranoa electorate which have kept the same name identified by local explorers and early settlers as the names given to them by the local Indigenous peoples. The Diamantina Shire mayor and the shire's councillors-many of them have lived in far western Queensland their entire lives-are highly supportive of the Simpson Desert Park being renamed to recognise its ancestry. They agree that it is far more appropriate for the desert to be named after its original inhabitants, rather than by a South Australian geologist who I have great respect for but who did not name it until 1939. It is high time we had this debate, not only on changing the name of the Simpson Desert but also those of many areas across Australia. One could ask: what is in a name? But I am sure that all Australians understand that acknowledgement and recognition through proper naming rights is a simple but fitting way to honour Australia's history and the people who were here long before us. I hope that we are able to get the support of the state governments and other authorities to see this issue progressed through the appropriate channels to see the name of the Simpson Desert changed to take that of the local tribe group that lived in that area for thousands of years. (Time expired) Kingston Electorate: Surf Lifesaving",162
167,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to pay tribute to the many surf lifesavers that patrol beaches around the country. I am very lucky in my electorate of Kingston because it has more than 30 kilometres of beaches. They are beautiful beaches but they would not be safe without the many surf lifesavers who patrol them. In fact, I have five clubs in my electorate and they all do a fabulous job in making sure that the beaches are very safe. The surf lifesaving movement has had a very long history. It started in 1901, so it is probably one of the longest-serving volunteer organisations in our country. The job that surf lifesavers did very early on was different from the job that they do today, but no less important. Early on they used a lot of different types of equipment to save people, including the reel whereby someone would stand on one end of the reel, and then reel in the person in the water. Obviously, things have changed significantly since then. Very high-tech equipment is needed now and, as a result, the clubs need a lot of support from their local communities. I have had a very close relationship with the surf lifesaving movement. I joined the surf lifesaving movement when I was 11 years of age. I was given the choice of playing a number of sports and I chose surf lifesaving. I have had a good and long association with the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club. I learnt many things from that experience, including first aid and also rescue and resuscitation. But the most valuable thing that I learnt from being involved in surf lifesaving at such a young age was the importance of volunteering. That is an absolutely fundamental thing about the surf lifesaving movement. It has hundreds and hundreds of volunteers who go out every Saturday and Sunday to sit on our beaches to make sure that people are safe. I think that is key to the movement. These people work tirelessly. In the new club that I am joining, the Christies Beach Surf Life Saving Club, people give up between 20, 30, 40 and 50 hours of their time to run this volunteer organisation to the best of their ability. They are very professional people. I would like to pay particular attention the South Australian organisation of the surf lifesaving movement. They recognise that the many migrants from around the world who are moving to South Australia perhaps did not have beaches in their country of origin. The organisation is looking at ways to educate some of these migrants on beach safety. This is incredibly important because we are seeing an increase in the number of migrants getting into trouble; they do not understand things such as rips and tides, which are very prevalent in South Australian waters. People in the surf lifesaving movement in South Australia have taken it upon themselves to start educating these people about water safety. They have their new ‘stay safe this summer' campaign, which has the acronym FLAGS: F for find the flags and make sure you swim between them; L is to look for the safety signs; A is for ask a surf lifesaver for some good advice; G is for get a friend to swim with you; and S is for stick your hand up for help. They also make sure that the message gets across: ‘Never swim in unpatrolled beaches. Never swim at night. Never swim under the influence of alcohol. Never run and dive into water. Never swim directly after a meal.' The surf lifesaving group work tirelessly to get these messages out to people. I am very pleased that the Rudd government has recognised surf lifesaving clubs and that it is assisting them in becoming more water wise. During the election, we made a commitment to deliver water tanks to the surf lifesaving clubs around the country, and we are delivering on that commitment. That will provide significant support for the clubs in conserving water at a local level. I know that that has been welcomed by my five surf lifesaving clubs. They want to become very ecowise. They want to look at not only water tanks but also solar panels and any other ways that they can contribute. to They know more than anyone how important our local coastal community is. Tonight, I just wanted to recognise the great work that they do on our beaches in saving lives. (Time expired)",163
