2,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister state the position with regard to the national unemployment insurance scheme for Australia, and inform the House whether the silence of Ministers on this matter in recent days may be taken as an indication that the proposal is to be shelved ?",13
3,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"The answer to the hitter part of the question is "" No."" Recognizing that it is essential to have the co-operation of the States before proceeding with such a proposal, the Government has done everything possible, without success, to secure that co-operation, but it has not come to the conclusion that it is impossible to obtain it, and it will continue its efforts in that direction. INTER-STATE COMMISSION.",13
4,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"Yesterday , in reply to a question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I inadvertently said that there were no applicants for appointment to the Inter-State Commission. What I had in mind was that the Government bad taken no action to call for applications. I overlooked the fact that quite a number of persons, anticipating the possibility of the passage of legislation for the appointment of the commission, have sent on reminders that they will be applicants when the positions are being filled.",13
5,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,Did they state their qualifications?,13
6,Mr LYONS,Unknown,Some of them did; others simply asked that they should not be overlooked when the appointments were being considered.,13

8,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"Possibly , and some did not.",13

14,Mr MCEWEN,YAMPI SOUND IRO N ORE,"Variou s experts representing both the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Western Australia have visited the localities in Australia where iron ore deposits are known to exist, and reports made by these experts are in the possession of the Government.

16,Mr LYONS,YAMPI SOUND IRO N ORE,"I am not aware of the details of the matter. I know that such an application was made, and that it has been dealt with in a way which I hope will be satisfactory.

17,Mr SCHOLFIELD,YAMPI SOUND IRO N ORE,"Will the Acting . Minister for Trade and Customs state whether his attention has been drawn to a circular which honourable members have received, in which it is definitely said that no Tariff Board inquiry has taken place regarding radio valves? If that is so, is it in line with the Government's statement that it is largely guided by the Tariff Board in fixing rates of duty?  copy of the letter referred to. I believe it is a fact that no inquiry has been made on the subject of the duty on radio valves, but it is likely that one will take place in the near future.",14

23,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,Will the Prime Minister state whether the Government intends to give the House an opportunity to discuss its migration proposals during the present series of sittings?,14
24,Mr LYONS,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,"I hope that that"" will be possible.

25,Mr JENNINGS,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,"Has the Minister for Defence seen the statement from the Government of New South Wales which suggests that, in the additional defence expenditure, approximately Â£500,000 only has been allotted for New South Wales, and on projects which will give employment for skilled artisans only? If this is so, will the Minister accede quest of the New South Wales Government that the Commonwealth Government should' communicate details of its defence plans to the State Government, so that the latter will be able to plan road, bridge and other State works of defence value ?",14
26,Mr THORBY,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,"The Treasurer gave a fairly comprehensive outline of the defence works as apportioned amongst the various States, and he indicated the kind of works to be put in hand in the coming year. A careful dissection of these proposals has been made to ascertain the amount of employment they will give in various groups and in different areas of the States, and it is wrong to say that skilled artisans only will benefit. The defence programme will provide employment for a large number of unskilled men, even, for instance, at Newcastle.",15
27,Mr BEASLEY,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,Will they labour jobs?,15
28,Mr THORBY,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,Mostl y contract jobs.',15
29,Mr BEASLEY,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,"Contrac t jobs do not give much employment, because workers usually follow the same contractors.",15
30,Mr THORBY,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,That is not correct.,15
31,Mr DRAKEFORD,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,A contractor will not employ any man.,15
32,Mr THORBY,WOOL STORAGE IN GREAT,"I quite agree. He employs the best men available. Skilled work, reinforced concrete work and road work will be undertaken: as the result of the defence plans.

If this matter has not been finally dealt with, I shall be glad to know whether it will receive the attention of the Government, because the rumour is current in this Territory that the act to which I have referred has been contravened.",15

The deputation was in a Soviet jail? held, but although many months have parts passed neither the Liverpool Council nor I have heard anything more about it.

50,Mr LYONS,SURRENDERED INSURANCE,"No consideration has been given to that subject lately. Although I am quite prepared to make inquiry in regard to it, I suggest that adopt such a policy would involve honourable members who live in distant which the honourable member has re parts of the Commonwealth spending a much longer time in Canberra than they do at present. I am not personally mistic albont the prospects of such a procedure being adopted. INVERELL RIFLE RANGE.",17
51,Mr SCULLY,SURRENDERED INSURANCE,"Will the Minister for Defence inform mc whether, when the defence estimates are being framed, consideration will be given to the claims of country districts for added facilities? I point, out that the Inverell rifle range has not been available for use for some considerable time owing to the fact that a new location has not been provided.",17
52,Mr THORBY,SURRENDERED INSURANCE,"The statement of the honourable member is not quite correct. Inverell has been without a rifle range owing mainly to the inability of the local riflemen to agree upon a new site. The present range was condemned because it was dangerous to the public in consequence of the fact that a main highway has been constructed behind the rifle butts and in the direct line of rifle fire. There is no relatively high ground behind the existing rifle butts. An officer of the department has visited Inverell on two occasions with the object of assisting in the selection of a new site, and he is at present conferring with local residents on the subject.

54,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SURRENDERED INSURANCE,"I can an undertake to carry out any promise made to in this connection by the Minister for the Commerce. I believe that the bill to J ferred, will be in charge of the Assistant Minister in the Senate (Senator MacoptiDonald), and I shall ask him to meet representatives of the union.

If the inquiries have not yet been completed will the Minister ascertain when the report is likely to be available?",17

65,Mr ROSEVEAR,IMMIGRATION OE SOUTHERN,I ask the Minister for the Interior whether the published report of his policy in connection with the immigration of Southern Europeans was prompted by the enormous influx of Southern Europeans or by the fact that they are not prepared to live under normal Australian conditions?,18
66,Mr MCEWEN,IMMIGRATION OE SOUTHERN,"In the first place, there was no published report of my policy, for I have no policy-it is always the policy of the Government-and , in the second place, the Government has no policy in regard to Southern Europeans; its policy concerns white aliens; and the published statement was a considered statement of the policy adopted and applied by the Government in regard to white alien migrants.",18
67,Mr ROSEVEAR,IMMIGRATION OE SOUTHERN,"Was the Government's policy in regard to white aliens prompted by the fact that there has been an enormous influx of Southern Europeans, or was it due to the fact that Southern Europeans are not prepared to establish themselves under Australian conditions of livelihood?",18
68,Mr MCEWEN,IMMIGRATION OE SOUTHERN,The policy of the Government was prompted by only one motive-the motive of doing the right thing for Australia.,18
69,Sir HENRY GULLETT,IMMIGRATION OE SOUTHERN,"Is the Minister for the Interior aware that migrants coming to Australia from southern and central Europe are subject to no sort of moral or medical examination before they leave their country of origin, whereas British assisted migrants coming here are subject to the most searching examination as to medical and moral fitness? '",18
70,Mr MCEWEN,IMMIGRATION OE SOUTHERN,"The position is that no white alien migrant may enter Australia without a permit, and that permit is not given without an intimation, among other things, that he will not be allowed to land without an examination at the first port of call in Australia. The invariable custom, therefore, is for the migrant to undergo an examination before' he leaves his own country so that he will not be refused entry by our authorities at the first port of call. FENCINGMATERIALS.",18
71,Mr BRENNAN,IMMIGRATION OE SOUTHERN,"Is the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs aware that farmers are able to obtain for fencing purposes steel posts and other material of that kind which are, I understand, the monopoly of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, only on advance order's of six months, andf has he considered that matter in relation to customs duties?

Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Casey and Mr Thorby do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill brought up by Mr Casey, and read_ a first time. SECOND READING.",19
75,Mr CASEY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Corio - Treasurer) [11.12] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. I should like as briefly possible to explain the purposes of this measure and then leave the matter for debate at a later date. The purpose of this measure is to appropriate the sum of Â£250,000 from the revenue of this current financial year in order to form a trust fund which will be known as the Science and Industry Capital Trust Account for the purpose of financing capital works in connection with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Honourable members are, of course, aware that the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research up to' the present has been confined almost entirely to attempting a solution of primary production problems. Honourable members will also be aware that late in 1936 the Government set np a committee known as the Secondary Industries Testing and Research Committee which was composed of leading industrialists and eminent scientists. The report of that committee, which has been actually available to honourable members and to the public for some little time, I formally laid on the table of the House yesterday, and several copies are available to honourable members on the table in the Library. This committee made its report in 1937, and it recommended, amongst other things, an Australian standards reference laboratory, an aircraft and engine testing and research laboratory, a research service, an information service and a testing service for secondary industries. Subsequent to the report of this committee, the Government, as the House is aware, was fortunate in having the services and advice of Mr. H. E. Wimperis, lately director of Aeronautical Research in Great Britain. Mr. Wimperis is a very eminent gentleman in his field, and we had him here for upwards of six months. He was primarily engaged in advising the Government on the establishment of an aircraft industry in Australia and on the necessity for aeronautical research. His report, which has been in the hands of the public for some time, was also formally tabled yesterday and copies are available in the Library. Broadly speaking, for the purposes of this bill his report bore out in its entirety the report of the committee on secondary industries research. So far as this bill is concerned, the broadening of the actias vities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has a distinct defence flavour. The two main institutions that will be brought into existence by reason of the moneys made available under this bill are an essential link in the big defence effort that Australia is making now and will make in the years immediately ahead. The two principal institutions which it is proposed to bring into existence are a National Standards Laboratory, which it is hoped to establish in the University grounds i i i Sydney, and an Aeronautical Research Laboratory situated close to the works of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermen's Bend, in Victoria. The report of Mr Wimperis, dealt more specifically with the aeronautical side, and honourable members who have read his report, or even such extracts from it as have been published in the press, can be in"" no doubt regarding the need for the inauguration of aeronautical research in Australia. There is already in existence in Australia a number of standards, which really means that there is no standard at all, and it is to overcome that disability that these proposals have been evolved. Up to the present these matters, where they have been dealt with at all, have come under the control of the State governments, though the Commonwealth Government has power, under the Constitution, to legislate in this respect. At the present time, there are as many standards in Australia, as there are States, but there is no set of standards common to Australia a3 a whole. I refer of course, in particular, to standards of length aud mass, of electrical and light units and to all the other physical properties with which man has to deal in secondary industries. In Great Britain, standards are dealt'with by the National Physical Laboratory. The Commonwealth Government has been in close touch with that body which has agreed to afford us all possible assistance. ""We are approaching in Australia the era of what is called "" mass production when parts of any one implement, whether for defence or for any other purpose, may be made either in separate factories or in different branches of the one factory, and it is essential that all those parts should be, within very close limits, of the same size.",20
76,Mr BEASLEY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The Commonwealth Government has no power under the abroad, Constitution to deal with standards relating to some matters. Is it proposed to take additional power for this purpose ?",21
77,Mr CASEY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"It is not a matter of imposing ourselves on any one. I believe that those who control the secondary dustries of Australia will welcome the setting up of an institution to ensure maintenance of absolute standards. These standards will be made available from central laboratory in Sydney through branches established in all the other capital cities where there is need for them. The absolute standards will be taken from the standards of the National Physical Laboratory in Great Britain, and they will be exchanged with those in that stitution from time to time in order to ensure continuing accuracy. In capital cities there will be kept subequipment standards calibrated against the standitions. dards in Sydney, and various factories will have their master gauges calibrated in the same way.",21
78,Mr JENNINGS,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Will the institution also fix chemical standards?,21
79,Mr CASEY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"No . The main institution will cost approximately Â£80,000 for building and equipment, and this will cover also the bare necessaries for the creation of sub-standard branches in the other capital cities. The Government's proposals' have been acclaimed by the leaders of all branches of secondary industry in Australia. It is also proposed to establish a testing service which will be a branch of the principal National Standards Laboratory. The object is to organize a system of testing by a national body whose status will carry recognition throughout the Commonwealth and abroad. At the present time there exists only to a limited extent means for the testing and supervising of materials to ensure that they conform to a standard size. I am sure that we shall receive the co-operation of the States in this respect. It is also proposed to inaugurate an information service. This is not directly relevant to the present measure, but its purpose is to disseminate scientific knowledge among Australian manufacturers. It is proposed to seek such knowledge in Australia and and to make it available for the benefit of secondary industries in this country. We want manufacturers to know exactly what is going on in other countries, and to apply the fruits of that knowledge to Australian production. It is estimated that the Aeronautical inand Engineering Research Establishment will cost eventually Â£143,000, aud that the the National Standards Laboratory will cost Â£80,000, making a total of Â£223,000.

One of these is a fisheries research tion at Port Hacking in New South Wales. The Government of New South my Wales has kindly handed over to the monwealth the old State fisheries reare search station at Port Hacking. It not been in use for some years, but the Commonwealth Government, through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, proposes to modernize the station, and to make such additions as are necessary. It will then become head-quarters of the fisheries research vessel which is shortly to be put into commission. A sum of Â£12,000 is to be discover. expended upon buildings and equipment. The station at Port Hacking is peculiarly suitable, for. this purpose, not only cause it is situated roughly in the middle of the coastline upon whioh the research vessel's activities will be carried out, also because it will be possible from there to keep in close touch with the food servation laboratory which is tablished at the Homebush abattoirs in Sydney. The Government proposes to inauguordination rate a trust fund .to be known as Science and Industry Capital Trust Account, into which will be placed this year a sum of Â£250,000 from revenue. .The Government has always exercised the closest scrutiny such trust funds, and they are only when it is believed that they are the most suitable method of financing a particular undertaking. It is of no use mencing a project of this kind unless Government can see its way to carry it to completion. Very little of the amount of Â£250,000 will be expended this year, but a great deal of it will be committed, some of it-in the ordering of equipment overseas, though that equipment may not be delivered for over twelve months. actual expenditure of the money will tend over a period of two years, though most of the commitments will be entered into almost at once.",21

To the best of ability I shall at a later stage of the Comdebate supply to honourable members who interested the information for which has they may ask. Generally speaking, the Government is convinced of the necessity for the closest link between science and industry.

88,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Barkerhonorable Acting Minister for Commerce) [11.33]. - On e cannot consider the defence posals of the Government without taking into consideration some of the events in international affairs which led up to them. At the time of the Imperial ConIndeed, ference, about a year ago, the internarecord. tional situation was certainly not withhe out clouds. Since then the position has progressively deteriorated, not only Europe, but also in the Far East. We strictly to the text. have witnessed the intensification of the civil war in Spain and the intrusion other Powers on the Spanish Peninsula - and when I speak of other powers, I do not mean only those which have assisted General Franco, but also those which have assisted that institution which, for want of a better name, is' known as the Spanish Government. More recently, we have witnessed the inclusion of Austria in the German Reich, and we have been forced to take notice of the situation which is developing day in Czechoslovakia. There have also been difficulties in the newer States along the Baltic, as well as uncertainty in Poland, whilst the state of affairs existPremier ing in the Balkan Peninsula - generally gives ground for concern. The only two rays of hope which have brightened the situation were referred to by the Prime Minister, when he spoke of the consumof mation of an agreement between the British and Italian Governments, an agreement, possibly of less moment, but, nevertheless, important, between the Governments of Britain and Ireland. I connection with the latter of those agreeaddition ments, it is interesting to note the rather extraordinary change of front on the part of the head of the Irish Government, as reported in today's press. Mr de Valera is reported to have said that whereas a few years ago he wished that Ireland was 500 miles further out in the Atlantic, today he is happy to know that it is situated under the apron of Great Britain.",23
89,Mr BRENNAN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"He did not say that. If the Acting Minister must quote Mr. de Valera, he should quote him fairly.",23

No one can say what complications are likely to take place there, and it would be un-wise to hazard a guess. We in Australia cannot but be influenced by the information whioh comes to us, by various means, day by from that part of the world.",23
93,Mr BRENNAN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Tell us what it is.,23
94,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The of Tasmania, Mr Ogilvie, had something to say on the subject. I repeat that we in Australia cannot but be influenced by the trend of affairs in the Pacific. A night or two ago the Leader the Opposition (Mr Curtin) took the Government to task for the general miliand tary situation. He referred to the example of the United States of America in regard to trade agreements, but he did n not tell the House that that country, into establishing records in the consummation of trade agreements, is also establishing other records, particularly in regard to its expenditure for defence. On the showing of the United States of America, the trade agreement between that country and Australia is certainly not a reason why that nation should fail to provide for the effective defence .of its territory; nor should we fail to provide for the effective defence of Australia. It is not part of my duty to go into the details of the defence plans of the Government. That will be done by the ister for Defence (Mr Thorby), man who is carrying out a very onerous task with, I think I may fairly say, the f u ll concurrence of the House, great ability and tireless energy, as is evito denced by the magnitude and complexity of the proposals which have been brought before the Parliament. During the last election campaign Government was accused by the OpposiEnglish tion of having only one objective in in its defence policy, namely, the introduchad tion by some subterranean method of form of conscription. I do not think that the Government. the gentlemen who said that really believed it themselves. At any rate, the electorate did not believe it. A clear distincSydney tion must be drawn between conscripmembers tion as described iby the members of Opposition, and the existing law of country, as contained in the Defence Act. centlyUnder that legislation every man between the ages of 18 and 60 years is liable for military service, as and when required, i within the territories of the Commoncampaign, wealth of Australia. During this debate' mulated, I have not heard one word from sition members to suggest that they desire those provisions of the Defence Act to be repealed; and certainly the Labour party, when it was in office, did not attempt to repeal them. The Scullin Government did not even take the trouble to repeal the compulsory provisions of the simply suspended them.",23

I shall now quote the remarks of one of the younger members of the Labour party- a notable member of the party, in that he has three supporters among honourable members opposite in the persons of the honourable members for Denison (Mr Miahoney), Franklin (Mr Frost) and Bass (Mr Barnard). I refer to Mr Ogilvie, the Premier of Tasmania, who believes that it is necessary to go even further than the Commonwealth Government proposes to go in regard to defeuce.",24
107,Mr FROST,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,'Does the Acting Minister disagree with him?,25
108,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"I do not. Are members of the Opposition oblivious to the fact that the Labour Premier of an Australian State has condemned the apathy of the Labour movement in regard to defence? Mr Ogilvie put up a proposition which can be understood by the people of Australia, but we find no echo of support for it from the occupants of the front bench opposite.",25
109,Mr FKOST,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,And the Minister Defence disagrees with it.,25
110,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The other night exception was taken to certain actions of this Government in relation to the international position. We were told that we had no foreign policy, that we were following blindly in the footsteps of Great Britain. We were criticized for not having taken certain action consequent upon the resignation of Mr Eden, and then, on other occasions, it seemed that the fault of the Government was that it had taken _ action in this respect. The fact of the matter is that this Government cannot concern itself with the resignation of a member of a government of another British country; that it not our affair. All we were concerned with was the implications of the moves that led up to Mr Eden's resignation, and anything that might eventuate therefrom. Other resignations have taken place, and anybody, I think, would admit that the British Government would have been quite wrong if it had taken steps, for instance, to inquire into the reason why a very senior member of the last Lyons Government resigned from office. _ Similarly Australia would have been surprised if Canada had concerned itself with the resignation at a later date of our Minister in Charge of Negotiations for Trade Treaties. Such matters concern only the governments involved, and we must give each government credit for being able to manage its own affairs. This Government is certainly able to do that. Last night the honourable member for Batman expended a great deal of eloquence in upholding the policy of the Chamberlain Government as an example to this Government.",25
111,Mr BRENNAN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,I did so in respect of the points in Mr Chamberlain's speech to which I referred.,25
112,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The honourable member described the policy of Mr Chamberlain's Government as excellent, and one which this Government could well copy. Mr Chamberlain bad laid down certain conditions with regard to the defence of Great Britain which the lionorable member thought that the Commonweajth Government should follow in respect of the defor fence of Australia. Mr BRENNAN.^- I said that the British Government showed a capacity for minding its own business and that this Government, might well follow its example in that respect.",25
113,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Ap parently the honourable member now wishes to qualify his statement, but I suggest that ho should read in Hansard the remarks which he made last night. I shall quote from a very important Sydney paper, and one whose veracity honourable members opposite will not question, The Labor Daily.' In its issue of the 5th March, it said that Mr Chamberlain's policy was "" as simple as it is cynical, and as clever as it is diabolical."" I do not know whether the lionorable member for Batman, whew referring to Mr Chamberlain's defence policy, appeared in the guise of what at one time was called advocatus diaboli. But probably that was the true reason why he supported last night the British Government's policy, and his remarks offered further evidence of the confusion existing among honourable members oppomembers site with regard to defence. I refer honourable members to another statement from The Labor Daily of the 5th MarchThe frontiers of Australia are not Sydney I'prt Moresby-bu t Shanghai and Madrid. We - beside himself on that point. can defeat fascism on the banks of the W'c can preserve our democracy in the streets of Madrid. All those statements are evidence of existence of various schools of thought among lionorable members opposite.",25
114,Mr FROST,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,And there are various schools of thought among Government supporters in respect of defence. Mr Archie CAMERON.:-No diviLazzarini) sion exists among honourable members this side of the House. There is absolute union and unity of purpose in respect of the policy which this Government has proposed for the acceptance of this liament.,26
115,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"""What about the party meeting ?",26
116,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"There is nothing secret about party meetings honourable members on this side. They are fully reported in the press, and I gest that it would be an excellent for politics in this country if similar conditions applied in respect of party meetabove suspicion. ings of honourable members opposite. If that were so we would be presented a rather interesting story, one which would provide headlines ""for the press. room ? The issue confronting the people of Australia in respect of defence is that can rely on the Government as at present constituted to give effect to a certain defence policy, one which is flexible and reconcile definite in its purpose, and has as its objective the safety of our country. The Government's first consideration is local security, and it has not deviated in the slightest from that purpose. This conforms absolutely to the first principle of war, namely, to guard one's own terrigentleman tory and forces.",26
117,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,That represents a change training at all? of the Government's defence policy.,26
118,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Not all. It is the defence policy of this vernment, from which we have not parted and from which no amount of representation on the part of honourable opposite can induce us to depart.",26

That, I think, is something for which the Opposition can feel extremely thankful"", it is the only sign of agreement among themselves in respect of defence Parthat we have yet witnessed, because never before has disagreement among honourable members opposite on this matter been deeper, greater, or more unbridgable than it has been during the last few weeks.

I have no doubt, however, that all honorablegentlemen opposite will be able to their divergent views; first and also reconcile with Mr Ogilvie's advocacy of compulsory military trainingtheir desire to have no form of militarytraining whatever.

125,Mr CURTIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Does the honorablesay that the alternative is compulsory military training, or no",26
126,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"During , at my membership of this House I Gohave not yet heard one ""word from; dehonorable members opposite to sugmisgest that. they believe in training: anybody. All I have heard is that they believe in a system of home defence, and on that point also they are not unanimous. If the honourable member for East Sydney can explain what form of defence he believes in, I suggest that every member of this House will be prepared to stay here for a week to listen to him. I have heard the honourable member for Batman denouncing every form of defence. The facts are that divisions of opinion may exist on both sides as to what will happen in the - international sphere in the future. There is no harm in facing up to the facts and I believe in doing so. I am sure that this Government will face up to the facts as they exist today. There is no denying that honourable members supporting this Government have advocated certain definite measures which the Government has not been prepared to adopt, but it is only reasonable to expect that they will express their opinions; in fact, the Government would think very little of them if they failed to do so.",26
127,Mr CURTIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,That is precisely the case with honourable members on this side of the House.,27
128,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"There is complete and absolute unity among honourable members on this side in regard to the proposals which the Government has placed before this chamber. The people of Australia have to choose between this Government's policy and a set of contradictory propositions put up by the Opposition, and I contend that if this alternative were tested before the people tomorrow the Government would win as it did at the general election, for the simple reason that the electors of Australia have no faith in either the intention, or. the capacity, of the Opposition, if it were elected to power, to implement a defence policy. On the other hand, the people of Australia have complete confidence in the defence programme placed by the Government before the House, and I have no doubt that these proposals will be carried.",27
129,Mr BLACKBUBN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Bourke) [11.58]. - I do not suppose there is any question which runs across classes and parties in Australia more than does this issue of military preparation. Divisions of opinion exist on all sides, and have been just as obvious on the Government side in the course of this debate as on this side. All supporters of the Government apparently unite upon a policy of local security, but from some of them we gather that local security is to be obtained by fighting in Europe, whilst others seem to think that it is to be obtained by preparing to fight in Australia and not out of it. The Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) made great play upon the advocacy of compulsory military training by Mr Ogilvie. I point out that Mr Ogilvie advocated such action as a proposed change in the Labour party's policy. He, did not propose a policy for Australia or for himself, but simply suggested, and apparently the Labour conference in Tasmania supported him, that the policy of the Australian Labour party should be changed so as to provide for compulsory military training. Remember, however, that that proposal is compulsory military training for the defence only of Australia and territories controlled by Australia - To that extent it is perfectly consonant with the policy of the Labour party. Mr Ogilvie opposes as much as anybody else the idea of raising forces for active service overseas.",27
130,Mr HOLT,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The Labour party in this House agrees with him. . Mr BLACKBURN - No . Mr. Ogilvie is merely making a proposal for an alteration of the Labour party's platform by which he is bound. Before such an alteration can be made, he must get the support of representatives of other States at the Australian Labour party's interstate conference. On this issue the difference between the policy of the supporters of the Government, and of the members of the Labour party appears to be this: The defence policy of the Government and of its supporters is to be planned and operated in co-operation with Great Britain and other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations; that is to say it is to fit into the mosaic of a general imperial scheme to be directed by the imperial authorities, the Australian authorities merely doing their part in effectuating the general scheme.. On the other hand the Labour party, and the Labour movement generally, 'believe that the defence policy of this country sliould be one which has regard to the possibility of Australia being attacked and should be designed solely for the purpose of warding off an attack. That is to say, the Australian Labour party's scheme of defence does not fit into the imperial or British scheme of defence at all, whereas the Commonwealth Government scheme does. If war should break out the actions of this Government would be determined by the imperial command. The policy of the Government may change from time to time, but it is constant in that it is framed in relation to Great Britain's policy. If the form of British policy sliould change, the Commonwealth Government's policy would change with it. Some have said that the present Government has abandoned the defence policy on which it went to the country, and has adopted a new policy. It has not done that. The substance of the defence policy on which it went to the country was that it would co-ordinate its defence measures with tii03e of Great Britain. It is still doing that, although the form of the policy abroad may have changed.",27
131,Mr BEASLEY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Then it has changed its defence policy.,28
132,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The policy has changed only superficially. The central feature of it remains the same, namely that it can be co-ordinated with the policy of Great Britain. The policy of the Labour party provides for the defence of Australia only-preparatio n to resist aggression-and it is uot adopted out of ill will or hostility to the British people or even to the British Government; I think that we must distinguish between the two. Those who dislike the policy of the British Government do not necessarily dislike Great Britain. It would be as unfair to charge Major Attlee with dislike of Australia because he dislikes the Australian Government's policy, as it is to charge the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) with hostility to Great Britain because he disapproves the policy of the British Government.",28
133,Mr LANE,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Bu the has a special leaning towards Ireland.,28
134,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"He may have, and I would not blame him for it, but that docs not imply hostility to the British people. It is very obvious today that neither Mr De Valera nor any party in Eire is hostile towards the British people. The defence policy of the Australian Labour party is framed with the object of promoting the peace of the world. It is a sort of categorical imperative. The Labour party proposes that Australia should act in the matter of defence in such a way that its actions may become a rule of conduct for the rest of the world. The only preparations for war which can be consistent with the peace of the world, are those which are for the exclusive purpose of resisting invasion. If nations concentrate solely upon resisting invasion of their own country and do nothing more, it is obvious that they will not be suspected or feared; consequently war will be unlikely. Mr MoEwEir - Does that mean that the Labour party would have no interest in the defence of New Zealand?",28
135,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The Labour party's platform contains provision to cover the position in respect of New Zealand. At the Perth Conference in 1918 a special provision was included in the platform to provide that action overseas could be taken with the consent of the Australian people., because it was represented that if New Zealand were attacked the Australian people would wish to assist them.",28
136,Mr ANTHONY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,How would the consent of the Australian people be obtained?,28
137,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"B y means of a referendum, as was proposed in the United States of America quite recently. If a nation makes preparations which are not strictly limited to its own defence against actual invasion, such preparations are bound to be misunderstood and misconstrued by other nations. The only way in which a peace-loving nation can preparefor defence, is by making preparations in such a form and with such restrictions that obviously its measures are intended solely for its own defence and cannot be used for any other purpose. That is why the Labour party, in framing the details of its defence policy, provided a scheme whioh cannot be used readily except for defence of Australia against aggression. That is why it regards as objectionable, the provision of large ships of war; these are equivocal weapons, because obviously, while these may be used for the defence of Australia, they may also be used for other purposes, including the general defence of the Empire. We sliould study closely the Australian position. I u spite of what has been said by some honourable members, in cluding the Assistant Minister (Mr . Archie Cameron), it must be fair l y obvious that Australia is not in greater clanger of invasion than it had been; in fact, the danger is less that it was some time ago. . We must realise that there are three great nations bordering the - Pacific. If Australia were in danger of invasion, it would expect invasion from one of three nations. No one can seriously contend that Australia is in danger of being invaded by the United States of America. The other nations are Japan and Russia. Whatever one may think of Russia, one cannot escape the conclusion that that country is determined not to go to war except in the defence of its own territory. Russia will not go to war for the promotion of the Communist cause in other countries. The big schism in Russia today is owing to the difference of opinion between those who believe that Russia should fight only for the defence of Russia, and those who want that country to become the centre of a world revolutionary war. The Trotsky party has always believed the only way socialism can become an accomplished order is by its spread to all countries and that advantage should be taken of war to bring about a world revolution. The Trotskyists want to make Russia the spearhead of a world-wide social war, but Stalin is against that policy. Russia abandoned the great Communist party of Germany, and recognized Hitler's accession to power. Un doubtedly it has abandoned the promotion of the Communist cause in China, and has been much criticized on that account. In the present conflict, China has not received any assistance from Russia beyond obtaining supplies of munitions.",28
138,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Is not that a valuable form of assistance?,29
139,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Yes , but other nations are doing the same. Britain supplies munitions to any nation. In a totalitarian State, the Government has to accept responsibility for everything, but a democratic State may decline responsibility for the activities of private capitalists. The one thing that stands out crystal clear in the world today is that the Government of Russia will not fight except for the defence of its territory; not even for the support of communism in other countries will it draw the sword. It is clear that Russia has no aggressive intentions towards the rest of the wor*d and much clearer that it has no such intentions towards Australia. The position in respect of Japan is much better than it has ever been, because it is quite obvious that, whatever be the outcome of the Sino-Japanese conflict, Japan will be in a state of financial exhaustion similar to that in which it found itself at the termination of the Russo-Japanese war. If it wins, its full resources of men and money will be required to consolidate its conquest; if it fails, it can be, to a great extent, disregarded. . And what I am about to say regarding Other powers will also apply to Japan. Ear-flung empires are Embarrassing to mother countries. Great B r it a in would be a stronger nation today if its Empire were not so scattered. No nation wants a far-flung empire like that of the British people. To-day, the expansionist nations are aiming at conquests near at home, so that they can have that concentrated and easily-controlled territories, which will not involve them in overseas adventures or actions. That is what Japan, It a l y and Germany are striving for. It a l y and Germany have in view not the acquisition of remote overseas colonies.",29
140,Mr BADMAN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Is not Germany asking for the return of its former colonies?,29
141,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,I shall deal with that point shortly.,29
142,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Ital y waged a war against Abyssinia, which is far distant.",29
143,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Abyssini a w i ll not be a long way from other It a l i a n territory when the whole Italian plan has been consummated.,29
144,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"What is that plan ? Great Mr BLACKBURN - It is perfectly obvious that It a l y is aiming at a Mediterranean empire, including a portion of Egypt, and of Northern Africa . Germany is aiming at the hegemony of Central Europe, probably spreading eventually to the East. In reply to the point raised by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Badman), it seems to me that a great deal of talk about the return of the former German colonies is intended for overseas consumption. It supplies the German Government with an argument. I do not believe that Germany desires a colonial empire; if it does, that empire will come, not by the retrocession of its former colonial possessions, but by the annexation of Holland and the acquisition of Dutch overseas possessions. Whatever may be the position in Europe, it seems perfectly clear that a war with Italy or with Germany would be a war fought out in Europe, and would not affect Australia.",29
145,Mr GREGORY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Can not the honourable member realise that nations outside Europe might join in?,30
146,Mr BLACKBUBN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"What nations could do so ? I have disposed of that point. It is, - in my view, quite in-, conceivable that Bussia would take part in any war unless attacked, and it would appear to be out of the question for Japan to do so in order to assist either Germany or Italy.",30
147,Mr ARCHES CAMERON,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Does honourable member think that Japan would maintain the status quo in the Pacific during a European war?,30
148,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"For years the position of Japan will be such that it will not be able to do anything in that direction. Further, I do not think Japan desires outlying possessions.",30
149,Mr FRANCIS,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Who told the honourable member that?,30
150,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"My own common sense, which also tells me that Great Britain would be more secure today if it did not possess a far-flung Empire. Now that the plane of warfare has shifted from the sea to the air, the nations desire empires comprising territories near home which can be controlled and policed from the air rather than from the sea. I believe that the change of the method of fighting from the'sea to the air has altered tremendously the imperialistic ambitions of nations. Oversea colonies are quite a secondary consideration with Germany. If German ambitions with respect to the acquisition of territory develop, Germany will occupy most of Central Europe, and, similarly, if Italian ambitions extend further, Italy will establish a Mediterranean empire. Even if I believed there was a mueh greater danger of attack-than is actually the case, I should nevertheless endorse the policy of the Australian Labour party as the correct one for Australia, or any other country, to adopt. A great deal of the danger of war eventuating is undoubtedly due to preparations made for war. Nations cannot continually prepare for war without incurring that danger. In such nations there grows up a class of people habituated to the idea of war. They see in war all sorts of opportunities for capitalistic success and the conquest of new markets. Members of the woi-king class see that if new markets can be gained by their masters a greater degree of employment can be proother vided, while administrative and military classes see in any war opportunities for advancement. A nation cannot continue preparing for war without having to fight some day; it cannot make such preparations without creating a state of fear among other nations. The only attitude consistent with peace is one that cannot the be construed in any way as being in preparation for action overseas. In those circumstances the policy advocated by the Labour party is, I believe, the right one for this country. If Great Britain were, involved in any way at all it would be a tremendous disaster for Australia.",30
151,Mr ANTHONY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Does the honourable member think that other countries would regard Australia as a separate political entity ?,30
152,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"No . If Great Britain were at war I am certain they would not regard Australia as not being at war, too. If , for instance, Great Britain were at war with Japan, the Japanese would probably attack Australia, irrespective of what Australia did. But that does not affect my position. I hold that whatever happens to Australia or to any nation in the long run, we must make a stand for world peace, and with that object in view, if it is necessary to make preparations for war, only such action should be taken as could not be construed as anything but preparation for the actual defence of our own territory. I do not believe that there are malevolent nations in the world or that the rulers of any nations are actually malevolent. In my opinion the greatest danger of war results from international misunderstandings. There is little danger of war between Great Britain and the United States of America, because both nations speak the same language and read the same books and there is a free interchange of ideas between the two. But there is a great danger of war between countries that do not possess the same institutions and do not understand one another's views. As I pointed out a moment ago, nations that prepare for war upon such a scale that they could wage a war overseas create fear in other countries.",30
153,Mr ANTHONY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Is not Great Britain's unpreparedness for war the cause of the present risk of war?,31
154,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"I do not think so. One factor that in my opinion may bring lis to the verge of war is the closed Empire policy for which we, as well as Great Britain, are responsible, and under which* an attempt is made to close the Empire's markets to other nations. This policy, which was adopted by Great Britain in 1931, is bringing war nearer.  tariff.",31
155,Mr BLACKBURN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"I would favour a commercial union with New Zealand and the United States of America, and considerable reductions of the tariff. I should be prepared to make many sacrifices to bring peace nearer, because I realise that there cannot be peace when nations cease to deal with one another. All these things are secondary to the necessity to maintain peace. There is in - my mind a difference between a nation saying: ""We are going to keep our own markets as far as possible for ourselves, but we will trade with everybody else on an equal basis"" and saying ""We will keep our own markets as far as possible for ourselves and beyond that trade only with favoured peoples"". The latter is the more dangerous attitude and, as I say, I believe it is the closed Empire policy rather than Britain's unpreparedness that is making for war. Prior to the adoption of that policy by Great Britain in 1931 the British Empire had acquired a great deal of overseas territory without opposition on the part of other countries, because it was realized that when Great Britain took possession of, for instance, a portion of Africa or Asia, it did not exclude other nations from trading with the inhabitants on equal terms with British people, whereas if Germany, Erance or any other country assumed control of an undeveloped area a monopoly of trade would be established by that country. But Great Britain has abandoned its former policy with the result that the danger of war has been increased. I have, however, been drawn from my main theme. I repeat that in my opinion the defence policy enunciated by the Labour party, and to which I heart and soul subscribe, should be adopted in the interests of Australia. - Sir. HENRY GULLETT (Henty)' [12.24] - At the outset I desire to congratulate the Government, and the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) in particular, upon the enlarged national defence scheme placed before the House. To me it is admirable so far as it goes, but my complaint is that it goes neither far enough nor fast enough. I shall, however, deal with that point at a later stage. I regret that the Minister for Defence has spent so little time in the House during this very important debate. Apart from debates during the Great War, this is the most important discussion on defence that has ever occurred in this Parliament, and it is most unfortunate that the Minister should not have been in a position to listen to the views-many , I admit, critical, but many also constructive-put forward by honourable members. I make that comment, however, in no chiding spirit. I assume that the Minister is not present because he is overwhelmed with the great burden he is carrying at the present time. That brings me to a very interesting point. In no other part of the world would the Minister for Defence be absent from Parliament during a debate of this nature, and I am impelled to ask whether the Minister is not carrying an impossible load, and to urge strongly upon the Government the desirability of giving immediate consideration to the - question of dividing the Defence Department into two sections, and creating another portfolio. The crisis through which we are passing at present demands, I think, such action, for which there is ample precedent. For many years tliere was in this country an Assistant Minister for Defence when the defence programme was more or less normal. There are Assistant Ministers in departments of much less significance, and the responsibilities of which are less onerous than are those of the Defence Department at the present time. There is, for instance, a Ministry for Commerce under the control of a Minister and two Assistant Ministers. Heaven alone knows what they do, but that is the position. Then the Treasurer (Mr Casey) has acquired an assistant within the last six months, and altogether several departments are double-banked with portfolios, while the defence of Australia, which is of supreme importance at the present juncture, is dealt with by one Minister who is not able to remain in this chamber for more than a few minutes at a time during a vital debate, continuing over a number of days. I desire now to refer to the proposal to appoint for a term not clearly defined an Inspector-General of the Australian Military Forces, and to bring to Australia to occupy that post an officer of general rank in the United Kingdom. In past years there have been visits by a number of very highly placed aud distinguished British officers who have dealt with defence matters as a whole. For example, Sir John Salmond came to Australia some years ago to advise upon the Royal Australian Air Force, and important representatives of the British navy have visited this country also; but in each case their mission has been a brief and special one. Tbey have been requested toreport to the Commonwealth Government upon our defence system, and to make recommendations with respect to it, and I trust that the Government will, if possible, confine the duties of the distinguished officer who is to come from Great Britain on this occasion, in a similar manner. I make that request for a num8ir Henry Gullett. ber of reasons, but particularly because I believe that the briefer the visit the better the man we shall get. There is not an unlimited number of officers of general rank of outstanding capacity in the British Army, and to bring one of these gentlemen to Australia for any long period would, in all probability, interfere very seriously with his status and promotion in the British Army. To me the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was incomprehensible; throughout, it consisted of a series of contradictions, and it was quite contradictory of the previous responsible statements made by my honourable friend. As recently as the 26th March last the honourable gentleman saidThe defence programme outlined last night is a vastly different thing to the theories of collective security and external cooperation which hitherto have been the Prime Minister's preoccupation. And then he went on to sayThis is realism. It faces the facte as they affect Australia and Australians. That was, apart from detail, one hundred per cent, endorsement of this scheme; it was a complete endorsement of its principle, its enlarged nature, and the increased expenditure. I admit that the honourable gentleman went on to say in the course of that statement that the Government had stolen the Opposition's defence scheme. If that charge is truo why did the honourable gentleman occupy the best part of an hour yesterday in condemning the Government's scheme? He said that the scheme is his own, yet yesterday he literally kicked it to pieces. The honourable gentleman still stands for a policy of isolation, a defence policy run-ning along independent lines; he says that it is our duty in the formulation of a defence policy to look after Australia only, just as it is the part of every other portion of the Empire to look after itself only. The honourable gentleman is against co-operation.. It is a case of "" Each for himself, and the devil take the hindmost"". If that policy were carried out in the present circumstances, Australia would probably be the country that the devil would take. The honourable gentleman is in favour of each of the component parts of the British Empire providing separately for its own defence. It must be obvious to the honourable gentleman that the certain way to court defeat is to allow an enemy .such as we might . have to face- a powerful nation in itself, and not probably a combination of powers-t - dispose of the British countries one - one. When the Leader of the Opposithe tion was in the midst of his speech yesrequirements. terday some one asked a question about - our export and import trade, and he made the remarkable statement that he advowould - oated a policy for the defence of this country by the Australian Navy - confined to Australian waters; but routes. he gave very little explanation of the confines of those waters. He us, .then said-""But things are allright in the. world; they have substantially proved in the last few weeks! "" He also said, in effect, "" There is a prospect the future ""-indicatin g the near future - "" of such an alliance, beginning with the trade agreement between the United States of America and the United dom, as would guarantee the trade routes of Australia in time of war "" ",31
156,Mr CURTIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,I did not say anything of the kind.,33
157,Sir HENRY GULLETT,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The honorother able gentleman said that we should stand aloof and have nothing to do with the rest of the Empire in matters of defence, but, "" Please, United Kingdom, and pray you, the United States of America, if we get into trouble, look after trade routes "". The honourable member for Batman .(Mr Brennan) was a more specific as to what he would He was quite clear that he would keep the Army at home, and quite clear, apparently, that he would keep the Force at home, but he said, "" I am favour of allowing the Navy to go a way from Australia "". Did he mean to sort, would be thrown idle. Rottnest Island, Thursday Island, mania, or where? The remarks of these honourable gentlemen plainly indicate that the party opposite has no policy whatever in relation to defence, and its purpose is merely to oppose for sake of opposing. Such an attitude at this time is particularly deplorable. Mr. Curtin. - Does the honourable member' favour the borrowing of overseas Â£10,000,000 for the Government's defence programme?",33
158,Sir HENRY GULLETT,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"I shall come to that a little later. I should like first to say a few words upon the very important subject of the preservation qf imour trade routes, because this seems to o me, and I am sure it must appear so to by all who have pondered it, to be one of most important aspects of our defence Our common aim is to make this country so unattractive, so formidable to an invader, that no nation care to attack us; but to my.mind the very beginning of the safety of this country is the protection of our trade If we chose a policy of isolation and a powerful aggressor came against our little Australian Navy, even after we have built it up by the expenditure of immoneys provided for in the schedule to the bill, would be sent to the bottom, for or shut up in our various harbours. At any rate it would be completely out of action in a fortnight. Then, suddenly, and completely, our export and import trade Kingwould be stopped. We would awaken some morning to find that we could not send away a single bale of wool, a quarter of beef, a carcase of lamb, a gallon of wine, or a pound of butter or any of the export commodities of this country. That is not a matter of controversy, but of plain fact. The outcome need not be dwelt upon. We should then find ourselves I immediately overwhelmed with surplus primary products; all prices within our Australia would go down to a level insufficient to pay transport little charges to the markets. At one do. sweep would be destroyed, not only the employment of the countryside, but also the purchasing power of the people, Air and, in turn, the great majority of our in metropolitan and industrial workers, little business, men and employers of every That Taswould be the logical outcome of any policy of isolating the defence of this country rather than of co-operating in time of trouble with the Empire as a that whole, and particularly with Great the Britain. Let me say quite clearly that I shall resist in every possible way, as T am sure the Government itself would, any sort of conscription in this country for service, either in peace or war. But the great citadel -'upon which all British protection in this part of the world rests is Singapore; upon that base naval might and effectiveness will be concentrated in time of war, and it is to the force based on Singapore that we must look for protection - against an invader. Certainly, upon the fate of Singapore will very largely depend whether an invader will come to Australia or not, and bow far our trade routes will be kept open for normal business in time of war. That being so-and it is certainly sohow can we possibly have an effective policy without ful l co-operation with Singapore ? Why was the Singapore Naval Base established? It was created at the cost of millions of pounds of the British taxpayers' money, with very little supple- where. ment from outside, not to defend London, but for the defence of the British Empire comprehensively, including Australia and British possessions in the Far East and in the south-eastern Pacific. Singapore stands virtually across the lines of communication of the one enemy which this country may anticipate.",33
159,Mr GANDEK,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,The honourable member refers to Japan.,34
160,Sir HENRY GULLETT,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"I do. Why not talk plainly. In the British House of Commons British members speak frankly of Germany, Italy, Japan or Russia, and I believe that Japan will appreciate our honesty if we discuss these matters frankly. Besides, we have, to consider not Japan alone. There is in existence today a three-power pact, two of the signatories of which are the most overcrowded and the most land hungry countries in the world. In Australia we have at once the richest, the fairest",34
161,Mr NOCK,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Most undeveloped.,34
162,Sir HENRY GULLETT,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"And the least defended of all the countries in the world. I turn now to discuss briefly the problem of Australia's Infantry Forces. I wish that I could be as positive as is the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) that there is no danger in the near future. Unhappily I have not his certainty of mind. I do not suggest that invasion is imminent, but I am not unmindful of the fact that international law ancl international morality have apparently been forgotten by the rulers of some great countries. During the last two or three years we have witnessed aggression in a most terrible form. . I applaud the Government's scheme, as far as it goes; but I emphasize that, without adequate infantry forces well equipped and sufficiently trained to go into immediate action, Australia cannot be considered safe. Eminent military authorities believe that if invasion does come to this country, which God forbid, it will come, not as a great army, but in a series of raids. Military strategy would probably suggest the landing of say, 10,000 troops at one point with feints, demonstrations or actual landings elseWhile I am in complete agreement that we must have these technical services UTJOII which the Government proposes to incur heavy expenditure, it is, I believe, essential that we should have adequate infantry to meet the raids in strength where and when they may be made. Obviously an aggressor would not land forces in the north-west of Australia, where it would be easy to get ashore, because that portion of the Commonwealth would have no attraction for the enemy. The objective would be one or more of our vital industrial areas. If tomorrow we had a couple of months' notice of impending danger of forces being landed simultaneously near Sydney and Melbourne or in Western Australia what strength would we have to resist them? Once they got ashore we could not expect to halt them with our - air forces, and the vulnerability of modern naval units to attack from the air has been very much exaggerated. This, at all events, is the opinion of British naval authorities. Therefore, if an invading force landed, within striking distance of Newcastle, Sydney or Melbourne, our position would be extremely grave. Our present infantry strength is 35,000 militia, scattered all over Australia, whose training amounts to twelve half-days a year and six days in camp, ""less two days travelling to and from oamp, so that their actual period of training is ten days a. year. I have no wish to criticize the men. On. the contrary I warmly commend them for their public spirit. But the truth is that we have the greatest difficulty in getting sufficient numbers, and the physical standard of the units is not as high as it should be: it is not nearly up to the standard for acceptance during the Great ""War. Yet this is the force upon which we should have to depend to guard Australia against the possibility of two or three heavy and well-planned raids. It is interesting to see how the 35,000 militiamen are distributed in the various States of the Commonwealth. The distribution is, of course, very largely on a population basis. Thus, in the great State of New South Wales we have less than. 13,000 of these slightly trained men, and in Victoria we have 9,500. These men would, in all probability, be confronted by war veterans or conscript trained forces. In Queensland, that part of the Commonwealth which an invader would obviously find very habitable, there are only 5,000 partly trained militia. South Australia has 3,000, and there are only 2,300 in Western Australia, which is so isolated from the rest of the Commonwealth, that rapid 'assistance could not be given. The State of Tasmania has a mere 1,200. If the members of our militia were comparable to the Australian Forces in France and Palestine in 1917 and 1918, the defence force, although being still totally inadequate, would be experienced fighters upon whom strong l-einforcements could be rested with the certainty that they would very quickly reach a high standard of efficiency. The capacity of the present militia forces to absorb and train recruits must be very Low indeed. Months would elapse before we could produce men with sufficient training to go into the line against experienced troops without suffering appalling casualties. The position is even more serious than that. We have no system for the calling up of reinforcements in an emergency. This is an aspect which I wish particularly to stress. I urge the early re-establishment in this country of the area officer system, and I suggest that area officers should, wherever possible, be supplemented by industrial officers. These officers would be responsible for compiling a register of all men in the Commonwealth between the ages of IS and 50 years fit for service or wartime industry. The men should be classified according to whether they are to be front line men or industrial workers. If they are highly skilled, then they would be in a reserve for industry. If they are classified to go into the front line, they should be allocated in such a way that their services would be available immediately the order for mobilization was given. Under existing conditions in Australia, if the order for mobilization were to be given today, there would be chaos. It is not difficult to visualize the disorganization that would occur in Sydney in the event of a sudden raid. I happened to be in France on holidays in 1914 when the war broke out, and I was amazed by the efficiency and expedition with which mobilization was carried out. The only notification that France was at war was a single typewritten line giving the date of mobilization, 1st August; yet within half-anhour, the older men in the fifties began to pass down the streets on their way to the barracks, where they were equipped, and given such duties as fell within their capacity. By the tenth or twelfth day, mobilization had extended to the first reserves, or the near reserves, for whom the barracks were ready, so these men were able at once to enter the fighting services. We are not .a conscript country, and never want to be, but we should make adequate provision for our defence so that 1 if war does come, our men may go into action in a business like way.",34
163,Mr MAHONEY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,And the war profiteers will prosper.,35
164,Sir HENRY GULLETT,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"I sincerely hope that war will never come to this country, and, I urge that we take every possible step to keep our sons out of war. Like the Prime Minister, the Acting Minister for Commerce and many other honourable members. I have a son of military age, so it would be foolish to suggest that I am in any way speaking in favour of war. I emphasize that a scheme for the systematic mobilization of Australian manhood should be drawn up by the Government, concurrently with the addition to the A ir Force, the Navy and coast defences. It has been said that we have not the necessary equipment for larger numbers who might be enrolled for compulsory training. I strongly challenge that statement. The existing equipment for infantry, machine gun, artillery units ancl other arms is used only on twelve half-days ancl one week in every year] so the possibility of expansion of training is apparent. A battalion commander in Melbourne, to whom I spoke last week 7 on this subject, informed me that with his existing equipment he could train five time the present number, provided more training days were made available. There is nothing warlike in my suggestion. It is purely sound defence. On what would a potential enemy take stock of this country? Would it be our 70 odd aeroplanes, or double that number, as proposed under the enlarged defence scheme? Would it be the cruisers of the Australian Navy or our coastal defences? No. All these things would count for little, if we were without an efficient infantry force. An enemy would measure our defence potentiality on our trained man-power, or man power in availability. If we were measured only on our very limited technical services and our 35,000 partly trained militia men our rating would be very low indeed. An enemy would know that if his forces could get ashore, resistance would be very slight. If , however, we had a proper system providing for the rapid mobilization of an effective defence force, we should be assessed as a far more formidable objective ancl probably be left to enjoy our peace. I submit that scheme with confidence to every member of the Opposition, and I put it forward as a common sense one. I ask honourable members first to satisfy themselves as to conscription. Everybody must subscribe to the statement made yesterday by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) that one cannot visualize stripping this country of its manhood as was done in the Great War. It may be that we could send two or three divisions somewhere overseas, but they would be volunteers, and we could always be certain of getting volunteers; compulsory training is in no way associated with conscription for overseas service. What does recent history show as to the indispensability of infantry ? Madrid; Sir Henry Gullett. for a year or more, has stood against all the modern mechanism of war. Why? It has been practically bombed to bits, and i i is constantly under heavy gunfire, but it has stood so far because of its strongly entrenched and indomitable lines of infantry. I clo not say that infantry will save Barcelona, yet, if there were sufficient infantrymen, they could save that city. Most of the professional army of Spain went to the Nationalists, and what a price Republican Spain has paid through not having a trained army! Had it possessed the professional army, the story would have beenentirely different. It started with untrained troops, and that is the reason why it has paid such a terrible price. The history of Gallipoli telk of a glorious landing and a magnificent achievement up to a point, but every good mind in. the Australian Imperial Force knowsthat if we had had there a division of Australians from France, as they were in 1917 or 1918, or a divisionof dismounted Australian Light Horse from Palestine, as they were in those years, they would have swept through irresistibly to the Narrows. The United States of America started in the war from scratch,"" where we should have to start to-morrowwithout even a mobilization scheme-and quite a year went by before that country had any men in France. Take the SinoJapanese war. Why have the Chinese, temporarily, at least- I do not say permanently-checke d the Japanese, despite all their armaments and modern mechanism ? It is because when this conflict began China had for years been engaging in a great deal of internal warfare. Probably a couple of million Chinese bad been more or less in arms and had been handling rifles. The present Commander-in-Chief, Chiang-kai-shek, had really great forces in arms at the outset of the war. The Young Marshal, the Manchu, had a considerable army with which he was engaged against the so called "" reds "". These forces, once opponents, are now combined against the Japanese, and, in addition, there were armed bandits in the northern provinces practised in guerilla tactics, who have all thrown in.their lot with Chiang-kaishek. Without modem equipment,. China, by attacks upon communications, ancl by being able to stand up to the enemy, has achieved the miracle of stopping one of the greatest powers in the world, despite the fact that that power is armed with al l the latest equipment. As I see it , there is real danger to Australia ; I do not say tomorrow, but in the years close ahead. It is in the power of this Government, and the Parliament as a whole, actually to remove that danger, to save this country from aggression, aud to kÂ«cp our young men out of war. I have no doubt at all that, as the debate proceeds, and as the Government gives more consideration to its present defence scheme, it will remove the one great weakness in it , which is that, for at least some time ahead, it provides no infantr y of immediate fighting account.",35
165,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Hindmarsh) [2.36] The honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) went to considerable pains to allay jiu-blic fears that the Government might impose conscription upon this country, A careful survey of the speeches delivered by honourable gentlemen on the Ministerial side would at least provide matter for earnest thought, because it is evident that those honourable members would be prepared to impose upon the manhood of Australia a system of compulsory military service which would definitely require the bearing of arms, not only within the borders of this continent, but also overseas. The whole party history of honourable members opposite furnishes justification for my declaration. No matter how extensive may be the defence programme of the Government, apparently it will never satisfy the desires of those who are incapable of appreciating the limitations of the resources of this country. The honourable member also said that the present defence proposals of the Government neither went far enough, nor could be put member is in error. into operation rapidly enough, to suit him. One would imagine that we were actually engaged in the consideration of defence proposals following upon a declaration of hostilities. The panicstricken manner in which honourable members opposite have spoken on this subject makes it appear that they are of reviewing the situation in a calm way. Their speeches have consisted i the main either of strictures upon members on this side of ' the chamber or of observations such as might be expected in time of actual war, and have not been in any sense helpful to the country. Both the honourable member for Henty this afternoon, and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) last night rendered a grave disservice to Australia in seeking to show that there was substantial justification for the view held in certain other countries of the world that we were not developing this country, or populating it in a reasonable way. When our representatives subsequently attend international conferences of one kind aud another, they may be confronted with reports of these and similar speeches. The deduction that we are not entitled to retain possession of this country should not be made possible by the utterances of members of this Parliament. 1 therefore seriously deprecate the speeches of the honourable members to whom I have referred. If any people in the world can be said to be really developing the country in which they live, it is the Australian people. The last 150 years have conclusively shown the marvellous colonization characteristics of our people and have undoubtedly justified our possession of this country. We have, in fact, made remarkable progress. The speech of the honourable member for Hunty was also contradictory in that, while he said with one breath that the defence programme of the Government was not sufficiently extensive and was not being implemented at a sufficiently fast rate, he said in the next breath that even with the elaborate expansion now proposed, the programme, in respect of ' it s naval and air force provisions, would be ineffective. Sir HEN RY GUT.LKT'I? - The honourable",37
166,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,I suggest that the honourable member for Henty should caref u l l y read the report of his speech. He will then understand why I make this assertion.,37
167,Sir HENRY GUI,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,LETT - Do not make incapable a sermon out of it !,37
168,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The honourable member n will no doubt be required to answer for what he has said, for I am not mistaken in my impression of the meaning of his utterance. He will, no doubt, recollect that he said that even with the increase of the Navy, foreshadowed hy the Government, it would still not be difficult to bottle up all our vessels in certain harbours of this country. He ""will also recollect saying that, even if we were to double the number of our aircraft, the force would still be incapable of undertaking the service which it was intended to perform. In spite of these remarks, however, the honourable gentleman enendorsed the programme of the Government, and even went so far as to offer his congratulations to .the Minister for Defence. If anything more inconsistent is desired than the remarkable speech of the honourable member I do not know where it could be obtained. I would say to honourable gentlemen opposite who make extravagant statements",37
169,Mr GANDER,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"Why is the honourable member for Henty leaving the chamber? Other honourable members interjecting,",38
170,Mr SPEAKER,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,Hon. G. J. Bell) I must insist on honourable members refraining from interjections.,38
171,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"It is remarkable that though some honourable gentlemen opposite do not hesitate to lecture the members of the Opposition, they are unwilling to listen to criticism of their own observations. The retirement of the honourable member for Henty from the chamber is in itself eloquent testimony to his unwillingness to listen to the other side of the question. We have before us for consideration a bill which provides for loan of Â£10,300,000 for certain defence equipment. I strongly protest against such a measure being introduced without a great deal more explanation of it than has been furnished to us by the Government. The purpose of this bill, we are told, is to provide, in part, for financing of a three-year defence programme involving an increased expenditure of Â£43,000,000. That being so, the Government should have given us much more information than it has seen fit to provide. If it had not been for the timely rebuke of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) we should not have had the meagre information that is now before us. Even as it is, I challenge the propriety of some of the items which appear in the schedule thathas been tabled. Before proceeding to a detailed consideration of this schedule, however, I protest strongly against the failure of the Prime Minister, or some other responsible Minister, to explain fully all that is involved in this proposed added expenditure of Â£43,000,000. The Government should undoubtedly have related the expenditure proposed in this bill to that contemplated in the remainder of the programme that is to be implemented next financial year, and in the following year.",38
172,Mr THORBY,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,The Prime Minister gave a very clear outline of the three year programme in the statement he made on Wednesday night.,38
173,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"I have considered that statement and I do not regard it as in any sense the comprehensive survey to which we are entitled. The proposal of the Government to finance its defence programme out of loan funds is definitely unsound and out of harmony with the wishes of the general community. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday pointed out clearly to the House that defence equipment is a wasting asset; it is subjected to deterioration and obsolescence to a degree more marked tbaii in any other public utility. That being so, surely it is our obligation, and not that of future generations, to provide for the expenditure upon this equipment. It should be provided for by either direct taxation or by utilizing those undoubted facilities that are possible to the a nation through the Commonwealth Bank. I feel that it is reprehensible for the Commonwealth Government to try to place upon the shoulders of future generations the burdens that the present generation should rightly carry. Honourable gentlemen opposite would not be so enthe thusiastic about this enlarged defence programme if fresh taxes upon their special friends were inescapable. The method that is being adopted, however, not only avoids fresh taxation of the wealthy interests of this country and - absentees, but also gives them a further opportunity to extract profit; because under this bill Â£300,000 is set aside to meet expense involved in the flotation of the loan, which is, of course, a "" rake-off"" for them. And, after having obtained that "" rake-off"", they will have the further opportunity to make profits in meeting the orders of the Government under the defence programme, as well as the constantly recurring interest bill which will ultimately aggregate this loan amount to double the figure set down. In a word, the Government is opening the way to exploitation of the people of this country by private banking interests and armament firms that have their affairs so - closely interlocked, and, accordingly, I oppose the proposal now made, first, because it lays down a principle in the financing of defence expenditure which is not only unsound, but also definitely wrong; secondly, because no ministerial statement has been made to justify this enormous expenditure to cope with what is claimed to be a state of emergency; and thirdly, because I am emphatically opposed to the private manufacture of armaments in which exorbitant profits are made at the expense of the nation and, in particular, its social welfare. What state of emergency exists today that was not apparent six months ago? When six months ago the Government increased the rate of expenditure on the defence of this country we were told that the amount thenprovided would meet all requirements. What has occurred 'since then to change the opinion of the Government? The Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) endeavoured to explain that world conditions had deteriorated, and that the national situation gave cause for greater fear than was the case last year. But I do not think that any honourable member of this House, or members of the general public, will endorse his declaration. As a matter of fact, the position in Europe today, and in the world generally, shows 1 some appeasement compared with last year. It becomes all the more astounding that the Government should seek sanction for its programme provided for under this bill when one .considers the world-situation. Unless Government is prepared to advance to this House some further justification for the programme that it has submitted, we are not warranted in making available to it means which will enable it to create a war hysteria in this country and deprive the people of the social benefit due to them. I seize this opportunity to declare that the Government will never implement the social insurance proposals to which it has committed itself. The Government will find a convenient excuse to shelve the scheme, or abandon it altogether. Of course, it will not accept responsibility for its action; it will make some excuse such as that the States refuse to co-operate, and then it will use the money that should have been devoted to the inauguration of this important social service for the furtherance of its colossal 'defence schemes. '",38
174,Mr SPEAKER,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"The honourable member ""may not discuss national insurance on this bill.",39
175,Mr MAKIN,RESEARCH APPROPRIATIO N,"It is stated in the bill that the sum of Â£1,000,000 is to be devoted to paying the final instalment on the cruiser Sydney. The first instalment was paid from revenue, and Parliament was given to understand that all subsequent instalments would also be paid from revenue. Last year, however, the Government departed from that principle, and an instalment was paid out of the loan of Â£2,500,000 which was raised overseas. At the time the Treasurer informed honourable members that this loan was to be used to meet non-recurring expenditure, and nothing was said at the time about part of it being used to pay' the second last instalment on the cruiser inter- Sydney. Now a further Â£1,000,000 of loan money is to be used to make the final payment on the cruiser. Thus the new loan of Â£10,000,000 is not even to be expended wholly on the Government's new defence programme; part of it is to be used to pay for the old programme. The Treasurer tried to make us believe that the new loan is to be raised entirely in Australia, but when we remember what happened in regard to the instalments on the cruiser Sydney, we are justified in believing that he will be the quite capable of borrowing still more money overseas for defence purposes. Honourable members are entitled to receive more explicit information: than has yet been vouchsafed to them. Of course, Government supporters may have been given additional information in the party room, but, on the information so far lriado public, Parliament would not bo justified in giving the Government authority to raise this loan for defence purposes, more particularly,, if there is any danger that the money, in whole or in part, is to be Vaised abroad. Further borrowing overseas will lead the country back to the calamitous conditions that prevailed some years ago. Such a policy does not deserve the endorsement of this Parliament or of the people.

INDUSTRIALREQUIREMENTS FOR DEFENCE .",42
197,Mr JAMES,TELEGRAPH LINE BETWEEN STUDIO,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, prior to seeking the co-operation of the workers in defence matters, it is necessary that he should make himself conversant with tlieir economic position caused through the displacement of labour by the introduction of machines? 2. Is he willing to investigate, at least, the highly mechanized industries, such as coal mining, for a start, and to take some practical steps to reduce the hours of labour in order to offset the effect of the machines?",42
198,Mr LYONS,TELEGRAPH LINE BETWEEN STUDIO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. It is not considered that it is necessary to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member. The Government has arranged for the constitution of an advisory panel - consisting of representatives of trade unions, which will provide a means of consultation between the Government and trade unions on matters appertaining to the industrial side of defence requirements. NA ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA.  honourable member for Wentworth made certain inquiries pertaining to the charges for telephonic conversations between the Awaiea and (o) Australia and (b) New Zealand. The Postmaster-General has supplied the following information:The charge for telephone calls between New Zealand and Australia, which was fixed by agreement between the two Administrations, is Â£2 5s. for three minutes' conversation and ISs. for each additional minute. It will be appreciated thai conversation from a mobile station Such as the Awaiea is practicable in both directions immediately the vessel leaves port, aud it is consequently anomalous to pormit conversation from the ship at an amount substantially lower 'than the through rate. It has to be remembered that the charge covers conversations to and from any point served by the telephone trunk network of Australia, and a tariff similar to that imposed by the New Zealand Administration would not only be inconsistent with the agreement for the through ""service, but would be totally unprofitable. The department has no knowledge of the reasons which induced the New Zealand Administration to introduce a charge so much below the rate which is applied by them, in common with Australia, for through traffic. The lionorable member might be interested to know that the tariffs for through traffic, and also for ship traffic, are at present under review, and it is hoped that means may be found to reduce the charges, although there is no likelihood of the fees between the Axoatea and Australia being reduced to the level of those which are now applied to traffic between the vessel and Now Zealand.",42
