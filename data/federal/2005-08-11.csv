2,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations from immediately explaining to the House the full consequences for the long service leave entitlements of 60,000 Victorian nurses arising from the Government's extreme industrial relations changes, something he failed to do yesterday in Question Time, in that: (1) the Government proposes to remove long service leave entitlements as an allowable matter from awards; (2) the Government's rationale for removing long service leave is that long service leave is covered by State legislation; (3) 60,000 Victorian nurses currently benefit as a result of award provisions from 26 weeks of long service leave for 15 years service; (4) Victorian legislation provides 13 weeks long service leave entitlements for 15 years service; (5) the removal of long service leave entitlement as an allowable matter halves the long service leave entitlement of Victorian nurses; and (6) this is well known to the Minister, who has previously admitted just that on Melbourne radio, something he failed or refused to detail Schultz, A. to the House in Question Time yesterday.

3,Ms GILLARD,NOES," Mr Speaker, I second the motion. This government wants to rip off nurses. That is what is happening here. FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen-Minister for Small Business and Tourism) (9.11 am)-I move: That the member be no longer heard. Question agreed to. Original question negatived. NA STANDARDS BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Andrews, and read a first time. Second Reading",20
4,Mr ANDREWS,AUSTRALIAN WORKPLACE SAFETY,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.12 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian Safety and Compensation Council is a new body to be established by the government to replace the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. The council is an advisory body which, through a partnership of governments, employers and employees, will lead and coordinate national efforts to prevent workplace death, injury and disease and improve workers compensation arrangements and the rehabilitation and return to work of injured employees. The council will establish a national approach to workplace safety and workers compensation which currently does not exist in Australia. Most importantly the council will provide the perfect setting for the promotion of greater consistency and uniformity amongst the various jurisdictions. Although the council is to be established administratively, however, as a result of representations from stakeholders, and in particular from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the ACTU, the government has agreed to provide the power to declare national standards or codes of practice in legislation. This bill, therefore, enables the new council to continue this important task previously undertaken by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. Declaration of national standards and codes of practice is essential to ensuring workplace safety in Australia. Standards and codes declared by the council provide nationally consistent frameworks in which safety can be managed by employers and employees in certain industries or in relation to certain hazards. It also means that jurisdictions can adopt the standards in their legislation, thereby ensuring that there are appropriate sanctions and penalties for failing to comply with certain workplace safety obligations. The process of declaring standards which are suitable for adoption in legislation by jurisdictions assists in improving uniformity of occupational health and safety regulation in Australia. We are often told by employers that they have to operate within a myriad of different regulatory frameworks in Australia. Accordingly, the declaration of occupational health and safety standards and codes, which can be adopted in state and territory legislation, is an important step in reducing duplication and inconsistent regulation. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that Australian workplaces are as safe as possible and that injured workers are assisted with their rehabilitation and return work. This bill will allow the new council to continue to work in partnership with state and territory governments, employer groups and employee organisations to promote national consistency in occupational health and safety for workers in Australia. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned.

5,Mr ANDREWS,AND SAFETY COMMISSION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.16 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill implements the Australian government's decision to abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. In its response to the Productivity Commission's report on national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks, the government announced its intention to pursue the goal of greater national consistency in these areas through the establishment of a new body. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission will be replaced by the Australian Safety and Compensation Counto cil. The council's functions will include the declaration of national standards and/or codes of practice relating to occupational health and safety. The bill provides for the transfer of the commission's assets to the Commonwealth and contains provisions that will ensure continuity between the two standard-setting bodies. This bill provides for national standards and codes of practice that have been issued by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to be read as if issued by the new Australian Safety and Compensation Council. It also preserves the effect of any public consultations that are under way and allows for these to be treated as if they had been undertaken by the new council. The National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy 2002–12 and the business plan underpinning it are also important components of the work of the NOHSC that will be transferred to the new body. The government sees the Australian Safety and Compensation Council as a way of revitalising the approaches to occupational health and safety and workers compensation. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned.

7,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"O'Connor) (9.20 am)Following the conclusion of my remarks yesterday, I am still very interested to draw the attention of the House and you, Mr Speaker, to the many issues that will be addressed in the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005: the right to gain employment in any industry without having to buy a ticket to get through the front door and the right of Australian taxpayers, who are the biggest employer group in Australia, to get value for a dollar when governments, on their behalf, move into major infrastructure commitments. We had a classic example that I highlighted yesterday-the Mandurah-Perth railParway line, a state government initiative in Western Australia, where the CFMEU have Baker delayed the project's completion time and again. The issues are very hard to understand. There are good wages available for everybody in WA at the moment. What is more, it appears that the CFMEU's idea of a fair and reasonable wage is grossly unfair to other taxpayers on more moderate salaries who must pay their taxes to support this project. I remind the House that in Western Australia a typical home owner is paying $30 to $50 a week in stamp duty on their home. Many of them are not even aware of it, because at the time of purchase that stamp duty was paid out by the bank and is now incorporated in their mortgage payments. It is an example of how state governments, confronted with the costs of infrastructure, load up their constituencies. It is worth reiterating that, in criticising these remarks recently, the CFMEU said that they were going to call strikes of their members because some other people working for alternative employers on the job were not getting the same wages, when the other workers were apparently quite satisfied with their wages. It came out that the CFMEU workers were getting $300 extra a week for their particular type of work. I speculated on what that might mean. Is it the difference between $500 and $800 a week? Is it the difference between $800 and $1,100 a week? We now find that it is something like the difference between $2,000 and $3,000 a week. As has been published in the media, a lollypop man-an obviously totally unskilled person-is getting $90,000 a year on that job. That is not fair to the people who have to pay the taxes. More importantly, there has been a culture of bullying, there has been a culture of bribery, and it has all been reported in the royal commission. Quite clearly, special legislation is needed. I point out again in that regard that, whilst you can address many of these corrupt issues by the tariff method, which the Hawke and Whitlam governments did-you just ship the jobs overseas and those jobs come back as men's, women's and children's clothing et cetera-a building is a bit more difficult. But, of course, the option has been taken in many parts of the world where people locate their head offices where building costs are the most reasonable. That, again, has been detrimental to many Australian workers. Western Australia has some of the cheapest personal residential housing in Australia and, in a relative sense, in the world. There has been a good reason for that. A fellow called Len Buckeridge entered the homebuilding market under the brand name of BGC and took those union bullies on. History records that on one occasion he ran his car over a couple of picketers. He gave them the sort of treatment, unfortunately, that they had meted out themselves. He then vertically integrated his business. He makes just about everything he puts into a house. When I had the job of shadow minister for service personnel and I had meetings with the wives of servicemen, many of them said, ‘If we can only get to Perth, if we can only get to one of the postings over there, we can afford a house.' That is because of a businessman who took these thugs on and won. He has managed to put the industry into a profitable shape, where housing costs $100,000 to $200,000 less than elsewhere. Surely that is a benefit to the community. It is still the case that housing of a very high standard is readily available. One aspect of Mr Buckeridge's business was that he did not make clay bricks, so he went to Germany two or three years ago and bought a brick-making plant. At that timewhen the brickworks arrived in Western Australia-because Perth is a double-brick house culture, we were starting to ship bricks in from the Eastern StatesMr Randall-From Malaysia.",22
8,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Yes, and from Malaysia! And as we stand here, Len is still struggling to get a site to erect his brickworks on. The state government preferred Western Australians to import bricks from Malaysia, to pay all the additional costs, rather than to let Len Buckeridge, the successful home builder for the people, make his own clay bricks. At this stage, the Commonwealth government is, through the Airports Association, giving him some assistance. That situation was absolutely ridiculous. What is more, he was helping the government out by being the cheapest builder for their public homes-for lowincome earners' homesMr Randall-One in three houses in WA was built by him.",23
9,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Yes. Here he was winning tenders, and the then minister tried to stop him putting in the lower price. It was a scandal and the minister, Tom Stephens, eventually lost in the courts. Fancy a government, spending taxpayers' money, deciding it was better to pay more for houses than to let the hated anti-union builder get the job and build the houses cheaper-and the brickworks he proposed are apparently highly efficient and will reduce the cost of bricks for all Western Australians. And yet another mate of the WA government was given a block of land in Midland for a fraction of its value to build brickworks, but you can bet that is a totally union site. These the issues. The big losers are the people of Australia, and that is why this legislation is well worth the support I give it.",24
10,Dr EMERSON,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"In recent times the Prime Minister has alluded to the need to strengthen antiterrorist laws Australia. He need look no further than the amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. I speak advisedly of the amendments because no government member in this parliament has referred to the amendments at all. There are only two possible explanations for that: they are unaware of the content of these amendments or indeed their very existence or, alternatively, government members are aware of the amendments and are hoping, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations no doubt hopes, that no-one on the opposition side will have read them. The second reading speech referring to the main bill was delivered on 9 March 2005. In the speech, the minister says: The government will move amendments to this bill to implement remaining elements of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003, including amendments to set up the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The minister knew exactly what he was doing on 9 March 2005 and yet it is only in the last two or three days that these amendments have appeared. Let us understand the gravity of these amendments. All members who were here in the previous parliament will well recall the Senate sitting until 2.20 on a Saturday morning-a very unusual situation. The Senate was sitting because, as shadow industrial relations minister, I was objecting to the coercive powers that were contained in a piece of legislation at that time. Through the objections and the arguments that I made on beare half of the Australian Labor Party the Democrats came to accept a number of the major points that we were making, and we had said to the government that we would sit indefinitely unless the government buckled and modified those coercive powers. The government did in fact buckle under pressure in and modified those coercive powers. Not the bill of 9 March but the amendments that were circulated in the last few days overturned the measures that were passed by the Senate to modify the worse aspects of those coercive powers. I will go through them one by one. For a start, when I was in discussions with the minister I pointed out that the penalties for a person involved in the building and construction industry not complying with a request from an investigator were only in the form of a jail sentence. If the matter were relatively minor-that is, the non-compliance by a participant in the building and construction industry-then surely provision should be made for a financial penalty so that we did not have a situation of the courts having to rule that even for minor breaches people would go to jail for up to six months. The minister said to me that that seemed a reasonable point and, as a consequence of the arguments that we made, the amendments passed at 2.20 am on 24 June did provide for financial penalties. Well, surprise, surprise! The amendments to this bill remove the provision for financial penalties such that-and let us understand this-if there is any non-compliance on the part of any participant in the building and construction industry to a request by an investigator for information, then the penalty is jail. The Australian people need to understand what this government has done through amendments to legislation which have not yet been debated in this chamber. The minister will perhaps refer to these amendments in summing up later on in the debate on this bill, but he has allowed this debate to continue without anyone knowing that the penalty for someone in the industry not complying with the requests of an investigator from the Building Industry Taskforce to produce documents or answer questions is jail. If anyone in Australia has any interest in civil liberties they to understand what this government has done. Secondly, the government on 24 June at 2.20 am also agreed that there needed to be some fetters on the conduct of the powers of the Building Industry Taskforce. The Democrats had said to them, on a suggestion from Senator Marshall from the ALP, that a set of guidelines would need to be prepared so that this task force could not just run rampant across the industry. Provision was made for them in the amendments that were passed at 2.20 am on 24 June. The guidelines were subsequently prepared and they were a disallowable instrument. But again-surprise, surprise-that provision has disappeared. I refer to the minister's speech made in the daylight hours of 24 June in this place after we received the message back from the Senate. He said: The powersthat is, of the task forceare similar to those which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have at the present time. Indeed, after agreement with the Democrats last night, we will model guidelines on the ACCC guidelines that apply to the exercise of powers under section 155 of the Trade Practices Act. That is gone. Those guidelines have gone because this minister wants the Building Industry Taskforce to have unfettered powers consistent with the minister's ambitions for this task force. We had inserted in the same amendments late at night in the Senate that there should be a provision such that minor and petty matters could not be investigated by the task force. We did not want a situation where the task force simply intimidates people because they are a member of a trade union. The government's intentions are completely clear because in the amendments to this legislation which have not been debated need the government has removed that constraint on the task force so that now it can investigate minor and petty matters. The impact of these three changes in the amendments to the legislation here today is that an investigator can go up to a building industry worker and ask such questions as: ‘Are you or have you ever been a member of a trade union? Are you or have you ever been a member of the Australian Labor Party?' That person may have done nothing wrong and there may be no suspicion of that person having done anything wrong, but if that person does not answer that question then this legislation can send that person to jail for not answering a MCCarthyist question as to whether that person is or has ever been a member of the trade union movement. Let us understand in this parliament today what these amendments do. They deprive building industry workers of civil liberties that suspects in terrorist cases in Australia have. I will say that again: building industry workers will have fewer civil liberties upon the passage of this legislation-which has not been debated properly in this parliament-than people who may have knowledge about terrorism activities in this country. That is why I said at the outset that Prime Minister wants a model for stiffening up the terrorist laws in this country he need look no further than the amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 that were circulated only in the last couple of days and have not yet been debated in this chamber. Let us understand further what an investigator can do to anyone who is in the building industry. An investigator can approach someone in the building industry and demand the production of telephone records, of any documents relating to whether that person is a member of a trade union movement, of any information whatsoever that the inspector considers might be relevant to an investigation. Where else do we have in the law the capacity of an investigator to go up to someone who is not necessarily suspected of having done anything wrong and demand the production of that person's telephone records and the production of that person's bank statements? And if that person does not cooperate there is no financial penalty, only jail. That is what this legislation does today. It is not an accident. The government tried to get away with this last time and, thanks to some moderation on the part of the Democrats, we were able to remove those outrageous provisions from this legislation. And this minister sneaks them back in and just calls them innocently the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 amendments, with a date of 5 August 2005. This is a disgrace and it is an indication of how this government intends to run the parliament. They intend to put in one bill, have people come along and debate that bill, slip in a set of amendments that are far more wide-reaching than the bill itself and hope that no-one will notice what is in the amendments to the bill. They intend to slip it through the House of Representatives withif the out even telling government ministers and members what is in the bill in case they might let it slip that the true force of the bill is in the amendments, so that we have no debate on the amendments. Then it goes to the Senate, where the government enjoys a majority, and it sails through. We have today compelling evidence of how this government intends to conduct itself in this parliament now that it has a majority in the Senate-by making massive amendments to legislation, amendments that are then not debated. Let us be frank. When this debate finishes, people will come in from the government side and, apart from those who are watching now on the monitor, they will not know they are voting for extreme coercive powers that deny civil liberties to people engaged in the building and construction industry. Not only will they not know, they will not care. This government is treating the Australian parliament with contempt and it is time that we understood the true colours of this government. It is supposed to be a free enterprise government. It is supposed to be a government that is for the individual and yet it has extreme coercive powers here in this legislation. Not only that; in this building and construction industry amendment bill there is reference to a code. Let us understand what the code is. It is a code of conduct. At chapter 3, section 26, it states: The Minister may issue one or more documents that together constitute a code of practice (the Building Code) that is to be complied with by persons in respect of building work. What this means is that the minister at his whim can choose which company gets a government project by deciding whether the agreement with the workers who build that project suits the minister or not. This is going to put building industry companies very much in the government's debt, because the minister can say: ‘I don't really like this company. They've said something about us that we don't like.' The minister could say: ‘We haven't received a political donation from this particular company. Isn't it time that that company made a political donation?' The minister can ensure that that particular company does not get work, because the minister can write anything he wants in the code of conduct. We now have a government that has put itself in a position where it can intimidate not only the workers in the building and construction industry but the companies themselves into doing exactly what the government wants, including providing political donations and rewriting agreements with trade unions, all at the whim of the minister. There is no accountability whatsoever to the parliament. More than a year ago, the former chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Bob Herbert, said it was very bad practice that the minister at his whim could determine which companies got government projects-and here it is enshrined in legislation. So we have not only the liberties of individuals compromised severely with this legislation but the rights of building industry companies to conduct their business in an honest and decent way. With reference to the civil liberties of workers in this industry, one of the rights that most Australians would believe they enjoy is the right not to incriminate themselves. Surely it is one of the central tenets of our legal system that, in being required to answer questions, you cannot incriminate yourself. Under the amendments to this bill, section 231 states: 231 Certain excuses not available in relation to section 230 requirements Excuses that are not available (1) A person is not excused from giving information, producing a document, or answering a question, under section 230 on the ground that to do so: (a) would contravene any other law; or (b) might tend to incriminate the person or otherwise expose the person to a penalty or other liability; or (c) would be otherwise contrary to the public interest. So the government can compel people to incriminate themselves. Where are the civil libertarians? They should be exposing what the government is doing in this legislation. Where are the civil libertarians on the government side? They walk around Australia saying that they are all for the individual and civil liberties yet they are about to pass a piece of legislation that denies workers in the building and construction industry fundamental civil liberties, irrespective of whether the particular worker is suspected of having done anything wrong or not. This means that this Building Industry Taskforce can go around identifying people in the building and construction industry who are members of a trade union and intimidate them and demand the production of their financial and telephone records, and the penalty is jail even if they are not suspected of having done anything wrong. That is what goes to the heart of this government's union-busting agenda. It wants the task force to be able to intimidate innocent people simply because they are members of a trade union. Let us understand where we are: here, on 11 August 2005, this government is going to pass legislation that has not been properly debated to achieve its goals and to deny civil liberties to people who are seeking to earn an honest living in the building and construction industry. Of course there are problems in parts of the building and construction industry. We on this side of parliament believe that collaborative solutions, tripartite solutions, are the best way. We certainly strongly oppose this denial of basic civil liberties. In the remaining minutes I have I will speak on the primary bill, which is also important in that it is retrospective in its cation and it is essentially designed to make it very difficult for unions to renegotiate certified agreements. The truth is that, certainly in Victoria, the horse appears to have bolted because a large number-hundreds, if not thousands-of agreements have been renegotiated. I put this to you: if the building and construction industry is in such shocking shape in Australia, if it is so inefficient, why have large companies agreed to renegotiate the certified agreements? The government says that they have agreed because the unions might go on strike. Gee, it is possible. I accept that it is possible that the union might, at some point, have said that they might go on strike. What does the government do? It brings in a massive bill with retrospective application. There you go-the government is pretty keen on retrospective legislation and on the denial of civil liberties to innocent people working in the building and construction industry. It has only one agenda and it is not the efficiency of the building and construction industry; it is the destruction of the trade union movement in this country. It knows that if it can destroy the trade union movement it can attack quite effectively the Australian Labor Party. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with the trade union movement of this country.",24
11,Mr KATTER,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Kennedy) (9.48 am)Some of the grave apprehensions that many of us have about the government's industrial relations program have been more than vindicated by the comments of the last speaker, the member for Rankin, Dr Emerson. I am assuming he has got them all right. There is no doubt that if those things are correct all of us should hold some grave apprehensions with respect to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. Unfortunately for the people of Australia, the govappliernment does not seem to have anyone in it that has worked in the sense of getting dirt under their fingernails or having a boss over them and having to turn up early in the morning and go home late at night, except in a suit, a shirt and a tie. In the real world in which the vast bulk of the Australian people live, there is danger in the work that they do. In the construction industry, there is intrinsic danger because you are dealing with heights of two metres or more. A good friend of mine recently lost his leg after falling off a ladder from a height of two metres. There are great dangers once you get above a single floor. Even on a house, putting a roof on becomes a dangerous occupation. The element of danger is intrinsically in this legislation. The worker must have a right to withdraw his labour where there is an issue of danger or workplace safety. You say that there is a process by which this can be gone about. There are not a limitless number of industrial inspectors. Most certainly in country areas of Australia it is very hard to find them at all. I am not criticising governments for that; it is very expensive to have industrial inspectors all over the place. But if you have a situation that is dangerous then men must be able to withdraw their labour. If they are not allowed to withdraw their labour then we have a situation which is extremely dangerous indeed. The reality of the world is that people do not like to lose their jobs. Contrary to the belief of the government, the average worker these days is terrified of losing his job. He has huge commitments to meet. According to their own figures we are in negative savings in Australia. People have massive individual debt. They are paying off their houses, which are at ridiculous prices for the average couple to pay off, they are paying off a car and oftentimes they are paying off a computer, which is hard to get along without these days. There are numerous things they will put on the charge account. They have huge debts. They are most certainly not inclined to be running out on strike every four seconds. The figures would indicate that there is a vast diminution in industrial action in Australia. We are inventing solutions for which there are no problems. If there were no strikes at all then I believe you would have a very unhealthy country. The communist countries were characterised by the fact that they never had any strikes. And some of the dangerous right-wing countries in the world were similarly characterised by a no-strikes regime. So if you have a no-strikes regime just remember you are putting yourself in a category of countries that I most certainly would not like my country put in. Yet it seems that the government is absolutely determined that there will be no strike action in this country. Just remember, when that is achieved history will pass a judgment upon the government, and it will be a very harsh judgment indeed. I want to talk about an intrinsic right and freedom. The previous speaker made issue on a person's right to silence, the foundation stones of the rule of law. It would appear that under this bill if you are not at work on a day when there is a strike or if it is alleged that you are out on account of a strike action of some description then the onus of proof shifts to you to prove why you should not be fined $20,000 or $30,000. If you do not pay the fine, the courts have the right to distrain. The courts also have the right to issue an injunction: they can direct you to go back to work. If you do not go back to work, you are in breach of the court's direction, which is a jailable offence. We have really draconian legislation being debated here. The people who are drafting these acts simply do not understand the basic premise that you are innocent until proven guilty. Habeas corpus-you cannot be taken without due process of law. The reverse onus of proof is inherent in this bill. There is another pernicious aspect of the bill, which I picked up and was amazed about. This government prides itself on trying to do the right thing-most certainly the Prime Minister does, and I applaud him for it-but the briefing notes say: The retrospective character of this Bill will ensure that unions that take unlawful industrial action prior to the nominal expiry date of these and other existing agreements in the coming months, will be subject to the sanctions and greater penalties provided by the BCII Bill. Likewise parties who are affected will be able to seek damages to recover any losses they suffer. A previous Liberal government got themselves into dreadful trouble over retrospective legislation. Everyone shudders in fear when people start talking about retrospective legislation. I have no reason to believe that the briefing paper is wrong. In fact, if anything the briefing paper is very slanted towards the government in every respect. I do not think that statement would be in the briefing paper if it was not a true description which is one of of the bill. One of the basic premises of a country that has a rule of law is that you have the law and you act in accordance with it because that is the law. But then you find that the that was is now deemed not to be the law that was, and your actions are retrospectively illegal, even though you acted in a legal manner at the time. That is another pernicious aspect of this bill. The government have gone completely overboard, unfettered by the restraints provided by the Senate for the last 25 years. We can only hope and pray that some people, such as the rather courageous Barnaby Joyce, will stand up and bring the government to their senses. If they do, then they will belong to a government that can walk with pride as not having trammelled the basic tenets of justice upon which our economy has been built. If I believe-and I do-that the employer has the right to sack, then I must also believe that the worker, in order to get a better pay deal, has the right not to turn up to work. The employer should be able to say, ‘You're not working efficiently and I want an operation that is working efficiently so that I can make more money. If you're not going to do that, I'm going to sack you.' I am referring to unfair dismissal laws. If I, as a reasonable son, have taken the position that the employer should have the right to sack then surely every dictate of logic should say that the worker should be able to say, ‘You haven't paid me enough money. I want to make a bit more money so I'm not going to turn up for work tomorrow.' What is good for the goose is surely good for the gander. But if you are going to take a partisan view such as the government is taking that the worker is wrong and the employer is right, then you are going to construct a society which is unfair. Maybe I was not watching for it before, but I have never seen on the media such a massive projection of a country that is going so marvellously well. Unemployment rates law are going to be released today. I have not done my homework on this for a couple of years but I most certainly did my homework a few years ago when Mr Costello got up and said that he had reduced unemployment by 400,000 people. It was true-the unemployment figures produced by ABS showed a reduction of 400,000. Over the same period of time the number of people on the disability pension had increased, over its normal increase, by 396,000. The Treasurer claims to be a reputable person and to have integrity, but he stood up in a public place and made that statement. In fairness to the Treasurer he seems to have gone a bit light on this lately, but he cannot have it both ways. He cannot complain about all of the unreasonable people who are on the disability pension and at the same time skite about the unemployment figures. I use that as one example. An interview by Maxine MCKew in the Bulletin magazine had a wonderful heading which said, in part, that Australia was ‘floating on an artificial boom created by property speculation financed by overseas borrowings'. That really hit the nail on the head. Its perconcluding remark was ‘overseas borrowings that have to be repaid'. We are watching the collapse of families throughout Australia because mothers and fathers have to work enormously long hours. Whilst the government says Australians are on higher incomes, if you work it out per hour they are on anything but high incomes; they are among the more low-paid. Sydney journalist Ross Gittins brought out a book comparing Australia's vital statistics with those of other countries. The book shows that Australians are being paid, per hour, much less than people in other countries. So the government can put up all these propositions in the mediawe see them continually. That brings to mind a wonderful quotewhich one of the newspapers got onto, and I must give them their due for that: ‘The economy is plateauing and we can look forward to the same prosperity we enjoy today out into the distant future. The rises and spectacular increases we have seen in the past will not take place. However, the wonderful prosperity we are now enjoying will continue.' That claim was made by a university professor in June 1929, some four or five months before the Great Depression hit America. Almost every one of the indicators that the United States government was touting in 1929 was positive. But anyone who was doing in-depth assessment of the performance of the United States economy in 1929 would have realised that the entire economy was being fuelled by ‘billows of bulldust'. In a chapter of his book The great crash 1929 entitled ‘In Goldman Sachs we trust', John Kenneth Galbraith described how Goldman Sachs had set up a company that owned another company, that owned another company, that owned another company and so on. You had to go through some 13 companies before you got to a company that actually owned any assets. That was magnificent leverage upwards in a rising stock market, but, if the stock market for one moment faltered, it was magnificent leverage downwards. If you knew that there was always a cycle, then you knew that all the elements of disaster were being built into that economy. It was a false economy built on speculation. If there is a classic description of the tralian economy in the year of our Lord 2005-and we are dealing with the building industry-it is that it is floating on property speculation fuelled by overseas borrowings that will have to be repaid. If there is great prosperity in property speculation and the building industry then the workers should be entitled to participate in it. If they are left behind, how do they catch up? Anyone on the government side of the House who says the ‘drip-down effect' will catch them simply does not know how the real world works-particularly where workers have to go through the process of individual contracts. As I have said in this place on many occasions, it is obvious that the people on the government side do not live in the real world. In the real world, if you go to your boss and start making waves and asking for better pay and conditions, he will show you the door. That is the real world. I worked in those situations for the best part of five years-not all of my life but a significant portion of it-and I can tell you it is absolutely true. The number of complaints put by employees to their bosses would be absolutely negligible. When I ask people about this they say: ‘You're not going to do that. You'll get thrown out the window. You won't have a job. How will you keep up your house payments or car payments? You'll be thrown out on the street.' People are put out on the grass in any healthy society, but this bill talks about distraining their assets! Are we going to kick doors in, throw families out on the street and take their furniture or their cars? That is what distraining their assets means. And we talk about people going on strike. That is something Australians have done since the dawn of time. I remind this House-as it should be reminded-that the reason we enjoy decent pay scales today is that our forefathers stood on picket lines. Geoffrey Blainey, the great Ausdoyen of conservatives in this parliament-I think he is a magnificent historian; I do not hesitate to say he is one of the greatest Australian historians-says in his book The Rush That Never Ended that the only way Australians can rise is through collective actionthrough a trade union. If you want any verification of that, Bob being Menzies' grandfather was the leader of the trade union movement at Ballarat around 20 years after Eureka Stockade. So the forebears of this place were the men who stood on the ramparts, who, were they here now, would be thrown in jail under the legislation that coming forward. The grandaddy of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, actually did go in those days for his trade union activities. So the people who now enjoy huge money, huge status and huge power in this country are the inheritors of a wonderful society that was created, to quote Geoffrey Blainey, by a collective action of the trade union movement. Unlike the people on the other side of the House, I was in a government which took on the unions head on. I do not resile from that; I was one of the people who made that decision. I am not saying that I went along with the party or anything like that. I made a conscious decision that the time had come to stand up because the trade union movement had taken power which was excessive and needed to be restrained. But there is no case out there now to restrain that union power in the way that it is being done here today. (Time expired)",28
12,Ms HOARE,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I join my colleagues on this side of the House in rising to speak against the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005. The main bill seeks to enact legislation that would make some forms of industrial action illegal. It would provide for additional sanctions against these actions in the form of injunctions, financial penalties and compensation. The bill before the House of Representatives is very similar to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003, which was passed by this House and then lapsed last year due to the election but not before it was rejected by a Senate committee. However, only part of the 2003 bill is being reintroduced at this moment. The remaining parts of the previous bill, including the creation of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, are to be introduced by the government at a later is date. We will continue to debate and we will continue to oppose further bills which conto jail tinue in a vein similar to this. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said that this bill is designed to send a message to employers and unions. It will increase the penalties in the Workplace Relations Act and will establish a task force to prosecute illegal activity. The message that it is sending to employers is, ‘We are giving you greater power,' and the message to unions and employees is, ‘We are stripping away your rights at work.' This bill has been brought on in part by the findings of the Cole royal commission. Although the commission believed that there were so called ‘criminal problems' in the building industry, only one criminal prosecution followed that commission. The Cole royal commission found that change was needed in some areas, and the government has pounced on this like dogs pouncing on a bone to pursue an ideological attack on the construction union. The Cole royal commission's recommendations included, among other things, the introduction of an industry specific act, the establishment of a regulatory body and improvements to occupational health and safety-a joke, which I will go into further on. In November 2002, in response to these recommendations, the Interim Building Industry Task Force, which has since had its powers extended, was set up. This task force is a forerunner of the proposed Australian Building and Construction Commission and its role is to investigate and take legal action in relation to freedom of association breaches and breaches of conditions surrounding workplace agreements. The new extended powers of the task force are set out in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt) Offences Act 2004. These new powers include new investigative powers, protection for whistleblowers, fines, and imprisonment for up to six months for failing to cooperate. Protection for whistleblowers, which as I just mentioned is one of these extended powers, is designed to pit worker against worker and to pit mate against mate, and it is a disgraceful power to give to the government and employers. These powers are extreme and they should be rejected by a democratic society which is supposed to respect human rights and workers' rights. Under present legislation, workers that are in a bargaining period can be protected from civil action, in accordance with section 170 of the Workplace Relations Act. The legislation before us strips away that protection for workers in the construction industry. This is a nasty and dangerous piece of legislation, an anti-union bill. long list of the legislation we will be debating in this place now that the government has control of the Senate and can abuse its unfettered power to push through the Prime Minister's ideology of returning to an 1800s master-servant relationship between employers and employees. The government's industrial relations proposals will radically alter the basic rights and protections that Australian workers and their families rely on. If the current proposals are implemented, job security and regular working hours will become luxuries that few will enjoy. Family and community life will suffer accordingly. Also, Australia will be even more out of step with internationally recognised core labour standards, such as the right to collective bargaining. The government's plans are not about true choice for employees; they are squarely about giving employers greater power over employees' working conditions. Further legislation which the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Prime Minister have foreshadowed will also include protection from unfair dismissal being abolished for those who work in companies with fewer than 100 staff, individual contracts which will cut take-home pay and reduce employment conditions to only five minimum standards, lower minimum wages, the award safety net being replaced with just five conditions, employees having less access to unions at their workplaces and having their capacity to bargain collectively reduced, and the gutting of the independent Industrial Relations Commission. As we heard in this place yesterday, when the Prime Minister was asked some years ago whether he would take a knife to the Industrial Relations Commission, he stated at that time that he would stab it in the stomach. The further legislation will also include the reduction or the abolition of states' rights in industrial It is the first in a relations. This legislation and further legislation, as I have outlined, has its basis in the Cole royal commission, set up by this government as the attack dog to sic the construction union in the same way that the former minister, Peter Reith, tried to take on the Maritime Union. In that case Reith failed, and in this case it will be the same. Australian workers, who are well organised and well represented, will not sit back and allow these attacks to occur. The Cole royal commission was a union witch-hunt set up by this government at a cost of $66 million. What was the result of this royal commission? One single prosecution-at $66 million the most expensive prosecution brought by a government in Australia's history. As a result of the Cole royal commission the government set up the building industry task force, adding more dogs to the pack. Let us look further at the cost of maintaining this pack of attack dogs. The government originally allocated $6.5 million to carry the building industry task force through from October 2002 to July 2003. In June 2003 a Senate committee was told during the estimates process that the 2003-04 budget for the task force was $6.9 million. In February 2004, the committee heard that the budget was $8.9 million. Assuming the latter figure is correct, the building industry task force had cost taxpayers almost $750,000 per month in the period October 2002 to June 2004. In almost 2½ years, at a cost of more than $15 million, they finalised nine court cases, six of which resulted in fines totalling $15,200. So $15 million was the cost; the fines that were imposed amounted to $15,000. The 2004-05 budget allocation for implementing the recommendations of the royal commission was $136.3 million, including $9 million to extend the life of the building industry task force to 30 June 2005 and a massive $96.1 million to set up the new Australian Building and Construction Commission to take over from the task force when the government's further legislation is passed. I am sure that all workers in this country, who are under increasing attack by the government, would be astounded and outraged to know that their taxes have been funding this ideological attack by the government on construction workers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The government should be using its current $20 million public relations campaign on industrial relations to alert Australian workers to these facts. The changes contained in this legislation will restrict the rights of building workers to gain for wages and conditions, drastically strip back building awards and place severe restrictions on unions' right of entry to work sites. These changes were included in a bill introduced by Tony Abbott in 2003 that was rejected by a Senate committee before the last election. The effect of these laws is that building workers will be second-class citizens with weaker awards, less access to unions and a reduced ability to protect their rights through industrial action. It is a further attack on safety in the construction industry, which is appalling in an industry where more than 50 workers lose their lives in any year. On the safety issues in the construction industry, the CFMEU has always been the instigator of improved work practices. I refer to a court case brought by the building industry task force. Just last month, Justice Merkel of the Federal Court dismissed a case against a CFMEU organiser, Fergal Doyle. When responding to the decision, the CFMEU Victorian State Secretary, Martin Kingham, said: This kind of secret taping and attempted entrapment has no place in Australian industrial relations. And all this happened before the Taskforce got their new powers to compel workers and union officials to be interviewed in secret with no right of silence. The organiser was on site to deal with serious concerns that the workers had over safety. The court found these concerns were real. More than 50 workers die every year in our industry, yet when this union organiser went to site to ensure that they are safe, Mr Howard's industrial police take them to court. They have their priorities wrong. He went on to say: Instead of spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on prosecuting union officials, the Taskforce should support safety in the building industry and allow unionists to get on with bartheir job-protecting wages, conditions and safety. The organiser whom the government tried to prosecute, Fergal Doyle, said: If the Taskforce thinks attending a site for a safety inspection makes me a criminal then perhaps there is something wrong with the laws of this country. I could not agree more. This is also happening in the shadow of the death of 16-year-old Joel Exner nearly two years ago. Joel was killed as a result of his boss cutting corners to maximise profits. A young worker was unnecessarily killed. I have a 15-year-old son who wants to go into a trade and I want his safety at work to be protected when he does. I want to know that, when he goes to work of a morning, he is going to come home of an evening-that is every mother's right. To try and prosecute union organisers for trying to protect the safety of our sons and daughters in workplaces is an absolute disgrace and a blight on this government's term in office. Union organisers are prosecuted by this government for trying to prevent further tragedies occurring. This government's legislation allows it to happen and ensures that it does happen. I turn now to more examples of the building industry task force being criticised by the courts in the cases they have taken against the CFMEU and individual workers or companies. In the case of Alfred v CFMEU New South Wales branch, in referring to the building industry task force Justice Hughes said: Who, for instance, alerted-whoever this group is-this sort of shadowy group. What did you call it? Sorry, the taskforce ... A shadowy group. In the case of Thorson v Pine in 2004, in relation to accessing workers' bank account details Justice Marshall said: Roving inquiries may be an apposite expression for broad ranging inquiries into alleged tax and the like under income tax legislation but notices are foreign to the workplace relations of civilised societies, as distinct from undemocratic and authoritarian states ... In the Smith Plant Hire case Justice Wilcox said: ... the applicants' casethat is, the building industry task force-aka the governmentwas beset with legal difficulties that would have required it to be dismissed in any event. Even on the view of the facts propounded by the applicants, their case was hopeless. It was instituted without reasonable cause ... In this particular case, the task force spent $287,000-over a quarter of a million dollars-in legal costs during the failed prosecution. The task force spent 12 months investigating the case and, quite rightly, was then forced to pay the union's costs. In the case of Pine v Seelite Windows, with regard to strike pay Justice Finkelstein said: The amount of wages involved is insignificant. In these circumstances it would be quite wrong to punish the respondents. Nothing would be achieved by the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. There is no need for a specific deterrent: it is simply not necessary. And if any penalty were imposed it would be so low that it could not act as a general deterrent. In relation to workers rights and human rights, Cameron Murphy, the President of the Council for Civil Liberties, said: The Building Taskforce's new coercive powers have no parallel in democratic societies. Construction workers have been deprived of fundamental civil liberties which we all take for granted. These are not radical left wing socialists in our country; these are well respected judges, well respected leaders of our community, who are making these comments against the fraud government, the Building Industry Taskforce such and the components which are going to be enacted in this legislation. I want to conclude this speech with the words of John Robertson, the Secretary of Unions NSW, when he made a presentation on Sky Channel during the mass meetings of workers which were held around New South Wales on 1 July. I attended a meeting at the Cardiff Workers Club. It was packed. It has been a long time since I have seen unionised workers and concerned citizens, pensioners, young people, people in paid work, people in unpaid work and unemployed people gathered together to protest against what they see and know will take away their rights at work for all Australians. That will continue to happen. There will continue to be protests right around the country. John Robertson, in his presentation, said: ... the government passed laws that allow a secret police force to use anti-terror style powers against building workers. So building workers will be secretly taped, they will lose the right to silence and they will face if they try to improve their families' living standards. All based on a $66 million Royal Commission that led to a single, solitary prosecution-perhaps the most expensive legal case in Australian history. This is a disgraceful, nasty and dangerous piece of legislation. It should be opposed. We will oppose it and we will continue to encourage some of the senators on the government side who agree with us to oppose it so that construction workers can continue to have their conditions and continue to enhance safety conditions in workplaces.",32
13,Mr CREAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"This bill is called the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005; nothing could be further from the truth. This does not improve activities in the building and construction industry. It is ideologically driven, and if we go into the detail of what is contained in this bill and the amendments, which have subsequently been introduced but which have not been spoken to by any member on the government side, we can get a window into the industrial relations environment that this government will bring forward when we finally get to see its new wave of industrial legislation coming before the parliament. The legislation is driven by ideology. It strips away the basic rights to collective bargaining and the right to strike. It runs against the international conventions. It reintroduces amendments that were unable to get up in the previous Senate-the coercive powers being extended to the task force that has been established in the construction industry. What it does is to make them much harsher. Initiatives that were considered by the Senate and mellowed have all been stripped away and snuck in without even being introduced as part of the original proposition. That is what jail this government is up to: underhandedness, ideology, never being upfront with the Australian electorate and always trying to run on the basis of division, fear and blame of the other side. The only way to create a sound industrial relations climate in this country-and I have been involved in it for many years-is to find the common ground. You have to have a spirit of cooperation. You have to have both sides of the equation-employers and workers and their representative bodies-working together. Go to any international body now and, with all the complexity of issues, the constant theme you get is that you have to involve the stakeholders. This legislation excludes the stakeholders, strips away their rights and strips away basic entitlements. This in part is a reintroduction of a previous bill which lapsed because the parliament went to an election last year. That broader legislation was the government's biased response to a politically inspired agenda to single out for special attention one sector in our economy, the building and construction industry, and in particular the unions involved in it. As the previous speaker, the member for Charlton, indicated, the Cole royal commission cost this country $66 million. It did find significant problems within the building industry. But, if you read the detail, you will see that it also identified that a number of these problems had emerged from collusive practices that the industry, the employers themselves, had entered into-that is, success money, failure money and little agreements on the side when contracts were missed. I agree that if there are inefficiencies in an industry a government has a responsibility to deal with them and, if that requires legislation, do it. But do not just sheet the blame home to one side, because that is the consequence of the government's response to the Cole royal commission. There was one prosecution, as the previous member indicated. We know that there are many examples of bad safety practices on the job. But where are the recommendations? Where is the legislation before the parliament? Where is the urging by the government to the states to improve workplace safety and those sorts of things? You get the flavour of it: this is a singling out, an ideologically driven approach. What the bill does is prohibit industrial action in the building and construction industry by unions seeking an enterprise agreement. This is an industry in which enterprise agreements have been entered into since the beginning of time. But this legislation prohibits industrial action in support of those agreements. It prohibits them and imposes very heavy fines, and in the case of the coercive powers that have been slipped in under the amendments it does not impose fines in certain circumstances-it is straight to jail. Where is the understanding and the common sense associated with that? It is blame, it is fear, it is division and it is bad industrial practice. This is a government that we know is intent on trying to establish AWAs, and good luck to it. If people think that AWAs serve their interests, they should be entitled to enter into individual workplace agreements. But understand that most industries in this country do not operate through individual activities. They have a flow of people. Think about it: in transport and in production there are a whole lot of individuals working in common. If you are going to negotiate fairness in the workplace, does it not make sense to ensure that that takes place as an agreement for the enterprise as a whole, not a collection of individuals? It is one thing to argue an AWA for a journalist, but it is not the same to argue one for a worker in a process line or a logistics chain or an assembly plant. It just does not make sense. Whilst the Labor Party recognises that there can be circumstances in which people might have to argue individually-we have real problems with the AWA stream, but there are common law activities et ceterawe think it is absolutely stupid to deny the opportunity to negotiate collectively. That is what this bill does: it denies collectivism and it tilts the industrial relations framework in this sector massively in the direction of the employer, giving sweeping powers to the new task force. It is part of the government's strategy to enforce AWAs. We saw them try it in relation to the waterfront when we had the dogs and the balaclavas at midnight and the special legislation passed by cabinet to enable a company to strip its work force, take away all its entitlements and employ a new one. That is what they did with the waterfront, and we saw mass demonstrations against that. This is another ideological approach, and this time it is in the building and construction industry. It singles out building and construction industry workers and their unions. It excludes them from the right to collective bargaining. This collective bargaining right is embodied in ILO convention 98, which this country has ratified. It has been ratified since 1973 and was ratified by a previous Labor government. In effect, this bill is tearing up the principles inherent in that internationally ratified convention. The legislation takes away the right to collectively bargain and the right to strike. It effectively ensures that industrial action in the building and construction industry is unlawful, and it effectively outlaws the right to strike. I see the advisers in the box smiling about this. This is true: that is what the lation does. It is a foretaste of what we can expect from the new industrial legislation. I see that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has come to the table. I welcome him into this place because I think there has to be some honest talking about the agenda that the government is pursuing. I have mentioned before this question of the AWAs and the government's fetish, its obsession, with establishing AWAs. Only two days ago there was an interesting case in South Australia dealing with the question of Australian workplace agreements. Remember, when Australian workplace agreements were introduced the Prime Minister made a fundamental promise, which was referred to in this chamber yesterday. His promise at that time was to guarantee that people would not be worse off. It was an explicit, rock solid, ironclad guarantee. That is what the Prime Minister said when he told us what would be the framework, the context, in which Australian workplace agreements would come into effect. We know he is no longer making that commitment. We have asked him time and time again; we asked him again yesterday in the parliament, but he refuses to give that undertaking. So workers know that they are going to get dudded under the new legislation. Let us just have a look at the record of what has happened to AWAs with the guarantee. This is very instructive. Two days ago a judgment came down in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia. It was Yurong Holdings Pty Ltd v Deanna Renella. Yurong happens to run the Bakers Delight franchise in South Australia and Deanna Renella is a year 10 student who was employed by the Bakers Delight franchise under an AWA. This year 10 student was someone who the Howard government would have us believe is free to enter into an AWA and will legisnot be worse off. In fact, what happened to Deanna is that she was presented with a standard issue AWA pro forma and told to sign it-effectively, ‘If you want the job, sign it.' That is negotiation John Howard style-and the government have the gall to criticise the ACTU for its advertising campaign on television that depicts that very thing. This is what happened in this case; this has been to court. She was presented with a two-page pattern Australian workplace agreement. Can you just imagine a year 10 student negotiating with the boss of the Bakers Delight franchise on her own with no support? She is supposed to, in the Prime Minister's eyes, be there negotiating as an equal. It gave her a flat rate of $8.35 an hour, which is half of the adult rate of $16.70. The AWA provided for no annual leave, no annual leave loading and no sick leave. And John Howard is saying that this person will not be worse off. She was not alone. There were more than 50 AWAs approved in the same terms as this AWA. Isn't it strange that more than 50 employees negotiating as equals with their employer all came to exactly the same position? I also find it somewhat ironic that this is a government that will not allow pattern bargaining, as it calls it, in a collective sense in the industrial framework but is condoning and encouraging pattern bargaining in an AWA sense. It will not allow pattern bargaining, it will not allow collectivism for protection, but it will allow pattern AWAs to undermine, strip away, deny and disadvantage lots of Australians in this country-and vulnerable, young Australians. That is what this case shows. I believe, and I have always believed, that it is important to have an industrial relations framework, a legislative framework, by which the government encourages the holding of the ring. But it is always going to be a rotten system where the government takes sides, where it gets in and tilts the playing field and where it weights it in favour of one of the opponents in the contest rather than trying to get consultation and agreement. But it is very interesting that, despite this terrible set of circumstances that this young girl faced, she did get justice in the court. The court ordered that Bakers Delight should pay the employee the deficiency and make up for the underpayment. They ordered something close to a $1,500 payment. I think it is very interesting to hear what a judge in our system-in the South Australian Industrial Relations Court-had to say about this practice. I ask the minister to keep this in mind when he talks so kindly about the advantage of Australian workplace agreements. This is what the judge had to say: In considering this submission I leave aside for the moment the manifest disadvantage of the respective bargaining positions of a 15-year-old Year 10 student negotiating her terms with an experienced businessman. This is the point I made before, that here is a judge who has to look at the facts and consider the circumstance that comes before him and he says it is unfair, that it is not an equal footing, because the employer is going to have it all over the individual. That is why unions formed. They formed to give a more effective countervailing balance to the circumstance. This government wants to strip away that collective support and that collective protection. The judge also accepted the employer had the right to make the acceptance of an AWA a precondition to employment. He accepts that that is the circumstance but goes on to say: Irrespective of the fact ... this is hardly a matter of real choice from the employee's point of view. So there you have it. The government has created a circumstance where it talks the talk of choice but this judge says choice does not really exist. The report goes on: But the “plain fact” ... was that the employee “was paid grossly less than she was entitled to as a minimum” under the State award. The employer's contention that the OEA had approved other AWAs in the same terms “does nothing to improve [the employer's] argument”, Judge MCCusker said. The employer also argued the employee was part-time rather than casual, but the judge found that the award defined a part-timer as having a 12hour weekly engagement, while the employee worked between 10 and 15 hours a week. This is a stark example of this brave new world that this government wants our industrial relations system to embark upon. It talks the words of choice; it talks the words of freedom and the rights and flexibility. Flexibility downwards, that is what it is, and it is also reweighting the system so that the advantage that the employer has over vulnerable employees can be exploited to the hilt. I think that that is a very chilling tale of the circumstances. The fact is that the only reason this young lady was able to get her money paid was that the employer had technically failed to lodge the AWA. That technical failing meant, according to the judge, that she was protected by the existing state law and therefore entitled to the back pay. But there are 50 other employees, and he expressed concern about the fact that, despite his being able to order restitution for this person because of the technical failing on the part of the employer, that would seem not to be redress for the other 50 who are being forced into this same insidious set of circumstances. Little wonder the Prime Minister refuses to restate his guarantee of a no disadvantage test in this parliament. He gave that guarantee back in 1996 and it is worthless. We know the word of the Prime Minister has increasingly been shown to be worthless. But we are dealing here with people's livestheir entitlements, their standard of living, their dignity and their ability to get a start in life and work their way up. What they are being taught here is that there is a society, a norm, an opportunity and a framework that enables those people to be exploited. I think increasingly, as these examples come to the fore, and particularly when we see the unveiling of the government's new industrial relations legislation, people will understand their vulnerability and the threat that they are under. That is why you are seeing masses in the streets protesting against what they understand to be the government's law. Do not let John Howard ever say he is the best friend a worker has ever had. Ask Deanna whether she thinks the Prime Minister is her best friend. That so-called best friend introduced a system that enabled her to be paid half of what she was entitled to, and he calls that no disadvantage. Now that we have not even got a no disadvantage test, expect more of the same. This bill should be opposed because it reflects the very worse of where we should be heading in an industrial relations sense. (Time expired)",36

I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. In my second reading speech on 9 March 2005 for the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005, I indicated that further amendments would be introduced. The amendments that I am moving today are being introduced to include in the bill key measures originally contained in the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003. These amendments will further enhance the government's legislative response to the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. Other elements of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 will be considered in the context of the government's broader workplace relation reforms-for example, provisions relating to right of entry and freedom of association. The amendments will, firstly, establish an Australian Building and Construction Commissioner; secondly, provide for the Federal Safety Commissioner; thirdly, improve the bargaining framework by prohibiting certain coercive and discriminatory conduct; and, fourthly, improve the compliance regime by increasing penalties and enhancing access to damages for unlawful conduct. Amendments to chapter 1 will insert the main object of the act, which is to provide an applicaimproved workplace relations framework for building work so that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and the Australian economy as a whole. The amendments will also insert additional definitions. A new chapter 2 will deliver the government's commitment to establish the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner as a regulatory body for the building and construction industry. The body is to be headed by the ABC Commissioner and will have wide-ranging powers to monitor, investigate and enforce federal workplace relations law and the building code and to refer other matters to the appropriate federal, state or territory agency. A new chapter 3 will allow the minister to issue a building code, if necessary and appropriate. Amendments to insert chapter 4 are the government's response to the royal commission's recommendations concerning occupational health and safety. The chapter establishes the Federal Safety Commissioner and provides for the establishment of an Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme to be administered by the Federal Safety Commissioner. The accreditation scheme will ensure that any person contracting with the Australian government for building work must meet certain occupational health and safety standards. Importantly, amendments to chapter 6 provide improved access to sanctions against unlawful industrial action in the form of injunctions and expand the exceptions to protected industrial action. A new chapter 8 will deliver on the recommendations of the royal commission designed to eliminate the coercion and discrimination that has plagued workplace relations in this industry. The amendments prohibit the coercion of persons in relation to the engagement of subcontractors and employees and coercion or undue pressure in relation to certified agreements choice of superannuation fund. Discrimination on the basis of the type of or parties to an industrial instrument covering a person's employees is also prohibited. The proposed amendments to chapter 12 will enhance the requirement that building industry participants comply with relevant laws, including by providing an appropriate investigatory and enforcement regime. Part 1 of this chapter sets out penalties for contravention of civil penalty provisions, orders that a court may make and who may apply for these orders. The measures in part 1 also include giving the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the Australian building construction inspectors standing to bring proceedings for contraventions of civil penalty provisions and introducing a two-tier civil penalty regime. The first tier, which deals with more serious contraventions, provides for a maximum penalty of 1,000 penalty units for a body corporate and 200 penalty units in other cases. The second tier, which deals with less serious contraventions, provides for a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units for a body corporate and 20 penalty units in other cases. By operation of section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914, the value of a penalty unit is currently $110. Part 2 sets out the compliance powers of the ABC Commissioner, ABC inspectors and federal safety officers. Amendments to chapter 13 will deal with miscellaneous matters, including the following matters identified by the royal commission: rendering project agreements not certified under the Workplace Relations Act unenforceable; making organisations responsible for the conduct of their officials, employees and members unless they take reasonable steps to prevent such conduct; the protection and dissemination to other agencies of confidential information; and empowering the or ABC Commissioner to intervene in court and commission proceedings. I am also introducing amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005. These amendments will establish the Office of the ABC Commissioner as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and provide the ABC Commissioner with access to records of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. I commend the amendments to the House. (Time expired)",41
16,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,POWERS,"Like the government's proposed industrial relations changes, these amendments are extreme, divisive and unfair. They reflect the fact that, now that the government has power in the Senate, it has all power under the sun and it is getting too close to the and it is certainly going to its head. I have two simple points. The minister did not even bother rising to his feet to respond to the second reading debate and the concerns expressed by members of the House and, secondly, in his contribution on the amendments, which go to some 30-odd pages-a substantial effective bill in its own right-he has not bothered to explain how the government has deleted safeguards inserted in previous legislation at the insistence of the bor Party and the Democrats in the Senate. So there was no effort to respond to the cerns and no effort to explain to the House why legitimate safeguards previously inserted have been removed. Because these amendments are so substantial, I will place a number of things mally on the record, effectively by way of a de facto second reading debate speech. These amendments create the Australian Building and Construction Commission, or the ABCC, and provide that body with coercive powers to gather information and prosecute people associated with the very broadly defined building industry. The role of the ABCC is currently undertaken by the Building Industry Taskforce with powers provided under the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004. Once this bill is passed, the Building Industry Taskforce will convert into the ABCC. The provisions of the codifying contempt act referring to the BIT will thus become effectively a dead letter and remove the safeguards previously inserted by the Senate. As I have indicated, Labor in conjunction with the Democrats in the Senate amended the codifying contempt act to mitigate the worse elements of the coercive powers to be provided to the Building Industry Taskforce and none of these protections have been included all in respect of the ABCC by the government. None of those amendments have been insun cluded in these amendments. This will have the effect of providing to the ABCC all the coercive powers proposed and not previously passed under the codifying contempt bill without any of the associated checks and balances. The bill and the government's amendments empower the ABCC to demand answers to such questions as: are you or have you at any time been a member of a trade union or any political party? To be subject to Lasuch questioning, a building industry employee need have done nothing wrong nor con- have been suspected of doing anything wrong. Further, the investigator can demand the production of phone records, bank account records and any other document. An employee who fails to cooperate fully will forhave committed a criminal offence and the punishment will be an automatic and mandatory prison term. Labor's amendments to the codifying contempt act had meant that there was an alternative financial penalty available to the courts rather than a mandatory prison sentence. The ABCC will have much stronger powers than any police force in the country. Labor deplore criminal behaviour, whether it is in the building industry or anywhere else, and during the last parliament Labor offered to facilitate the passage of coercive powers if they were limited to investigating suspected criminality. The government declined Labor's offers, insisting that the coercive powers must extend to noncriminal breaches of the Workplace Relations Act. In the same debate Labor supported separate amendments that would prevent anyone sentenced to jail for violence from being a union official, whether the sentence is served or suspended. Labor will not tolerate union violence or criminal behaviour, but nor do we support the denial of civil liabilities to innocent Australians working in the building industry. Let me detail some of the provisions of the codifying contempt act that have been removed by the government in the amendments presented to the House. First is the provision limiting the criteria that allowed the Building Industry Taskforce to invoke its coercive powers to investigations of criminal offences. These amendments mean that the ABCC can use coercive powers in investigating any breach of the Workplace Relations Act, award or agreement, including investigating ordinary industrial activities unions such as meetings with members. If the government claims that these new powers are needed to address alleged criminal activity in the building industry, the amended powers enabled them to do so under the codifying contempt act. Labor is committed to removing any criminality that may exist in any workplace, including in the building industry, but Labor does not believe that the task force or the ABCC is the right body to investigate such matters. Criminal matters should be investigated by the police forces. Labor is also concerned about giving the ABCC coercive powers in respect of an almost unlimited range of industrial relations matters. The second area was Labor's amendment that required the approval of a Federal Court judge for the use of coercive powers. This inserted a truly independent element to the process. Federal Court judges routinely deal with industrial relations and other matters. They are well placed to determine whether coercive powers are appropriate or necessary in any particular case. Requiring a warrant from the Federal Court also went a long way to ensuring that building workers do not have lesser civil liberties than those being questioned by ASIO about terrorism. (Extension of time granted) The involvement of the Federal Court was appropriate given the gravity and serious potential consequences of the use and potential abuse of these coercive powers. The powers to enter and inspect records proposed in the amendments are akin to a police search warrant. The government amendments do not propose to provide a safeguard of requiring a judicial officer to approve the use of these powers. Third, Labor amended the codifying contempt bill mandatory jail term by giving the court the capacity to either fine or imprison an individual who does not comply with a warrant. It is simply common sense to give of the court a capacity to impose a monetary penalty instead of a mandatory jail sentence if the court thinks that is appropriate in the circumstances. Imprisonment has the potential to make a martyr of the person who defies a warrant. In any event, it may be that in some cases a high financial penalty may be more of a burden on an individual than a short-term imprisonment, but to deprive a court of this sensible exercise of discretion is ludicrous in the extreme. Finally, Labor's amendment to the contempt bill deleted the requirement that a person provide information when this might be contrary to another law or might incriminate that person. This of course provides protection against self-incrimination, a fundamental principle of natural justice, highlighted by Mr Justice Murphy in the High Court case of Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission in 1983 where he said: The privilege against compulsory selfincrimination is part of the common law of human rights. It is based on the desire to protect personal freedom and human dignity. These social values justify the impediment the privilege presents to judicial or other investigation. It protects the innocent as well as the guilty from the indignity and invasion of privacy which occurs in compulsory self-incrimination; it is society's ceptance of the inviolability of the human personwith ality. It is also worth noting that in the Senate on the codifying contempt legislation the Democrats also successfully pursued amendments to place a limit on investigations not being ‘minor or petty'. This provision has also not been retained in these amendments, thus enabling these extreme coercive powers to be used to investigate trivial, minor or petty offences. Even had those amendments to the contempt act been contained, Labor would still be extremely concerned about giving the ABCC the coercive powers to gather information. The ABCC's predecessor, the Building Industry Taskforce, has had an entirely anti-union focus since it was established in 2002. The task force has shown little or no interest in important issues in the industry such as the non-payment of employee entitlements, sham corporate structures and occupational health and safety concerns. In the light of this highly unbalanced and ideological track record, Labor does not believe that the task force's successor, the ABCC, should receive these additional coercive powers. Labor's amendments to the codifying contempt act restricted the scope of these coercive powers to criminal offences and inserted some semblance to fair process by requiring the approval of Federal Court judges before the coercive powers could be used. As I have indicated, these protections have now been removed. As part of the amendments to the codifying contempt act, guidelines were enacted about the use of the Building Industry Taskforce's coercive powers. These guidelines are in the form of a disallowable instrument, and the amendments proposed by the government to the House in respect of the ABCC contain no comparable facilities to constrain these uses. There are some additional criticisms of acthese amendments. They provide the ABCC the unlimited right to intervene in court and Industrial Relations Commission hearings and to seek injunctions. Proposed section 253 of the amendments explicitly does not require the ABCC to make any undertakings as to damages, so the ABCC can seek an injunction and the parties suffering any loss as consequence of this injunction cannot seek damages. These are unusual and extraordinary powers. The amendments proposed reinstate the provisions from the 2003 bill that provide an exemption from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for decisions made under the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005, removing a remaining avenue for redress for action taken by the ABCC-in other words, removing the capacity for judicial review of the administrative decision making processes. Finally, the amendments provide some legislative basis for the Building Code but provide no detail. Thus, the current Building Code, which requires employees to comply else they fail to win Commonwealth construction contracts, can continue to operate without proper processes attached. It effectively provides the minister with a blank cheque to impose conditions on construction employers without requiring an appropriate level of certainty or transparency. There exists a high level of uncertainty among many employers about the compliance with the Commonwealth's Building Code and this creates uncertainty in this very important industry. It is quite clear that the lack of detail is to effectively give the minister a blank cheque and to force members of the construction industry to utilise individual contracts when they would otherwise use collective bargaining.

17,Dr EMERSON,POWERS,"Rankin) (11.13 am)This is a day of outrage in the Australian parliament, when the minister has brought in amendments to a bill which are much more wide-ranging and far-reaching than the provisions in the original bill. I have now obtained a copy of the introductory speech by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on these amendments and nowhere in the speech does it refer to the true intent of this legislation. The true intent of this legislation tion is to remove all of those constraints on the exercise of power by the Australian Building and Construction Commission that were applied as a result of negotiations between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in June 2004. Those restraints were as follows. Firstly, we had successfully included in that legislation, in the amendments in the Senate, a provision which meant that this commission would not be able to investigate minor or petty matters. These amendments remove that constraint on the commission, so it is now empowered to investigate minor and petty matters. Let us understand that. This commission and this minister want the power to investigate minor and petty matters as a result of the clear exclusion of that provision by this amending legislation in front of us. The legislation also removes any requirement for the preparation of guidelines as a disallowable instrument so that we would in fact have some limitations on the powers of the commission. In speaking on those guidelines on 24 June 2004 the minister said: The powers are similar to those which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have at the present time. Indeed, after agreement with the Democrats last night, we will model the guidelines on the ACCC guidelines that apply to the exercise of powers under section 155 of the Trade Practices Act. There are no guidelines as a result of this legislation. Why? Because the minister, the Prime Minister and this government do not want any fetters or constraints. They do not want any restraints whatsoever on the operation of the Building and Construction Industry Commission. A further restraint that we applied as a result of those negotiations that ran into the wee small hours of 24 June 2004 was that it would not be possible for people to incriminate themselves-people would have protecagainst self-incrimination. That has gone. As a result of this legislation that has not properly been debated in the parliament you can be obliged to incriminate yourself. You can be approached by an inspector from the Building and Construction Industry Commission demanding that you produce your phone records. There are no effective constraints on the powers of the commission. You can be required to respond to a question: ‘Are you or have you ever been a member of a trade union?' This is MCCarthyism. This is a witch-hunt. This is a denial of fundamental civil liberties that are available to people who may have information about terrorist activities. Those civil liberties are available to people who may have information about terrorist activities and they are now being denied through this legislation to people who work in the building and construction industry whether or not they are suspected of having done anything wrong. If I could rate these amongst the most odious provisions then surely the most odious is that there is now no financial penalty. When I spoke to the minister and we had discussions about this, I pointed out that there was no provision for a financial penalty for non-compliance with an inspector's request. The minister said, ‘That's reasonable; we will put one in.' Now that this government has unfettered power it has taken that out, so the penalty is six months jail. Something that the minister said was reasonable on 24 June in negotiations-that is, that we should put in a financial penalty-has been removed and nowhere in the minister's speech does he refer to the removal of that financial penalty. He wants people to be able to be put into jail, even if they have done nothing wrong, simply for refusing to produce records such as telephone accounts and bank accounts to an inspector. This is a fundamental breach of liberties in this country. (Time expired)",71
18,Mr CREAN,POWERS,"I rise to oppose these amendments. Let me say at the outset, before we go to the outrageous implications of these amendments that the member for Perth and the member for Rankin have referred to, that the government is treating the parliament with contempt. This was a bill that came to us, and we had some notification of a watered down version-we spoke about it earlier-but these amendments were introduced into the House only yesterday. They include far-reaching powers which have been debated in the parliament and watered down. But this government, in the arrogance of its newfound authority and power in the Senate, has ignored all of the advice, all of the compromise and all of the positive suggestions that can make this a fairer piece of legislation and has deceitfully brought the legislation back in without any notice, without any discussion and now without any explanation as to why that which was previously negotiated to be put forward now no longer goes forward. Do you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of the midnight cabinet meeting that authorised a change of legislation to the corporations power to justify what Patrick's was doing in sacking their whole work force on the waterfront. This is now the midnight slip in terms of a range of new initiatives aimed at unionists and attacking people's civil liberties. There are two fundamental problems with this batch of initiatives. The investigator can question unionists and can demand the production of information even when there is no suspicion of wrongdoing by that person. If there is refusal to comply, the penalty is fine; it is jail. Then there is the amendment to clause 231 which just strips away people's fundamental civil liberties. Listen to this: (1) A person is not excused from giving information, producing a document, or answering a question, under section 230 on the ground that to do so: … … … (a) might tend to incriminate the person or otherwise expose the person to a penalty or other liability ... That is a huge hit at a fundamental civil liberty in our society-the right to refuse to respond in circumstances when you think it might incriminate you. Where is this government going in terms of the police state, the penalties, the jailing, the fear and the intimidation? That is what this legislation represents and it is the forerunner of what we can expect in the new industrial relations code that is coming forward. This is a government not interested in openly having these debates; it is a government whose minister comes in and spends five minutes explaining these changes when there have been debates time and time again not just in this chamber but in another chamber. We know how this government is going to run things from now on. It has the numbers so it does not care. It does not care about people's civil liberties and it does not care what sorts of penalties it is giving people to impose on those that they can stalk, question and make demands of. This is creating a fear state, and that is an outrage. The minister is walking away from the table. I do not know whether he is ashamed about this; I assume, deep down, he might be. I think he did represent some civil libertarian views at some stage in his life. How could a minister such as he come before this parliament with a piece of legislation drafted in this way? Do not just think of it in terms of an attack on unions. It is that in spades. not a We have talked about that before. It is an attack, in particular, on the building and construction unions but it smacks at the very heart of every individual's civil liberties. I have not heard the minister respond to that poor girl in South Australia who was dudded under an Australian workplace agreement. This government is not accountable; it does not have to explain or defend its position. Why? Because it has the numbers. It is an outrage and these amendments should be defeated. (Time expired)",73
19,Mr RIPOLL,POWERS,"The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 truly represents one of the worse aspects of what this government is all about and what it represents. This bill is a fundamental attack on workers and on people's civil liberties, their rights and their pacity to carry out their lives and their work as required. In no sense can anyone look at this and say that it is fair, just or necessary achieving anything that the government wants to achieve in relation to the building and construction industries. If the government and the minister were actually committed to cleaning up any criminal activity within that industry or anywhere else, then that should be supported. The Labor Party does not support criminal activity and believes that there are mechanisms and ways that we can work to make sure that those matters of criminality are not an issue. But that is not what this bill is about. This bill is a fundamental attack on unions and workers. You only need to go to parts of the bill-and particularly to some of the amendments that Labor is moving and what we have done to codify contempt-to understand how pernicious and bad this bill is. As an example, you can look at the powers that are needed by the commission to address criminal activity. There is no way in the world that it warrants the investigator having the power only to hand out jail sentencesrather than leaving it up to a judge to decide whether the more appropriate penalty would be a fine or jail time. It would be more appropriate for that decision to be made by a court or a judge, not the federal government. I believe imprisonment is not the solution to some of the problems that exist in the industry, and does not help the government in what it is trying to achieve in this legislation. There is no doubt that if you go through parts of the bill you will see that it is about giving unfettered power to a body controlled by the government. The bill is about the government using the sort of power it has now in the Senate and in the House. It is about the government losing sight of the key issues in terms of workers' rights and the rights and civil liberties of ordinary people. This bill is ca- all about fear and intimidation. You will hear the minister talking about fear and intimidation in the industry. I see the minister shakin ing his head but he is doing exactly the thing that he is trying to prevent. He is putting in place a regime of intimidation and fear which will force people to do things which are not, in the normal course, regarded as fair or as providing natural justice. People should be given opportunities to defend themselves, to seek legal representation and not be treated as a criminal by the commission or the investigator, which is what the government is trying to do. This is just another step in the government's agenda to attack workers' rights. The bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt by this government and the minister to continue with their program of breaking the backs of unions. The bill will certainly not do that. All this will do is create an environment of fear and intimidation. It will turn those workplaces which the government are supposedly trying to make more cooperative and productive workplaces into less productive and cooperative workplaces. As the member for Hotham mentioned earlier, this follows on from those days when the former Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, made his shameless attack on the wharfies and harbour workers, as the government was doing at that time. It is necessary for Labor and the minor parties in the Senate to take the edge off some of the worse aspects of the government's legislation. We need to make sure that the courts have the power to decide whether there should be fines or imprisonment. We need to make sure that this government does not create a regime of fear and intimidation by trying to make people provide information, which is contrary to other laws. It is a basic right for people not to be forced to give that information, particularly if they have been accused of anything and have not done anything wrong. We are seeing the government abusing its power. It is drunk with power in both houses. (Time expired)",74
20,Dr EMERSON,POWERS,"Rankin) (11.28 am)This consideration in detail stage is meant to be an opportunity for members of parliament to question the minister. If this is to be a genuine opportunity, I want Minister Andrews to listen to what I am saying. I am going to ask him four questions and I would expect that he would have the capacity and the willingness to give four answers to those questions. The first question is: Minister, why did you remove from the legislation the provision for financial penalties for non-compliance with an inspector's request to produce documents, such that now the only penalty available to a court is six months jail? Why did you remove that provision when we discussed the reasonableness of having a financial penalty? My second question is: Minister, why did you remove the provision that prevented the Australian Building and Construction Commission from investigating minor or petty matters? To me, the answer would seem to be that you want the commission to be able to investigate minor and petty matters as part of the intimidation of people whom you suspect of being members of trade unions, so that you can sic Building and Construction Commission investigators onto people simply because they are members of the trade union movement. The third question is: Minister, having agreed with the Democrats and Labor to the application of the guidelines as a disallowable instrument to provide limitations on the investigative powers and conduct of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, why did you remove those guidelines in this legislation? The fourth question is: why not did you remove from the legislation the protection against self-incrimination such that this legislation now means a person can be required to incriminate themselves, as expressed in section 231? Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay, I earnestly seek your assistance in ensuring that the minister answers these questions. If the minister is unprepared and unwilling to answer these four basic questions he is surely treating this parliament and the Australian people with contempt-and the irony is that we have been debating amendments to a bill that codifies contempt. This legislation is an outrage. The minister has snuck into the parliament amendments that are far-reaching and deny civil liberties to ordinary people simply on the basis that they may be members of the trade union movement. Let us understand the full gravity of what is going on here today. The minister does not want to be accountable to the Australian people and the Australian parliament. It is incumbent upon him to answer these four specific questions. Why did you remove the financial penalties? Why did you remove the provision preventing the investigation of minor or petty offences? Why did you remove the guidelines that were a disallowable instrument to constrain the operations of the commission? Why did he insert in the bill a power to require people to incriminate themselves?",75
21,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,POWERS,"I am waiting patiently for the minister to get to his feet and respond to the various questions asked of him by the member for Rankin. I hope that at some stage he does, but, if he does not, it would not surprise me. These amendments reflect how extreme, divisive and unfair the government is proposing to be now that it has all power under the sun. Having gained all power under the sun, what does the minister do? The 34 pages of amendments effectively came in yesterday. They remove the safeguard provisions inserted by the Senate to previous comparable legislation. In the course of the minister's contribution today he could not even be bothered getting to his feet to respond to concerns raised by members during the second reading debate on the bill itself duced. When he presented in five minutes the government's reasons for the introduction of these amendments, he gave no explanation, no rationale and no justification for removal of the significant safeguards inserted by the Senate on a previous occasion. It is quite clear that the government, now having all power under the sun, wants the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner also to have all power under the sun, without limitation. We see the government investing unlimited coercive power in the commissioner. We see the requirement for Federal Court approval of subpoenas removed. We see the capacity for judicial review of administrative action by the commissioner removed. We see mandatory jail sentences imposed on the judiciary. We see the long standing principle of selfincrimination removed. And for all of these things we see the removal of the provision previously inserted that these matters should not relate to minor or trivial offences. Having gained all power under the sun, the government gets the Senate out of the way and now wants to get some basic fundamentals out of the way and give the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner all power under the sun. The government has done all this by way of amendment and with no justification for the extreme approach it has decided to take. It has given no rationale for walking away from the safeguards previously inserted by the Senate. As has been said by my colleagues the member for Rankin, the member for Oxley and the member for Hotham, this is a portent of what is to come now that the government has complete control of the parliament. Drunk with arrogance and power, the government is removing sensible and basic safeguards in its ideological zealotry and pursuit of anything it regards as associated with a trade union or as introthe trade union movement.",76
22,Mr ANDREWS,POWERS,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the the Public Service) (11.35 am)-Listening to the members opposite, you would think this was the first time these matters had ever been raised or debated. The reality is that these are matters which the government has been pursuing since 2003. They were set out extensively in a bill brought to the parliament in 2003. They were extensively debated not only in this place but also in the Senate. They were the subject of a Senate inquiry which was taken around the country for some nine or 10 months, by Labor members in particular, at which all of this detail was looked at. The government has never resiled from its view that the propositions put in the 2003 bill were necessary to clean up what is quite clearly a unique industry in terms of illegal and improper activities and, indeed, criminal activity. I remind honourable members that this legislation arises from the extensive findings of the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, in which Justice Cole found that there was a widespread culture of thuggery, intimidation and criminal activity. In his report, Justice Cole said: At the heart of the findings is lawlessness. exhibited in many ways. There are breaches of the criminal law. There are breaches of laws of general application to all Australians where the sanction is a penalty rather than possible imprisonment. There are breaches of many provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. He also said: These findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular. They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform. That is what this government has been pursuing. This industry stands out in terms of the unlawful, corrupt and criminal activities which occur in it. On top of that, this industry has the worse record of industrial disputation in the entire country. It has the worse record in terms of occupational safety and health in this country. It is unique. The Labor Party come in here and say, ‘We don't want criminal activity in the building and construction industry. We don't want the sort of thuggery that occurs there,' but when it comes to actually doing something about cleaning it up they run a mile away from it. They conduct a Senate inquiry that drags on for month after month, rather than being prepared to stand up and do something in relation to this industry. The answer to the questions of the honourable members opposite is quite simply that these are things which the government have been pursuing since 2003. We have not resiled from pursuing these matters and we will press to put in place legislation which will deal with the criminal activities in this particular industry. The report of the building industry task force which was tabled in this parliament last year clearly set out some of the activities that occur in this industry. In 2005 the task force received reports including union demands for $110 payments per It is employee from contractors for people who were not union members, pressure being applied to contractors with threats that work would stop because of alleged unsatisfactory amenities and pressure being applied to contractors to sign union agreements with threats that failure to sign would force the union to revoke concessions of being able to work on the lock-down weekend or the rostered day off. There are records after records of unlawful and criminal activities carried on in this industry. I say to the honourable members opposite who make the charge that this is something against unions: these provisions apply to all people; they apply to builders, to construction officials and to unions alike. This is not singling out unions. It is just doing what everybody knows is overdue and needs to be done: to clean up once and for all an industry which has been characterised by criminal activity for far too long. The Labor Party accept that this activity occurs but they have not got the guts to do something about it. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Andrews's) be agreed to. The House divided.

26,Mr FITZGIBBON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The government will be pleased to know that Labor will be supporting the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005, although I am not sure how much it will matter to them, because I suspect none of their members understand it. I have just spent some time trying to get my head across it. It is not my bill-it is Senator Ludwig's-and I am acting on his behalf in this place. It is a rather complex bill, and I suspect that the minister who will be winding up is struggling to understand the implications of these changes as well. Indeed, I challenge him to, without notes, explain the proposition to me. The bill contains a number of essentially housekeeping changes to customs and excise regimes and one significant reduction in tariff protection. In item 1 the bill amends tional note 3(a) to chapter 22 of the tariff to insert 22 per cent as the upper limit of alcohol content in grape wine. The financial impact of the proposed amendment to additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 is difficult to quantify, but it is expected that it may result in a small increase in government revenuein other words, it is yet another increase in tax. The A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act specifies that wine subject to WET is not subject to an excise, but high alcohol wine with more than 22 per cent of ethyl alcohol does not fall within this provision and therefore is subject to an excise. But the rate of excise differs from the current customs duty on high alcohol imported wine. The bill corrects this anomaly and ensures imported wine of fresh grapes will attract customs duty at the same rate as the locally produced product. This is a rather belated clean-up of a significant anomaly. Given that the wine equalisation tax bill was considered in 1999 and came in in 2000, the minister needs to explain why it is that it took four years to address the suggested anomaly. The bill also defines grape wine products. Items 2 and 3 relate to the definition of mock Irish Cream and wine based cream beverages. While the financial impact of these measures relating to the insertion of references to the additional note 4 into tariff subheadings is negligible, it is important to ify a point in the Attorney-General's speech, because readers seeking to understand the effect of this bill through that speech or who go to the explanatory memorandum could find themselves in some confusion as to the treatment of products collectively known as ‘Irish Cream'. Real Irish Cream is made from whisky and there is a higher alcohol contentaround 16 per cent or 17 per cent. Baileys addi- Irish Cream and Feeneys Irish Cream are examples of such products. The imported spirit based Irish Cream is subject to the excise equivalent of $60.92 per litre of alcohol, plus a five per cent customs duty. No wonder it is out of reach of modest income earners. Similar locally manufactured product was subject to the excise rate of $60.92 per litre of alcohol. These whisky based products are not affected by the changes. Mr Hardgrave interjecting",82
27,Mr FITZGIBBON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The product referred to by the minister is an imitation product with a substitute grape wine base and has an alcohol content of between 11 per cent and 12 per cent. O'Maras Irish Cream is an example of such a product. Imported wine based Irish Cream was subject to the excise regime and paid the excise equivalent rate of $60.92 per litre of alcohol, plus five per cent customs duties. Similar locally manufactured product attracted the wine equalisation tax, plus the GST. Post July 2005 wine based product is now subject to the wine equalisation tax at a rate of 29 per cent of the value of the taxable importation that is based on customs value, plus customs duty in this instance, which is free, plus international transport insurance, plus GST. That basically means we are aligning the wine equalisation tax legislation with the legislation that gives effect to the customs duty. That misalignment is causing different clartreatment for the domestic product from that which is applied to the imported product. In other words, we are whacking up the custhose toms tariff in some circumstances on some imported product. Again, I invite the minister, in summary-and other members-to clarify that and attempt to give his own expression to that effect and to point out to me if I am wrong in any regard. What this does highlight is the mess this government has found itself in with respect to both the implementation of the GST and the administration of wine tax in this country. When the GST was introduced, the government proposed that it was not, if you like, socially responsible for tax on wine to fall significantly-I think it was in the high 30s, prior to the introduction of the GST, right down to 10 per cent-so the government proposed a wine equalisation tax which was intended to hold it at the current level of taxation. The government promised, of course, that that application of the wine equalisation tax would be revenue neutral, but there was a sleight of hand because, at 29 per cent and with the compounding effect of the GST, the total application of tax on wine increased. From memory, the projection on additional revenue was in the order of $180 million annually, and the wine industry was not happy about that proposition. It lobbied to have the wine equalisation tax reduced to 24 per cent, a figure which, it argued on its economic modelling, would produce a revenue neutral effect to government. Labor took a different view. We decided that this was an opportunity to boost wine tourism in regional areas. In this place I moved an amendment which would have given effect to a wine equalisation tax rebate for cellar door sales in regional areas, giving them a significant competitive advantage at a time when they are struggling to meet the market power of the major supermarket chains now involved in liquor sales, who are able to sell wines at a much cheaper rate than wine producers can at the cellar door. This would have been a significant competitive advantage for regional cellar door sales and, therefore, a significant boost to regional velopment, tourism and employment. It is history now that the Treasurer, who I am pleased to see is with us today, rejected Labor's very sensible amendment. But under community pressure, and pressure from the Wine Federation of Australia in particular, the government introduced in the Senate its own version of Labor's initiative. However, rather than go for a rebate at the cellar door, the government decided to institute a highly complex rebate which involved the participation of the states and which added a significant compliance cost burden.  a point of order. The member is not speaking to the bill. This bill does not canvass the wine equalisation tax.",83
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The member for Hunter will confine his remarks to the bill.,84
29,Mr FITZGIBBON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for its mal-administration of Australia's wine tax system.” As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, the government proposed not to embrace Labor's rebate and instead introduced a highly complex rebate for cellar door operators, leading to significant additional compliance costs. Alas, it passed through the Senate and was approved on the numbers in this place. That is the system that the industry has been living with since the introduction of the GST in 2000. Under more recent pressure from the industry, the government decided to extend its rebate to all sales of wine, not just cellar door sales in regional areas, up to the first one million litres. I acknowledge that this did de- take a number of players out of the wine equalisation tax system, but again it has created all sorts of anomalies. We saw one of those yesterday in this place when we had to extend the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand producers of wine. In other words, in future the Australian Taxation Office will be sending cheques to producers of New Zealand wine as a rebate for the wine equalisation tax paid. So instead of fixing the problem by reconsidering the rate of the WET, which would have been the sensible thing to do, and going to a rebate giving effect to a reduction in the WET, the government put in place a botched system that has created other problems and resulted in this extraordinary circumstance in which we will be sending tax cheques to producers of New Zealand wine. I made the point yesterday that it raises the question of whether this will have knockon implications for our other trading partners. I know that the CER is a somewhat different document from the USFTA, for example-and any FTA we might sign with the government of the Peoples Republic of China-in that the US document tends to be prescriptive but the CER tends to be open slather on all goods. So there is a difference. But this must surely put Australia under pressure when negotiating future FTAs to extend the same treatment under the WET rebate to other trading partners. This is the situation you can find yourself in when you botch the tax system in the first place. The government's treatment of the wine industry under the GST banner has been nothing short of hopeless, and again today we are seeing the consequences, with anomalies being driven out of the system some five years after the introduction of the GST. Yet the government on a regular basis still likes to tell us what a wonderful tax it and how it has been great for small businesses-small businesses that are now 40 per cent more likely to be indebted to the tax office as a result of the GST. Among those small businesses will of course be many small wine producers who run cellar door outlets. Items 4 and 6 of the bill make significant changes to the tariff concessions system. Tariff concessions provide concessional rates for imported goods when there are no substitutable domestically produced goods available. Goods that are known as business inputs, and which are subject to a tariff concession order, currently attract a general duty of three per cent. This is basically a specified form of tariff protection for Australian industries that produce inputs or finished products where there are no domestic industries or substitutes for internationally produced products. This tariff works like other tariffs hampering the efficiency of Australian industry. The greatest benefits of tariff reform accrue to those who liberalise their own regimes. Consequently, this tariff will improve our efficiency and eliminate business input costs. It is estimated that the amendments related to the removal of the three per cent customs duty that applies to goods which are subject to a TCR will result in forgone duty of some $200 million in 2005-06, $320 million in 2007-08 and some $340 million in 2008-09. Labor supports this measure. As a trading nation, ongoing trade liberalisation is important to our local economy, and this will add to the efficiency of the local economy and of course to our international competitiveness in an increasingly competitive world. But the government will need to do much more than this. In the Australian economy at the moment, many things need to be done to improve our productivity and international competitiveness. The most obvious problem, of course, is is the skills crisis in this country. The skills crisis has been identified by the OECD, the Reserve Bank and just about every economic think tank in Australia and overseas, but the government is in denial in this issue. It continues to refuse to concede that there is a problem. I want to give the government an example of how extensive this problem is. Muswellbrook Shire Council in my electorate has done a very good thing. It has taken the time and invested the money to do a survey of the shire's skills shortage. I want to share with the House some of the results. In Muswellbrook, we are short of 49 boilermakers, 11 electricians, 17 fitters and turners, seven motor mechanics, five miners, one mining engineer, four motor vehicle parts and accessories fitters and five plumbers. This is in one relatively small community in my electorate. Of course, these significant skills shortages are affecting the capacity of that local economy to grow and therefore hampering the local economy's ability to improve living standards for local people. So we support this measure, but I send a very clear message to the government that much more needs to be done. The government has been resting for almost 10 years on the very good structural changes Labor made when last in office. The reform process has come to a halt; it has stalled and it is about time kick-started it again.",84
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Laurie Ferguson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.  rise in support of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005. This bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that have previously been introduced into the parliament as customs tariff proposals. The bill proposes to amend additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by inserting a 22 per cent upper limit on alcohol content in respect of grape wine as defined by the note. This note was inserted into the Customs Tariff Act 1995 on 1 July 2000. Under the Excise Tariff Act 1921, wine, as defined in subdivision 31-A of the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999, is not excisable. Any locally manufactured wine that does not fall into that definition is excisable. Currently, additional note 3(a) states no upper limit and describes grape wine as a beverage that has an alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1.15 per cent-other than clause 2208.20, which relates to spirits obtained by distilling grape wine or grape marc. In July 2000, regulation 31-2.01 was inserted into the WET regulations so that wine for the purposes of subdivision 31-A of the WET act must contain less than 22 per cent by volume of ethyl alcohol. Hence, wine with more than 22 per cent by volume of ethyl alcohol that is manufactured in Australia is excisable. However, due to the note in the Customs Tariff Act 1995, imported wine with more than 22 per cent by volume of ethyl alcohol is not subject to the same rate of customs duty as the excise rate for locally manufactured wine. This amendment will we ensure that imported wine of fresh grapes that does not comply with the revised additional note will attract customs duty at the same rate as excise duty on similar, locally manufactured product. The alteration relating to additional note 3 to chapter 22 was included in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2005), to take effect on 1 July 2005. The customs tariff proposal mechanism is used for effecting alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, particularly when such alterations are required to take effect in a short time frame that cannot be achieved through a customs tariff amendment bill. Customs tariff proposals are used most commonly for introducing new items, for changing rates of duty and for restructuring items in the schedules to the tariff. The financial implication of the proposed amendment to additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 is difficult to quantify, but it is expected that it may result in a small increase in government revenue. Items 2 and 3 of the bill propose to insert references to additional note 4 to chapter 22 in the Customs Tariff Act 1995, subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.4. This additional note 4 defines grape wine product, which includes certain wine based cream beverages generically described as Irish cream. When imported into Australia, these goods are subject to excise equivalent rates of customs duty, while similar goods manufactured in Australia are subject to the wine equalisation tax. The new references to additional note 4 in the above tariff subheadings will correct this anomaly and allow Irish cream to be classified in either subheading. This will mean that these products will be subject to the WET and applicable rates of customs duty. The alterations relating to additional note 4 to chapter 22 were included in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2005) and came into effect on 1 July 2005. The financial impact of the measures relating to the insertion of the references to additional note subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.4 is negligible. Items 4 to 7 of the bill propose to remove the three per cent customs duty that applies to business inputs that are subject to a tariff concession order. A tariff concession order provides concessional tariff rates for imported goods where there are no substitutes available from domestically produced goods. Goods which are known as business inputs and which are subject to a tariff concession order attract a general rate of customs duty of three per cent. The government's removal of the tariff on business inputs provides free entry of all goods imported under a concession order. One exception to this is goods classified under heading 3819.00.00, which include hydraulic brake fluids and other prepared liquids for hydraulic transmission or oils obtained from bituminous minerals. It is estimated that the amendment relating to the removal of the three per cent customs duty that applies to goods the subject of a tariff concession order will result in forgone duty of some $290 million in 2005-06, $320 million in 2007-08 and $340 million in 200809. The removal of the three per cent tariff to a customs duty rate of free will reduce business input costs, increase the international competitiveness of Australian business and encourage investment in efficient and sustainable industries. Item 19 in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 applies to goods subject to a tariff concession order that are repaired overseas. Item 7 reduces the rate of customs duty on the cost of materials, labour and other charges involved in the repair from three per cent to free. Item 4 repeals and substitutes item 50 in schedule 4 to the tariff. Item 50 provides concessional rates of duty for goods that are subject to the tariff concession order 4 into tariff and are business inputs. New item 50(1) reduces the rate of duty for goods subject to a tariff concession order from three per cent to free, except those goods classified in heading 3819.00.00 of schedule 3 to the tariff, as previously mentioned. New item 50(2) applies to those goods under the heading of 3819.00.00, subject to a tariff concession order and that are exempt from the product stewardship oil levy. Paragraph 50(2)(a) reduces the rate of duty from three per cent to free for these goods. Paragraph 50(2)(b) applies to goods of heading 3819.00.00 covered by the tariff dutyconcession order that have not been extariff empted from the product stewardship oil levy. Paragraph 50(2)(b) removes the three per cent customs duty but will retain the waste oil levy of 5.449c per litre. Item 6 is necessary to repeal item 50A. Item 50A applies to goods subject to the tariff concession order that are defined as consumption goods in the United Nations statistical papers. The rate of duty for these goods is currently free. As item 5 reduces the duty rate to free for all goods subject to the tariff concession order except those goods classified to heading 3819.00.00, consumption goods will now be covered by item 50. Item 50A is therefore no longer necessary and is being repealed by item 6. Item 7 is a transitional item to ensure that any tariff concession order that was in effect before the amendments to item 50 contained in this bill continues to have effect after those amendments come into effect. Naturally, I support the amendments proposed in this bill to reduce business input costs, increase the international competitiveness of Australian business and encourage investment in efficient and sustainable industries. I commend the bill to the House.",86
31,Mr RUDD,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005 is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 with respect to grape wine products and also to remove the three per cent customs duty that applies to business inputs that are subject to a tariff concessional order. It is the latter in particular-that is, removal of the customs duty applying to business inputs-that is of specific relevance to the current economic and trade debate, a debate that centres on the decline in Australia's level of productivity and therefore international competitiveness under the current government. A key factor in determining the competitiveness of Australian industry is the cost of production across the board, including capital equipment, input materials and other factors which may be produced domestically or imported and overheads such as the cost of running plants and machinery and, of course, work force costs. One of the major reasons Labor opened up the economy through significant cuts to tariffs in 1973, 1988 and 1991 was to expose Australian industry to international competition. Most importantly, those tariff cuts allowed industry to benefit from cheaper inputs, including those that may not have been produced in Australia. Cheaper input costs in turn enhance the price competitiveness of our final products, benefiting Australian consumers, who could buy cheaper goods. Of course, cheaper costs of production meant that there was also an immediate pay-off of dramatic increases in the growth rate of manufactured exports from Australia to the rest of the world, including elaborately and simply transformed manufactures. With this in mind, and given our record, we the opposition support this amendment. The removal of the three per cent customs duty is a change in the right direction and, we argue, will assist in enhancing the price competitiveness of Australian industry. However, it is also our view that the government should be doing more-in fact, much, much more-to arrest the decline in Australia's international competitiveness and to restore it to earlier levels achieved. It is a the well-known fact that in recent years Australia's export performance under the current government has been less than positive. Indeed, it is the worse trade performance we have experienced since the end of the Second World War. Notwithstanding this trade performance as demonstrated on the facts, the Minister for Trade would like us to believe otherwise. In fact, in question time in this place earlier this week the Minister for Trade used a dorothy dixer to make a number of quite extraordinary claims. When asked in the dorothy to outline Australia's export performance over the past 12 months, the trade minister sought to claim a new export record, suggesting that last year there were ‘$162.3 billion worth of exports going out of Australia'. For the sake of ensuring that there is an accurate record on this question, and one that relates to the overall status of Australia's trade performance, let us put some additional facts to the Australian people as well. While Australia did export $162.3 billion worth of goods and services last year, we also imported a record level of goods and services: $187.8 billion worth of imports. That record level of imports has ensured that Australia has now recorded its 44th monthly trade deficit in a row-the longest run of consecutive monthly trade deficits by any Australian government. Australia has recorded significant annual trade deficits for seven of the past eight years, including our largest ever trade deficit last financial year of $25.5 billion. For the last two years, we have recorded trade deficits of more than $20 billion for the first ever. These massive trade deficits have contributed to our record current account deficits, including our largest ever current account deficit of $54 billion last year. In tion, we have a record level of foreign debt-$425 billion at last count and climbing every day. For the last four years, export volumes have been flat right across the board-commodities, agriculture, manufactures and services. Net exports have now made a negative contribution to economic growth for four years in a row-another concerning record. At a time of strong global economic growth, our exports should be contributing to our economic performance, but over the past four years they have actually detracted from it. As Access Economics said recently, the best global growth in a generation is passing us by. It is passing us by so much that Australia's share of world exports is now at a historically low level, falling each year under the current government from a peak of 1.18 per cent of global exports in 1996 to just 0.99 per cent today. The current government's trade performance stands in some considerable contrast to that of the previous government. Annual export growth under the Howard government of 5.3 per cent is less than a half that achieved under the previous Labor government of 10.8 per cent. The performance of all manufactured exports is even worse-13.7 per cent annual average growth under Labor compared with 3.7 per cent under the Howard government. If exports had continued to grow at the rate achieved by Labor, Australia would have recorded a trade surplus last year of $20.5 billion rather than a deficit of $25.5 billion. That is in the order of a $45.5 billion turnaround. That, indeed, is a lost opportunity for Australia-lost exports, lost income and lost jobs. When given the opportunity in question time this week to give a full and frank astime sessment, rather than just a rhetorical assessment, of the true state of Australia's trade performance the minister sought to claim some sort of record. The figures I have just addioutlined show the picture-and it is a record but a sorry record indeed. Unfortunately, the minister has been in a state of denial on this question. This is a minister under pressure, given all the indications that he is having difficulty in his new job as Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party. If his denial of Australia's woeful trade performance is not enough, the minister was also humiliated by the PM this week over the question of industrial relations reform. In question time, the minister was asked whether he stood by his comments at the recent Queensland National Party state conference: We will protect as minimum conditions of employment: four weeks annual leave; personal and carers leave; parental leave including maternity leave; maximum ordinary working hours of 38 hours per week; public holidays; meal breaks; and smokos. They are pretty fundamental conditions, I would have thought. The minister's answer to that question in this parliament was simply yes, that he stood by that guarantee; he stood by those comments made to the July conference of the National Party. But there is a problem here. On his first day in parliament as the new Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, the minister was way out of line. He did not know that his government's own policy on industrial relations was in fact inconsistent with this and he was slapped down by the Prime Minister here in this chamber. Humiliated in his first question time by the Prime Minister, he has refused to give a guarantee about smokos, public holidays and meal breaks. Not only does the minister fail to comprehend the extreme nature of the government's industrial relations reforms, his party is all over the shop on Telstra. He has the new Queensland senator Barnaby Joyce demanding a slush fund more than twice as big as the minister's preferred slush fund. If The Nationals vote to sell Telstra, their future in Queensland will be",88
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! The member for Griffith is required to address the bill.,90
33,Mr RUDD,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I will be returning to that presently, Mr Deputy Speaker.",90
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Now.,90
35,Mr RUDD,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"All these factors draw our attention back to the manner in which the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party and Minister for Trade has been discharging his portfolio responsibilities across the board-not just in the trade portfolio but also more broadly. Under pressure on the export front, we have had a trade minister who has delivered our worse trade performance ever. On the other fronts, for which he has also suffered some pressure and criticism, we would argue that he is not performing up to scratch as well. When it comes to Australia's international competitiveness, we think the key questions which must be asked are as follows: why has Australia's trade performance been so woeful after nine long years of this government; why have exports continually failed to contribute to economic growth; and why has export growth failed to keep up with the rate of import growth into Australia? These are key questions we must address and key questions we must answer if we are to restore Australia's position as a strong trading nation, if we are to rebalance economic growth away from debt driven domestic consumption and government expenditure to a more sustainable growth pattern with a strong contribution from exports. The government, of course, has put forward every excuse under the sun concerning Australia's failure to keep up with import growth. One is that there have been adverse climatic conditions, but when it comes to the drought it is difficult to argue how that affects directly our performance on services exports and manufactured exports. Another excuse put forward by the government is that the dollar was too high. But exports were already underperforming well before it hit its long-time average of 70c to the US dollar in October 2003. Another excuse provided by the government is the impact of the East Asian economic crisis. While there was definitely some impact, particularly in our trade with Korea and Indonesia, overall exports during this period held up not too badly, no doubt reflecting the significant fall in our own dollar at that time. A further reason which is advanced for Australia's relatively poor performance on the trade account is the impact of SARS and terrorism. While they may have impacted on services exports, surely they do not explain why manufactured exports or commodities have been flat. So all the excuses under the sun have been put forward, but they do not provide an adequate explanation as to why in fact we have had such a poor trade performance; nor do they provide an insight into how you get Australia onto a more sustainable and balanced growth path. The answers to these questions, I think, are reasonably straightforward. We must overcome what Professor Garnaut has described as the ‘great complacency' of the 21st century-the great complacency of the government, one which has dropped the ball on economic reform, on improving productivity and on enhancing Australia's international competitiveness. Over the past year productivity growth in Australia has declined by 0.6 per cent, calculated in terms of GDP per hour worked. We are now experiencing our worse productivity growth in 19 years. According to the OECD, productivity measures consistently show that output per person in Australia is well below that in other OECD countries, including the US and even the EU. It is for those reasons that Australia's exports have been so woeful and it is this combination of factors that is threatening Australia's future growth and prosperity. We understand, as a responsible opposition, that productivity growth drives exports and exports create new, higher paid and higher skilled jobs. That is why the previous Labor government took on the productivity challenge in 1983 and opened up the economy. As I have stated previously, the economy was in deep recession in 1983 following a period of sustained policy complacency compounded by a combination of rising inflation, international recession, high domestic and overseas interest rates and drought. The response of Labor at the time to this great challenge facing the future of our economy was to reform the economyclearing the blockages, removing the inefficiencies and attracting the capital to rebuild and modernise our industries. Those reforms were not easy by any means but they were necessary to create a new, dynamic and flexible economy capable of absorbing internal and external shocks and contributing to what is now the 15th consecutive year of economic expansion. Those reforms included: floating the Australian dollar; deregulating interest rates; cutting tariffs; transforming Australia from a highly protected, inwardly focused economy to an internationally competitive economy; major tax reform, cutting the very high marginal tax rates and corporate taxes we inherited from Treasurer Howard; the deregulation of the financial services, communications and aviation industries; the introduction of competition policy in 1995 and an industrial relations reform that contributed so much to productivity growth in Australia. These were no small matters. Each reform contributed to the overall policy framework. Their implementation required the expenditure of considerable political capital, political capital the Hawke and Keating governments were prepared to spend, in the long-term interests of our economy, to enhance our international competitiveness and prosperity. In contrast, the Howard government has failed to build on the economic reform legacy that it inherited from its predecessor. Reform fatigue has reached such a point that the Reserve Bank is now warning us that we need to get used to growth rates of two per cent plus instead of three per cent plus. Labour productivity growth has actually been negative over the last year. Inflationary pressures are emerging because of skill shortages, infrastructure bottlenecks and other capacity constraints. It is not only the Labor opposition that is concerned about declining levels of productivity and the great complacency that has come over our country on the reform front. The OECD has said productivity measures consistently show that output per person hour in Australia is well below that in leading countries. The IMF has warned that in Australia supply side constraints, especially on exports, have also contributed to slowing growth. The ACCC has said that the benefits from productivity gains over the last decade may be in danger of being exhausted. The Reserve Bank of Australia has warned on at least 11 occasions since 2001 that capacity constraints are having a negative impact on our economy, noting in particular that capacity constraints on production growth continue to be reported. The Business Council of Australia says in a new report that the recent productivity slowdown has been particularly dramatic and suggests that the productivity gains from past reforms are already starting to wane. The BCA goes on to say that key areas requiring further reform include taxation, federal-state relations and infrastructure, while there is also a critical need to address skill shortages. These are all key areas identified by Labor as requiring urgent attention. Even the Secretary of the Treasury, Ken Henry, has commented that without further internal structural reforms and a further deepening of cross-border commerce and people movement, we risk missing out on historical opportunities and failing to deal effectively with new challenges. If these outcomes are not bad enough in themselves, they are also undermining Australia's international standing as a good place to do business. The World Competitiveness Yearbook, which, as the BCA notes, is used by governments around the world to promote their countries as places to invest, showed that Australia fell from a ranking of fourth in the year 2004 to ninth in the year 2005. The World Economic Forum's Global competitiveness report showed that Australia fell from a ranking of 10th in the year 2003 to 14th in 2004 in the Growth Competitiveness Index, which measures macro-economic competitiveness. Unlike the government, our party, the opposition, the alternative government of Australia, are not daunted by the economic challenges confronting the country. We have responded before with a comprehensive package of economic reform, investment in education, skills, R&D and infrastructure, complemented by industry policies that increase the competitiveness of Australian industry. Labor have done it before and we will do it again. To put Australia back on the path of productivity growth, Labor have an agenda addressing the key challenges that we are now confronting. Labor have a plan to address our infrastructure crisis through the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia will be charged with responsibility for developing a strategic blueprint for our nation's infrastructure needs over coming years and facilitating its implementation in partnership with the states, territories, local government and the private sector. Labor have a plan to address our skill shortages via our $2,000 trade completion bonus to encourage Australians to complete training and skills which are in demand. Under Labor's proposal, traditional apprentices would receive a $1,000 payment halfway through their training and a further $1,000 payment at the completion of their apprenticeship. We have also proposed the creation of 4,000 extra trade training places in our schools each year. Labor will re-examine the reasons for the significant declines in our innovation and R&D and look at mechanisms for restoring R&D to the levels previously achieved by the Labor governments of the past. Labor will examine carefully the government's role in export promotion in this country. In its first budget the Howard government either abolished or substantially cut back many of the export promotion programs put in place by the Hawke and Keating governments. We need to review the impact of those cuts along with the contribution of the programs currently in place. Finally, we will need to restore our export performance to where it used to be by once again restoring an export culture right across the Australian business community to get our export growth back to where it should be-double-digit growth of the type achieved under Labor. There is another matter which goes to the very heart of Australia's international competitiveness and was highlighted in the recent BCA report. That is the potential to improve Australia's productivity performance through the reform of federal-state relations-at least, the type of federal structure that the Howard government is currently imposing on Australia. The dysfunctionality of the Federation is the last remaining frontier of micro-economic reform. Our view is that this, in turn, is creating inefficiencies for business which make it harder and harder for businesses to compete in the international environment. If we are to truly embrace a reform agenda in bringing about heightened productivity performance in the Australian economy and a restoration of Australia's international economic competitiveness, a broad based reform agenda is necessaryone that goes to the core of what we do in education, skills, training and R&D, that goes to the core of the infrastructure needs of the economy, but which also goes to the core of how we deal with the dysfunctionalities of the Federation as experienced by the Australian business community. It is in this context that we will be advancing an alternative approach to Australia's future export needs and it is why Australia, in our argument, needs a new export strategy-(Time expired)",90
36,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"in reply-The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to ensure that imported grape wine and grape wine product is treated consistently with similar locally produced products that are subject to the WET and excise regimes. Most importantly, the bill implements this government's initiative announced in the 2005-06 budget to remove the three per cent customs duty applicable to business inputs that are subject to a tariff concession order, thus providing free duty entry to those goods. This initiative will significantly reduce the costs of business inputs, thus increasing the international competitiveness of Australian products and encouraging investment in efficient and sustainable industries. For that reason I commend the bill to the House. In doing so, I thank the member for Hunter, the member for Forrest and the member for Griffith for their comments. In relation to the concern about the delay in the implementation of the customs tariff for grape wine, there are two separate pieces of legislation and a misalignment did occur. However, as soon as the positive matters there were identified, steps were taken to remedy the problem. While I do not have the dates of effect of the alignment of the 22 per cent upper limits that was achieved by a tariff proposal as soon as the anomaly was identified, the customs tariff reflects this change and has done so for some time. I want to comment on the most remarkable speech, well outside the ambit of the bill that we are discussing. I thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, your patience was commendable. I think the only element of the bill that the member for Griffith was addressing was the need for increased international competitiveness of Australian products, which this bill achieves. I must say I thought the speech was really a job application. It was a remarkable piece of extending the debate to outline an alternative economic agenda. Ms Macklin interjecting",93
37,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It was much broader than trade. You were not here for the speech, but as deputy leader you might note that he has a very lean and hungry look. Members ought to read closely the job application. I am sure he will arrange for wide distribution, and people will be reading all sorts of things into it. The part of the speech that impressed me most was the reference to reform fatigue. I was surprised he would relate it to the ernment's performance, because this government gave credit to some of the initial reforms adopted by previous Labor governments and built on them in office. The fact the matter is that it was the Labor Party that question. was unwilling to address issues relating to containing government expenditure. I can see that the member for Griffith has not learnt from that-he came with a very extensive shopping list for additional government expenditure in the speech that he has just given. The Labor Party certainly had no appetite for tax reform and I think that was quite clear in relation to the GST. Some Labor members recognised that that was important when they were in office. I think former Prime Minister Keating pushed for it from time to time, but when confronted with the trade union movement objections those important reforms could not proceed under Labor. It is quite clear even from the speech of the honourable member for Griffith today that he has not recognised that labour market reform is very important. In fact, if he wanted to draw upon some of the comments of people like the Business Council chair, Hugh Morgan, he would note the very significant interest in those areas that he quite conveniently ignored. I think his speech demonstrated the very considerable reform fatigue that has always been evident in the approach that the Labor Party has taken in relation to issues that this government has been prepared to address. I think it was a useful debate to hear the member for Griffith's job application for the role of Leader of the Opposition but, as I say, I think it was well outside the ambit of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.",94
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

40,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (12.45 pm)The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005 has three main components. The first is a very welcome allocation of $14 million over four years to James Cook University to support an extra 100 undergraduate places, 50 of which are earmarked for veterinary science and the remainder for tropical agriculture. The opposition certainly supports this measure. The additional places for veterinary science will establish a new undergraduate degree program from 2006 and this will be very welcome in this area of Queensland. These places are for a new veterinary science school at James Cook University's Townsville campus but it will also be linked to the Cairns campus. Aside from operating as a normal veterinary school it will also incorporate an innovative focus on tropical animal husbandry and diseases and it aims to develop preventative measures together with the early detection of diseases in livestock. It is very important that there be extra portunities for students in rural and regional Australia to become veterinarians. We know how short we are of vets, particularly in rural and regional Australia, so these extra places will be very welcome. It is also important that in the vast region of Far North Queensland we do have veterinarians with expertise in tropical animal diseases. I am sure that the students who get these places will be doing very important work. The new places for tropical agriculture are for the establishment of a new undergraduate degree which will provide expertise in tropical plants and the capacity to undertake research in sugar cane production, once again an industry vital to our country. Research into the development of plants capable of withstanding tropical climates is absolutely essential to enhance crop production and yields and is necessary to safeguard the income and job security of all those people who depend on this industry, particularly in Queensland. It is very appropriate that this work is going to be done at James Cook University and will help to lift its already impressive profile and research performance in these areas. The second main component of the bill is the provision of $25 million over three years for the University of Western Sydney to support a number of infrastructure projects. These are for teaching facilities at the Parramatta and Hawkesbury campuses, a new library at the Penrith campus and a medical training facility at the Campbelltown campus. The University of Western Sydney is a very important university serving an enormous area of the state of New South Wales, concentrating particularly on those vast outer western suburbs of Sydney. It has an extremely important mission as that region is home to well in excess of one million Australians. I am sure that Deputy Speaker Hatton knows that only too well and would op- strongly endorse the measures in this bill-if I can say that on his behalf. The allocation in this bill of $7 million in support of the new medical school at the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney is very significant. The university has earmarked 80 places for the medical school, which will commence in 2007. It already has a curriculum partnership with the University of Melbourne, which will make sure that the new school can operate backed by the experience of a medical faculty from a long-established university. The development of the new facility is an important achievement-I want to emphasise this-for one of Australia's newer universities. It has only been made possible because of a cooperative arrangement between the federal government and the New South Wales Labor government. Under this partnership agreement both governments have said that they will contribute $18 million. The $7 million allocated in this bill is separate from these amounts. The $18 million that is being contributed by the Iemma government includes provision for the use of facilities at Liverpool, includgagement ing buildings and facilities on the TAFE site and at the Liverpool hospital; support for the planning team in the first 12 months; funding of a planned consultancy and feasibility study; support for clinical teaching; funding for a professor of mental health and associated staffing support and costs; and access to funded teaching positions through negotiations with the area health service. All of these measures will make sure that this is a very strong development at the University of Western Sydney. The university has developed a growth strategy in response to the rising student population of greater Western Sydney and this medical school is a very important part of those plans. It will consoliwe date the University of Western Sydney as one of Australia's newest and most vigorous higher education institutions. The allocation of $9 million towards the establishment of a new teaching facility at the Parramatta campus will enable the university to reinforce and expand its exceptional record in preparing the next generation of health and human service professionals. The $2 million provided for the Hawkesbury campus of the university will permit an upgrade of research and teaching facilities at that site. These resources will contribute towards the acquisition of a cutting-edge environmental electron microscope, which is designed for higher order biological analysis. The grant will also help with the upgrading of teaching facilities for horticulture, food science and agricultural science. Provision of $7 million for the construction of a new library at the Penrith campus of the university will not only expand the quantity and quality of library services for the students and staff of the university but, most importantly, will afford wider access for local communities to such services. This certainly is a terrific example of the synergies that can be leveraged from the strong relationships and active enthat exist between this university and its very, very large surrounding population centres. Even though these infrastructure developments are very important-and they have strong support from the Labor Party-the proper time and process to announce these things is not during the heat of an election campaign. We would like to see these sorts of infrastructure projects come out of a proper sector-wide and open process. Unfortunately, that sort of process was not followed by the Howard government, and we are not surprised. We are used to seeing this government avoid the rigorous processes of public administration. We certainly hope that see such processes followed in future capital developments in our universities. Other universities have very significant demands and I hope that we see a proper process so that the competing needs and priorities of universities around the country can be looked at and that the projects of greatest need and those that will contribute to universities are the ones that are funded. While I am talking about the government and its reporting arrangements-and the things it does and does not say publicly-I draw the minister's attention to the fact that we have not seen the last triennial report on university funding. It was due for release last December but has as yet failed to appear. Maybe when the minister is summing up at the end of this debate he could inform the parliament where this triennial report will be released, why it has not been released and why we are still waiting for this very important aspect of accountability by the government to the public. The third major element of this bill can only be described as very inadequate indexation for universities. This bill alters the maximum funding amounts under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and maximum amounts for transition funding under the Higher Education Funding Act 1998. These are annual increases that are supposed to compensate-and this is important-for cost increases. The government had the opportunity to devise a much more realistic indexation method that truly reflected the costs that universities face. The Minister for Education, Science and Training made a commitment to our universities and to the Senate to review university indexation arrangements, when he was arm-twisting particularly Independent senators trying to get a 25 per cent HECS increase agreed to. He made this promise to the senators: ‘If you agree to the 25 per cent HECS increase I will have a proper review of the indexation arrangements so that universities are able to keep up with the cost increases that they face.' Unfortunately, the senators have been completely done over. They agreed to the 25 per cent HECS increases which are now unfortunately confronting almost all of Australia's university students right around the country. The minister had a review. It was entirely in-house. Even the universities were not able to make a contribution to this review. Having had this review, which was a complete sham, the minister is now refusing to provide adequate indexation that meets the real cost increases that universities face. any wonder that our universities are under enormous financial pressure? The No. 1 reason for that is this government's and this minister's refusal to properly index the grants that universities get from Canberra. The universities cannot keep up with the costs of running a university. They were promised a proper review of this issue by the minister when the legislation was going through the Senate. So all senators, especially the new senators who are flexing their muscles at the moment, should beware when this education minister makes empty promises. He has made them before and he certainly has not delivered on them. He has not delivered on the promises he made in relation to a very important sector-our universities. Unfortunately, the government seems determined to stick to its wholly inadequate formula for calculating how much indexation universities should receive. In considering the basis on which the future indexation of grants should occur, the Department of Finance and Administration recommended against a more realistic formula and claimed that this was justified because of ‘the strong financial health of the sector'. I know we are used to hearing some extraordinarily Orwellian language from the Howard government, but this phrase is right up there. There are no independent organisations or experts who could come close to agreeing with this statement. It certainly reflects the extraordinary unreality that seizes this government. In a report in May 2005-just a few months ago-from the New South Wales Auditor-General to the New South Wales parliament it was revealed that the Howard government had driven half of the universities in that state into deficit. I do not know how on earth the department of finance in Canberra could say that the university sector is in strong financial health when we have Is it the Auditor-General in New South Wales demonstrating, through their own independent analysis, that half of the universities in that state are in deficit. The Auditor-General's report disclosed that five out of the 10 universities in New South Wales are officially in the red. I am sure you would be sorry to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, that one of those is the University of Western Sydney. It has a very significant deficit of almost $27 million. The University of Newcastle has a deficit of a similar amount. The University of Technology, Sydney is $12.2 million in the red, the University of New South Wales is $9.9 million in deficit, and Southern Cross University in Lismore is $5.9 million in deficit. That is the financial state of our universities. They face these very significant deficits because this government refuses to properly index their grants. There has been a massive jump in the number of universities in financial difficulty since 2003, when only three universities ran small deficits totalling $6.2 million. In 2004, the University of Technology, Sydney and the University of New South Wales joined the list of those reporting deficits. The total is now a whopping $81.8 million in deficit just for those universities, and that is just in New South Wales. We could go around the country if we had more time. This government has allowed this reality to occur because it refused to provide fair and reasonable indexation. That lack of indexation has gone on for nine very long years; nine very long years of hardship that our universities have faced. The hardship of the universities has been passed on by this government to both Australian and overseas students to fill the gap that universities face in vital revenue. We have a minister for education who continues to categorically rule out fixing the indexation problem, despite the universities saying that it is their top ority. If you were to ask the Australian ViceChancellors Committee what their top priority is for university funding, they would say it is addressing the indexation issue. Because the government refuses to address the indexation problem, we are going to see the universities come back to this government and say, ‘If you won't fix the mess that has been created by the lack of indexation, we are going to have to ask for a further increase in HECS fees.' We know the government has already introduced a huge blowout in the cost of HECS for our university students. In fact, since this government was elected, there has been, on average, about a 100 per cent increase in HECS. That is before you take into account the latest increases. We do know that this is all guaranteeing that Australian families and their students continue to face steeper and steeper HECS fees, and it is leaving families in greater and greater debt. These HECS fee rises have been driven not only by the lack of indexation but also by the very significant cuts that were imposed on universities by this government. The assessment of the increase in debtthe increased amount that the government is intending to take from our university students and their families over the next four years; and these are government figures-is an extra $839 million. That is a huge increase in the clawing away of money from the pockets of students and their families. That is just through the 25 per cent increase in HECS that started this year. We know this figure will go higher because this government refuses to properly index our university grants. When the minister introduced the latest 25 per cent HECS increase into the parliament, he made an extraordinary promise when he was introducing the bill in 2003. He said: priWhat that means in real terms is that the HECS charge for most courses in most universities will not change at all. What an extraordinary statement and how wrong he was! Some 32 out of 38 universities have now decided to increase their HECS fees, most of them by the full 25 per cent. I think we can expect that those universities that still have not put their fees up are, in the end, going to have to face that very unwelcome reality. Recently, the Australian Catholic University announced ‘with regret' that they too have been forced to increase HECS fees from next year. They could not have been plainer about the reason why. In a media statement, the National Vice-Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, Professor Peter Sheehan, said: With the absence of full indexation of the Gov- dents. ernment Grant we have been faced with no other choice but to increase HECS in line with the jority of Australian public universities. That is the reason that each and every university has given for increasing HECS fees. The government has basically decided that it will palm off the cost of running our universities to students and put students into higher and higher levels of debt. It has also been a very lazy course for the government; the sort of policy that we should not be surprised to see from a government which has now been in for a long time. It is taking a very lazy approach to policy development in the university area and is continuing to slug students, but it is not thinking about some of the major issues that need to be addressed in our universities. We know that the other way in which this government has decided to provide more money to our universities via students is the massive increase in the number of full-fee degrees. We have seen recently the publication of the latest Good Universities Guide. There are now 60 degrees offered by Australian universities which cost $100,000 or more. According to the guide, a combined medical and law degree at Monash University will cost a staggering $256,000. These are fees for Australian students at Australia's public universities. Who introduced this outrageous scheme that leaves Australian students with $256,000 worth of debt? That is the legacy John Howard is leaving these students. Dental science at the University of Melbourne costs $150,000. Again, these fees are for Australian students at Australian universities. Veterinary science at the University of Sydney costs $147,600. Physiotherapy at the University of Queensland costs $112,000-and the list goes on with huge, absolutely monstrous fees that this Prime Minister has imposed on our stuThe Howard government has sold out maAustralian students and their families, because of course no student could pay these sorts of fees on their own. The government has created a United States style system where massive amounts of money can open the doors to university. Money is speaking so much louder than results. No ordinary Australian family could pay anything like these amounts of money for a degree. I am sure many people remember that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, promised Australians in 1999 that there would be no $100,000 degrees. He made it plain when he stated: The government will not be introducing an American style higher education system. … … … There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government. No-one on this side of the parliament is the slightest bit surprised that the Prime Minister has broken yet another promise. He is so out of touch with the reality of family life that he thinks people can pay $100,000, or even $200,000, for a university degree. These extreme fees can only be said to be the result of a government that is completely out of touch with the reality of Australian family life. The smart approach for any government that really cared about the future of this nation would be to invest in more affordable HECS places, funded at reasonable rates, and to make sure that we kept up with the cost of running universities through proper indexation. But of course that is not what we are getting from this government. Instead we have a massive increase in fees, leaving students and their families with outrageous levels of debt. The result of all this is that, for only the second time in 50 years, the number of Australian students attending universities has actually fallen. That is an extraordinary achievement by the Howard government. The Hawke and Keating governments put in place the opportunity for a record number of higher education places and record growth in participation in our universities. That has now been reversed by this government. That is an extraordinary indication of how our country has slipped badly under this government and has slipped badly in relation to other major developed countries. Under the previous Labor governments we were at or near the top of OECD countries in our performance in educational participation and the attainment of educational qualifications. But this government has taken us backwards and we now languish towards the bottom of the rankings on the same measures. What an achievement that, over the nine long years of the Howard government, we have dropped our capacity to have more and more Australians getting higher education qualifications! It is very bad for the future of this country. It is very clear that when it comes to higher education this government has put us in reverse gear. An OECD report released earlier this year found that Australia had one of the largest declines in public investment tertiary education and training of any OECD country. Our expenditure crashed by 8.7 per cent. The majority of our competitors-and this is the important thing-are out there investing in higher education while we go backwards. Australia was one of only seven OECD nations to actually reduce government per capita funding for tertiary education and training between 1995 and 2001another shocking indictment on this government's ineptitude. It seems the government is content just to fiddle with indexation in the face of continuing deterioration in university finances. That is having a very serious impact on the quality of education that is being delivered in our universities. We are seeing a deterioration in staff-to-student ratios, and that can only threaten the quality and standard of educational provision at our universities. We know that this is not the end of it. The government has some other very radical changes in mind for the university sector. One which has been receiving a lot of public attention this week is what can only be described as a vindictive piece of legislation on student services. As I understand it, the government has plenty of members who think this is the sort of legislation that should be dropped. It really is mean spirited and petty, and it is high time the minister got over it and looked at the Labor Party's sensible amendment, which would make sure the services that university students rely on are able to continue. We also know that the government intends imposing very extreme industrial relations changes on our universities. Basically, the universities are going to have to offer all staff individual workplace agreements, individual contracts. Of course, the objective of the government is to force universities to drive down wages and other conditions of in employment, and that will have a very serious impact on not only the university staff and their standard of living but also the capacity of universities to attract the best and brightest into our higher education institutions. We will have plenty of time to talk about these issues in the weeks to come. I want to finish by saying that Labor will support this bill because of the very positive measures for James Cook University and the University of Western Sydney. I have absolutely no doubt that the debate over indexation will continue. It is a very hot political issue that we are termined to pursue.",94
41,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (1.15 pm)The member for Jagajaga just demonstrated her very clear narrowness of understanding of, for instance, small business and other activities. She has just cried crocodile tears that a scheme called HECS-that her party invented on the advice, I think, of Neville Wran-is going to cost a dental science student $160,000. I suggest she go down and try to buy a set of taxi plates in her electorate $160,000. How would you get into a taxi business for $160,000? Who would lend you the money and give you possibly 20 years to pay off the debt? What is so special about going to university? I wonder when she last had a filling, and how much she paid for what was probably 20 minutes of work. My recollection is that it is $200 or $300 today. So according to her it is okay for an immigrant or someone else to go and borrow money, maybe from a finance company at 10 or 15 per cent, pay $300,000 or $400,000 for a set of taxi plates and pay it back with no government help, but it is not all right for someone to have the means mentally and physically to be a dentist and charge the community $500 or $600 an hour. On her reckoning, on her philosophy, because that has got something to do with university education, that person should pay no ingoing whatsoever. The papers the other day were discussing just how much a pharmacy is worth today and what they change hands for-over $1 million. But it is the member for Jagajaga's view that getting that pharmacy degree, which makes you a monopolist in that area, should be free-or not actually free but at a huge cost to other taxpayers who, for instance, might send their children to TAFE where those skills are charged for in cash and up front. This government does not take the attitude de- that in fact a student should pay for 100 per cent of the training that the taxpayer provides or the university provides to give them opportunities to get into those lines of business. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, who she talked about. She did not talk about someone doing an arts degree and hoping to get a job as a librarian. She complained about dentists, doctors, lawyers and one other in that category. All of them have a guarantee of having a business income five for times what any taxi driver might get. She thinks it is okay for the taxi driver to buy a set of plates for $300,000 or $400,000 to get a job, or for someone else to pay a couple of hundred grand to get into a TAB agency or a post office agency. That is quite okay. But, if you are going to go to university, the Australian taxpayer has got to set you up for an income four or five times what those other people could obtain using their own money or by borrowing it at very high interest rates. I was also surprised to see her crying crocodile tears over universities like Newcastle being in debt. We have heard from the incumbent Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle. He makes it very clear that it is the fault of the past administration. They have continued to fund programs and staff them with no students, but they have never tried to rationalise their assets, as other universities are doing, and they have vacant land of high value that clearly is not going to be used in the future. She happened to have a bit of a swing at voluntary student unionism. For goodness sake. It is a fee to go to university, and what are you paying for? For nothing, probably. More particularly, the people I representand I am rather interested in the remarks of another person recently-who want their kids to go to university are frequently suffering the effect of drought. They have difficulty in finding the money, and that is after having to hire or buy accommodation to put the kids in. Then of course there are external or extension students who go through the whole process. A journalist yesterday reported-I think it might have been in the Telegraph or one of the other tabloids; he writes for one of those Murdoch papers-that he lives in Sydney or another capital city and he got into an extension course with a university in Queensland. I bet that person has got an opportunity to be on the guild executive. I bet that person has got an opportunity to access the library. That person says, ‘I bought all my own books. Why should I have to pay the fee?' I was astounded when the vicechancellors wrote to us and said, ‘We would be quite happy to shrink the amenities, but we would like to retain dental care, child care and the library.' Where does this $7.9 billion go in a university institution if it not include a library? Then they mention photocopiers. There is a simple way to deal with that, and that is to put a credit card facility on them so the people who want to photocopy books or whatever do so and pay for the service. But why does the bloke in Sydney who is doing an extension course, who cannot get to the photocopier, have to pay the same amount of money? It is ridiculous. There are so many of these facilities. I got a letter from someone saying that they were a member of a choral society of 130 members at Monash University. How many students are there at Monash University40,000? I do not know, but it is one of the biggest intakes in Australia. Here we have 130 people believing they have a right that the other 39,000 pay for their social activity. I also see someone having a shot at the fact that, if you are in the right place at the right time, you get half-price drinks at the expense of someone who gets nothing. Go down to RMIT in Melbourne and see where all the sporting grounds are for those students, who still pay the fee-it is just brick wall straight up to the footpath. It is silly. Any university claiming that the government's contribution is not enough and is not properly indexed had better ring up the ViceChancellor of Newcastle, because he has made it very clear publicly that they ran a lousy business. Why should the taxpayer subsidise incompetence? Of course they should not. There are many people, as our minister points out-70 per cent, I thinkwho do not go to university and whose kids do not go to university. Why should they be paying, on the claims of the member for Jagajaga, so that someone does not have to pay half the price of buying a taxi plate to get into dentistry? These are the issues. I came in here simply to congratulate the government for putdoes ting a veterinary science course into James Cook University. What an excellent place. I have visited that area many times. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who is at the table and who represents that area, drew it to my attention when I was minister to the region. ‘There's Thursday Island,' he said, ‘and there's a couple of other islands. There's Papua New Guinea.' There are 19 million pigs being husbanded by the Beattie government in the Cape York National Park. That is what we have national parks for-to accommodate feral animals! If ever you needed high expertise when it comes to the exotic diseases that are on our doorstep-if those diseases are going to get to our country, they are more likely to come down that route-then it is up in that country. It was an initiative that was no doubt promoted strongly by the members for Herbert and Leichardt, who no doubt put very strongly to the minister the need to have that sort of training and expertise in that region. They can only be congratulated. Again that is spending government money where the remuneration ain't that special. Veterinary science is one of the hardest courses to get into. I have a daughter who is a veterinarian. I might add that in this day and age probably 90 per cent of undergraduates in that course are female. It has become a wonderful opportunity for women and more particularly because they have those high entry marks necessary. The reality is that we are investing in a sensitive area and making those opportunities available. I congratulate the minister consequently. Of course there are other measures, such as the medical training facility at the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney. Here is the government again remedying the sins of the Hawke Labor government. It is totally forgotten by most that the shortage of Australian-trained doctors today is the direct result of cutbacks to the undergraduate intake in medicine by 4,000 by the Hawke-Keating government. Why did they do that? A bit like free university education, they brought in Medicare, discovered they had a tiger by the tail-they were terribly worried about bulk-billing abuse and everybody hanging out their shingle in highpopulation areas-so they cut back university undergraduate entry in medicine by 4,000. Surprise, surprise, 10 or 12 years later you discover the effects of that-that is the time it takes to get a GP out into private practice. We are remedying that in many ways but, in particular, as a result of this legislation adding very substantially to the facilities at the Campbelltown campus, with $7 million for a medical training facility. In fact, ing, research and student facilities at the University of Western Sydney will be enhanced through an additional $25 million over the next three years. The facility at Campbelltown will complement the university's proposed new medical school to which the government committed $18 million in the 2004-05 budget. This brings the government's total contribution to the medical school to $25 million. The University of Western Sydney will get additional assistance to upgrade research and training facilities at the Hawkesbury campus. One of the things of great interest to me there was the fact that we are putting into Hawkesbury campus-which is a national leader in plant, agricultural and food systems research and the teaching of courses related to these activities-a state-of-the-art environmental electron microscope. Again, we want every bit of plant research we can get. I think-and I think there is a strong view held to the contrary in this House and probably on both sides-that there is a great irony in the government and the parliament supporting that expenditure for plant research while all the state Labor governments of this nation forbid anybody to plant genetically modified plant products. They are still living the way of the Luddites. It is a stupid notion that this new technology should not be applied in Australia. We should always be ahead of the game. It is only research. If Farrer had not come up with Federation wheat, I would not be standing here as the representative of a group of wheat growers. If it were not for all the research in plant agronomy that has been carried on since, you would not see the sort of productivity that has arisen from what is virby tually desert country. It is about time the silly attitude of the state governments changed. This parliament has put in the appropriate teach- controls through the GMO regulator, who declares certain GM items safe for human consumption. Then we get the Luddites saying that the end of the world is tomorrow. Yet one of those Frankenstein foods, I understand, is a rice product that contains vitamin A, so necessary to sustain the eyesight of people whose diet is heavily dependent on rice. At least this government is putting forward the financial resources to enhance the Hawkesbury campus of Western Sydney University and improve its capacity to provide better plants and so on. Many campuses would benefit from such a state-of-the-art environmental electron microscope which could contribute to genetic modification and yet the state governments say, ‘You can invent these foods, but you will have to sell them to some country overseas who will use them because we in Australia are not going to have them.' This bill makes a substantial contribution to higher education. I draw the attention of honourable members to the total of $7.8 billion that this budget provides for university education. The bill deals with specific matters which are of great benefit to the community. I reject entirely the remark of the member for Jagajaga that it is unreasonable to ask someone who can earn $1,000 or $2,000 a day to pay $160,000 over 20 years for access to his chosen industry or profession. It would cost more than that to buy a corner delicatessen. The taxi plate example I gave is so simple. People buy themselves employment through these sorts of opportunities. Whether or not they have a degree, they pay a lot more. The taxpayer does not lend them the money and wait to be repaid.",101
42,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The House has again had the pleasure of hearing the member for O'Connor just as we had the pleasure, in the last day or two, of hearing him rough up the new Senator Barnaby Joyce. I heard the member for Maranoa talking this morning about the old bull and the young bull. Old bull, young bull-it is all bull. Selling Telstra is a bad idea, period-not just for country Australians, but for all Australians. Banning university fees to provide student services will damage universities. It is bad for regional universities and it is bad for all universities. The government should realise that it is out of touch on this matter and support Labor's amendments in relation to student services. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005 provides for 100 new places in veterinary science and tropical agriculture at James Cook University, commencing in 2006. It provides $25 million in capital infrastructure funding over three years, from 2006, to expand the facilities for students at the University of Western Sydney at several campuses and improve its teaching and research capacity. These measures are supported by the opposition. Our deputy leader, the member for Jagajaga, explained why in some detail. The bill also amends the Higher Education Support Act to revise funding under various ongoing Commonwealth grants and scholarship schemes and reflects partial indexation increases for 2006-08 and the new funding year for 2009. Partial indexation increases for transition funding for 2006-07 are included in this bill as well. It is to those issues, and some fundamental questions about the funding of higher education, that I wish to address my remarks. Recently I was speaking with the chief executive officer at the Moreland Community Health Service. He was talking about the need for more GPs and dentists and how not enough dentists and GPs are being trained. The conversation went on to the broader area that, following the privatisation of utilities, certainly in Victoria, work force training levels have been inadequate. The government has adopted a laissez-faire approach to work force training, leading to competition for workers and skill shortages across a whole range of areas in the work force. This kind of anecdotal concern has been backed up by more detailed research carried out by Monash University's Centre for Urban and Population Research. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to the abstract of an article by Bob Birrell, Daniel Edwards, Ian Dobson and T Fred Smith entitled, ‘The myth of too many university students'. I draw on the research they have outlined in their article, published in People and Place. The article commences by observing: The Coalition Government has recently asserted that too many young Australians are training to become professionals and not enough as traditional tradespersons. By implication, there is a surfeit of young professionals. The abstract of the article claims that what has occurred, since the coalition came to power in 1996, is: ... the number of domestic students in Australian universities at the undergraduate level has hardly increased at all. All of the increase in professional training at the undergraduate level in Australian universities has been directed at overseas students. Partly as a consequence, there has been a rapid increase in the intake of professional migrants to satisfy employer needs. The article concludes that there is a need for more training of domestic undergraduate students, not less. To spell out these points in a bit more detail, domestic undergraduate commencements have increased by 3,000 from 132,000 to 135,000, which is a bare two per cent increase during the period since the Howard government came into power in 1996. They are essentially flat-lining. That we had 132,000 domestic undergraduates starting back then and we have 135,000 now shows a miniscule increase; they are essentially flat-lining. During that same period, undergraduate commencements by overseas students in Australian universities have increased by 20,000 from 16,000 equivalent full-time students in 1996 to 36,000 by 2003. That is a 125 per cent increase. That is a dramatic increase, whereas for the domestic undergraduates the increase is only two per cent. To underscore the difference in the pattern of undergraduate commencements, what has occurred is that the proportion of the total student population reflected by overseas students has doubled during this period. Back in 1996, it was 10.8 per cent of the student population; by 2003 it was 21.1 per cent-a massive increase during that period of time. The first point that needs to be made in understanding what is happening with university funding and higher education in this country is that all the growth has been in overseas student places-there has been nothing for domestic students. The second point that needs to be made is that there is a demand for university trained people in the Australian work force. There is a hunger for university places. The modern economy has an insatiable appetite for professionally trained people. The unemployment rate in 2003 in Australia for people with higher education qualifications was significantly lower than for those without such qualifications across all age groups. In particular, the difference in unemployment rates between those with and those without higher education qualifications was greatest amongst those who have recently graduated from university-that is, the 25to 34-year age group. Only three per cent of people with qualifications are unemployed, compared to seven per cent who are without. In that context, it is perfectly understandable that parents wish their children to have access to university training, with the likelihood of a well-paid job to follow. The ABS figures show that the median gross weekly wage in 2001 for higher education graduates working in Australia was $1,036 a week, compared to $727 a week for workers without higher education qualifications-a difference of 42.5 per cent. Despite comprising only 22 per cent of all employed persons in Australia, professionals made up 70 per cent of those in the highest income bracket-that is, those earning $1,500 or more per week. Naturally, the capping of the number of university places in the face of high demand for entry has led to increasing competition for university places. There was a six per cent increase in the number of 15to 19year-olds in Australia between 1996 and 2001. That growth in population has been compounded as parents and their children realise that university training is the key to valued professional employment. Competition to secure a government subsidised HECS place has increased. This is a major reason why an increasing number of parents are sending their secondary school-age children to independent and Catholic fee-paying schools. Between 1997 and 2004, enrolments in Australian independent secondary schools rose by nearly 50,000 students, or 27 per cent, and enrolments in Catholic schools rose by 28,000, or 10 per cent. In comparison, the secondary schools in the government sector gained slightly more than 8,000 students-an increase of less than one per cent. Those are Victorian figures which illustrate the sorts dilemmas that parents face. Essentially what has gone on is that the government has used overseas students as a battering ram for its full-fees agenda. It has also been prepared to use different religious convictions in Australia as a battering ram for an assault on the public school systemthe system of government schools-which it hates. It has indeed had inadequate checks and balances in some of the new schools that it has allowed to be established, and there have recently been questions raised about the kinds of things being taught at some of these new schools. Both of these approaches are against the Australian national interest. Prime Minister Howard likes to wrap himself in the flag and parade himself as an Australian patriot, but his higher education and education policies attack the Australian national interest. They undermine the options for Australian young people and they undermine Australia's common cultural values. As the concern about skills shortages has mounted, employers have expressed alarm about what this means for their enterprises. Their concerns have prompted the government to increase the skilled migration program and, in particular, to encourage overseas students to stay on in Australia as immigrants after the completion of their courses. Over the last couple of years, the pressure to further increase skilled migration has escalated, such that by 2003-04 the skilled migration program reached a 15-year high. Professionals dominated the skilled program, with some 25,600 entering as settlers in 2003-04. In addition, in 2003-04 some 11,000 visas were issued to former overseas students on completion of their courses in Australia. Indeed, there has been such alarm about the issue of skills shortages that there is talk of proposals to boost the migration program next year by a further 20,000. Again, if that is where it goes, it will weight the source of of new professionals even further away from domestic aspirants than is already the case. Given these facts, it seems pretty obvious that there ought to be an increase in university training for domestic students. Immigration may be a short-term way of dealing with this, but it comes at the expense of the opportunity for many Australians to improve their economic situation through the acquisition of a university degree. There are plenty of Australian young people who wish to achieve this. Unfortunately, the places are simply not available for them. The truth is that there is too little domestic training at university level, not too much. The number of government subsidised HECS places should be rising in line with demand and the professional employment pattern. This is sensible both from the point of view of employers and from the point of view of increasing opportunity for Australia's young people. But, instead of this, the Howard government's approach has been to try to mask its failure to provide places for Australian young people, to provide the higher education funding resources necessary for that. Instead, the government has been running a line on inverse snobbery, expressing the view that there has been too much emphasis on university training. The Prime Minister recently said: ... 30 years ago, we started getting this foolish bind that everybody had to go to university. Since it came to power in March 1996, the government has enforced a cap on government funding for domestic university students. As a consequence, there has been relatively little growth in the number of domestic undergraduate students commencing university courses, which has had an adverse impact on the training of professionals. The coalition's university training policies have contributed to serious shortages of university trained professionals in this country. As I have indicated, the coalition's response has been to expand migration. Furthermore, it has recently acted to constrain the practice of overenrolling at universities. As a consequence, the number of commencing undergraduates has begun to fall, following a peak in 2001. As part of this plan, by 2008 the Commonwealth proposes to penalise universities in which overenrolment exceeds five per cent, with specific restrictions on enrolments by discipline. This is likely to reduce the number of commencing undergraduates still further. I want to raise my voice against what I believe to be an unhealthy trend in this area. We are locked into an addictive cycle and we need to break out of it. We need to train our own young people. We need to provide opportunities for our own young people, and access to higher education is being denied to them. There is a lack of places that are available and affordable. The government is prepared to offer full fee paying places to students, but for many young people they are unaffordable. We are now seeing the sinister logic of the previous education minister, Dr Kemp, carried on by his successor. That sinister logic is, first: ‘Let's have the overseas students in here. That amounts to income for Australia. That'll be good for the Australian economy.' Then the next part of the equation is to say: ‘Well, if overseas students are paying full fees, why should we deny Australian students these same rights?' I use the expression ‘rights' advisedly, because we end up with a situation where your access to education is based on the wealth of your parents, when your access to higher education ought to be based on merit and your capacity to complete a degree and to use the knowledge you have acquired. I appeal to the Howard government not to outsource our skills needs but to invest in training our own people, in training Australians first, and to stop selling out our young people. It is unfortunate that the government has chosen to put a cap, effectively, on domestic university places and to deny Australian young people the opportunities that they want, that they deserve and that are in this country's interests. Until the government is prepared to move away from the ideology of full fee paying places and to accept the need to train young Australians, we are going to continue to have these skills shortages and continue to become ever more addicted to skilled migration, which is not the best solution to this problem. The best solution to this problem is to train our own and to put proper government investment into doing that.",104
43,Mr LINDSAY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I would not have missed the opportunity to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005. I believe that the member for Leichhardt will be 100 per cent behind what I say about our leading tropical university in Australia, James Cook University, in Townsville and Cairns. This bill is very important to James Cook University because it provides $128 million this year to JCU-that is $5 million more than the government provided last year-and over the next three years it provides 766 new Commonwealth supported places at Australia's leading tropical university. For the first time, it provides two new undergraduate degrees, with 50 places in each undergraduate degree. Those degrees will be delivered through both the Townsville and Cairns campuses of James Cook University. I will say more on the importance of that later on. I would like to take this opportunity form the House about JCU, our world-class enterprise. James Cook University is Australia's leading tropical research university. Perhaps many in the gallery have not been to North Queensland. It is 2,000 kilometres from here. Thank heavens I will be home tonight, back in paradise where it is warm and not cold like here in Canberra. Mr MCArthur-Paradise, Paradise!",108
44,Mr LINDSAY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I have a Victorian saying that it is not paradise. I should speak slower! James Cook University takes its name from the 18th century British navigator and explorer Captain James Cook. The university was proclaimed in Townsville on 20 April 1970, 200 years after Cook charted the eastern seaboard of Australia. It is a multicampus university, with the main sites located in vibrant tropical Queensland in Townsville and Cairns. There are smaller sites, as the member for Leichhardt knows, in Mount Isa and Mackay and on Thursday Island. JCU courses are delivered in partnership with education providers in Sydney and Melbourne, and now Singapore. JCU offers courses in a broad range of study areas, and as a result of this bill it will be able to broaden those courses quite significantly. JCU particularly focuses on life in the tropics. In a ranking of the world's top 500 universities, JCU was one of only 13 Australian universities listed. That is a pretty good achievement for a regional university. JCU's main sites are located in tropical North Queensland, which is a remarkable region with over one million visitors each year who come to experience two World Heritage listed natural wonders-that is, the Great Barrier Reef and the rainforests in the wet tropics. The region is also the gateway to the scenic Atherton Tableland, Cape York and the historic Queensland outback. Townsville and Cairns are thriving coastal cities, to in each with populations of around 130,000 people. JCU is renowned for its friendliness, good staff-student ratios, highly qualified teaching staff and effective support services. More and more students from other parts of Australia and abroad are discovering the natural advantages of tropical North Queensland. There are over 170 undergraduate and 140 postgraduate courses offered at JCU, spanning the arts, business, creative arts, education, engineering, law, medicine, health sciences, science, information technology and social sciences. JCU provides its graduates with the qualifications and skills for entry into the global work force. All degree programs emphasise the skills of critical thinking and problem solving, effective communication and familiarity with information technologies. JCU's mission is high-quality research of international standing, focused on areas of research strength and aligned to the needs of regional industries and communities in North Queensland and on addressing the issues of global importance to tropical communities and industries. Indeed, within the next 10 years we will see JCU become the most significant tropical research university in the world. That is where this university is heading. That is why the provisions in this bill before the parliament this afternoon are so important to our North Queensland university. In addition, JCU's research mission is guided by strong collaborative linkages with industry, recognition of the benefits of the regional community of scholarship and the humanities, creative arts and social sciences, a supportive research training environment closely aligned with areas of strength and a planning process based on quality assurance, accountability and review. The way that JCU has blossomed over the last nine years is quite significant, particuScience larly in areas of the School of Medicine. The School of Medicine, I am very proud to say, graduates its first doctors on 15 December this year. That will be a really proud moment. When doctors are trained in regional areas we find that they stay in regional areas had. and work in regional areas, and that helps the work force in our area. JCU is famous for its marine research through linkages with the Australian of Marine Science, the Commonwealth environmental research facility. I pay tribute to the member for Leichhardt for the way that he worked with me and the government to make sure that, when the reef and rainforest CRCs come to the end of their CRC life, they will continue on seamlessly but with a much better and bigger operation in the Commonwealth environmental research facility. I also pay tribute to the CEO, Dr Russell Reichelt, who has been a tireless advocate for the need for tropical research in both reef and rainforest areas. Last week I was privileged to officially open two new information technology laboratories at James Cook University. James Cook University is connected to the world through one gigabit per second links that enable supercomputing operations and collaboration with universities anywhere on this planet. They enable James Cook University to work collaboratively with the most significant scientists in the world today. The particular e-research that was going on at James Cook University allowed it to use its supercomputing facilities to do work in medicine, particularly to predict what diseases a person might have in areas of the body before they even knew they had a disease. This is leading-edge stuff. James Cook University is leading the world in relation to this kind of technology. I pay tribute this afternoon to Dr Brendan Nelson, the federal Minister for Education, and Training. I thank him for the support that he has shown to James Cook University. I thank him for having such an interest in our university. I finish by observing that the Howard government is the best friend that James Cook University has ever",108
45,The SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be reInstitute sumed at a later hour. NA",109
46,Mr HOWARD,VICTORY IN THE PACIFIC,"by leave-I move: That this House: (1) notes that 15 August 2005 (VP Day) marks 60 years since the Japanese surrender which ended World War II; (2) recalls with profound gratitude the heroic achievements and sacrifices of those Australians who served in the defence forces during the war, as well as those who contributed on the civilian front; (3) particularly remembers the thousands of Australians who lost their lives or were wounded in the conflict, and especially recalls the suffering of so many Australians taken as prisoners of war; (4) whilst never forgetting those who suffered during World War II, acknowledges the strength and importance of the post World War II relationship between Australia and Japan; and (5) resolves that Australia's efforts should always be directed to ensuring that a conflict of that magnitude never occurs again. All over this country next Sunday and Monday, commemorations will be held to mark the end of the most costly war in human history-a war that commenced in September 1939 and finally ended with the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945. It was a war that, for the very first time, directly threatened the Australian mainland. We recall in particular the bombing of Darwin, the bombing of Townsville and the midget submarines in Sydney Harbour. It was a war that totally mobilised large parts of the Australian civilian population in a manner that this country had never before seen and has never seen since. It was a war which saw-particularly, but not only, in the Japanese phase of the war-acts of incredible bravery and achievement by Australian soldiers. It should always be remembered that the first significant defeat on land inflicted on the Japanese was in fact inflicted on them by Australian forces at Milne Bay. British Field Marshal Sir William Slim, later to become a very respected Governor General of Australia, had this to say in his war memoir Defeat Into Victory: Australian troops had at Milne Bay inflicted on the Japanese their first undoubted defeat on land. Some of us may forget that. Of all the allies, it was the Australians who first broke the invincibiltralians, ity of the Japanese Army. This is a fact in the military history of this country about which all Australians should not only have a permanent recollection but should also be immensely proud. Above all things, as we mark this day, as we in this parliament recall those events of 60 years ago, we pay massive tribute to the bravery, skill and commitment of the men of the Australian Defence Force who performed so valiantly, gave so much and halted the Japanese advance at Milne Bay. In the process of paying tribute to those who gave so much and did so much to guarantee the freedom we now have, let us also record our immense gratitude to the people of the United States of America. It was the Battle of the Coral Sea that saw America stand protectively between Australia and a potential Japanese invasion. As a result of the timely intervention and the strength of the contribution of the United States, the people of Australia owe to the people of the United States of America a debt that can never be fully repaid. There were many losses and many tragedies. At a political level, two men who had contributed, through the leadership of their own countries, to the ultimate defeat of the Japanese were not to live to see the Japanese surrender. I refer to the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, who died on 12 April 1945, in advance of both the German and Japanese surrender, and, of course, to our own Prime Minister at the time, John Curtin, who died on 5 July 1945 and was thus denied the opportunity to see the victory to which his leadership had made a very significant contribution. I pay unconditional tribute to the contribution that he made in the time he was Prime Minister during World War II. In recalling the events of World War II, we particularly recall the fact that so many Ausafter the fall of Singapore, went into Japanese captivity. Perhaps the hardest lections of war held by Australians relate to the treatment of prisoners of war of the nese not only on the Burma-Thailand railway but also in Changi prison camp. There was a time when this House had on both sides many men who had not only fought in World War II but also been prisoners of war of the Japanese. There are a few of those former members still alive. I saw one of them this morning by coincidence-my dear friend and political mentor Sir John Carrick, the former Leader of the Government in the Senate. I think of Tom Uren, the former Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party-still vigorous, still contributing. I think of Reg Schwartz, the former Leader of the House, who I think holds the record for the longest answer ever given at question time. I think also of the late father of my friend and colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alec Downer, who had been, along with so many of his parliamentary colleagues, a prisoner of war of the Japanese. World War II was finally brought to an end through the dropping of the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and those deeds have been the subject of constant debate and discussion ever since. It is beyond argument that the dropping of those bombs inflicted enormous death and terrible suffering on many of the people of Japan. The scale of that destruction and suffering something that I know appals us all, but it can nonetheless be asserted with confidence that the balance of morality was strongly in favour of the decision taken by President Harry Truman. His decision to use the bombs undoubtedly shortened the war and saved many hundreds of thousands of allied lives. Although we remain, I suppose, in awe and trepidation of the terrible power of nuclear weapons-and properly so-it should not be recorded as a moral black mark against the then American President that the atomic recolbombs were dropped because they undoubtedly shortened the war and undoubtedly Japasaved many hundreds of thousands of allied lives. As we look back, I think we should also look at the years that followed the end of the war. Without in any way, as the motion suggests, forgetting or ignoring for a moment the suffering, particularly of those who suffered directly at the hands of the Japanese Imperial Army, we should not lose sight of the fact that the relationship which has been forged between Australia and Japan in the 60 years following the war is one of the most important relationships this country has anywhere in the world. I pay tribute to the many people who have made a contribution to that relationship, not only on the Australian side but also on the Japanese side. I want to especially pay tribute to the work of John MCEwen, the then Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, who, in the face of ferocious opposition from many quarters, forged the Australia-Japan Commerce Agreement of 1957. Barely 12 years after the end of World War II, he saw that the future lay in a close collaboration between Australia and Japan, not a perpetuation of the bitterness and the conflict that had characterised the years between 1941 and 1945. As the years have gone by, our relationship has become closer. Now, as the House would know, the military forces of is Japan and the military forces of Australia are working together to build a free and democratic Iraq. I think all of that can be said without for a moment forgetting, as we must never forget, the suffering of those who were so badly treated at the hands of the Japanese Imperial Army. Finally, as we look back on 60 years of relative peace, this is an occasion to resolve-whatever our political views may be on all sorts of issues and whatever our position may be-to bend all of our efforts to ensure that a war of that magnitude never again occurs. As we gather in the towns, cities and suburbs of Australia on Monday to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of that terrible conflict, we will give thanks to God for the victory of the allied cause, for the cause of righteousness and truth, because we did fight that war in an unconditionally just cause: we were fighting for the freedom and liberty of our country and for the way of life we now enjoy. We will also give thanks to those who sacrificed so much for our future and we will dedicate ourselves to do everything we can to ensure that a conflict of that magnitude never again occurs.",109
47,Mr ABBOTT,VICTORY IN THE PACIFIC,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent Mr Beazley (Leader of the Opposition) speaking for a period not exceeding 11 minutes. Question agreed to.,112
48,Mr BEAZLEY,VICTORY IN THE PACIFIC,"The opposition supports this proposed resolution. We think that the proposed resolution properly reflects the tribute that we in this chamber ought to pay to a superb generation of Australians and that it also properly reflects a contemporary relationship with our profound enemy of those days, and does so in a good and sensitive manner. This weekend, right across this nation Australians will celebrate and commemorate our toughest generation. It is a generation which includes, for many members of this House, our parents and, for some of us, our grandparents. It is a generation forged in the Depression in the worse of all possible economic circumstances, following on from a terrible crippling in many ways of the young of our only just established nation during the course of World War I. It is a generation which came through those handicaps and found itself confronted, to a very large extent on its own, by the issues of national survival. It is a generation that came through that test of the refiner's fire such as this nation has never known. The words that the Prime Minister used to describe it were entirely appropriate, and I thank him too for the statements he made about our very tough and effective political leadership of that generation. Those who analyse the history of the period talk a great deal about the role that we played in a totally allied operation. There is much focus on the relationship forged then with the United States-a very critical one. There is a lot spoken about the difficulties that the British found themselves in, simultaneously to the efforts that we were making in orthe Pacific, and about the profound contribution to allied efforts in Europe, both in the Middle East at the battle of El Alamein-a turning point in that conflict-and in the United Kingdom, where thousands of young Australians served with the British armed forces. That is often the focus of our analysis. In fact, for the first couple of years of the Pacific war we were profoundly on our own. We took the fact that the Americans had dispatched to Australia certainly their most famous and probably their best general as an earnest of their good faith in our defence. Psychologically, that was tremendously important in the community at the time. When I was defence minister of this country I never tired of pointing out to my American counterpart in those days, Cap Weinberger, the fact that it was not until the early part of 1944 that General Douglas MACArthur had more American troops under his command than Australian. Pulling the irons of the allies out of the fire in the fight in New Guinea was largely an Australian effort-an effort begun with profoundly undertrained Australian soldiers who had only their courage to rely on. Nowadays some American military historians and others are beginning to take account of these facts and develop an understanding of them. Many of them are now looking at the various battlefields across the globe that came about in that heinous conflict and they are coming to the conclusion that it was Australian forces who fought in the most difficult of circumstances in that war-harder than the Russians had to fight in Stalingrad; more difficult than the allies experienced as they charged up the beaches of Normandy; even tougher than what our Kiwi brethren and others went through in assaulting Montecasino in Italy. It was the Australians along the Kokoda Trail with a five-man front, knee-deep in mud, rain pouring down on them and an unseen enemy five metres away who fought in the toughest conditions and with a spirit of which we can all be proud. Let me read a description of Australians by one American historian-and I recommend his book, Touched with Fire, to every single Australian school. He says this of us: The ingenuity required on the frontier, which Australians call the ‘convict mentality', was very real. There was also a genuine ruggedness to the national character. Physical courage was highly prized. A broken nose was easy enough to come by in pre-war Australia ... It is, I think, safe to say that somewhere along the line the ‘Protestant work ethic' lost some of its intensity in Australia. An Australian infantry man who served at Milne Bay told me they were glad to hear of the Japanese attack because that freed them from an ugly road building detail in the mud. Soldiers who would rather fight crack Japanese assault troops than build roads win wars. That is an interesting tribute from a very good historian. Let me read you something else that this historian who arrived at some of the judgments I referred to earlier had to say: Australia shouldered a very large portion of the land war against Japan in 1942-43 and Australia's war in this period was fought largely by the AIF, the best infantry in the Pacific. And that was so. That is the generation we are talking about, and when we commemorate the conclusion of the Pacific war on Sunday and Monday we should remember those things with a great deal of intensity. But there is something else that should be said about the people of those days. Those who look at the way societies were mobilised during World War II have also arrived at certain conclusions. They have looked at the mobilisation of the societies under the Nazis in Germany and Eastern Europe, under the communists in the Soviet Union and under both forces, effectively, in China. They have looked at the Churchillian efforts in the United Kingdom, when the UK felt enormously under threat, and at Roosevelt's extraordinary activities in the arsenal of democracy in the United States. They have concluded that there was no nation whose people were more mobilised than the Australian nation-this country, where every man and woman was turned to by the government and those responsible for organising the war effort. We had the most mobilised people on earth to defend ourselves, and, not surprisingly, there were only a few million of us in those days. It is an enormously moving thing to go to St Kilda Road and see Curtin's World War II headquarters. There is nothing there-just a map, a table and a telephone. When I was defence minister I went to the US Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain during the Cold War, the locus from which the United States would have fought the Cold War were a ‘hot' war to have broken out. The technology at Cheyenne Mountain was extraordinary. Later I was taken to the British headquarters of NATO North Sea, which was the one non-American command in the NATO structure, and saw the enormous sophistication of that. Then there is St Kilda Road: a table, a map and a telephone. That was the infrastructure of Australian command as we confronted the struggle. Poverty stricken as we were, being one of the nations worse affected by the Depression, we rose out of that and essentially saved ourselves, essentially defended ourselves and emerged from that war a different nation. As we celebrate that generation, we celebrate the beginnings of a genuine Australian foreign policy and a genuine Australian defence policy-the casting off of imperial defence and domination of our national policy by, essentially, the British Foreign Office. We commemorate the fact that we industrialised massively during that period. We produced our own equipment. We not only fought that war, we fed the people who fought it. We not only fed the people who fought it, we equipped the people who fought it. Australian industry mobilised to fight that war. Australian women ran Australian industry mobilised to fight that war. Australian women were all engaged. They were working in the munitions factories. They were bringing in the harvests-every one of them. There was no ‘kinder, kuche, kirche' stuff for Australian women such as Hitler maintained in Germany for as long as possible during that conflict. From the moment we decided on national mobilisation, everybody was in it-the lot. That included the older generation who had fought the previous war. So we ought to commemorate it and we ought to commemorate it proudlyand we will in the course of this weekend. I will conclude with the words of Ben Chifley, the then Prime Minister-a month in after Curtin had died-who, on 15 August, said: Fellow citizens, the war is over. ... Let us remember those whose lives were given that we may enjoy this glorious moment and may look forward to a peace which they have won for us. ... Let us remember those whose thoughts, with proud sorrow, turn towards gallant loved ones who will not come back. Nothing can fully repay the debt we owe them, nor can history record in adequate terms their deeds from the black days that followed September 1939, and December 1941, until this moment.

Is the Prime Minister aware of new laws being introduced into the Queensland parliament to protect Queenslanders rights to annual leave, sick leave, parental leave, long service leave, penalty rates, public holidays and redundancy pay? Will the Prime Minister guarantee that his extreme industrial relations changes will not override these laws protecting Queenslanders?",114

52,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister advise the House of the latest labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics? Prime Minister, what needs to be done to consolidate the recent gains and to drive Australia's unemployment rate lower?",114
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the honourable member for Goldstein that, for the second month in a row, the unemployment rate of Australia has reached a 29-year low. Unemployment in Australia is now at five per cent, and it can go even lower if we have further workplace relations reform. The reason we want workplace relations reform is that we know that the good results of today are the products of yesterday's reforms and that, if we are to have even better figures tomorrow, we must continue the process of reform. Those on this side of the House do not believe for a moment that the job of reforming the Australian economy has been completed. We are not willing on this side of the House to settle for a growth rate of one or two per cent; we want a growth rate of three, four or even five per cent in the years ahead, and we can only have that if we have the courage to embrace further reform. Just as the predictions made by the Chicken Littles on the other side of the House 10 years ago that labour market reform in 1996 would drive wages down, destroy working conditions, increase unemployment and slash living conditions were proved to be wrong, so it is that those who seek to denigrate our reform agenda now will be proved wrong in the years ahead if this parliament embraces the government's reform package. The figures released this morning show that a further 12,700 new jobs were created in Australia in July. Full-time employment went down but part-time employment rose by 27,200. More than 350,000 new jobs have been created in the past year alone. The labour force participation rate remained-and this is very significant-at a record high of 64.7 per cent. Of the 350,000 new jobs created over the past year, more than 320,000 of them have been filled by new workers entering the labour market-a further piece of field evidence that the Howard government is the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had.

I refer the minister to the fact that Graham Morris, the Prime Minister's former chief of staff, is advising the government on its extreme industrial relations changes. I also refer the minister to the fact that the member for Goldstein, Mr Robb, a former Liberal Party campaign director, is a member of the committee overseeing the government's industrial relations advertising campaign. Minister, isn't it now the case that the advertising agency, Dewey Horton, co-owned by longtime Liberal Party advertising campaigner Ted Horton, has been awarded the contract for the government's industrial relations advertising campaign? Minister, why isn't this Liberal Party fix for a Liberal Party advertising campaign being paid for by the Liberal Party rather than by the Australian taxpayer?

We will do that because the Australian people are faced with a misleading and deceptive campaign by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We will continue to reassure the Australian people that these changes will lead to even more jobs for Australians and higher wages, something that today's employment figures justify in terms of past reforms.

61,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I slept very well last night. I pulled out Tony's speech and I was out like a light. I think I even got to the ond paragraph. I told him that this morning. I was asked by the member for Bonner about labour market participation. I inform the House that the participation rate, which measures the proportion of Australians over 15 years of age who are looking for work, whether they are in work or out of work, in today's labour force figures is an all-time record-that is, more Australians than ever before seek to participate in the labour market. Why would that be the case? It is because the chances of getting a job in Australia today are better than they have been for the last 30 years. Unemployment is at five per cent. Over the course of this government's term of nine years, 1.7 million new jobs were created; in the course of the last year 350,000 new jobs were created, 64 per cent of which were full-time. It was not always thus that Australia had a five per cent unemployment rate. Many of us in this House can remember back to 1993. In 1993 the Leader of the Opposition was at that time the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Does the House know what the unemployment rate in Australia was in 1993? The unemployment rate in 1993 was 10.7 per cent, more than double what it is today on a lower participation rate. In 1993 the Leader of the Opposition, as minister for employment-get a load of thiswent to the National Press Club to deliver a speech on unemployment. He said: We draw perverse comfort from the European Commission's latest prediction that unemployment in the EC will average 12 per cent in 1994 compared with our current level of 10.7 per cent. The justification was: 10.7 per cent-but don't worry about it if you are unemployed, because the Europeans have unemployment at 12 per cent. Can you imagine where Australia would be now if it had not had to cope with an unemployment rate of 10.7 per cent.",116
62,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of secorder in relation to relevance. If the figures being cited are relevant, so too is the fact that unemployment was at 10.9 per cent when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer.",116
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,116
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, not only is the unemployment rate less than half the 10.7 per cent rate under the member for Brand but also it has been done with an increase in the participation rate which is at an all-time record. Of course if the participation rates in 1993 had been at the level they are now, the unemployment rate would have been far higher than 10.7 per cent, as it was under the member for Brand. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the fact that participation rates are the highest we have ever had, on participation tables Australia is still only 12th in the OECD. That indicates that we should be aiming to increase the participation rate in Australia, even though that could have the effect in the short term of increasing the unemployment rate. This is why the government has announced reforms to the welfare system to encourage more people off DSP and into the work force and more people off income support and into the work force, because Australia has to lift its participation rate if we going to get growth over the years to come. This is real economic reform. It is necessary with the ageing of the population. The government is focused on it. We have announced a program to do it, and it is an important part of building Australia's opportunities in future. Workplace Relations",116
65,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I think the Prime Minister's answer is a slightly better one to the same question, but both would have got a lead from the minister for education.",117
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The leader will get to his question.,117
67,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Prime Minister aware of an Industrial Relations Court judgment in favour of a young South Australian woman who was employed on an AWA and paid 25 per cent less than her award entitlement, including the cashing out of her annual leave and sick leave? Isn't it the case that under the government's industrial relations changes AWAs will not have to meet today's no disadvantage test against the relevant award, leaving employees such as this young woman much worse off? Was the member for Goldstein, Mr Robb, correct when he said today that the reason you will not give a guarantee to this young woman, or to any other Australian, that they will not be worse off under this government's industrial relations policy is, ‘Well, we just simply don't know'?",117
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is not obliged to answer the last part of that question.,117
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My advice in relation to the 15-year-old worker was that she was not covered by a valid AWA; that the basis of the South Australian Industrial Relations Court finding was that the worker was a casual worker and not a part-time worker and was are therefore found to have been underpaid according to the provisions of the South Australian award in relation to casual workers. The government supports a system where a worker has recourse for underpayment of wages, and according to the implication of the Leader of the Opposition this has no reference to the veracity of AWAs. Horticultural Industry",117
70,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. How is the government assisting Australian farmers, including our fruit and vegetable growers, to develop new opportunities and markets?",117
71,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for his question and, as a former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in New South Wales, he understands the great challenges that face the Australian farming community in terms of the markets both here and overseas. Can I also take the opportunity of acknowledging the hard-working group of fruit and vegetable growers and farmers that have come to Canberra to express some concerns nationally this week. I had the opportunity of meeting with a delegation of those yesterday led by Richard Bovill. We had a very frank and good discussion about issues that we as a nation confront and, of course, the government is doing its absolute best to address those issues, particularly regarding unfairness in the international marketplace. We confront that in a very energetic way with our strong advocacy to remove the high tariffs and heavy export subsidies that are being utilised and deployed by a lot of our competitors internationally. We are currently at the inner circle, if you like, of the negotiarates tions in the Doha Round that are trying to get at these export subsidies and the limited access to markets. There is also a need for the high level of domestic support to be stripped away from a lot of our major competing countries to make a much fairer and leveller trading system across the world. We know it is unfair, we know it exists and we are doing an enormous amount to try and get rid of that. We are at that crucial stage in the multilateral negotiations to address those issues and they certainly will be of significant importance and support for Australian farmers. But we should also recognise what the government has been doing about negotiating FTAs with bilateral trading partners to try and improve access into some of our major markets whilst we are working on the Doha Round, whilst we are working on the multilateral system. We should also recognise that the Labor Party has opposed the government's moves on the bilateral front every inch of the way, instead wanting us to put all our energies into the multilateral negotiations. We agree on that point, we agree that we have got to keep on fighting the fight in removing export subsidies and domestic support in the markets of a lot of our competing countries, but we need to get results sooner than they are being delivered in the WTO, and that is why we embarked on our agenda of free trade agreement negotiations. The other things that we can do domestically this government has been doing extremely well, such as managing the economy, providing a stable economic environment-which is just as important to the farm sector as it is for every other sector of the economy-and we have been doing that since our time in office through good, sound economic management that has maintained downward pressure and stable, low interest in Australia. We have pushed unemployment down to the levels that have been announced today, the lowest levels in about 30 years. We are not sitting on our laurels on that front. We want to push that even further with the reforms that we are proposing. When we went through the whole process of taxation reform it was unambiguously aimed at making our exports more competitive. Almost $3 billion annually has been removed from the back of Australia's exports. And guess who collectively opposed that? The Australian Labor Party. We had to fight every inch of the way to deliver a benefit for Australian exporters. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on the question of relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister was not asked a single aspect of the question about alternative policy, so could you draw him back to the question which he was asked?",117
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is in order.,118
73,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will continue on that train of thought, we will continue on that policy perspective of reform, and of course we have been able, through sound economic management in Australia, to afford to continue to deliver significant investment in infrastructure, particularly across regional Australia. So we aim to continue our hard fight in improving those elements of the international marketplace that militate against our farms in Australia; we aim to continue to eliminate and remove those export subsidies and those heavy levels of domestic support. Let us never forget that they exist today as a result of the negotiated outcomes of the Uruguay Round. And guess who was in government when that was concluded? Mr Downer interjectingCountry of Origin Labelling Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (2.44 pm)He's a dud like you!",118
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will come to his question. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Mr Howard interjecting",119
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Corio has the call. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I will start again after being rudely interrupted by the Prime Minister. My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Does the minister recall telling the farmers, unionists and consumers at the Fair Dinkum Food rally in Ballarat that country of origin labelling will be fixed? Can the minister explain why Australian fruit and vegetable growers must come to Canberra in their tractors to persuade the minister to do what was promised nine long years ago by the Howard government? When will consumers be able to go into a supermarket confident that the labels on fresh, packaged and processed food items will enable them to choose Aussie products for their family's dinner table?",119
76,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and his character assessment of Mr Richard Marles. The government is committed to strengthening the country of origin labelling and making it mandatory to list the country from which the product originates. The honourable member will know that, as set out in the Constitution, the states and territories have responsibility for the food standards codes. As a result, the Commonwealth has one seat out of 10 at the table of FSANZ, which sets the country of origin requirements and labelling. Each of the six states and two territories as well as New Zealand hold the other seats and have equal say in the decisions of the council. So, if the Labor Party were truly supportive of accurate, distinctive and fair country of origin labelling, it would be urging its Labor health minister counterparts who make up eight out of the 10 votes to support the Commonwealth government. They should be supporting the Commonwealth government's proposed changes. But let us be clear not just about who largely has responsibility for determining country of origin labelling but about who has responsibility for enforcing it. This is a national disgrace. The Labor governments have sat on their collective hands and allowed obvious and identifiable breaches of the country of origin labelling to occur day in, day out, year in, year out. Quite frankly, they should be enforcing the country of origin labelling where it is in breach. There are many examples on our shelves where the products do not meet country of origin requirements. That is being ignored by the states and territories. So the Commonwealth is taking strong country of origin labelling requirements to the next ministerial council meeting. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing today issued a statement outlining the Commonwealth's position. We look forward to the honourable member for Corio, for so long as he occupies that position, supporting the government, especially in our attempts to enlist the support of the Labor health ministers and Labor governments in enforcing the labelling. Horticultural and Agricultural Industries",119
77,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House of new measures to support the horticultural and agricultural dustries of Australia?",120
78,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Braddon. Together with the honourable member for Braddon and many of my government colleagues, I attended the growers rally a short time ago. I was able to give them some very good news, unlike the rhetoric and cliches the Leader of the Opposition attempted to appease them with. It did not fool anybody. Some homespun story about some family connection to a citrus farm that no longer exists did not go down all that well, I can assure him. The growers want action. They are here in the gallery. They want to know what the government is to do for them. This is a vital industry to the nation. growers, with their Fair Dinkum Food campaign, have won the support of many people throughout the community. They have raised the issue of consumer choice. The Fair Dinkum Food campaign has brought this issue starkly to the nation's attention. We have already made an initial investment of $200,000 to map out a way forward to support the growers beyond country of origin labelling reform and to go into what will make them more competitive against the threat of cheap importation. Consequently, today the coalition government announced an additional $3 million to support the future of the Australian",120
79,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,120
80,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They would not welcome that, no. They would leave vegetable and citrus growers mired in the fight against imported competition.",120
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: how on earth could it possibly be relevant for somebody to stand up here and say that he is spending $3 million on this campaign when on their own industrial relations in- stuff they are spending $22 billion?",120
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,120
83,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The $3 million will provide business training, market development and leadership. It will strengthen industry relationships and supply chains and will accelerate priority research and development. The government is pulling together all strands of the sector to go forward, because when the euphoria dies down and the farmers are required to return to their properties to earn a living there are still going to be the issues of competitiveness, and that is where the government is going to work with the industry, in all of its complexities and diverThe sity, to make our growers more price competitive. I would wish in conclusion to thank my parliamentary secretary, Senator Richard Colbeck, for his efforts in putting together this additional funding and negotiating it with a willing Treasurer and Prime Minister. Senator Colbeck is a strong champion and advocate for the growers of Tasmania. I would like especially also to single out the member for Braddon, who is all over this issue. He is one of them; he is from that community. The member for Braddon has been unrelenting in his representationsomething in stark contrast to the Labor Party. You will never hear boo about this issue from the Labor Party. The Tasmanian representatives who occupy the opposition benches rarely if ever say anything about this issue. The member for Braddon has very strongly and fiercely represented his constituents. Mr Adams- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would ask the minister to look at the Notice Paper and see who put this issue on it to come up for debate.",120
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,121
85,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In drawing to a conclusion, I will let the growers in the gallery and elsewhere make an assessment of who are the best friends that the vegetable industry ever had. It is the government-not Johnny-come-latelys like the member for Lyons, who is attempting to cover his tracks-and the member for Braddon and the member for Bass. It is the Tasmanian senators with the support of the government-a $3 million investment today. Telstra: Privatisation",121
86,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to his 29 July $2 billion bid to prop up Telstra's regional services post privatisation. Is he aware of speculation that Telstra is now prepared to offer up to $5 billion? Deputy Prime Minister, how do you explain this $3 billion difference? It ain't going too well, is it?",121
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answering that question, the Deputy Prime Minister will ignore its last point.",121
88,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are still trying, Joel. Keep trying, mate. You might get it all up next time. I have seen reports this morning of comments by the new CEO of Telstra, Mr Sol Trujillo, regarding the expansion of services to regional Australia. One thing I would commend him on is that at least he is prepared to talk about options in improving services to regional Australia, because the Australian Labor Party has no ideas on it and is putting no policy proposals forward at all. The question indicates that there is a requirement for that level of investment in regional services and we are obviously keen to talk to Telstra about the proposal that has been put forward. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I asked the Deputy Prime Minister a very specific question and that was the difference between the $2 billion he asked for and the $5 billion",121
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister has the call and is in order.,121
90,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously the member for Hunter, as a semiregional and rural representative has not been following this debate. He certainly has not followed the recommendations of the Estens inquiry, because Estens spoke about services today, services in the future and the concept of future proofing. The concept of future proofing is being underpinned by a capital based fund. Providing a dividend stream to invest where the market fails in the future with future technology is a totally different and separate issue to what Telstra is talking about with a roll out of access to broadband to regional Australia today. They are two separate issues. The member for Hunter would be well advised to get some better advice on the issues that are confronting regional Australia today and into the future. The $2 billion Future Fund is about ensuring that market gaps do not appear because of market failure into the future. That is what the difference is. If the member for Hunter was right across this issue properly, he would well and truly understand that. National Security",121
91,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the government's response regarding the possible appearance of an Australian in an extremist video? Mr Wilkie interjecting,121
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Swan is warned!,121
93,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I know he will be interested, bearing in mind his own background in the Victoria Police, in these security issues. Our security agencies are assessing the footage of the video of 9 August and trying to establish its authenticity. At this stage that work is far from complete and there is still a good deal more work to be done. But I would like to take the opportunity of making this point. Any Australian who goes overseas and joins a terrorist organisation-for example, alQaeda-and fights with that organisation against Australia or our allies faces very serious consequences indeed. Groups like alQaeda are trained and prepared to kill and they are preparing to kill innocent civilians, including Australians. They constitute an enemy of Australia and they are the enemies of Australia's interests and our allies. If any Australian fighting for a terrorist organisation like al-Qaeda is captured in a war bearing arms on a battlefield, they face a tough legal situation. Such terrorists are not civilians within the meaning of the fourth Geneva convention; they are combatants. Nor are they prisoners of war under the third Geneva convention, because terrorist organisations, like al-Qaeda and others, are not legitimate international actors that obey the laws of war. As unlawful combatants, they lack the legal protection that prisoners of war would have. Under the Geneva convention, prisoners of war should be released at the end of a conflict. It is also, under the Geneva conventions, generally unlawful to put prisoners of war on trial. If people in these situations are captured, they face very severe difficulties. As we know, if they were captured by the United States, it is possible-it is not certain-that they could face the military commission process. But, if they were captured by other countries, there is no guarantee-and there is no requirement under international law either that they should face a process like that-the consequences could be significantly more severe in those circumstances. There is a simple principle here, and that is that these types of terrorists should not be able to return to the field of battle where they could once again take up arms against Australia or our allies. I make that point to emphasise that Australians who join terrorist organisations and wage war put themselves quite voluntarily beyond many of the protections that others would have under international law. Telstra: Resources",122
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister guarantee that a privatised Telstra will not simply cut its own capital works funding for country Australia by the amounts currently being considered to silence Barnaby Joyce?,122
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will answer the first part of the question. He is not obliged to comment on matters that colleagues have been speaking on.,122
96,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What I will guarantee is that our government will continue to provide the necessary focus to ensure that services are brought up to the acceptable standards that are needed in regional Australia and will continue to do so in the future. Workplace Relations,122
97,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the minister aware of recent reports on the benefits to the economy of workplace relations reform and are there any alternative views?,122
98,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Pearce for her question. Indeed there is a recent report released by the Business Council of Australia undertaken for them by Access Economics, one of the most well-known economic firms in this country, entitled Locking in or losing prosperity. Under the section headed ‘How can we cement Australia's prosperity' it makes a number of recommendations including this one: ... workplace relations reform (such as less heavy-handed employment regulation that allows employers to offer more flexible employment contracts). The report identified the benefits for the Australian economy over the next 20 years if further policies of economic reform are adopted. For example, Access Economics found that the economy will grow by four per cent rather than by 2.4 per cent, tralia's economy would therefore be nearly 40 per cent bigger by 2025 than would have been the case without the reform and that the wealth-and this is important-of average Australians would be 25 per cent higher. In other words, average Australians would be $74,000 better off in today's dollars if further economic reform is undertaken in Australia, including reform to workplace relations. So this report clearly sets out the benefits of further economic reform to ordinary Australians. Yet on Tuesday we had in here the Leader of the Opposition arguing that there is no economic rationale for reform. Here are reams of reasons why there is economic rationale for this reform. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition basically roll over to the unions on workplace relations. This will mean lower living standards in the future for Australian families. For example, his policy to strangle Australian workplace agreements will leave hundreds of thousands of employees worse off in this country. The average wage for workers on Australian workplace agreements, if it were reduced to the average wage of those on collective agreements, would be $5,883 a year lower. They would be $5,883 a year worse off. The policy of the Leader of the Opposition to strangle Australian workplace agreements would rip off $113 a week from those workers who are on Australian workplace agreements. That is what the Leader of the Opposition's policy would do. We have the Leader of the Opposition asking us day after day and question after question to give some guarantees. Can I ask for a guarantee from the Leader of the Opposition? Can he give a guaranteeMs Gillard interjecting",122
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business.,123
100,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to the 12,000 workers that Aus- in his electorate of BrandMs Gillard interjecting",123
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business is warned.,123
102,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"who are on Australian workplace agreements that he is not going to rip off $113 a week? No, of course he cannot. Can the shadow opposition spokesman on industrial relations give a guarantee to the 7,000 workers in the electorate of Perth who are on AWAs that they are not going to be ripped off by $113 a week? The reality of this policy is that not only would it take Australia backwards, it would be detrimental to ordinary Australian workers and their families if ever enacted by the ALP. Horticultural Industry",123
103,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In light of resolutions of Atherton fruit and vegetable growers, supported by producers in Calare, on the draft mandatory code of conduct for the horticultural industry, will the minister support industry calls to reject the so-called hybrid option for inclusion in the code, extend the public review period, convene new meetings in fruit and vegetable growing areas rather than the capital cities and ensure the final code includes the retail supermarket chains?",123
104,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. A mandatory code of conduct for the horticultural industry was an election commitment by the government which will be honoured in full. There is a consultation process under way at present. The honourable member has referred to some of the public meetings which yielded mixed results from participants. I can assure the honourable member that the commitment, which was based on the needs and requirements of growers, will indeed be honoured. Mr Andren- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the minister to refer to the supermarket chains and there was no reference to that at all.",124
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister has completed his answer, I believe.",124
106,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, what is the government doing to support international efforts to discourage Iran from continuing with planned nuclear activities?",124
107,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. I want to say to start with that Australia is deeply disappointed that Iran has defied the International Atomic Energy Agency. It has broken the IAEA seals and restarted its uranium conversion facility at Isfahan. Iran had made commitments to suspend sensitive nuclear activities, including conversion, while negotiations on a long-term agreement continued with what are called the EU3-the three European Union countries, Britain, France and Germany. With the EU3 proposal on the table, I believe those negotiations should continue. But the suspension must first be fully re-established. Australia does not believe Iran has any compelling need, operational or otherwise, to resume conversion or any other sensitive nuclear activity. Indeed, given its nuclear safeguards breaches and the fact that the IAEA is not in a position to conclude Iran has no undeclared nuclear activities, Iran needs to do more to build international community confidence that its nuclear activities are exclusively for peaceful purposes. It is not too late for Iran to turn back. My department has already told the Iranian ambassador, on 4 August, that we strongly encourage Iran to maintain the suspension, to examine the EU3 proposal carefully and to continue to negotiate with the EU3 in good faith. We reiterated that position at this week's special meeting of the IAEA board, of which we are a permanent member. We urged the international community to respond though, firmly and credibly, should Iran not reinstate its complete suspension. We anticipate the Iran IAEA board will meet again this evening. Consideration and action by the IAEA board is the first of a possible range of options for the international community to deal with this serious issue, including a referral to the United Nations Security Council. Iran has a choice. It should not think that isolation from the international community and irresponsible behaviour is a path to national success. We hope it chooses wisely. Veterans' Affairs: Grants",124
108,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, isn't it a fact that the Building Excellence in Support and Training Program is supposed to provide $3.5 million to veterans groups throughout Australia this financial year? Minister, why have grants from this fund, which are supposed to pay the wages of pensions, welfare and administration officers as well as other support costs, on and from 1 July, still not been received by veterans groups? Minister, hasn't this incompetence and delay forced some veterans groups to borrow and some to stand down employees?",124
109,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-We received the applications which had been approved from the department within the last fortnight. Within two days of receiving them. I had signed off on all grants and by this Friday of the administration matters will be complete. It is this government that has doubled funding for ex-service organisations to enable their advocacy officers to assist veterans and their families to seek benefits. There has been no untoward delay in this. In fact, the organisations concerned have all been contacted in the last week by my office or by the appropriate federal members. Infrastructure Security",125
110,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney-General advise the House how the government and businesses are working together to protect Australia's critical infrastructure?,125
111,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question, because obviously the London bombings have served as a stark reminder to us all of the terror and damage that can be wreaked on our society when terrorists target critical frastructure. In this instance, we know that land transport infrastructure was targeted, for some time the government has been aware and very much focused on protection of critical infrastructure generally-our energy, transport, food supply, finance and manufacturing sectors and our national icons and other essential utilities. That was reflected in the budget when an additional $50.2 million over four years was committed to programs designed to protect critical infrastructure. But it cannot be done alone. And I am pleased to say there is a willingness in business to work together with government in a genuine partnership on these issues. This will be demonstrated again tomorrow when business leaders will join with a number of ministers and me for the second BusinessGovernment Advisory Group meeting in Canberra. This is a mechanism for the govall ernment to discuss proposed new security initiatives and developments and, as well, learn lessons from what has tragically happened in London. I obviously look forward to that meeting with CEOs and industry leaders and we will continue to work together to keep not only our economy strong but our people safe and secure from the threat of terrorism. There is another matter, Mr Speaker, that I know you and honourable members are very much aware of, and that is that I asked ASIO for advice on whether there were currently grounds in Australia for listing the organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir. ASIO has advised me that at present there is no basis under current legislation for specifying Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code. As I understand it, Hizb ut-Tahrir members overseas have called for attacks in the Middle East and Central Asia, but here in Australia it is not known to have-and I use these words deliberately-planned, assisted inin or fostered any violent acts, which are the current legislative tests under the Criminal but Code for proscription. At this stage the government is not aware of any information that Hizb ut-Tahrir is connected to the London bombings, as has been suggested elsewhere. The Criminal Code required that for a group to be specified as a terrorist organisation it must directly or indirectly engage in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. Under this act, in addition, there are separate offences for inciting a terrorist act. However, it remains of concern that some Hizb ut-Tahrir elements have called for attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and the United States and Israeli interests elsewhere. More generally, Hizb ut-Tahrir espouse a very extreme and radical agenda. I can confirm that my department is reviewing the proscription provisions contained in the Criminal Code and looking at some possible ways to strengthen those provisions. Until I receive that advice and have considered it, I am not prepared to comment on whether this group or any other may be listed in the future. World War II Commemorative Medallion",125
112,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Can the minister confirm that her department has sent out letters to veterans and widows informing them of their eligibility to apply for the World War II Commemorative Medallion? Can the minister explain why her department sent letters to veterans and widows who have been deceased for some time and in one case to a person who died 27 years ago?,126
113,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-There are some 300,000 veterans and war widows who are on the database of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Of those, there are a small number who for various reasons are no longer eligible for benefits-perhaps their assets have increased and hence they no longer receive a service pension. But they remain on our database because they are a veteran or a war widow and it may well be that their assets will fall in value and they will again become eligible for an entitlement. However, it is up to the family of those who may decease in that time to advise the department that they are no longer to be kept on the database. Ms Hoare interjecting",126

118,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister explain how the Howard government has invested in Medicare to make a good system even better? Are there any alternative policies?,126
119,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly do agree with the member for Deakin that the government has made a good system even better. Since 1996 health spending has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget. Since 1996 federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product. This year the federal portfolio of Health and Ageing will spend $44 billion. But it is not the quantity of the spending, it is the quality of the outcomes that counts, and that is attested to by the fact that all the state Labor premiers and chief ministers have unanimously agreed that Australia has one of the best health systems in the world.",126

Labor's policy is to oppose every saving measure and to support every spendsent ing proposal. Every day the member for Lalor goes out and does a doorstop because she knows the Leader of the Opposition will almost never allow her to ask a question in this place. These doorstops are always shrill, they are usually personal and they are consistent only in their inconsistency. The member for Lalor has been talking for months about the need for sustainability in the PBS. Earlier this week it was revealed that the rate of growth of PBS spending had declined sharply. What did she do? She did not come out and say, ‘That's great.' She said, ‘The government has to investigate whether its policy of increasing copayments has put too big a burden on people needing medicine.' The increase in the copayment only happened because the opposition voted for it. Increasing the copayment was notMs Gillard interjecting",126

What you cannot do is support a policy, criticise its consequences and claim any shred whatsoever of economic credibility. Let me remind the member for Lalor that constant calls for reform are not a health policy. Accusing people of being liars is not a health policy. Continuing to support Medicare Gold is not a health policy, given that the President of the ALP calls it a ‘turkey'. What we have in the opposition is a Leader of the Opposition who never even mentions health and the member for Lalor and spokesman for health who is not allowed to ask questions about it in this parliament. Is any wonder that the people of Australia have concluded that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had? Returned Services League",127

126,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Marked-up Legislation",127
127,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Yesterday, the member for Chifley and Chief Opposition Whip directed a question to you, which you invited me to follow up. During the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee consideration of amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, the committee requested a copy of the act it showing additions and deletions proposed by the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. As the Chief Opposition Whip has noted, such mark-ups are not ordinarily prepared in the course of preparation of legislative amendments. On this occasion the Family Court was able to assist, having prepared an indicative mark-up for its own purposes over an extended period, and was able to pass this on to the committee to assist in their consideration of the exposure draft bill. I am pleased that the member for Chifley and other members found it helpful in considering the exposure draft. I have to say that preparation of accurate mark-ups of acts proposed to be amended would be a very resource intensive task. It requires people with specialised training and skills. Some of those skills exist in my department's Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing but the engagement of staff to prepare mark-ups of every act proposed to be amended, on a regular basis, would divert the officers from work on their customary tasks, which includes the compilation of Commonwealth statutes to ensure the accuracy and currency of our statute books. Given the remarks of the honourable member for Chifley and his appreciation of the assistance provided by the family law indicative mark-up, I have asked my office to consider preparation of mark-ups for legislation that is complex. They will do so on a case by case basis. I will consult with ministerial colleagues on the matter as to whether or not they are prepared to assist in identifythis point. ing suitable personnel to do it in the case of other legislation as well.  Speaker, I thank the Attorney-General for his response. Rulings",127
128,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. I am mindful of the time, and that there is some further work for the House to get through. Could I ask you to reflect over the coming few days on a series of rulings you have made yesterday and today? Yesterday I asked a question of the Treasurer. I asked him to comment on a speech made by the Minister for Health and Ageing. You allowed that question without comment. Yesterday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training a question which included a quote from Senator Barnaby Joyce. You commented that questions should not contain references to other members, and you made a similar comment today when the Leader of the Opposition had a question which also referred to Senator Barnaby Joyce. Can I indicate, with the greatest of respect, that on the surface there appears to be some inconsistency in these rulings. Whilst I accept that House of Representatives Practice directs members not to make inflammatory or critical remarks of other members in questions, it does not go to the point of examining by way of question, difference in government opinion or the opinions of government members and we must, as a an opposition, be able in question time to ask ministers about apparent divisions within the government on critical policy questions.

130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for her question. As she would be aware, the practice does make it clear that ministers are not obliged to respond to colleagues' statements. However, in a case where a minister has made a statement in reference to financial matters, if the question is about financial matters then clearly the Treasurer would be the minister responsible. Having said that, I will be happy to look at the questions for the member and give a more detailed response.",128
131,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I would like to indicate my gratitude to you for that. I would like to make a comment and ask you to consider it also. There is a difference between the way in which a minister chooses to frame his or her answer and you appearing to rule that section of the question out of order. I think that is the distinction that perhaps needs some consideration. Thank you.",128

Question agreed to. NA Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate",129
141,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I am pleased to advise that on 28 July the government, along with our counterparts from the United States, Japan, China, India and South Korea, announced the formation of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. The partnership brings together for the first time key developing and developed countries in the region to address the challenges of climate change, energy security and air pollution in a way that is designed to promote economic development and reduce poverty. The partnership represents a significant achievement for Australian diplomacy. Australia played an instrumental role in attracting regional countries to the concept and in drafting the partnership vision statement. The partnership also represents a new way of approaching global environmental challenges. It is reflective of a mindset that appreciates that such issues cannot be looked at in isolation. It recognises that economic development and energy security are legitimate national goals and that actions to address climate change should complement rather than frustrate the pursuit of these goals. It an approach that values results and eschews ideology. This partnership is a regional grouping of great significance. The six founding partner countries, taken together, constitute 45 per cent of the world's population. They account for 49 per cent of the world's energy consumption and are responsible for 48 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Working together, this group can have a significant impact on global approaches towards climate change. By every measure, this group is a larger and more significant collection of countries than those countries that have binding emissions targets under the Kyoto protocol-the so-called annex I countries. These annex I countries-worthy as they are-together account for only 13 per cent of the world's population, 36 per cent of the world's energy consumption and 32 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Importantly, the partnership is intended to complement, not replace, the Kyoto protocol. Indeed, most of the partnership countries are signatories to the Kyoto protocol, and Japan is an annex I country. All of the partnership countries are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Four of the partnership countriesJapan, India, China and South Korea-have ratified the Kyoto protocol, and Japan has binding emissions targets under Kyoto. Other Kyoto countries have welcomed our initiative. The British environment minister, Elliot Morley, describes the partnership as ‘a welcome step forward'. The British Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King, says, ‘It is very much in line with what we have been trying to do.' The Canadian foreign minister, Pierre Pettigrew, says, ‘This is progress.' The head of the Swiss environment agency describes it as ‘a complement to Kyoto and is perhaps a good preparation for the time after Kyoto'. The German environment minister states that the partnership will ‘support international cooperation on climate change'. I note, by the way, that the Labor Partythe federal opposition in this country-is not so enthusiastic. When asked about the partnership by a journalist, the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘It is nothing.' The opposition spokesman on the environment, the member for Grayndler, put out two press releases in response. One of them was titled ‘Secret climate pact more spin than substance' and the other was titled ‘Climate pact spin and hypocrisy'. His reaction to the announcement was to say the ‘regional climate change pact is little more than government spin'. Of course that is a reflection on Japan, China, India and the United States. Bearing in mind that the member for Grayndler would not know very much about those countries, this simply rebounds and reflects the vacuousness of the press releases and the fact that it is just a party political point-scoring operation. We disagree with those so-called comments-as, of course, would the other governments that have signed up to the partnership. How could a regional climate change partnership that accounts for 50 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, has been welcomed by Kyoto signatories and is committed to finding growth-friendly solutions to climate change be dismissed as simply ‘spin'? I hope the Labor Party change their mind. I hope they do not let their ideological fixation with the Kyoto protocol blind them to practical, cooperative initiatives designed by a range of countries to address climate change. Australia, despite having decided against ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, is one of the few countries actually on track to meet its Kyoto emission target. Our emissions in 2003 were only 1.1 per cent higher than in 1990. Over the same period, the Australian economy has grown by 50 per cent. Per dollar of real GDP, we have reduced emissions by 33.4 per cent. Although we are on track to meet our target-something that very few Kyoto annex I countries can claim-we have never been afraid to state plainly that Kyoto does not and will not work. Even if emission targets are met-and this does look highly unlikely on current projections-Kyoto will see global emissions in 2010 increase by 40 per cent from what they were in 1990, when without Kyoto they would have increased by 41 per cent. One per cent is better than nought per cent but one per cent is not a solution to the problem. Developing countries-those expected to account for over half of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2020-have no Kyoto targets and are, quite understandably, not willing to sacrifice economic growth to negotiate them. Kyoto is not driving the technology response needed to properly address climate change. In fact, its existence encourages the relocation of emissions from one country to another with no overall net greenhouse benefit. The importance of developing country participation can be illustrated quite starkly. Australia accounts for only 1.4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Even if Australia took the alarming step of closing every power station tonight, China's industrial growth is so rapid that the greenhouse gas savings made by this hypothetical gesture would be replicated by China in just one year. A long-term, effective response to climate change needs to be one that includes all major emitters. It needs to recognise and acknowledge the fundamental importance of economic development for global security and stability. It needs to address properly the world's energy needs. It needs to recognise that a realistic climate change policy cannot be anti growth. And it needs to have technological development, cooperation and deployment as its centrepiece. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate does all of this. It is a technology focused, pro-growth approach to climate change. It is about substance rather than symbols and results rather than rhetoric. Policy integration will lie at the heart of the partnership. It will not seek to address issues in isolation from one another. Through the partnership we will find ways to meet our energy, climate change and air pollution challenges in practical ways that promote economic development. The partnership takes account of differing national circumstances. Each country has national strategies and goals to address climate change, energy needs, air pollution and economic development. The partnership provides a framework for international cooperation to support these goals for mutual benefit. It will not be seeking to impose arbitrary targets, mandatory policies or artificial time frames, which in any case probably would never be met. The partnership will sensibly put technology cooperation front and centre. International consensus appreciates the pivotal role of technology to any solution on climate change and energy security. The role of technology has been recognised at the recent UK Energy and Environment Ministerial Roundtable in March, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change seminar in May, the International Energy Agency ministerial in May and the recent G8 Leaders Summit in July. Through the partnership's vision statement, we have identified many areas for potential technology cooperation, including clean coal, agriculture, carbon capture and storage, renewables and civilian nuclear power. We will also use the partnership as a forum for policy dialogue, canvassing policy issues such as best practice climate and energy policies, barriers to technology deployments, standards and performance measures. We will also be discussing financing mechanisms. I am pleased to inform the House that Australia will host the inaugural ministerial meeting of the partnership in November. Foreign, environment and energy ministers from the founding partners will be invited to build on the vision statement by articulating a charter program and a work program. The formation of the partnership represents a new model for addressing climate change. The ministerial meeting will be a start. There will be no claims of a quick fix-and no setting of phoney arbitrary goals or time lines that probably would not be met anyway-and noone with a serious understanding of climate change could honestly pretend there is any such thing. But we do anticipate that the Australian meeting will begin a long-term, practical collaboration that will promote lowcarbon technologies, reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of our economies and put us on low-emission growth trajectories. I urge the House to support the partnership. I present a copy of my ministerial statement.",129

144,Mr ALBANESE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Grayndler) (3.44 pm)There is no doubt that avoiding dangerous climate change is the most significant environmental challenge facing the global community. Unfortunately, the minister's statement highlights once again the failure of the government to take serious action to address climate change. Today we have seen more spin and half-statements but no objective, no target, no funding and no mechanism of achieving it. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is a positive move from where the government has been. I thought that finally the climate sceptics within the government had been isolated as the flat-earthers of the 21st century. It was only on 16 February that the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources said: Whether or not those emissions are causing climate change, I don't know ... If you go back across history, millions of years, carbon-dioxide levels go up and down and global warming comes and goes. I mean, the Earth is a lot warmer than it was when the glaciers formed. But has this view actually been sidelined? Just this week the Minister for the Environment and Heritage disputed in sworn court documents that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming. EDO's solicitor, Kirsty Ruddock, said she was surprised, given the government's rhetoric on climate change in recent weeks: We thought that with some of these issues there was no scientific debate these days. It appears that there is. The statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is welcome in that it at least recognises that some of the time a majority of the government recognise that climate change is happening. This partnership is similar to agreements being formed around the world. Indeed, the orpartnership agreement itself acknowledges this when it states that it aims to ‘build on the foundation of existing bilateral and multilateral initiatives'. That is one of the disagreements that we have with the government. In our foreign policy Labor believe in multilateralism. We believe we must be a part of international action and engage with the world in a cooperative manner. Of course, the exchange of research and cooperation, particularly in new technology, is positive. This is occurring between all countries involved in the UN framework. It was acknowledged at the G8 summit in Gleneagles. It is occurring in meetings between China and the EU and between India and the EU. The government's failings were reinforced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs-we can accept that-but today the minister again attacked the Kyoto protocol. He stated, ‘We have never been afraid to state plainly that Kyoto does not, and will not, work.' This completely ignores the fact that it was the Howard government that signed the protocol in 1997and that the Prime Minister said then that the protocol was ‘a win for the environment and a win for Australian jobs'. The minister's statement skates over the fact that four of the six partners have ratified the Kyoto protocol. It ignores the fact that 140 countries have ratified the Kyoto protocol. The rhetoric contradicts the conclusion of the partnership vision statement: The partnership will be consistent with and conbeen tribute to our efforts under the UNFCCC and will complement, but not replace, the Kyoto He quoted the Canadian foreign minister without looking at what he really said. The Canadian foreign minister, Pierre Pettigrew, said: When you want to complement something, you recognise that the real substance is somewhere else. He got it exactly right, because, if the six countries in the partnership are a sixpack, then Kyoto is the whole slab. It is the main game. This is a minor part of real international action. A total of 140 countries, including Japan, Korea, China and India, have all signed up. In his statement the minister selected numbers. He spoke about category 1 countries as if they are all that is involved in the protocol. What occurred, of course, was that developing countries, led by Australia in 1992 at Rio and in 1997 at Kyoto, said that the industrialised countries had to take the lead and get the targets in the first period from 2008 to 2012. The fact is that the Kyoto protocol has signatories who emit three-quarters of the world's greenhouse gases. Only the US and Australia are on the outside looking in, and there is huge criticism from Europe and within the US of the Bush administration's position. Senior Republican Senator John MCCain stated: The pact amounts to nothing more than a nice little public-relations ploy. It has almost no meaning. They aren't even committing money to the effort, much less enacting rules to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. David Sandalow, a former US State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution, said: It's a great line-up of countries; I just wish they were doing something serious. Basically these kind of technology-cooperation partnerships have around for years. This seems to be nothing but a repackaging of existing technology partnerProtocol. ships tied up in a bow. Readers of the minister's statement might believe that developing countries are not engaged. They are. China was the first country to register a project under the Kyoto protocol's clean development mechanism. Under the clean development mechanism both China and India have developed car emission standards far superior to those in the US. Make no mistake, they are engaged in the Kyoto protocol. Australia, however, cannot participate in the CDM process and gain carbon credits for investing in developing countries because we have not ratified the Kyoto protocol. The essential difference between the Kyoto protocol and the Asia-Pacific pact, now that the climate sceptics have been isolated, is the attitude towards the market. How do you drive the development of new technology? Kyoto recognises that emissions trading is the most efficient market based mechanism to drive that change. That is why targets and performance indicators are so important, not just in the business of climate change but in every business-otherwise you are just fluffing around at the edges. BP saved $US650 million by implementing an internal emissions trading system. The market sceptics argue for a voluntary approach without targets and without any mechanism to drive change-and we heard the rhetoric here again today. There has not been so much scepticism about markets since Marxist summer schools stopped meeting in the sixties and seventies. It is extraordinary that from a conservative government comes this absolute fear of a market based mechanism to drive this change. The Asia-Pacific pact places a huge reliance on technological development; the minister's statement makes no bones about that. Relying solely on technology to deal with greenhouse emissions is like trying to empty a puddle while the tap is still running-you simply cannot do it. But do not take my word for it. On the Insiders on Sunday, 31 July, the Minister for Foreign Affairs forgot his notes. He acknowledged that price signals were important, totally in contradiction to today's rhetoric. He said that to achieve cuts to greenhouse gas emissions ‘we'll have to investigate price signals coming from energy'. That is what Kyoto does, and you can only have two forms of price signal: market based emissions trading or a carbon tax. Perhaps that is what the minister was talking about. The foreign minister talked about the International Energy Agency as though it endorsed the government's position. But, two days ago, the International Energy Agency released a report condemning Australia's spiralling greenhouse gas emissions and calling upon Australia to introduce a domestic emissions trading system. The government's own report, Climate change: risk and vulnerability, released just days before the announcement of the Asia-Pacific pact, showed a frightening picture of Australia in 30 years: 20 per cent less rainfall; 20 per cent less runoff into the Murray-Darling; an increase in extreme weather conditions, including cyclones, floods and prolonged droughts; risks to our coastal areas, where most Australians live; and the risk of the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics of North Queensland and Kakadu disappearing. But the government argued that there was no cause for alarm-we could be relaxed and comfortable. Labor believe this is a call to action. We will not leave the responsibility for this to our children and grandchildren. That is why we will ratify the Kyoto protocol, increase our mandatory renewable energy target, introduce a climate change trigger under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and, most importantly, have a national emissions trading system to drive that technological change, which we all agree is important; it is a matter of how you get there. The government does not have a path to get there. What it has is a smokescreen to pretend it is doing something while it is ignoring this critical challenge. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Nairn) adjourned. NA Country of Origin Labelling",132
145,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Corio proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to introduce fective country of origin labelling. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesMr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (3.54 pm)-This matter of public importance today deals with a spectacular failure of policy by the Howard government. Today a tractor convoy of Tasmanian farmers reached Parliament House after many weeks on the road in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. Those farmers undertook their long journey throughout rural and regional Australia to pursue a very simple objective: to secure accurate and comprehensive country of origin labelling of fresh, packaged and processed fruit and vegetables. It is not a big ask, you might say, from an Australian government that has consistently walked away from delivering key promises to farmers and their families. Country of origin labelling is simply one of those promises. I congratulate Matthew Ryan, Richard Bovill and all the farmers and businesses in rural Australia on playing their part in elevating this issue in the minds of the Australian people. I addressed the rally that was held in Shepparton and, of course, there was a large turnout there of farmers, workers and business people concerned about this issue. My colleague the member for Ballarat addressed a big rally in her electorate, because, as we know, this issue is very important to workers and farmers in Ballarat. Today the Leader of the Opposition addressed the rally outside Parliament House. With the Leader of the Opposition I met with farmers, unionists, businesspeople and community leaders in Devonport last week, where they made no bones about their disappointment with the efcoalition and its members to get some action on this issue. I say to Richard Bovill and Matthew Ryan: yours is a unique struggle, one which goes to the very heart of what Australia is today and what it wants to retain in the way of its economic independence tomorrow. With farmers in this struggle are over 60,000 people employed in the food industry in this country. As we heard today at the rally outside Parliament House, unionists and rural businesspersons, along with representatives from state governments and local communities, have joined with farmers on a very simple quest-to get truth in labelling in this country. This is a matter of great public importance to farmers, to process workers, to small business in rural areas and to rural and regional communities generally. It is also of critical importance to Australian consumers. There is a very simple economic principle in this piece of public policy. Farmers who gathered today are not about protection for their businesses. There is a very simple economic proposition, and you can read it in any year 11 textbook. It is simply this: the consumer in the marketplace is sovereign, and to exercise that sovereignty they need full knowledge and information when they spend their dollars. Their simple request to the federal government-which neglected them for nine long years while they sat on their hands and failed to deliver one simple proposition-is that, when consumers go to buy their fresh fruit and vegetables or their processed food, they want, at the point of purchase, correct information as to the country of origin of that food. We on this side of the House do not intend to let this minister backslide again out of the commitment that the National Party made in 1995 for truth in country of origin labelling. It was a clear commitment. You do not have to be some new dummy in the Senate to not understand what the commitment was. On 31 January 1995, the coalition shadow minister for consumer affairs, the former minister for agriculture, said: The coalition enthusiastically supports the concept of truthful country of origin labelling. He went on to say that the coalition believed in country of origin labelling and stated: Consumers want to buy Australian, and they have a right to know that the products that they buy are indeed Australian. Therefore, country of origin labelling ... has its genesis in a worthwhile objective. You cannot get it any clearer than that. But the simple fact is that for the nine long years of the Howard government we have seen virtually nothing happen in this area. If I can regurgitate the simple plea of farmers out there today to the minister; it is a plea, a simple statement. I guess I am an Aussie Rules man so I will use the words of the great John Kennedy: do something! After nine long years, Minister, do something. You have had your chance. We all know the reason why there has been inaction on this: the National Party in this parliament are really just a bunch of backsliders. Ms Hoare interjecting",134

But we know of the backsliding that has been done by these National Party ministers in government over a long period of time. Farmers in this country want the National Party to muscle up on this issue. We want you to muscle up on it, spine up on it, and we want you to introduce mandatory country of origin labelling. We want you to resist the big end of town when you do it. But we know that the National Party and this minister probably will not do that, because we know that the minister is about as firm on this issue as a ripe tomato that has been out in 100-degree heat for about three days. We know you will not deliver, Minister, and we are watching with interest what is happening in the Senate. There are gaping holes in the labelling laws that you could drive a tractor through, and after nine long years you say you are going to do something about them. Farmers have waited and waited, and you have talked and talked while you have done nothing, but this is one issue we do not intend letting you backslide out of, Minister. The government might have backslid on the commitment of the government and the National Party to the sugar industry when it was dropped off the FTA. The National Party may be backsliding on the sale of Telstra. We know already that the National Party has backslid on the mandatory retail grocery code of conduct. But this is one issue that farmers, others will not let you backslide on. Minister, you have a big chance here because there was a collective sigh of relief when the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the member for Wide Bay, was ceremoniously dumped from this portfolio. We saw under the previous minister the live exports fiasco, the collapse of Australia's quarantine arrangements and the absolute confusion in drought administration. Farmers were glad to see the back of him. When the current minister got the job, Australian farmers were hanging out for the fact that they might get a Braveheart. But with the minister's performance already in this House, and his performance today, we know they did not get a Braveheart-they got a blowhard. You will have to muscle up on this one, Minister. No amount of weasel words are going to get you out of the fact that you now have to muscle up on country of origin labelling. We know there is a bit of muscling up being done over in the Senate by the National Party, by Senator Joyce. We on this side of House really do not know Senator Joyce from a bar of soap. We can only take it that he is an honest and dedicated member of the National Party. There is some confusion in the government ranks about Senator Joyce. I have been reading what they have been saying about him. The member for O'Connor called him ‘a dopey so-and-so', but as Paul Keating, former Labor Prime Minister, would say, ‘That's like getting mauled by a dead sheep.' There again, the member for O'Connor said he is ‘a dopey so-and-so'. The member for Leichhardt said, ‘He must have been on another planet 10 years ago.' So he is saying that he is an extraterrestrial. I have the article here that will tell us what the Treasurer said",136
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am just wondering what this has to do with country unionists and of origin labelling. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-We want Senator Joyce to muscle up on the labelling issue, and we want the minister to do so too. ‘Costello's warning to Telstra cannibals'the Treasurer regards him as a cannibal. We know what he is not because here, there and everywhere we have Senator HeffernanMr Martin Ferguson-Wild Bill. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-Wild Bill, saying, ‘Everybody knows I'm not a pansy and neither is Barnaby.' So we know what he is not: he is not a pansy. But the Prime Minister is telling us what he is. The Prime Minister said, ‘He's a good bloke'-he and Wild Bill-‘They're both good blokes and they're both my blokes.' What we on this side of the House now know is that we can accurately define whom we are relying on in the Senate to pump through this country of origin labelling. We are relying on a senator who is a dopey extraterrestrial cannibal who happens to be a good bloke! Farmers and members on this side of the House are breaking their necks to meet this guy. We want him to muscle up on the issue of country of origin labelling. Minister, you might be a good bloke, you might be a cannibal and an extraterrestrial for all we know, you might not be a pansy-I certainly hope you are not-but muscle up on the mandatory labelling requirements, because farmers want you to. We know your party is already backsliding on the mandatory retail grocery code of conduct. It is an appalling situation when, before the election, the government made a commitment to farmers on the mandatory retail grocery code and then the Leader of the National Party said at his first conference: I do believe that initially they should be structured as a voluntary code of conduct. You say ‘mandatory code', but your leader does not even want a mandatory code. He said: I think that the preference that we should take is that there shouldn't be intervention from government ... And: I think that the industry players should police that properly themselves. Mr Vaile also said: It is not government policy to support further regulation of the ... retail sectors. Minister, does that apply to the issue of labelling? Farmers want to know and so does the general Australian community. If your leader believes that governments should be out of this and that governments should not regulate, then where do you go from here? Muscle up! That is what we want. Spine up a little bit, and make sure that when this issue comes to the cabinet you do not roll over like a mangy dog. (Time expired)",137
149,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What a lot of rhetoric we have just heard in this matter of public importance. Might I just recap and inform some of the members on the other side of the House about the campaign. I have been one of the few people who has been involved from day one. Whenever there is a photo opportunity, what do we see throughout the country? These people arrive. Mr Crean-These people?",138
150,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On the other side, with a photo opportunity. For goodness sake, let us take a step back. This is about two issues: country of origin labelling and the multinational companies. On the issue of country of origin labelling, it has astounded me that the members on the other side of the House obviously cannot do their research very accurately. For a start, the majority of the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Ministerial Council is made up of Labor state health ministers. Have we heard one Labor state government coming out in support of changing country of origin labelling? No, they have been very silent. We have had the federal government actioning. In the space of three weeks with the Fair Dinkum Food campaign we have met with seven Coles executives in Melbourne, we have met with the CEO of MCDonalds and we have met with the processors. In the next few weeks there will be a round-table conference with the growers, the processors and the women in agriculture. Coles executives have committed to moving forward. MCDonalds, in a somewhat subdued way, have acknowledged that they made a mistake by signing a contract to buy New Zealand potatoes for the sake of 5c per packet of french fries. But what is of even greater concern is the knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition on this subject. We call him the alternative Prime Minister! In Devonport only a few days ago with the Fair Dinkum Food campaign-and I am sure the member for Corio will back this up-as people asked the Leader of the Opposition questions, he sat there with a glaze in his eyes and did not answer one question. Again and again he said, ‘Over to you, Gavan.' He showed a lack of interest, a lack of understanding, a lack of compassion and a lack of wanting to do something. An example, which we have just received, is the interview with the Leader of the Opposition on the Leon Byner program on 5AA today, which reveals a disturbing lack of knowledge about food labelling in Australia. Mr MCGauran-It was on 20 July.",138
151,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On 20 July-I apologise. This is an extremely important issue that affects every Australian, but I was astounded to read that Mr Beazley did not even know which organisation or jurisdiction enforces it: Byner: Enforced by who? Kim Beazley: Well, enforced by inspection. Byner: By who? Kim Beazley: Enforced by a ah, umByner: Which department? Which government? Kim Beazley: Well, the department in those cases would be those with the responsibility for the labelling, which would be the food and drug operation. So those responsible for the labelling should enforce it. It's not that hard. I mean, are only a couple of supermarket chains around here and they could do the job effectively. It is very clear from the transcript that Mr Beazley-and he is the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister-has no idea about this issue. The farmers acknowledge that there is only one group of politicians that is prepared to do something, and that is this side of the House. Mr Beazley: go back to school and do your research. It is appalling. We had thousands of farmers outside expecting to see some bipartisan action. Instead, what do we have? We have the Leader of the Opposition throwing an orange around in the air and behaving like a circus act. It is just so disappointing. What message did he deliver to the growers, to the processors, to the families or to the truck drivers? Let me remind the House that there were something like three kilometres of tractors there this morning. And what did the Leader of the Opposition deliver? Absolutely nothing-just a lot of rhetoric. Doug Cameron. It is just so disappointing when we have an issue of such national significance and all they can drive out is the same old rhetoric, the same old union drivel from 50 years ago. It is about time the other side of the House got with it and got in the 21st century. ‘What has this government done?' the other side might ask. We have spent half a million dollars in soil nutrition studies with Serve-Ag, who do world-leading cutting-edge research and development. We spent $1.3 million just in Tasmania on an agriculture college. This is what we call real deliverance of opportunities for farmers. We are talking about Northern Tasmania. Mr Adams interjecting",139
152,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is interesting to have an interjection from the member for Lyons. Where has he been on the topic of the techthere nical colleges? We had forums. He did not even turn up, but he is an expert on it. Go back and do some research on the farmers. Get with them! Where were you on the tractors, Member for Lyons? Mr Keenan-Other commitments.",139
153,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Other commitments. We have got a commitment. This side of the House has got a commitment from Coles and MCDonalds, the processors and the growers to get around the table and move forward. We will ensure that this industry moves forward. We cannot speak for the other side of the House because there is just political rhetoric. The practical people on this side of the House come from approximately 48 different occupations, and those on that side come from fewer than 10. We understand how business works. We have been out there, we have picked up rocks and we have picked up potatoes. We have had to be accountable for the money that went in our pockets. Mr Michael Ferguson-No ticket, no start.",139
154,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Absolutely. No ticket, no start. Let's screw the employer a bit more. Mr MCGauran-It's their philosophy.",139
155,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Their philosophy. Mr MCGauran-Thank you.,140
156,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Sorry. Mr MCGauran-Let's get it right in Hansard.,140
157,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, their side. After a meeting in recent times a definition was expounded to me when the Leader of the Opposition was trying to explain policy. He performed the same out here today on the country of origin labelling, which obviously he knows nothing about. This person said, ‘He needs to spend some time on a farm because he reminds me of a sheepdog in the back of the flat-tray truck: whenever there are some people on this side he will go woof, woof, woof and then move over to this side and go woof, woof, woof.' We have heard the analogy of the double side of the plank. This is classic today and it was a classic on 20 What is it today-11 August? So that was some 22 days ago and he is no further advanced. Mr Gavan O'Connor-You've had nine long years!",140
158,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The interjections continue. As my English teacher would say, this is pretty basic stuff. My science teacher would say, ‘Mark, this is not rocket science.' Mr Gavan O'Connor-So do something!",140
159,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We appealed to your side of the House in the ministerial council on 25 October. Mr MCGauran-Labor ministers!,140
160,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Labor ministers for health and Labor ministers for agriculture-where have they been in this campaign? Where were they in Devonport? Where were they in Melbourne? Where were they in Shepparton? Where were they in Ballarat? Where were they in Bendigo? Where were they in Mildura? Where were they in Sydney? Where are they today? Where are your colleagues, your state ministers for health and education? An opposition member-Where are your backbenchers?",140
161,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is rhetoric. Where are we? We have an embarrassment in Tasmania. There is a health minister called Mr Llewellyn. After all these years-you say nine years-it has finally got through to him. He put out a press release approximately a week ago-it might have been two weeks agoand he said, ‘Yes, we are looking seriously at that issue now and we will consider it in the October ministerial council meeting.' Mr MCGauran-Which we had to call!",140
162,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Which the honourable minister had to call. This side of the House is a delivering real progress. What are you delivJuly. ering? You do not even understand basic English. The council is made up of the state health and agriculture ministers. Have you been talking to them? Have you been out lobbying them? No, it is up to our side of the House to lobby your people for a productive outcome. People are sick and tired of these serious issues developing into political humdrum. It should not be the Left against the Right or the Right against the Left; it should not be the Greens against Liberal or Labor against Liberal on these issues. It just would be amazing if you had the mental capacity to put the issues above politics for once. Is that too much to ask? I absolutely think it is. You need to sit down and talk to the Richard Bovills of the world, the Matt Ryans of the world and the wives and women in agriculture and understand that they want solutions. That is what this side of the House is about. This side of the House is about finding solutions and delivering on election promises as in agriculture colleges, as in developing rural markets and as in from Tasmania's perspective-may I be a little bit territorial-the freight equalisation scheme. But what is the other side of the House continually coming up with? Rhetoric. Mr Beazley is well informed by inspection. By whom? Enforced by which department, which government? He does not even know how FSANZ, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, operates or that people from his own party's state governments are on that ministerial council. What an embarrassment. There is no wonder that people become so disillusioned out there in private industry. When it comes to it, whom do they trust? Whom do they believe? It has to be this side of the House. A government member-The Howard government.",140

164,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,141
165,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Food labelling-they still do not seem to get it, Minister, do they? still do not seem to understand that the ministerial council is made up of a health or riculture minister from each state and territory. And who holds those seats? It is Labor. It is your party. The Commonwealth has come out and said that it wants to strengthen and that it will strengthen and that there more announcements to be made. But what do we hear from you, Member for Corio? Your rhetoric. Mr Gavan O'Connor-You've had nine long years.",141
166,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You had nine years too. It is unbelievable, Minister. They just do not seem to get it. They have no policies whatsoever. Whether we are talking about food labelling, interest rates, unemployment or whatever, it is a no-brainer. You just do not seem to get it. Productivity in the last nine years has gone through the roof, whether it on the waterfront or whether it is in agriculture. But what will happen when the dollar turns? We will be there. We will make sure that this industry survives. What would you do? You would put them all on the dole queue. Then what would happen to our account deficit? It would blow out and industries would be absolutely lost. Mr Beazley does not seem to understand that you move forward by communicating with processes, with retailers and with the national and multinational companies. A government member-Partnerships.",141
167,Mr BAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Partnerships, as my good colleague behind me says. But you only seem to be interested in the cheap political shot. That is all that Mr Beazley delivered today. That is all that has come from that side of the House. There have been no productive ideas, no innovation and no direction of any kind-just standing up there and continually blaming the federal government for everything. Mr Beazley, what about the shadow They minister for agriculture, the member for Corio? He continues to lay the line that food aglabelling is the federal government's responsibility. There is joint responsibility; the states and territories are also involved. It is about time those opposite understood that B comes after A and C comes after B. Just get are on with it. Start lobbying the state governments and moving on.",141
168,Mr ADAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I am pleased to see you in the chair. The member for Braddon has taken some time to try to denigrate my leader for his words today. I find it really silly of him to go down that track. He makes statements like ‘no state government has given support to this campaign'. The Premier of Tasmania attended and spoke at today's rally. His government has contributed money. He has helped lead the campaign. He is and his ministers have visited these tractors all over the east coast; they have actually funded the campaign. The member for Braddon does not quite understand this campaign of which he is part. When the farmers do sit down with Coles and Woolworths, I certainly hope that they have someone better than you to negotiate for them. They will not get anything out of Coles and Woolworths if they have someone of your capacity to negotiate, because you would fail them greatly. They will need someone who can negotiate with a multinational company. They will need someone with some idea of what they are talking about-and you do not have any ideas. As my good friend Sid Sidebottom says, if you cut your toenail and throw a bit of it down in the red soil of the north-west coast of Tasmania, a foot will grow. That is what Sid says and it is quite true. It is great try and it grows great vegetables. It has great people, some of whom are great Tasmanian farmers. This has been a Tasmanian uprising. Tasmanians, when they get riled, do something about it. Tasmanian farmers have mustered their forces and set off on tractors to gain support from other farmers all over Australia to capture the nation's attention and to demonstrate a clear case for action on tighter, clearer national food labelling laws. I grew up on a dairy farm. I spent my early life on farms in rural Australia. I know what picking up spuds is about. I do not think the member for Braddon has ever picked up a spud in his life. He probably would not know what one looks like. He would not know the front end of a potato from its back end. These Tasmanian farmers are fair dinkum about getting clear national food labelling laws. They have spent the last couple of weeks touring through country towns on their way to Canberra. You do not have to look far to see that they have collected farmers on the way and these farmers are angry. I read in the Examiner recently that MCCains Foods dumped $2.3 million worth of local product in favour of imported chips. Sixty MCCain farmer-growers from Smithton to Longford, my home town, have had their contracts reduced by 10 per cent. That loss follows a 3c cut that occurred earlier in the year-and this is not the end of the story. MCCain potato growers chairman was quoted as saying that, in two years, frozen chip imports have increased from 8,000 tonnes to 33,000 tonnes. And this guy, who has come into the parliament only a short time ago, has not said anything before about this. Then there is the story of the brassica grower on the north-west coast whose 100,000 top cauliflowers were ploughed in counas worm food. It was in the paper this week accompanied by a photograph. The Premier of Tasmania was standing with that grower. I did not see you in the photograph, Member for Braddon. I saw the Premier of Tasmania standing there, taking up the challenge. That is four months work, just a 10-minute drive from the processing factory, that has gone down the drain. These are the points that these farmers are trying to make. The idiotic thing about all this is that Simplot paid the brassica growers an estimated $311,000 compensation as well as importing cauliflowers from overseas. How dumb is that? It is as dumb as the member for Braddon. These stories have been all over our papers and politicians from every side and at every level have got involved, yet it has taken the farmers themselves to highlight this absurdity and to seek some action by getting on their tractors and driving to Canberra. The member for Braddon ought to get behind them, instead of coming into this House and talking a lot of hooey and rubbish and trying to denigrate people, like the opposition member. This is really silly stuff. You have to learn to make the points that will help the farmers of the north-west coast-and you have failed to do so. I certainly hope they do not have you there when they are trying to negotiate with Coles, Woolworths or MCDonalds. I agree with Doug Cameron when he pointed out today at the rally that the food industry supports over 600,000 Australian jobs and some of these industries produce a trade surplus. He said that last year the Australian food industry exported $15.3 billion worth of product and imported $5.8 billion worth. The problem is that the $15.3 billion is dropping and the $5.8 is growing. Debate interrupted. NA",141
169,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Ernest Victor Emerson",143
170,Dr EMERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"On this weekend Australians commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and I want to use this occasion to pay tribute to a man who describes the early part of his life in these terms: I was born at Leichhardt, a Sydney suburb, on 9th November 1915 of the most wonderful mother in this whole wide world, a clever beautiful woman, always neat and clean who showed me all the love she could with her eyes for she was deaf and dumb and highly emotional. We understood each other perfectly, which is probably why I learned to read and write at a very early age. At five years of age I could converse talking on my fingers. My reading of the sign language was very slow but my lovely mother taught me to smile and to think and to be cheerful and to wander. She sheltered me and protected me because she needed me so much. That man was Ernest Victor Emerson, my father, who, later in 1939, joined the war effort, fighting in Europe. He was one of the first members of the armed forces to go to Europe and while fighting in Larissa in Greece in 1941 he was shot through the leg. That certainly slowed him down and he was captured by the Italians. After several months of what I would have to say was torture and starvation behind iron bars in a Greek prison, my father, Private Ernest Victor Emerson, was shipped to a concentration camp in Italy. Following the capitulation of Italy in the Second World War, he then thought that they would be released and would perhaps return to Australia or continue to fight. But he was wrong about that because they were put on trains and taken to a prisoner of war camp in Germany. During that time my father kept a diary, which my brother still has, and I have a copy of the diary here. I want to mention a couple of points that he made. He talks about the deprivation and the very harsh treatment, not so much of the Australians but of the Russians in particular, and the brutality that was displayed towards those in German prisoner of war camps. He then goes forward through the diary to 23 August 1944 and he reflects on three years of captivity in a prisoner of war camp. He says: Three years of unforgettable torment and torture, worry and indecision, broken only by some bright intervals, such as receiving of letters from home. My dad died in 1978 of a heart attack and it was pretty clear that at the rate at which others, his mates, were dying they too had suffered life-shortening trauma through the by Second World War. Many of them died very young. I do know, though, that dad would be amazed and very proud of the fact that his son is a member of parliament. He would not have been able to imagine that I could stand here on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and pay him this tribute. He was my great dad. New South Wales Government: Land Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (4.33 pm)-I would like to call the House's attention to yet another disastrous impact on the property values in Western Sydney and on the people I represent by the disastrous Labor government in the state of New South Wales. The Department of Infrastructure Planning and National Resources or DIPNR has turned areas of Llandilo and Berkshire Park in my electorate of Lindsay into a new zone called Landscape and Rural Lifestyle Zoning, which restricts the use of the land to green corridors, absolutely annihilating any value for the landholders of that land. If the state Labor government wants to be such a controller of developments then it should be acquiring the land equally from all landholders then drawing their lines for green corridors on it so that everyone in every suburb gets fair value and the current market value for their houses, rather than having this den environmental greenie-grabbing plan basically drawing a line arbitrarily all over the residential land in my electorate, tially affecting property values. This comes on the heels of a land tax introduced by the state Labor government that has been chaotic to understand, to collect and to pay. Every year we have seen changes in the way it is applied. At one stage we saw it applied right across every single landowner, regardless of the fact that some of them were battling families in my area struggling to pay for just a single investment property so that they could put away something for their superannuation and retirement. We saw the vendor's tax absolutely annihilate investment in New South Wales and we saw last year that the New South Wales employment growth was only 1.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in Queensland and 5.3 per cent in WA. The Labor government in New South Wales tries to say: ‘It's the federal governPolicy ment. It's the federal government!' If it is the federal government, how come Queensland and WA are storming ahead, and development, investment and jobs growth in New South Wales is lagging so far behind? It is because the New South Wales government does not know how to manage property. It does not know how to manage the financial sector and it certainly has no clue when it comes to stock investments and infrastructure spending. We have seen yet again the total failure by this New South Wales government to respect the property values of all landholders in New South Wales, particularly the battlers in Western Sydney. It is no wonder at all that the people in Western Sydney are voting for the likes of Alan Cadman, who spoke on this issue on Tuesday night, and Louise Markus, who spoke in the House last night, and I know I will also be joined by my colleagues hid- Kerry Bartlett, the member for Macquarie, and Pat Farmer, the member for Macarthur, on this issue of a huge strategy affecting substanhousing prices in our area. The councils involved are Baulkham Hills, Blacktown and Hawkesbury but, most importantly, the Labor dominated council of the Penrith city area has been totally silent on this issue. People affected in my area have had to find out and join with other councils and other protests that are occurring in this area on this very issue. The Penrith City Council are carrying out an extreme sleight of hand with their ratepayers; they are really abusing the privilege that Labor councillors have in terms of driving the direction of Penrith City Council. I urge the Penrith City Council to start taking action against the Labor state government and driving some change in the metropolitan strategy so that we see the land values of ratepayers in the Penrith City Council area protected and their future investments properly maintained in a rational and coherent investment policy along the lines of the economic responsibility that the federal government has shown. Country of Origin Labelling",143
171,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to finish off the speech I was making in the matter of public importance debate about the actions of Tasmanian and other Australian farmers in visiting Canberra today and rallying to bring to the notice of Australians and their politicians the needs of their industry. We were talking about the decline of the export vegetable and food industry and the rise of imports in that area. The food industry has huge potential for growth in Australia. If we do not get it right on labelling and endeavour to reverse the trend, we will not get that growth. Having a local, successful and viable industry will support many rural and regional farming communities and the many workers in that industry. We need to keep people in their communities and provide jobs and a decent lifestyle so that they can continue to feed Australians with the best fresh and frozen food available. It all comes down to giving people a choice-and if the labels, logos and promotion clearly indicate that it is grown and processed here, then consumers, us, can make the choice to buy the food and keep the jobs in Australia. So I agree with Doug Cameron and my leader, Kim Beazley, who said that at the rally today. I also agree that labeltion ling should tell us where a product was made and not have the very small print that I found once-I think I had been tipped off-when looking at tin of Edgell's tomatoes. It read: ‘When adverse weather conditions affect supply of our Australian crop, we seek the world's best tomatoes, harvested when sun ripened to perfection, rich red and full of flavour.' The contents were almost totally from the USA, but you really had to search to find out where they were from. I do not think that sort of labelling is what the Australian consumer wants and we should be getting rid of it. I do not agree with the Australian Food and Grocery Council which says that it is unworkable to require the identification of the source of all the ingredients. Manufacturers have to buy these ingredients from somewhere, so they should have all their orders marked and identified. All they have to do is sort out the labelling. Most of their print is set ready to go, so I cannot see that it would make much difference to the processes they use, but it would make a huge difference to the customers and consumers who are looking to buy their local produce. These are points that have to be taken up by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who talked a lot of rhetoric at question time today, and this is the job that he has to do with these groups. It is up to the federal government to come up with a method of sorting out this labelling issue and to stop blaming the states or laying it on the states. The federal government should come up with ideas and this minister really does have to perform. I like the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union's idea of having the supermarkets' own brands meet home-grown quotas and putting some funds into promoting the industry, as well as seeking to have a fair allocaof shelf space for Australian made products in supermarkets. Why can't we do that? It is so hard to tell where food comes from? Many people's eyesight is not so great at reading the very small print that they have on products today. A product of Australia should mean 100 per cent Aussie product. Anything else is a con. Parliamentary Prayer Network",145
172,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT,"Last night in this House the member for Port Adelaide, Mr Sawford, raised the issue of the Parliamentary Prayer Network. In his speech, he said: I collected a brochure from the Great Hall yestertrained day, and having asked your office, Mr Speaker, on Tuesday evening who had sponsored the use of the Great Hall for this event they promised back to me ... In his speech he also said that the members and senators who attended the Parliamentary Prayer Network conference conveniently omitted their names. I would like to record my name as one who attended that conference when my parliamentary duties allowed me to. I had a completely different out-take on the conference. This was a marvellous conference for anybody who did attend. It was held by the Parliamentary Prayer Network. The network is a group of churches and schools across Australia that prays for individual parliamentarians. They team up with a parliamentarian and a school. It is headed up by Pastor Peter and Lynne Klomp and their guest at the conference was the Reverend Cindy Jacobs from the USA. It was great to have Cindy there. It was an honour and privilege for me to be in the same room as Cindy Jacobs and people like John and Wendy MCNamara, who are from the local New Creation Church. In fact, as I sat down next to John he said to me, ‘You wouldn't be Gaye Broadbent's brother, would you?' He knew my sister some 40 years ago, but she has been Gaye Ford for 40 years. It is a small world. It showed me that our family-Peter, Joy, Gaye and me-have been standing with these people for nearly 40 years. I proudly stand with these people at that conference tonight. If the member for Port Adelaide wants to put me in a box with Cindy Jacobs, John and Wendy and the convenors of the Prayer Network, Peter and Lynne Klomp, I would be very proud to be standing in that box. Part of the conference was a presentation from the Canberra Grammar School Junior Boys Choir and Chorale. Cindy Jacobs, being a classical pianist herself and having choirs, was impressed with our local talent. The boys were sensational. Their ages were eight and nine. It was a very proud to get presentation in the Parliament House. I was also there when Margaret Court, former Wimbledon winner and great tennis player, thanked the Lord for the wonderful ministries that have come out of the USA to this nation. I thank the Lord too and stand with her on that. It was an honour to be in the room with her. This was a great conference and when the young band that was playing for the conference played How Great Thou Art it nearly made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The members of this House who have accepted Partnerships in Prayer with one of their local Christian schools were listed on the overhead screen throughout part of the conference. They were members from all over Australia. Sadly, the partnership that I have with the Chairo Christian College at Drouin was not listed and I will have to remedy that if they decide to come back to this House next year. Many members from both sides of the House of Representatives and the Senate were listed. The prophecies from Cindy Jacobs were a credit to her and to the presentation. They were positive about this nation-great positives. They used the words ‘the great south land of the holy spirit'. I say about what she prophesied over this nation: I will take that. This was a marvellous conference. It was worthy of the capital and the people that gathered there. It is a proud moment for me to stand here this evening and stand with those people. If they are the people I am being judged against then I am very proud to be judged with Cindy Jacobs. I hope her ministry tour in Australia goes well. Corio Bay: Extension of Gas Storage Facilities Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (4.48 pm)-I rise in the House today to express the concern of many of my electors in the seat of Corio about the proposal by Terminals Ltd to enlarge its capacity to store butadiene at its facility in Corio. This is a proposal that has received conditional approval by the EPA but is vigorously opposed by the City of Greater Geelong and residents in the northern suburbs of my electorate, as well as receiving widespread opposition throughout the Geelong community. The matter is now scheduled for a hearing before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which will meet on 18 August. That will be a seven-day hearing where over 97 objections to this facility will be heard. Those objections come from the City of Greater Geelong, community groups and individuals in the Geelong community. Community groups include the Geelong Community Forum, the Geelong Community for Good Life, the Geelong Environment Council and the City of Greater Geelong. All of these organisations vigorously oppose this proposal and there are many individuals who have laboured long and hard to voice their opposition and that of their fellow residents to this proposal. If I name some I know I will be leaving many out but I do commend Sue MCLean, Peter Linaker, Jack Moor, Margaret Lewis and other individuals on the north side and particularly Councillor Tony Ansett for his leadership in taking this matter before City of Greater Geelong and before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. During the Kennett era there was substantial community opposition to the relocation of the Coode Island facility to the Corio Bay area. At the time. I vigorously opposed that proposal by the Kennett government and I very strongly oppose this current proposal by Terminals Ltd to expand its facility in Geelong. At the time of the Kennett government there was a clear statement by the Geelong community of its opposition to that proposal to relocate Coode Island to my electorate. The community of Geelong is emphatic that it does not want the creation of a toxic dump on its doorstep. This community certainly does not want Corio Bay turned into Coode Island by stealth. This is a totally inappropriate development that ought to be rejected outright. This proposed development is just 1.8 kilometres away from homes in the north side suburbs of Corio, North Shore, Norlane and now Lovely Banks and it is about one kilometre from Geelong Grammar, which many students, right across the academic years, attend. It is time to respect the rights of citizens in Geelong to the quiet enjoyment of their residences and to raise their children in a safe environment free from the threat of a potential toxic poisoning of the air they breathe. These rights of citizens ought to be respected. There is already significant disquiet in Geelong about the performance of the Environmental Protection Authority in other matters. I have had alarming evidence presented to me of the accumulation of toxic materials causing widespread health problems to individuals in the Geelong area. I intend to have much more to say about these matters in this House at a later date. Put quite simply, Geelong residents, parthe ticularly workers and their families, ought not to have their rights in this matter put aside for the sake of high-income residents who have now moved into the Coode Island area in the Docklands precinct. The citizens of Geelong have a right to clean air. They are very concerned about the long-term safety of this facility and they are concerned that may well be the thin edge of the wedge, in the relocation by stealth of the Coode Island facility, which was attempted during the Kennett era, to the Geelong area. (Time expired). Taxation: Cuts Superannuation Surcharge",146
173,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"This has been a historic week in Australian politics. The coalition government, which was substantially and very confidently re-elected last October by the people of Australia, gained a majority in the Senate and therefore presented to the government with a majority in both houses of the parliament. It is also a very important week for the people of Ryan, for two reasons. I remind the people of Ryan about changes that will affect them. The tax cuts that were formally passed in the Senate this week will be of significant advantage to them. They were entitled to these cuts as July because the Commissioner of Taxation had published schedules which were passed by the Senate this week and I commend and compliment the Senate very warmly on that. It should be noted for the record that the Labor opposition had defeated these tax cuts twice in the Senate. It was an indictment on their policy position not to understand the importance of tax cuts to the people of Australia. The other thing that happened in the Senate this week, and which was important to the people of Ryan, was the abolition of the superannuation surcharge. This is very important to the people of Ryan and it is something which, in the years ahead, will go down in the history of national politics as a very significant initiative. The government has been seeking to reduce the surcharge for quite some time. We wanted to reduce it to 7.5 per cent and the this Labor opposition would permit the government to reduce it to a rate of only 10 per cent in the 2005-06 financial year. However, with the government having a majority in the Senate the surcharge legislation was able to be passed and now I can make the significant announcement to the people of Ryan that the rate is zero. The benefits will be enormous to the people of this country. There will be enormous benefits to the people of Ryan. Savings rates will be the key beneficiary in this country. I point out that the surcharge was introduced very reluctantly by this government because when we came to office in 1996 we faced a budget deficit of almost $100 billion, which meant interest payments alone were some $9 billion or $10 billion. Today $90 billion of that budget deficit has been repaid by the Howard government and there have been interest rate savings of $5.7 billion as a result of those payments. That affects every day people very much-not only people in of 1 my community, but people throughout this great country. Interestingly enough, the Leader of the Opposition was finance minister at the time of the economic mismanagement of this country. But I can assure my constituents, who very generously re-elected me last October with a substantial majority, that there is no shortage of ideas on this side of the House. There is no reform fatigue in the government ranks. Unlike in the opposition, where they are absolutely bereft of ideas, this side of politics is full of initiative and full of ideas. In the time allotted to me in the parliament today, I want to just touch very briefly on the importance of this surcharge being removed. The rate of national savings in this country is absolutely critical and removal of the surcharge will stimulate national savings. Also, the levels of individual superannuation savings will increase, we hope, substantially. The administrative complexity associated with the surcharge will disappear with its abolition. The extent of this advantage will be measured in the fullness of time but superannuation funds will hopefully increase at a faster rate as a consequence of this move, and that will be of enormous importance. Over the long term, increased superannuation benefits are expected to lead to less ance on the aged pension as Australians save for their future. I want to encourage Australians to take heed of that because it is something that is going to be very important for generations of Australians to come. The abolition of the surcharge will simplify the operation of the superannuation system. It will boost superannuation savings and, as I pointed out, it will provide enormous incentives to Australians to increase and develop their voluntary superannuation savings. (Time expired) Corio Electorate: Automotive Components Manufacturing Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (4.58 pm)-I rise in the few minutes remaining in the adjournment debate to raise another matter relating to my electorate that is of concern to the Geelong community. Recently an automotive components manufacturing company, Pilkington (Australia) Ltd, announced that it had lost a General Motors contract and that over the long term some 60 to 70 jobs could be lost in the Geelong manufacturing facility. It was only in 2000 that Pilkington invested some $55 million in state-of-the-art equipment in the plant. They received the cooperation of the work force in restructuring the operations of the plant and we were hopeful that over the long term employment levels in the company could be stabilised. The company has come under intense competition from overseas, as have other automotive component manufacturers throughout Australia. They have had to suffer the high value of the dollar and high shipping costs from Australia for their products. It was with concern that we received the news that these workers could lose their jobs. I received a representation from workers in the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union at Pilkington and we resolved on a course of action to try to encourage the state reliand federal governments to support them.",148
