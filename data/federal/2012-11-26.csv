Let us be very realistic about this, only three Sunfish which is a membership based organisation. talk about growing anger in the recreational having with Sunfish at the moment, it is the the closure of the Coral Sea. I did not hear government's closure of the Coral Sea. I did lack of any sort of science based on making the the minister for environment Mr Burke say the decision to close the Coral Sea.

It is not the problems we are problem we are having with this government and the member for Capricornia talk about this not hear her talk about the lack of science or the decision to close the Coral Sea.

So, if you experience extreme anger from recreational fishers the water, it will be because We went to the 2010 elections saying that to. We had a recreational fishing forum in recognised that the ability to go out the front recreational fishers in Townsville want it recognised not its enemy. There is no-one in North Queensland and dropping sticks of gelignite in the water recreational fishers doing. The Howard government established the green establishment of green zones. But the recreational of green zones off the coast of Australia has now is extend that to establish artificial reefs zones they have somewhere to go and can get yellow zone, where you would have no anchor fish those areas there. That is what recreational something positive from this government, and make it harder for the recreational fisher-because This government is prepared to sacrifice everyone black skivvy wearing, soy latte drinking Greenie can sit there and vote for them. All the way through this, we do support commercial fishing industry. Sunfish, as I left with 20 years of Labor mismanagement, uncomfortable to do. As I said before, when there-and you will see what the Newman government a very, very good picture. Sunfish is not organisation. As with everything else, it will and approach more people.

I in support of the motion from the member for this very important motion forward so that for Herbert for putting some truth in this debate. Finally we have a member of the opposition far away the Coral Sea is from Townsville. recreational fishers will not be affected because from Townsville. Thank you for actually saying how far it is from Redcliffe Peninsula shortly. I want to acknowledge the damage being done by the LNP and to voice my support for recreational electorate of Petrie, which is bound by beautiful Campbell Newman and the LNP government have 60 jobs from fisheries Queensland, front-line National Fisheries Research and Development LNP have also scrapped the funding for Sunfish volunteer program, slashed the fisheries observer program, restructured the Queensland boating based senior management support services. Campbell Newman has in his sights. The LNP program for commercial and recreational Seafood Industry Association. I know that locals in my community love to know that Sunfish have always stood up for the advocacy over the years. There are four LNP of them has stood up to Campbell Newman election promises by the Premier that the government would work with recreational fishers find that by 'enhance' the LNP really meant front-line services like fisheries officers positions first. I thank Minister Ludwig, Forestry, for his representations to the LNP forward to hearing an explanation for this local communities like mine. But it is not just LNP state members who Moreton Bay and Brisbane's northside also federal opposition over their recent scare campaign heard from the member for Herbert about the marine park. The federal Liberal Party were so that they even distributed incorrect maps out. On 14 November I was thrilled to hosts State School on the Redcliffe Peninsula, where fisheries minister took questions from residents the Liberals were right when they said that locals from now on. The answer was a resounding no, for setting the record straight on that occasion. travel over 400 kilometres from the Redcliffe not a lot of tinnies equipped for that journey. telling the truth about the marine parks and how I think the member for Herbert's words were that the Coral Sea is over 300 kilometres away that. It was a long time coming. I will get to to Queensland's recreational fishing industry fishers, particularly in and around my Moreton Bay. Just to recap, since his election cut $8 million from the fisheries budget, fisheries researchers and funding for the Corporation. But that was not enough. The Queensland, discontinued the Fishcare program, scaled back the freshwater fishing and fisheries patrol and rationalised Brisbane And it is not just recreational fishers that have also ceased the industry development fishing and cut $125,000 from the Queensland throw a line out in Moreton Bay and I do too. I right to do just that and I thank them for the state members across my electorate and not one on this issue. These cuts come despite prePublic Service has nothing to fear and that the to enhance their experiences. Instead we 'cut' and when the LNP said they would not cut they really meant that they would redefine the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and on behalf of recreational fishers and I look latest round of cuts, which are further damaging owe local fishers an apology. Fishers across deserve an apology and an explanation from the around the Coral Sea marine reserves. We rallies and protests against the impact on the desperate to con locals in my area on this issue throughout my community, until we caught them the Petrie community cabinet at Hercules Road the Prime Minister, environment minister and on this issue.

We stand by am very surprised that this motion has even here is a Labor government criticising a state in Queensland. The colossal amount of Labor managed to send the state broke in the middle ever seen. Such was Labor's track record for seeing their tax dollars wasted, they delivered for Labor. The reality for us Queenslanders is our beds we have to find $12 million just to pay left Queensland. That is $12 million a day, $84 over $1 billion a quarter, just in interest on a bit over three days in Queensland the money we just the interest on Labor's debt-could have Gracemere near the Capricornia electorate, or interest for Labor's debt to build a new statehave been used to build a new Rockhampton on paying interest on Labor's debt could have Highway in the Capricornia electorate.

However, the paper, like the government, substance. It is a paper that demonstrates again production and food producers in Australia. The problem is not complex; it is simple profit then the business closes, and frequently food producers in Australia. On the land we many of those doing the work cannot make Department of Agriculture, the broadacre return to capital of around two per cent over business world usually works on a minimum acceptable around 12 per cent.

This should be of significant and pressing the number of farming families with a negative income. So how does the government's green paper Well, it does not. The government never puts together in the 274 pages of the green paper-not viability and market access in that paper. Nor farm-gate price, nor return on capital. These sector.

Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (12:57): Can I member for Fraser has introduced this motion My gratitude also stems from the opportunity endured for many years. It gives me a chance Stockade was, and what it was not. It was entrepreneurs against an oppressive mining levy. The miners who defended the ramparts quintessential entrepreneurs. No-one exemplifies their leader, Peter Lalor. As my good friend out, he lost an arm at the stockade but that did of Australia's most remarkable political within the space of 11 months. In November 1855, he won election to the assembly the following principles of limited government Now to a few words about what the Eureka socialist uprising, like some try to claim in look to Peter Lalor's words afterwards. I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by Communism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical I am still, and will ever remain a democrat. Yet the member for Fraser apparently thinks Eureka Stockade was the inspiration for Utterly and unequivocally, as the words friend the member for MCMillan knows-in 1999 But my personal preference for an Australian countenance the deliberate distortion of Australian say thank you as a grateful nation for making the right decision to have been made. of another addition to the history of Eureka with forward to reading it. I understand, from history of the Battle of Eureka. This book joins John here as well-on this very, very important in the Ballarat goldfields back in the midthis motion to the House. It is a very the Eureka Stockade that it will be remembered and also very much part of this nation's live in Ballarat, we are very proud to have been where we have held the tradition and continue to Australian public. Again, I urge all members and will be most welcome-and have the new Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka say at the outset that I am grateful that the on the Eureka rebellion. It was a great moment. it provides to scratch a political itch I have to set the record straight about what the Eureka a tax revolt-an uprising by private sector of the Eureka Stockade on 3 December 1854 were the values of the Eureka rebels better than next to me, the member for MCMillan, pointed nothing to dampen his thirst for liberty. In one metamorphoses, Lalor went from mutineer to MP he entered the legislative council, and then year. Peter Lalor was an advocate for the in the Victorian parliament. Stockade was not. It certainly was not some a warped version of history. It is interesting to When challenged on his ideals, he wrote: the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or I am not now nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. press, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, otherwise, because his motion asserts that the the Australian Republican Movement. Wrong! from Lalor demonstrate. For the record-as my I voted 'Yes' to the republican referendum. head of state does not make me willing to history. The member for Fraser, I feel, has fallen victim to one of the great frauds in stems from the arrogation of the Eureka Stockade warped it beyond all truth or recognition. The Eureka uprising was a rebellion of capitalists, fighting for a progressive mining tax as the fighting against an arbitrary increase in licence And isn't this all so reminiscent of another mining tax? I will not go there for reasons only of time. These days we fight our battles with ballot decades we have watched the Eureka symbol be of the Eureka spirit. We see trade union yobs tactics of intimidation during workplace disputes. flaunting the law through their illegal blockade Geelong. Not too long ago we saw union yobs in downtown Melbourne. In 1854 the Eureka banner signified classical individual freedom and personal responsibility. Australian Labor Party excels at turning history symbols and tall tales designed to serve its partisan were alive today-he obviously would be very crane in sight to take back the Eureka banner the trade union movement.

One of the primary into the parliament is to address unresolved mischief.

Therefore, under successfully prosecuted for committing one these offences were committed either with sanctions regime also provides for an aggravated exploitation.

The Employer Sanctions provisions recalcitrant employers and labour suppliers. This bizarre-and it is absolutely bizarre-contradiction Howell report's recommendation.

On making a case that the extent of illegal workers Once again I return to the question: where is Mr Howells' report states that in 2008-09, Australia and, of those, only 990 were confirmed that up to 100,000 people were working illegally figures are purely speculative as they assume total labour force in Australia is some 11 report are accurate, that is less than 0.9 per the so-called 'burning bridge' just got higher. solutions and posing more unnecessary burdens about a number that is equivalent to 0.9 illegally, and I emphasise that there is no other regulatory overreach which has gone mad. parliament in addressing a problem that scarcely than adequately dealt with by the existing but where is the onus on people who are working recently, the department changed some of its working in this country just had to quote an for proof of bank records and payslips; that government have a pathological obsession with Speaking of employer groups, the government in drafting this bill. There have been various from, for example, the Australian Industry proposed changes in this bill to be: ... heavy handed and unnecessary. Imposing strict will not deter the small minority of employers or to engage cheap labour. Rather the proposed changes employers and labour suppliers. It is unfair that because of the illegal practices of just a very small few. In this context, the coalition opposes this remember their own 2007 red-tape reduction this one out even before it gets in. It is, burdens on businesses out there who already that has just increased under this Labor government. Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (16:42): response to the independent report of (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, conducted government was presented with the results of concluded that the extent of illegal work measures in place at the time were insufficient recommended the adoption of a range of recommended sanctions which encompassed both and strict liability offences with civil penalties the Howard government failed to act on these belatedly introduced legislation The 2010 review of these measures, conducted the existing Howard government sanctions were DIAC located 11,428 unlawful noncitizens into be working illegally.

We have heard about the onus on employers, illegally under this legislation? I note that proof of records. Previously, people who were ABN, but I understand now that they are asking is a very welcome move. But why does a Labor slugging employers in any way that it can? should not have been wasting everyone's time groups-according to the submissions received Group and various chambers-who believe the liability offences on employers and labour suppliers labour suppliers who already knowingly abuse the law will impact the unintended targets: i.e. good these persons be subject to high regulatory burdens bill, and I call on the government members to election commitment. One in and one out; throw again, an overreach imposing greater regulatory have to contend with a huge regulatory burden The bill implements the government's the 2010 review of the Migration Amendment by Mr Stephen Howells. In 1999, the Howard a review into illegal work in Australia which in Australia was a significant problem and that to address the problem. The 1999 report employer sanctions. Critically, the report fault based offences with criminal penalties as well as infringement notices. Unfortunately, recommendations. It was not until 2007 that it which provided for criminal sanctions. by the barrister Stephen Howells, found that wholly ineffective. These measure have not provided a practical mechanism to instil in deterrent to illegal work hire practices. Illegal Australia's migration program and can result conduct may also put at a disadvantage those entitled to work and it reduces work The Howells review recommended implementation modification, including graduated tiers of fault civil penalties and criminal offences. compliance by businesses, and when this does amendment in this bill will amend the criminal provisions for persons who: firstly, allow an unlawful non-citizen to a third person for work; breach of a work related visa condition; and person for work in breach of a work related compelling analysis and critique of the effectiveness with the problem of illegal work. It concluded increased markedly since the 1999 review, currently being employed without valid work down on employers who hire illegal workers penalties. The graduated system of sanctions will concern to those employers who seeks to amendments include: amending the criminal penalty provisions and an infringement notice unlawful noncitizen to work, or allow or refer related condition; creating statutory defences times to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement criminal offences and civil penalty provisions arrangement or series of arrangements that result entitlement; extending both criminal and civil officers of bodies corporate, partners in association's committee of management; and powers specifically to facilitate the investigation civil penalties. In order to address the illegal practices of illegal workers by various entities within offences and civil penalty provisions will be the chain of events that results in a noncitizen required permission can be held liable for related provisions. In addition, the bill will executive officers of bodies corporate, unincorporated association's committee of management introduces investigative powers to allow authorised breaches of the work related offences businesses the need to comply, nor acted as a work hire practices undermine the integrity of in the exploitation of vulnerable workers.

The Howells report provided a of the current framework for dealing that the prevalence of illegal work had with potentially more than 100,000 workers rights. This bill allows the government to crack by setting out a range of civil and criminal operate as a last resort and should only be of circumvent the law. The legislation's key offences and creating new, non-fault civil scheme for people who allow or refer an a lawful noncitizen to work in breach of a work where reasonable steps are taken at reasonable to work; broadening the application of to hold a person liable for participating in an in a foreign national working without lawful liability, in certain circumstances, to executive a partnership and members of an unincorporated creating search warrant and notice to produce of suspected breaches of these offences and sham contracting, informal labour hire and use of a conglomerate, the application of the criminal broadened so that a person who participates in being allowed or referred to work without the contravening work related offences and work extend both criminal and civil liability to partners in a partnership and members of an in appropriate circumstances. It also officers to gather evidence of suspected and work related provisions. To the extent that the government's employers, those arguments are likely to have strict liability offences will impose requirements employers, that it is not the responsibility that more time is needed, or that there will run throughout the Howard government years recommended by the 1999 review. The case ACTU as follows: It is not seriously contested that illegal work both for the illegal workers themselves, as well Australian citizens and residents, or overseas of illegal work … affects … those employers community. Major concerns with illegal work include:  employees employed illegally are more susceptible such as ill-treatment, safety concerns or under-payment  it has the effect of driving down local wages away local employment opportunities;  those employers employing illegal workers are such as industrial relations, OHS,  In the worse cases, it can involve labour The real issue then becomes what practical reduce and remove the impact and incidence employers who might be tempted to employ to ensure that those who do the wrong One of the more disturbing aspects of illegal people to Australia for exploitation in the sex and Crime Prevention Committee of the parliament trafficking for sex work, and its subsequent trafficked women on student visas is quite prosecutors working on trafficking cases have Australia on student visas.

The government states that the exploitation of illegal foreign workers. This is to be exploiting workers should be punished strict rules in 2007 to deal with just this detail of this bill that, far from achieving the sanctions proposed by the bill are so onerous that compliance costs on all businesses, the vast majority of which do the right thing. The majority of businesses do indeed do the right thing. Why is it significant that this will be question in more detail. The government, in regulation it brought in it would get rid of claimed that it would fix the problem of deregulation deregulation. But these issues are not Since coming to power the Labor government It introduced over 1,000 pages of new regulations period it removed fewer than 100 regulations. any sense of certainty, when the goalposts And what is the point of having a minister whose when all we see from this government is more Like all things this government does and says This brings me back to the bill before the of bureaucracy and another impost on hard working government has against Australian businesses? to do business in this country, not easier? environment is critically important to our tape will increase productivity and, in turn, nation-to thrive and grow.

It showed government regulation compared to 68th in worse the burden of government regulation, slumped from 40th to 80th in pay and productivity when the same report showed that Australia government policy and, most alarmingly, wastefulness of government spending to 48th. When you consider these trends it comes as country is on the slide. A recent Grattan Institute that since 2007 Australia has experienced a while the OECD average remains in positive on our economy but it does not bode well government should be doing everything it can address this emerging and alarming trend, increase the regulatory burden and ultimately business with more red tape so detrimental? minister himself acknowledged that the vast so onerous for businesses? Let us examine this coming into government, claimed that for every a regulation-a one-in, one-out approach.

In that same How can businesses be expected to plan, with are changed so frequently by this government? main function is to deregulate the economy, red tape, more regulation and more burden? one must look past the spin and at the reality.

We understand that removing red allow business-the wealth creators of this red tape represents four per cent of all business up to $12 billion to our economy.

The government may well say: what is one one more piece of legislation have? Let us make but one of a multitude of regulations introduced having an economic impact, has a human impact. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and national red-tape survey, and the results were businesses that responded said they were spending were just two years ago. Forty-four per cent and five hours a week complying with government for permits, reporting business activity at businesses is spending more than five hours surveyed spent more than 20 hours a week on regulation. This is time that could be better productivity enhancing or, as I said before, would be emotionally enhancing.

This legislation is an extra regulatory that are doing the wrong thing. It will further more regulation going to do? What effect will it abundantly clear: as previously stated, it is since 2007. Increased regulation, as well as Industry, ACCI, recently conducted their distressing. Almost three-quarters of the 870 more time on regulation today than they of businesses are having to spend between one regulations-filling out forms, applying a local, state or federal level.

Why, may I ask? this Treasury needs in its process of cooking scramble not that dissimilar to a poverty-stricken back of the couch in order to put a meal on the table. I want to share with you why the government debt and to the heart of this government's capacity all of the deficits since 1901, when Edmund 2007, it would come up to $123 billion.

Once again, what we are and the law so it is easier for the government not go through the details because I am running forth what the process is. This is changing industry. These changes should not be made in a and under proper scrutiny. They are enabling this What this government are trying to do justification for it is poor, because if they had years, like they have, there would be no need oppose this bill and be right in doing so. speak to the Treasury Legislation Amendment This is an extraordinary bill. The reason it this is a fig leaf to cover the Treasurer's rather that, as we know, inherited a budget billion in net savings, and as a consequence, decisions, has now squandered all of those assets put in place and has racked up over $140 of this Labor government's typical ineptitude government's inability to balance a budget, government spending like there is no tomorrow. being unfavourable globally, we have a policy decisions, are now facing a situation barrel of running another huge budget deficit. the biggest deficits in Australia's history. The have been so big is that we have had to that we are above average trend when it notwithstanding that we are in the part of the and sustained period of economic growth. out there promising so many things to so many very poor stewardship. That is why we have seen, for example, announcements with respect to and an announcement with respect to health funding. Because the government is staring down the government is desperately doing whatever it bill, the Treasury Legislation Amendment those that are no doubt going to be reading thumb their way through the pages of the member for Lilley, was thinking with this bill, that constituents in my electorate, on the Gold that has been adopted by someone who, in my ineptness but who, for some unknown reason, treasurer. This particular bill has a number of schedules on the first schedule. The first schedule to this unclaimed bank accounts. It reduces unclaimed seven years down to a period of inactivity money that is deposited into a bank account this bill now-of three years will be taken revenue. It is only through a high level of proactive money to consolidated revenue that they would also add an important qualifier-for them to principal plus CPI. Now contrast that with the fact that currently seven years. So the Labor government is moving years of inactivity, and the consequence is that some $660 million, basically half-in fact more Wayne Swan has this fig leaf that he dangles embarrassing budget deficit there. The member legislation to raise an extra $660 million. The point as well is that it does not allow and this is one of the proposals that the three bank accounts. They may, in fact, have the concept of an offset account. It is an opportunity loan borrowings. People will often leave redraw that money down so they get the benefit mortgage account but by the same token they on the mortgage account and can withdraw it almost beggars belief that the government capturing money in offset accounts as part of revenue, even though other accounts that are why the coalition has very reasonably said that not be rushed in this way. Australians should taken by a Labor government that is obsessed as quick a time period as it possibly can because the NDIS, announcements with respect to Gonski barrel of another massive budget deficit, this can to claw back revenue. So we get to today's (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill. To and enjoying the Hansard on this debate, as they Hansard, wondering what Wayne Swan, the let me make it crystal clear. I certainly know Coast, are very concerned about the approach view, is a Treasurer with a serious amount of others seem to herald as the world's greatest to it, but in particular I would like to focus bill amends legislation with respect to so-called bank accounts from a period of inactivity of of three years. The consequence of this is this: which has no activity on it for a period-under by the government and placed in the consolidated effort from the person who has lost that be eligible to get that money back. I would get that money back in terms of the original the existing threshold for account inactivity is it from seven years of inactivity to three there is a bottom line boost to the budget of than half-of the forecast budget surplus. So about, because he knows that there is, in fact, an for Lilley, the Treasurer, is amending the for changes in circumstances. Say, for examplecoalition is putting forward-someone had two or an offset account. People would be familiar with to park some cash to offset your home money in those accounts because they want to of offsetting the interest payable on their are not obligated to leaving that money sitting from that account at any particular time. It is so desperate for cash that it would look at its attempt to raise $660 million of additional attached to the offset account are active. That is the legislation should be amended. It should not have their money that they have worked for with getting as much cash as it possibly can in the member for Lilley, the Treasurer, is so desperate to prop up a budget that is eroding. government is turning its back on the coalition's sense. Amend the legislation so that individual individuals are looked at. If an individual has in to to, not individually. As I said, an offset could come up with. Another example of just how desperate this Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This government, attempt to prop up its budget bottom line. Bankers' Association in their submission to where they said: … the proposed timing for implementation and being in less than two months and falling during technology or IT systems changes. It is estimated months to make all the necessary changes, inform compliance requirements. That is what the ABA says. The situation is advice of the ABA, saying to banks, 'No, Because it is good public policy? No, not policy. This is done for one reason and one trying to grab as much cash as it can as quickly election year facing yet another massive budget Treasurer stand up and make claims: 'We've we've got an inkling; we've got a general plan some point.' What the government does not effectively steward the Australian economy problem is compounded when you see days like the fact that the government is spending an government talks and crows about its vision minister for FaHCSIA today during question obscene amounts of money on the NBN. The consequence of all of these factors is to be around $120 billion to the year 2020, of unfunded announcements by this Labor government net public debt-which saw the erosion of coalition government left to it-so that, in total, had to shoulder for the last five years has this government has. That is the legacy of the a prop to try to pretend that this is a government greatest travesty-the most shameful aspect government's inability to control its promises generations, the Aussie kids of today, who are this government has spent, money We see this situation arise where the amendment even though it makes perfect accounts are not looked at but rather three or four accounts, they should be looked at account is simply the clearest example that one government is is in the MYEFO, the Mid-Year in MYEFO, raced through this change in an This was a point made clear by the Australian the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations a commencement of 31 December 2012 is unrealistic, a period when banks implement freezes on any that banks and other ADIs will require at least six customers in a legally compliant manner and meet extraordinary. The government is ignoring the you must be compliant within two months.' Why? because it has anything to do with good public reason alone: a desperate government that is as it can because it does not want to go into an deficit. That is the reason why we see the got an aim; we've got a plan; we've got a vibe; to have a desire to reach a budget surplus at have is the discipline and the wherewithal to in a way that delivers a budget surplus. The today, when the Minister for Health heralds additional $4 billion in the health sector. The when it comes to the NDIS-as we saw from the time-and the government continues to spend that this government now has liabilities forecast all of which are unfunded. A further $120 billion builds on the already $145 billion of $70 billion of net savings which the former this glorious Labor Party that Australia has managed to spend roughly $350 billion more than Australian Labor Party. This bill is nothing but that in some way knows what it is doing. The of this government's spending spree and this and its spending-is that it is tomorrow's going to have to pay off the $350 billion that that it simply does not have. Consistent with past form of a government try to buy its way back into office at the next announcements without the funding, and now people's money away from them with only two raise $660 million as part of its attempt to deliver addition to that, in schedule 2 of the bill to three years the inactivity test for the first reduction which unreasonably increases the Australian Bankers Association at the brief Economics stated: … customers generally find these accountsthat is, first home saver accountsand the restrictions and conditions confusing. additional complexity, especially given the 4 such as term facilities and depositswe consider that any new unclaimed monies provisions satisfy the definition for inactivity.

White Ribbon Day is dedicated domestic violence against women, which is the in our community today. Domestic violence is throughout the world. Australia is no exception. protect victims and address the attitudes women, the statistics on domestic violence lifetime one in three women in our country will will experience violence of a sexual nature. week by her current or former partner. If that what is. These statistics should be quite chilling they become even more confronting when you that every woman that we know is vulnerable think of my wife, Bernadette, my daughter, Charlie, Maisie and Kiarni. For me that is the becomes very personal. With the females in my really resonates with me. I would like to encourage did, it might strengthen our resolve when domestic violence to flourish. Domestic violence and violence against issues facing our community today. Left flourish on an intergenerational basis. What growing up in abusive households are more is even more chilling and disturbing to me, and young women or girls growing up in an abusive abuser as a husband or a life partner. Then the four young people have witnessed violence lifetime, it clearly demonstrates how widespread In fact, domestic violence is even more prevalent electorate, than in the rest of the country because it being a low socio-economic area, an area the equation. It is also a very multicultural and behaviours that allow violence to continue, by 'I swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent of the White Ribbon Day by taking the oath and against women and their children, estimated to be taken, the cost will be an estimated $14.6 billion in many of us came together to celebrate each year is set aside to remembering and perpetrated against women and girls in the to raising awareness of tackling the issues of most prevalent form of violence that we have the single most widespread human rights abuse Although this country is doing much to underlying the continuation of violence against are simply terrifying. The fact is that in their experience physical violence and one in five It is also a fact that one woman is killed each is not a wake-up call to society, I am not sure for every responsible citizen in our country, but personalise them and acknowledge the fact to violence. When I look to personalise this I Elizabeth, and my three fabulous granddaughters, one in five; the statistic sits there.

When you consider that one in against their mother or stepmother in their this is as an issue in our community. in south-west Sydney, in the area of my of a couple of things. There is an issue about of great disadvantage, which probably comes into community. Many people who migrate are fleeing from violence and oppression themselves, and women and girls are treated. Cultural barriers make it significantly harder seeking help but also to get the message through domestic violence in our community is a crime-that, dealt with and more than likely you will go to through. We have to protect the victims and look abusers, we really need to articulate our Only last Friday I had the opportunity to speak I decided to check the level of reported cases discovered that from January through to now violence reported in Liverpool. In Fairfield Cabramatta there have been 797. In Green Valley a full year, but the stats are very high. When me that, of all the assaults that occurred in them relate to domestic violence.

Domestic victims and their communities but also has described the amount of work by the local police. the year 2021 would be the cost of domestic they estimate. Bear in mind that the cost of so it is not far behind it in terms of the overall eye to domestic violence. On Friday last week, I attended two functions to domestic violence.

In fact, I think they had around 300 people stalls and guest speakers, including Police acknowledge all the hard work the Fairfield event very significant. I would also like to thank Community Centre, and Dr Simon Emsley, perhaps some of that is manifested in the way to get the message through to victims about to perpetrators and potential perpetrators that if you commit this crime, you will be jail. That is the message we really have to get after them, but also, to abusers and potential stand on domestic violence in our community. at a couple of functions. Before I went there of domestic violence in my local areas. I there have been 2,079 incidents of domestic there have been 2,024 over the same period. In there have been 1,500. That does not cover I sit down and talk to the local police they tell each of those four police commands, 50 per cent of of police resources and doing something about to take into account that 50 per cent of all violence.

They talk about this so-called hospital in Daru. disgusting. To suggest that this is something well is an absolute nonsense, and a lot of report.

That is what with it that has not worked to give a voice to the the CCA, and Meat and Livestock Australia, the have been going through the motions of reform so far is that the Cattle Council of Australia, role or oversight role of the MLA, will I do not see how this is going to assist the representation of the producers. I will just Australia's history, from page 1: The Cattle Council of Australia-the I wish it was and it should be, but in Canberra know that it has not been the voice that it should for beef producers. Ask the local producers unkind, but they laugh when they read that. Cattle Council was not completely happy with the Industries and Energy, John Anderson, but is working success. The major advantage of MLA over its predecessors of how their levies are spent. That is not true. They are not in charge of model in MLA, which is a company, works means that. It goes on: In the past, other sectors, because they were forced say in outlays and programs. Then it continues: Cattle Council has new responsibilities on behalf of its operations and making a major contribution Council … And it says a number of other things. When they say, 'That's nonsense. That doesn't happen.' and my readings-and I have read all the annual the other bodies-that has not happened. Those the industry itself is saying that it knows it a voice is that it does not have a single united different sectors of the beef industry, but there common that it comes together on. We know what on those, and say, 'Here are the five key issues is what they are and this is what we recommend.' Do we hear it? No, we do not. We hear meetings going on lately with CCA and restructure committee. They had models put come to nought. People are disappointed. Some 'It will come to nought.' Others said, 'No, what they come up with.' The key issue is organisations and representation. Ideally that them and people are still waiting for them producers, what do they say? They talk about same prices they were getting years ago and then what the MLA have said about that. They say Others say differently. Economists say differently. know. There is not enough information. The read some experts from the Cattle Council of national voice for beef producersit proves that it has not been. All governments be here. They say they are the national voice what they think of that. I do not want to be In their history they talk about on page 4: MLA model determined by then Minister for Primary hard to make the new industry arrangements a is that producers are now totally in charge how the levies are spent. The way that the voting there is no way they could be in charge of to pay levies, had an equal, and at times dominant, of beef producers in advising MLA, keeping abreast to the proper functioning of the Red Meat Advisory you talk with producers and the local producers, They have not seen it. In my observations reports with CCA, with MLA and with all roles have not been fulfilled. It is clear, even does not have a voice. The reason it does not have voice. Yes, there are some separate issues in have to be, Mr Deputy Speaker, some issues in they are. It can at least have a united voice facing the Australian beef industry today. This dead silence. I know there have been a lot of with MLA, but particularly CCA. They had a up to them, models A, B and C, and really it has old hands who have been at it for years said, give them a go. Let them go ahead with it and see that there needs to be a review of the industry needs to come from them. That has been put to to come up with it. When you hear from smaller prices. They talk about getting effectively the they will detail you some of that. I have read it is to do with the high Australian dollar. There are different reasons. We need to model of representation that they have is also one that I do not see a great deal of transparency about how the producers' levies are One thing the MLA has said is that it has marketing and research. Some people say that is note a previous CCA member, Mr Greg Brown, he was calling for MLA to have that moved at not happen. My understanding is that the MLA talks about an audit that can be done. It something should happen. The least that structure. We certainly do not I have a couple of other points that I would word and it goes to the producers. This is producers have said. They have said that representation and accountability. They have and it says, 'Levy paying cattle producers still $56 million levy. It would seem CCA has consultation fees from MLA.'
