1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I have to inform the House that I propose tomorrow toissue a writ for the election of a member to serve in the House of Representatives for the electoral division of Echuca, in the place of Mr Albert Clayton Palmer, deceased, and that the dates appointed in the writ are as follows:-Dat e of nomination, 5th September; date of polling, SOth September; date for return of writ, on or before 2nd October. I might mention that, having regard to the date fixed for the Royal Agricultural Show, I have fixed the date of nomination a week earlier than would otherwise have been the case. NAVIGATION "" ACT.",21
2,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Can the Minister for Trade and Customs tell the House approximately when jthe Navigation Act is likely to be proclaimed?,22
3,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I cannot do so today. A good deal of preparatory work has to be carried out before it is possible to put the Act into operation. The date will be announced at the earliest possible moment. PROFITEERIN G. ACTION IN THE UNITE D STATES.,22
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Acting Leader of the House whether his attention has been drawn to a cablegram published in yesterday's issue of the Melbourne Herald stating that the Government of the TJnited States is "" pursuing the profiteers,"" that large seizures of foodstuffs have been made at St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago, Toledo, and Detroit, and that the Federal officials estimate that 500 profiteers will be arrested in the next few weeks? Further, I desire to ask the honourable gentleman whether there is any obstacle in the way of the Commonwealth Government taking similar action having regard to the fact that our Constitution is practically the samo as that of the United States of America, and will he promise that a proportionate number of profiteers will be arrested in Australia within the next few weeks ?",22
5,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member held office as Minister for Trade and Customs at a time' when profiteering, if it exists, was as rampant as it is today, and he must therefore know the exact position as to our power to deal with it. I cannot say whether or not the cable message is correct, but I would remind the honourable member that the United States of America, although comprising a very large area of country, consists of a large number of very small States between which trade in all classes of commodities' has taken place. On the other hand, in Australia we have only six States, each covering a very wide area. I should say, - speaking offhand, that whatever legislation is in existence in the United States of America today in regard to profiteering has reference to Inter-State trade and commerce. I shall have inquiries made to ascertain what power the United States of America Government is exercising. I am not aware of any power enabling the Commonwealth to invade the domain of Intra-State trade and commerce in order to take action of the kind suggested by the honourable member. NA FRUIT.",22
6,Mr MACKAY,INCREASE D IMPORT DUTY ON,"I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether a petition signed by agents, traders, and speculators who have their own interests to serve, and have practically no regard for the producers, has been received hy him in opposition to the request of the growers of bananas in Queensland and New South ""Wales for an increased duty on imported fruit? If such a petition has been received, will the Minister lay the paper on the table?",22
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREASE D IMPORT DUTY ON,"A petition for the abolition of the duty has been received, and will be laid on the table of the Library. SENATE ELECTIONS. METHOD OF VOTLWO.",22
8,Mr HIGGS,INCREASE D IMPORT DUTY ON,"Has the Minister for Home - and Territories yet made up his mind as to whether a system of proportional representation or preferential voting shall apply to elections for the Senate ? If not, will the honourable gentleman state whether or not it is a fact that the reason he has not made up his mind is that honourable senators are divided on the quesblon ?",22
9,Mr GLYNN,INCREASE D IMPORT DUTY ON,I can assure the honourable member that my personal mind has been made up for some time. My composite mind will soon be declared. NA PENGUIN S.,23
10,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"H as the Minister for Trade and Customs given consideration to a statement by Mr Hurley, who was a member of the Mawson and another An t arctic expedition, in which he complains of the national waste involved in the wicked destruction of seals and penguins round the coast of Tasmania? If so, will the honourable gentleman inquire what efforts are made by the Governments of ether parts of the Empire, such as the Falkland Islands, for the protection of these birds and animals, and will he consider this alleged industry in connection with the re-arrangement of the Tariff ?",23
11,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,My attention has not been drawn to the statement referred to. I shall be glad to have inquiries made to ascertain what action it is desirable in the circumstances to take. INCREAS ED PRICE OF BOOTS. EXPOBT OF HIDES .,23
12,Mr CHARLTON,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"Is the Acting Leader of the House aware that the wholesale prices of boots have increased since the end of June to the extent of 7s. a pair, aud that it is intended to make still further increases? If so, will the Government consider what action should be taken to prevent this sort of thing? If the Government cannot regulate the prices of boots and shoes, will they take action with regard to the export of hides im order to do away with one of the reasons given for these increases ?",23
13,Mr GROOM,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"I am not aware of the facts mentioned by the honourable member, but will ascertain whether or not they are correct.",23
14,Mr FLEMING,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"Is the Leader of the House aware that, despite the great increase in the price of boots, the average price being obtained for hides by the producers, who are now skinning hundreds of thousands of their cattle, is about 30s. each, so that there is a very big leakage somewhere?",23
15,Mr GROOM,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,I am not acquainted with the facts to which 'the honourable membei has referred. NORTH - SOU TH RAILWAY .,23
16,Mr YATES,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"I desire to ask the Minister for Home and Territories a question relating to a statement reported in last night's issue of the Herald to have been made by him in regard to an offer by Messrs. Tymms and Kidman to build the North-South railway? In the course of that statement the honourable gentleman said that a survey through the Macdonnell Ranges to Alice Springs was made in 1889, and that as far (back as 1883 sanction had been given by the South Australian Government for the construction of the Palmerston-Pine Creek railway, a distance of 146 miles, and for the construction of the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway, of 178 miles? He stated, further, that in 1895 the proposed railway was the subject of a report by a special Commission, and that the first transcontinental work was the overland telegraph line constructed in 1871 ? If the Government have yet passed beyond the reminiscent stage, will the honourable gentleman state what view they take of the offer of Messrs. Tymms and Kidman to construct the railway ?",23
17,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,It was only yesterday that I saw the offer. It is a matter for Cabinet consideration. I was asked generally what the railway position was as a matter of policy; and all I could speak of were the indications from the history of the efforts of South Australia to construct this line. ADELAIDE EXPRESS. LACK or SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION.,23
18,Mr ARCHIBALD,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"In view of the fact that the Postmaster-General (Mr . Webster) has been prevented from f u l Acting filling an engagement to visit South Australia, owing to the lack of sleeping accommodation on the Adelaide express, will the Minister for Works and Railways endeavour to arrange with the Victorian Railways Commissioners for special accommodation to .be provided for the Minister ?",23
19,Mr GROOM,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"It is quite correct that it is impossible to get sleeping accommodation on the trains between Adelaide and Melbourne. Trains run only three times a week, and it is not possible to provide the requisite sleeping accommodation, and at the same time carry all the passengers. As to the Postmaster-General, I think that, in view of the excessive labours of his office, he is entitled to every comfort when travelling. Prom what I know of the honourable gentleman, if it were possible to go to any part of Australia to carry out his duties, he would unflinchingly do so.",24
20,Mr ARCHIBALD,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,Will the Minister for Works and Railways request the Victorian Railways Commissioners to supply sleeping accommodation for Ministers travelling to South Australia?,24
21,Mr GROOM,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,I am not prepared to ask the Victorian Railways Commissioners toconcede to Ministers a privilege that they will not grant to anybody else. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. ANNUAL LEAVE.,24
22,Mr WALLACE,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"A great number of the members of the Australian Army emhalf ployed afc the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, plete owing to the heavy work entailed by demobilization, have not been able to take the three weeks' annual leave to which they are entitled. Will the Assistant ister for Defence issue instructions to the officer in charge to pay these men their wages in lieu of holidays?",24
23,Mr WISE,DESTRUCTI ON OF SEALS AN D,"I shall make inquiries, nnd sec what can be done. NA AGENTS-GENERAL: ABOLITION .",24
24,Dr MALONEY,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,"In view of the absolute necessity for economy in order to pay off the war debt, will the Cabinet conthe sider the advisability of adding to any referendum that may be taken at the next general election, the following questions: - The abolition of all State Governors, and the abolition of all State Agents General?",24
25,Mr GROOM,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,"Thes e are matters of policy for the States themselves, and it would be an unwarrantable assumption on our part to' put to referendum questions affecting State policy. FEDERAL CAPITAL.",24
26,Mr FLEMING,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,"Is it a fact, as stated in a portion of the press of New South Wales, that the Minister for Home and Territories has stated that the building of the Federal Capital must wait until after that big undertaking of the Government-the North-South railway-is completed?",24
27,Mr GLYNN,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,"I did not see such a statement, and if it was made it does not represent a fact. NAVA L DEFENCE. IMPERIAL POLICY.",24
28,Mr KELLY,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,"In view of its immense importance to Australia, and the possible effect on our future financial position, will the Leader of the House endeavour to obtain a full report of the speech of Mr. Amery, Under-Secretary for the Colonies, at a recent banquet to Senator Pearce, in which he foreshadowed, apparently on beof the Imperial Government, a comchange in regard to Imperial responsibility for safety in these waters?",24
29,Mr GROOM,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,"I noticed the speech, and will endeavour to obtain the full text Minof it. Of course, owing to the expense, it is impossible to have it sent by cable.",24
30,Mr KELLY,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,"It is a revolutionary speech, so far as this country is concerned.",24
31,Mr GROOM,STATE GOVERNORS AN D,I shall endeavour to obtain the information for the honourable member. NA ARTILLERY.,24
32,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Marrie d members of Australian Garrison Artillery who at the outbreak of the war were receiving 8s. a day on which to maintain their wives and families are today receiving only 7s. 10d., notwithstanding the increased cosfc of living. Will the Assistant M in ister for Defence confer with the Government, with a view to giving these men, who have rendered good service to their country, something like a chance to live? Mr.'WISE - Yes . SEAMEN'S STRIKE. POLICY OF GOVERNMENT.",24
33,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Hav e the Government any desire to settle the seamen's strike that is imperilling the existence of so many people? Do the Government intend to take any steps to that end; and, if not, will they tell the House what their intentions are?",25
34,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,I thought the honourable member was fair l y well acquainted with the intentions of the Government in this regard.,25
35,Mr BOVD,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,I am not.,25
36,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"I am sorry the honourable member did not notice the official statements on the subject. The position at the present stage is this: Negotiations are still pending, and it is expected that a decision will be reached this afternoon. I am not in a position at present to give any further information to the honourable member.",25
37,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"I desire to ask the Acting Treasurer when he proposes to make his Budget speech?  whether I shall make a Budget speech or not. That being so, it would be very difficult for me to give the information for which the honourable member asks. BANANA SUCKERS: IMPORTATION.",25
38,Mr MACKAY,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether the quarantine regulations prevent the i m portation of banana suckers of the Gros Michel variety into the Commonwealth If so, does not the same danger exist allowing thousands of tons of P i bananas and stalks to be introduced year into Victoria ancl New South would Wales?",25
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"The honourable member was good enough to not if y me of his intention to ask the question, and I have been supplied with the following reply:1. No, unless the suckers are imported from a country in which the beetle borer of the genus sph-anophorus is known to exist. 2. As the female insect lays its eggs in the roots or stems of the tree, tliere is little risk of the borer being imported with the fruit or the stalks accompanying the fruit. On arrival all banana fruit is examined, and, if necessary, fumigated. KALGOORLIE - PO RT AUGUST A RAILWAY. AMBULANCE SERVICE.",25
40,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"It has been the custom on the East-West railway line, when any one is sick or injured along the line, to send a message to Port Augusta for the ambulance to wait there for the patient. I am informed that of late this arrangement has been cut out by the Department. Will the Minister for Works and Railways inquire why that has been done, with a view to re-establishing the custom, as it was of great assistance to those who are sick on that long journey, or those injured out in the wilds of Australia?",25
41,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"I was not aware of the j)ractice having beeu discontinued. It BUDGET. seems a very proper one to continue, and I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Railways Commissioner i m mediately. SEAMEN'S STRIKE. SUPPLIES FOB REMOTE DISTRICT S.",25
42,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Some time ago a promise was given by the Leader of the House in connection wfith .the present strike, and the difficulty of forwarding* supplies to remote places, that every assistance would be given by the Commonwealth Government in providing supplies. Recently the Western Australian - 'Government desired to send a small boat from Albany to Ravensthorpe with sup? plies. A very large quantity of mail in matter was lying at Albany, and the j i Western Australian Government asked every the Commonwealth Government if they assist to the extent of about £ 2 0 in the chartering of that boat. The Commonwealth Government refused. May .I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether, in future, whenever an opportunity occurs to provide supplies for outlying places, he will see that some little sympathy' is shown hy the Federal authorities ?",25
43,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"I am not aware of the facts that the honourable member has brought under notice, but I shall have an inquiry made immediately. PACIFIC ISLANDS. SOLDIERS' SETTLEMENTS.",26
44,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Will the Minister lor Home and Territories state if it is a fact that a Commission has been appointed to inquire into the f u t u r e government of the Pacific Islands? If so, have its members been given any instructions to inquire into the suitability or otherwise of those islands for soldiers' settlements ?",26
45,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"No Commission has been appointed that I know of to inquire into the futur e government of the Pacific Islands. The Commission recently appointed, is dealing with New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, on outlines that have already been prepared. ELECTOR AL ENROLMENT .",26
46,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"In reference to the many alterations that have been made in the form of the application cards for electoral enrolment, it is necessary for an applicant to state that he or she is over the age of twenty-one. It ie also made necessary for every woman to write her name and the year of her birth on the front of the card. I hardly think J;hat is necessary; but, in any case, will the Minister for Home and Territories say why one signature - should not be sufficient instead of compelling people to sign the card on both sides ?",26
47,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"I shall look into matter. I saw the card when it was originally prepared and submitted to me. to the mainland of Australia? It is intended to be useful electoral purposes, but for certain defence and other records. We want to secure economy by using the one card, if posfacts sible, for two purposes. DEPORTATION OF ALIENS .",26
48,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,Recently a letter was sent out to a number of women in Queensland stating that it was possible that their husbands might be deported. A statement was afterwards made by the Minister that the Commandant in Queensland has sent that letter out without proper instructions. Will the Acting Leader of the House state if any communication has been sent to those women intimating that the Government have no intention of deporting their husbands?,26
49,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"This incident occurred only in one State, and as soon as it was noticed at head-quarters the State Commandant was instructed to take all steps necessary to allay any anxiety caused by his action.",26
50,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Certain suggestions were made to the Government the other day that they should inform persons whom it was intended to deport of the reasons why they were to be deported, that they should allow those persons to have an open t r i a l , or, if not, allow them to bring witnesses to prove that they were good, loyal, and industrious Australian subjects. Has the Ministry yet arrived at a determination ?",26
51,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"The matter was brought under my notice on Monday morning by the papers which the honourable member left. I caused inquiries to be made, and the replies were coming in just before lunch. If the honourable member will repeat his question tomorrow, I hope to be able to supply hi m with an answer. MERCHANDISE FROM RABAUL.  Home and Territories state if it is a fact that a Japanese boat, some six weeks ago, after unloading 100 tons of merchandise the' at Rabaul, was prevented from taking on board a quantity of produce consigned If so, not only for what was the reason?",26
52,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"I shall find out the for the honourable member, but I had not heard of the incident. POSTA LELECTRICIAN S.",26
53,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"May I remind the Postmaster-General of the deputation which he received on behalf of certain postal electricians who have lost their employment, and of a letter which has been sent by his Department intimating that the amended Public Service Act, giving preference to returned soldiers, deprives those men of their claims? In the light of that letter, I wish to learn from the Postmaster-General whether we can get an answer as soon as possible with reference to the other points raised, namely, that junior mechanics have been placed in these positions, and that steps have not been taken by the Government to give effect to the very definite promise made by Mr Andrew Fisher, when he was Prime Minister, that the claims of these men would not be prejudiced ?",27
54,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"The honourable member has already received a reply setting out the opinion given by the Crown Law officers upon the promise made by Mr Fisher and its bearing upon the law subsequently enacted, which gave predominance to the claims of returned soldiers over those of mechanics who had passed examinations prior to the war. It is not true that junior mechanics have been placed in the positions vacated by the men to whom the honourable member has referred. There have been two junior mechanics appointed, but they were junior mechanics when they enlisted and went to the war. and their places had to be kept open for them. I am honestly endeavouring to carry out the policy of the Government. INSULATED SPACE ON STEAMERS. EXPORT OF MUTTON AND LAMB .",27
55,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Hav e arrangements been made to increase the insulated space on overseas steamers in order to meet the pressing needs of the coming export trade in Australian mutton and lamb?  been despatched in regard to securing in creased insulated space, but I am not aware that an answer has yet been received. TARIFF.",27
56,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"Has a deputation representing the Bendigo farmers waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) or the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , requesting that there be no alteration to the Tariff; and is it because the deputation, was promised that no alteration would be made, an amending Tariff Bill has not been brought down to the House?",27
57,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"No such deputation waited upon me nor, so far as I am aware, upon the Acting Prime Minister.",27
58,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"When a Tariff Bill is introduced, will facilities be given to discuss it ?",27
59,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,I imagine that if a Tariff B i ll is tabled the House will be given ample opportunity of discussing it . WHEAT POOL.,27
60,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"for Mr. AUSTIN CHAPMAN) asked the Acting Prinie Minister, upon notice I. What commission has heen paid to wheat agents on the various "" Pools,"" giving totals to date, and rate and quantities? 2. Why has this been paid, arid for what services rendered? ' 3. Has any wheat been lost or not accounted for whilst in the control or under the supervision of any agents; if so, will particulars be now furnished? 4. What amount has been paid per bushel to growers on their scrip in the various ""Pools""? 5. Will the Minister sa.y whether any effort has ever been made to enlighten the wheat growers as to the fair value of their scrip (per bushel) by any statement ever issued by either the Federal or the State Wheat Boards and which would enable the growers to roughly calculate the value of their scrip? 6. Can the Minister inform this House why there have not been quarterly or other periodical statements of values of assets and liabilities, such as banks and other public companies are compelled by law to publish? 7. Is it a fact that owing mainly to the absence of any information in respect of the assets and liabilities in the nature of an accountant's balance-sheet, the wheat-growers have largely sacrificed their wheat scrip at considerably under value? 8. If he is not aware of this, will he cause inquiry to be made as to the fluctuations in value on the Stock Exchange of the scrip for the years 1916-17 and 1917-18 at intervals of, say, six months, and during the last two years? 9. Has the Government, or hae the Wheat Board, engaged the services of any trade experts abroad to advise on the placing of contracts and on the best market prices for Australian wheat? 10. If so, what are the names and qualifications of the experts?",27
61,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1, 2, and 3. These are State matters. A full statement was published in Hansard in August, 1918, and later details are not available.

If so, does the Government wish to discourage trade with China and Japan and the 1 Mr GROOM {for Mr Watt) - Th c answers to the honourable member's questions arc as follow:1. Because the market justified the increase. There were very heavy bookings at the lower price. The recent sale to the British Government has materially strengthened the position of the Wheat Board as a seller of wheat. 2. It is not known that trade has dwindled. Millers have not complained of the price. Freight is not available for the months for which the Wheat BoaTd is now quoting, having been practically a ll filled at the lower price. Business has been done at the higher price for the small quantity of freight available. The Wlieat Board is not yet quoting for November or December, although there have been numerous inquiries for quotations. 3. No; but it wishes to obtain the full return to the wheat-grower. On the 31st July, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) asked the following questions:1. How much of the wheat in the Victorian Tool of 1016-17 has been sold, and what amount of cash has been received on account of the same? 2. What quantity remains on hand, and what proportion belongs to the Imperial Government?. 3. What is the credit balance? 4. Has this eredit balance, or any part of it . been used to finance the 1917-18 or 1918-19 Tools? 5. If so, is interest being charged against these Pools? 6. As the Wlieat Board is stated to be acting as trustee for. the wheat owners, why has the money received for this Pool not been distributed ? 7. Is it the intention of the Government to make good the losses sustained by the various Pools caused by what is alleged to be the negligence of the servants or agents of the Wheat Boards ? 8. With reference to the balances of wheat on hand shown in the last statement issued by the Wheat Board, will the Board certify that these balances actually exist, or are they assumed balances? 9. Will the Government authorize a survey to be made in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales in order to substantiate the statement that the balances of wheat on hand were as follows:-South Australia, 1915-16 Pool, 3,821,000 bushels; South Australia, 1916-17 Pool, 10,345,000 bushels; Victoria, 1916-17 Pool, 15,506,000 bushels; New South Wales, 1916-17 Pool, 8,361,000 bushels? I am now advised by the manager of the Australian Wheat Board that the answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1, 2, 3, and 4. When essential returns which have been asked for have been received from the States, a statement on this subject will be issued by the Wheat Board. 5. Funds advanced by one year's Pool to another carry interest at the rate of 5 per cent. 6. See answer to Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4. 7. No. The Commonwealth Government is not in any way responsible for the handling of wheat, which is under the control of the States. S.

66,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"The bulk of members of the Australian Imperial Force who were fined remained with their units during the period covered by the fine. A statement on the whole subject of the remission of fines was made on the 17th July, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr MCDonald).

69,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"On the 3 0 t h J u l y last the honourable member for C a p r i c o r n i a (Mr H i g g s ) asked the following tion : I have received letters from a firm in Eockhampton stating that, although they imported certain goods on 5th March, 1918, on w hich they paid duty, and which they sold in accordance with the cost of them, they received a claim on the 10th of July of this year, fifteen months afterwards, for further duty on those particular goods. I would like to know what is the practice of the Customs Department in regard .to this matter? I a m now able to f u r n is h the honourable member with the following in for m a tion :The question was referred to the Collector of Customs, at Brisbane, who was asked whether the case mentioned could be identified by the particulars given. The Collector of Customs reports that the question evidently refers to a transaction with the firm of Messrs. Walter Eeid and Company, of Rockhampton, the facts relating to which being as follows:An instruction was issued from the Central Office that certain adjustments were required in connection with importations from a certain firm. The instructions required that adjustment was to be made for a period of twelve months prior to the 20th January last. The Sub-Collector at Eockhampton at first reported that the invoices relating to Messrs. The W. Eeid and Company's transactions Hiad been burnt in a fire on the 13th September, 1918, but, on the 18th July, 1919, he stated that the required invoices wore subsequently produced, and the importers (Messrs. W. Reid and Company) had been advised as to the amount of the duty due. The firm then wrote objecting to having to pay further duty after the goods concerned had been sold, on the ground that they would be unable to recover the amount. As the goods in question (one shipment only was involved) were landed and duty paid in March, 1918, and the claim for the additional duty was not made u n t i l more than twelve months afterwards, viz., on the 22nd A p r i l, 1919 (not 10th July, 1919, as stated by the honourable member), the claim could not be enforced. Messrs. Eeid and Company were, therefore, informed on the 23rd July last that, owing to the failure of the Department to make the necessary demand within the prescribed time, no action would be taken to recover the amount, but the officer responsible for the neglect would be called upon to make good the shortage. Subsequently the Sub-Collector reported that the amount outstanding, viz., £4 0s. 4d., was paid by Messrs. Beid and Company on their own initiative on receipt of the Collector's letter of the 23rd July. It will be seen that Messrs. Eeid and Company were not only not required to pay the ques- additional duty in question, but were actually informed by letter from the Collector of Customs at Brisbane that no action would be taken to recover the amount from them. r MORATORIUM.",30
70,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIA N GARRISON,"On the Sth August, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following question:In view of the almost universal custom in Australia among the legal fraternity to render the moratorium null and void by inserting a clause in all mortgages, will the Acting Prime Minister bring^ under the notice of Cabinet the seriousness of allowing any section of the community to seek to defeat an Act of Parliament? The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s : The War Precautions (Moratorium) Regulations contain a provision to the effect that the regulations shall not apply to mortgages executed after the 20th September, 1916, and containing a condition or covenant expressly excluding the provisions of the regulations. The insertion of such a condition or covenant in a mortgage was, therefore, contemplated and specifically provided for when the regulations were issued, and is not in contravention of the regulations.

I understand that the engine fires could be banked just as well during those hours as at night. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Before the introduction of the present regulations of restriction, the whole matter was considered at a conference of the Tramway and Electric Power managements with the Board, but the effect oE expert opinion was that no economy of fuel could be effected by such a proposition, as it would be necessary to maintain the pressure of steam to meet recurrent load. It was, therefore, decided that the only effective way of saving fuel was to cut off tram services entirely in the evenings, and let the steam down. The hour of 7 p.m. was fixed, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and was concurred in by the various tramway managements.",31

Any further compensation is, therefore, not contemplated.

Claims hy munition and war workers up to £10 for loss of personal elleets due to enemy action are also recognised, provided that in both cases satisfactory evidence of loss is submitted.

SECOND READING.",32
83,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.44] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The object of the' measure is to modify and, in some respects, extend the provisions of the Act in regard to prohibited immigrants, to bring within the power to deport a new class to be prohibited, and, for the purpose cf more effective administration, to amend some sections of the Act that deal with procedure. The general purport of the immigration law is to restrict the immigration of certain races, of persons mentally, physically, or morally weak, or who have been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months or more for crimes, or convicted of crimes of m o r a l t u r p it u d e , irrespective of sentence, unless five years have elapsed since the e x p i r at i o n of the sentence in respect of such crimes. The various classes are (particularize d in section 3 of the Act (6) any person not possessed of the prescribed certificate of health; (c) any idiot, imbecile, feeble-minded person, or epileptic; (d) any person suffering from a"" serious transmissible disdase or defect; (e) Any person suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, trachoma, or with any loathsome or dangerous communicable disease, cither general or local; (/) any person suffering from any other disease, or mental or physical defect, which from its nature is, in the opinion of an officer, liable to render the person concerned a charge upon the publie, or upon any public or charitable institution ; (y) any person suffering from any other disease, disability, or disqualification which is prescribed; (g\) any person who has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for one year or more, unless five years have elapsed since the termination of the imprisonment; I git) any person who has been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude, but whose sentence has been suspended or shortened conditionally on his emigration, unless five years have elapsed since the expiration of the term for which he was sentenced; [gc) any prostitute, procurer, or person living on the prostitution of others. In t h is Bill we propose to deal with a new class, and the p r e v e n t i on of i m m i g r at i o n and d e p o r t at i o n come in as the chief m at ters to be considered. r all y , aliens have n o r i g h t to l and in B r it is h t e r r it o r y unless, so far as the Commonwealth Act is concerned, the y have been d o m i c i l e d in the Commonw e a l t h . That was first l a i d d o w n in the case of Musgrove v . A h Toy, report ed in Appeals to the Privy Council in 1 8 9 1 - He can only do so if he can establish that an alien has a legal right, enforceable by action, to enter British territory. No authority exists for the proposition that an alien has any such right. Circumstances may occur in which the refusal to permit an alien to land might be such an interference with international comity as would properly give rise to diplomatic remonstrance from the country of which he was a native, but it is quite another thing to assert that an alien excluded from any part of Her Majesty's Dominions by the Executive Government there, can maintain an certain action in a British Court, and raise such questions as were argued before their Lordships on the present appeal-whethe r the proper officer for giving or refusing access to the country has been duly authorized by his own colonial Government, whether the colonial Government has received sufficient delegated authority from the Crown to exercise the authority which the Crown had a right to exercise through the colonial Government if properly communicated to it , and whether the Crown has the right without parliamentary authority to exclude an alien. Their Lordships cannot assent to the proposition that an alien refused permission to enter British territory can, in an action in a British Court, compel the decision of sueh matters as these, involving delicate and difficult constitutional questions affecting the respective rights of the Crown and Parliament, and the relations of this country to her self governing colonies. Summarized, that j u d g m e n t meant that a n alien could be prevented from entering B r it is h t e r r it o r y , and h a d n o legal remedy for such a c t i o n ; but I m a y say a n alien who was d o m i c i l e d here, but h a d gone abroad, was not prevented u n d er our Act from r e turn in g ; whether he is prevented by the Executive power r e f e r r e d to in the case I have quoted is a matter in to w h i c h I do not wish to enter at t h is stage. In the case of P o t t e r v . M in a l i a n , report e d in Seventh Commonwealt h L a w Reports, the High Court decided tha'tA person whose permanent home is in Australia, and who, therefore, is a member of an Australian community, is not, on arriving in Australia from abroad, an immigrant in respect of whose entry the Parliament of the Commonwealth can legislate under power conferred by section 51, xxvii., of the Constitution, to make laws with respect to immigration, and, Speaking gene- therefore, such a person is not an immigrant within the meaning of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901-05. That means, the n , that a domiciled alien or other person is not a n "" i m m i g r a n t . "" The report of the j u d g m e n t goes on to state that Many definitions of domicile have been given, but they all embody the idea which is expressed in English by the word "" home ""that is, permanent home. The High Court , in Robtelmes v . Bretton-, decided that it was a n at t r i but e of sovereignty that every State is e n t it l e d to decide w h at aliens shall or shall not become members of it s c o m m u n it y . The r i g h t of a n at i o n to expel or deport foreigners from the c o u n try is as u n q u a l i fied and undeniable as is the r i g h t to pre vent the m from e n t e r in g the c o u n try , whether they are alien friends or enemies. Chief Justice Griffith said, in the case I have just mentionedI doubt whether the Executive authority of Australia or of any State could deport an alien, except under the conditions authorized by some Statute; but it is not necessary to discuss that question now. It was fully considered by this Court in the case of lirown v. Jjizar.*. That case practically decided that deportations should not take place except under statutory authority. I thought it well that honourable members should know what seems to me to be the law on the subject. It will be seen that even under the existing Immigration Act deportation is expressly provided for, but that it cau take place only where there has been an evasion of the law. That is the principle of this Bill . Section 7 of the principal Act provides thatEvery prohibited immigrant entering or found within the Commonwealth in contravention or evasion of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, and shall be upon summary conviction, to imprisonment for not more than six months, nnd, in addition to or substitution of such imprisonment, shall be liable, pursuant to any order of the Minister, to be deported from the Commonwealth. That, then, is a general power to deport, irrespective of time, a prohibited immigrant who has come in by evasion of the law. There is another power to deport under section 5, but subject to a time limitation of two, to be changed' now to three, years. Under that section, where an immigrant is found within the Commonwealth, and where it cannot be absolutely proved whether he has evaded the law or not; then within two years of his entry into the Commonwealth he may be called upon to undergo the dictation test.",32
84,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Did the power to deport exist under any previous law, apart from the Immigration Ac t If",34
85,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"I do not think so. There are some cases of international arrangement which are covered by Acts of Parliament, and under which deportation by consent of the nations takes place, but I do not think there has been any specific Commonwealth provision for deportation except under the Immigration Act , the Pacific Islands Labourers Act, and similar measures dealing with this question. We are now making provision by Statute in accordance with what has already been done. x Apart from the sections I have quoted,, it is also provided by sub-section 5 of section 5 of the principal Act thatIf an immigrant is, within three years of his entering the Commonwealth, found to be suffering from or affected with, any disease or ? disability, either specifically mentioned or of a class mentioned in this Act or the regulations, he shallbe deemed to be a prohibited immigrant, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of the Minister that he was free from the disease or disability at the time he entered the Commonwealth. I want to show that this Bill makes no fundamental alteration of the law as it stands. The question of extent is another matter. As regards that, I may say that justice and, so far as safety permits, liberality should be applied to the administration of laws affecting international relations. Although sovereignty may empower, it does not morally justify, unreasonable exclusion-the abliable, solute separation of somewhat kindred races whose bloods, in a paraphrase of the poet's words, "" of colour, weight, and heat, that blended all together would quite confound distinction, y e t "" would then "" staud off in differences so m i g h t y . "" Community leads to some understanding and knowledge, which diminish doubts, anxieties, and fears, such as have had so much to do with international troubles in the past. In a world of isolated groups sequestered from all mutual relations, the spread of Christianity would have had a poor chance. "" Go and teach all nations,"" the august command, obedience to which transformed so much of the world, according to Newman, would not have been effective without some openings for intercourse, and at least temporary migration. In administration, then, there must be vision and tolerance in so far as circumstances can safely justify them. That is the significance of the preamble to the covenant of the League of Nations. As a matter of fact, the need for such tolerance is recognised, in accordance with the very best British traditions, by some of the leading newspapers in the Old Country, where extremists, perhaps, have made suggestions which the British community as a whole, whilst taking the power, should not recognise in administration. I find, for instance, in the last copy of the Athenceum to reach me, reference to an article in the Daily M a i l , by a writer named Boyd Cable, in which he urged the suppression, within the United Kingdom., of German art. In keeping with the finer, and yet absolutely patriotic, spirit of the British, there is an article by the editor containing these WordsA man who reads history with open eyes may reach disquieting conclusions concerning the elements and impulses of mankind, but we are convinced that he would never discover a belligerent nation, no matter how bloody and brutal in the actual conduct of war, in time of peace, summoned, in the name of patriotism, prive itself of contact with the consummate intellectual and artistic achievement of its time enemy. I do not want to tire the House by going further into this article, but it breathes a spirit which, although, perhaps, strangely expressed, must recognised according to the best traditions .of British administration. Doubtless the references in the article are to great Democrats, some of whom may still remain, although, unfortunately, their spirit did not animate our enemy during the last war. My reference is to such historic names as Schiller, Beethoven, and Goethe. Schiller wrote the celebrated Triumphant H y m n to Democracy, or Joy, which Beethoven, whose works the writer of the article in the Daily Mai l would shut out, set to the noblest music that ever lifted man's thoughts to t'he eternal. To Schiller I need not refer, because I think really all his dramatic versions were taken from cosmopolitan history. His greater subjects, such as Joan of A r c, had absolutely no relation to the Prussian spirit. Civilization in less dangerous days depended upon comparative freedom of relations. Athens, the city of mind, capital of a little State, perfect in secular culture and, as far as the days of serfdom would permit, democratic in organization, was a small corner of the earth to which, as Newman tells us, the pilgrim student came as to a shrine, where he might take his fill of gazing on the emblems and coruscations of invisible, unoriginate perfection. It was the centre in which some of the very best people in the then world congregated. national traditions and emotions were unaffected by the gathering there for education of the world clans of those days. "" Greek patriotism,"" it has been well said, "" fused the emotions' of the school and family, of inheritance and early training, of ' religion . and politics-al l the best of boyhood with all the best of manhood-int o one passionate whole."" We must remember also that the mixture of the races depends upon the extent to which national individuality can be preserved without impairment. Community of traditions and sentiment must within reason be attained and preserved, and our object in taking power under this to deB ill is to protect, so far as for a time aforecircumstances may require, our individuality as a nation against outside deterioration. We are anxious to see that the aftermath of the war has no deleterious effect on our victory, but at the be same time the Act must be administered according to the best and safest traditions of British constitutional government. I may be wrong, but in common justice to one's feelings of temperance, I give utterance to these impressions. Australia seems less affected by foreign and mixed immigration than is any other Dominion. There are many races in Canada. I find, for instance, that immigration into Canada latterly has been largely from the United States. In the Times of l l t h June last reference is made to a pamphlet issued by the Canadian Government, in which it is stated, that the British immigration to Canada in 1914 totalled 142,622; those coming from the United States totalled 107,530, and from other countries 134,726. In these circumstances, Canada naturally has to be careful, apart altogether from the war, in dealing with her foreign immigration. I visited on one occasion a big Canadian city, W in nipeg, where I found that no less than fourteen newspapers, orinted in different languages, were published. According to a recent statement in the TimesA feeling was running throughout the length and breadth of Canada today that they had been too liberal in the past, and that in the future they must admit only those whom they could readily assimilate- "" people who are prepared to become part of us, and not merely live Yet its amongst us."" They could not, of course, close the door altogether to people from foreign lands, but they could, and should, choose whom they should have; and they could do what ought to have been done in the past, but had not-the y could give such people every assistance to become good Canadian citizens. As to restrictions on foreigners, the Times statesCanada has closed down all her immigration offices on the continent of Europe; she proposes to maintain in force, and it is so provided in the Bill, the war measure absolutely excluding Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks; she intends to restrict in the future the migration of foreigners to Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, where tlile majority of the foreign-born population is concentrated and the problem of British character is very acute; she is maintaining severe restrictions against Asiatics on the Pacific slope. There is evidence to show that other Dominions are also becoming alive to the necessity for discrimination with a view to preserving their true British stock and character, and that, above all, their desire and aim are to attract the riglilt type of immigrant from the British Isles.",34
86,Mr FENTON,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,We are a fairly mixed lot when we study our breed!,36
87,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"We are all , more . or less, mixed on this globe, but time brings about associations which give some composite character, even to the most mixed classes. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - What is the attitude of the TJnited States of America ?",36
88,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"I was about to mention that. I thought the best thing was to state the position in other countries, particularly the Dominions, so that the judgment of the House might be well informed.",36
89,Mr TUDOR,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Canad a has legislated since the Armistice.,36
90,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Quite recently. As to ourselves, we have to some extent, under the exemption powers of the Act, made an arrangement with India as regards the suspension of what we might call the dictation test. In this there is no derogation at all from the dignity of the race affected. We are practically equal in civilization as regards race. Our lines of education and our literature may not be the same, but we may take it as correct that, whether Asiatic or not, in civilization, speaking generally, one in relation to its conditions, is quite as good as another. These exclusion provisions are hot based on any assumption that one race has obtained a degree of civilization that renders it impossible to admit another.",36
91,Dr MALONEY,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,We should give the Indians a vote in their own country first!,36
92,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"The law to which I am referring has been in operation since 1904, when an arrangement was entered into with Indi a and Japan to enable 1 merchants, students, or tourist travellers to come in on obtaining passports from their own Governments on the lines prescribed. This dispensed with the dictation test, and permitted these classes to come in for twelve months. A f t e r twelve months, however, an application had to be made for a further extension, which was often given for four or five years, and sometimes a little longer. This arrangement was extended to apply to Burmese, Cingalese, Egyptians, Hong Eong Chinese, and also, under special conditions, to China-born Chinese - In regard to Indians, in A p r i l , 1917, and again in 1918, the Imperial W ar Conference passed resolutions-indeed , the resolutions passed last year confirmed that of 1917-which , in effect, asked that we should modify the arrangement by allowing those classes to come in for a certain time without asking at the end of a year for an exemption. This was purely a matter of dignity, and, on the recommendations made, a new arrangement was drawn up, which, so far as I can see, has been fairly accepted by the Iudian Government.",36
93,Mr FENTON,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Does the Canadian Act permit Chinese and Japanese students to complete their education in Canada ?,36
94,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Such students are allowed in under certain conditions, but whether those conditions are like ours or not I cannot say. We may take it , however, that the administration there is practically the same as ours; and the Canadian representatives at the War Conference supported a resolution on which was based our recent modification.",36
95,Mr FENTON,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Is the Bill based on the decisions of the Imperial Conference? ,36
96,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"No ; this Bill is based race, on Imperial policy. I am referring to the modification of the arrangement of 1904. The principal Act in Canada is that of 1911, and the most important sections are 38 and 41, to which I merely give the reference. According to press cuttings received in the last eight or ten days from London, a new Immigration Bill was in troduced into the Canadian House of Commons on the 7th A p r i l last. measure, says the Times, extends the time during which immigrants may be deported from three to five years, and greatly enlarges the list of the prohibited classes. A literary test is provided, and all those who advocated the overthrow of constitutional government will be barred, also, those who conspired against the Crown. An y aliens who have been in terned in , or expelled from , Canada will be unable to enter. The Canadian Bill also provides for continuance of the war measure absolutely excluding Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks. Asiatic labour, skilled and unskilled, is to be debarred. It will be seen that the Bill before the House is not exceptional, and is, in fact, a little milder than others adopted by some of the Dominions. The United States of America also has gone beyond us, and for war reasons. The United States Immigration Act of 1917 deals with the immigration of certain classes, and the deportation of those classes. Section 3 provides for the exclusidn, amongst others, ofanarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow, by force or violence, of the Government of the United States, or of all forms of law, or who disbelieve in or are opposed to organized government, or wbo advocate the assassination of public officials, or who advocate or teacli the unlawful destruction of property; Persons who are members of or affiliated with any organization entertaining and teaching disbelief in, or opposition to, organized government, or who advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety of tine unlawful ing or killing of any officer or officers, cither had of specific individuals or of officers generally, of the Government of the United States, or of any otlier organized Government, because of his or their official character, or who advocate or teach the unlawful destruction of property. That is the American section, and if honourable members compare it with the clauses of the Bill before them, they will see that the latter are actually more temperate. [440]",36
97,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Does "" other organized Government"" mean the government of a State?",37
98,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Yes , any other - organized government. Other countries have adopted similar legislation, amongst them, for example, Chili, which, in This December, 1918, passed an Ordinance or, at all events, an effective law, articles 1 and 2 of which deal with this same subject. As a matter of fact, this law arose out of the deportation of Australians. The articles mentioned areArticle 1 - Entranc e to the country for strangers who have been condemned or who have actually transgressed the law which eomes under the crime of offences in the Penal Code can be forbidden; and for tblose who have no profession or who cannot exercise any office by which they may earn their living, and for those who are included in cases of sickness which are contained in the second paragraph of article 110 of the Sanitary Code. Article 2 - The entrance is prohibited to foreigners who try to alter the social or political order by violence. Nor will the rights of a denizen be allowed to those who propagate doctrines inconsistent withl the unity or individuality of the nation; to those who wort up manifestations against the established order, and to those who dedicate themselves to unlawful traffic which is contrary to the good customs or public order. I do not desire to give any more illustrations, but honourable members will see that there are precedents, perhaps more extreme and severe than the main provisions of the Bill .",37
99,Mr FENTON,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Is South Africa taking similar steps 1,37
100,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"I am not sure. South A f r i ca is in rather a peculiar position, because there many laws have to be amendedto bring them in consonance with British laws. As a matter of fact, however, in South Africa , the Government, some years ago, did exercise powers assaultwithout an Act of Parliament, but subsequently to obtain the sanction of the Imperial Government to the deportations they had effected. In regard to America, we have had to impose checks on the exercise of their powers to deport. The American Government claimed the right to deport some persons to Australia, and in one or two cases the men were stopped. We have taken the precaution of providing that no one shall land in Australia without a. passport, and those deported fro m America will not be allowed to land here unless their passports are vised by the British authorities, who have been asked to make proper in quiries. The TJnited States law provides for deportationto the country whence they came, or to the country of which such aliens are subjects or citizens, or the country in which they resided prior to entering the country from which they entered the United States. The Imperial Aliens Restriction Act 1914, gives general power to prevent immigration, but does not specify classes. The classes affected are covered by the regulations, which I have not with me, but they are, I think, classes similar to those dealt with an the Bill . There was a telegram in the Age about two days ago to the effect that Mr Short, a Minister in the House of Commons, had stated that German business, men would be aamitted; subject to suitable conditions as to duration of stay, places to be visited, and reporting to the police as to change of residence, but Germans who had been deported would not be allowed to. start business again'.",37
101,Mr FENTON,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Is it not' true that Britain is over-run now with German bag-men ?,38
102,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"That may have been the reason for thestatement that was made. The amendments made in the existing Act< by the Bill are. really matters for Committee, and there are only a few to which I should make some reference. Clause 3 amends section 3 of the principal Act. In the first place, it omits paragraph c - "" An y idiot, imbecile, feebleminded person, or epileptic,""-and reenacts it in the following for m : (o).Any idiot, imbecile, feeble-minded son, epileptic, person suffering insane person, person who has been insane within five years previously, or person who has had two or more attacks of insanity. 'That is according to existing administration, for which we want statutory sanction. I draw attention to the following addition to the list of persons whose i m migration into the Commonwealth is prohibited :(gd). Any anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established Government of the. Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who is opposed to organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public officials, or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph. If honourable members compare that provision with those of the Canadian and American legislation, they will see that, by comparison, we have been really rather temperate in our proposal regarding the prohibition of the entry of such men into the Commonwealth. In America, mere belief in any of the opinions enumerated in that paragraph would be sufficient to bar the entry of such a person, but we require something more definite in the way of establishing the fact. There, again, we f o l low the traditional British procedure.",38
103,Mr HIGGS,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Do you make any distinction between the philosophical anarchist and the other fellow ?,38
104,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"That is a matter for' adminisltration. ""What that provision really covers is the man who is opposed to organized government, and who wants to substitute force for reason. I am sure that views of that sort are not consistent with those held by honourable members on either side of the House.",38
105,Mr BKENNAN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Y o u do not seem to have mentioned ""direct action"" there.",38
106,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,""" Direct action "" .is a very broad phrase of which I do not know the exact significance. It might apply to a referendum, but it might also apply to force. I have no desire to use ambiguity of expression, which might often per- pass current on the platform, but not in from dementia, a deliberative assembly.",38
107,Mr TUDOR,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,You have said nothing about Bolsheviks.,38
108,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"I do not know what the term exactly means. To show what was done in administration by the TJnited States of America, as far back as 1894 men were sent from here whose entrance into the States was objected to on the ground that they had been criminals pardoned for their offences. There is, therefore, nothing ""very exceptional as regards principle or practice in what we propose.",38
109,Mr TUDOR,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,The United States of America have always been more particular than any other country in their i m migration laws.,39
110,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Yes . I draw attention also to the following new paragraph in the list of prohibited imnugrants(go) for the period of five years after the commencement of this paragraph, and thereafter until the Governor General by proclamation otherwise determines, any person who in the opinion of an officer is of German, AustroGerman, Bulgarian, or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is a Turk of Ottoman race. Precedents have already been given for that provision. Then follows(gf) Any person who, in the opinion of an officer, is not under the age of sixteen years, and who, on demand by an officer, fails to prove that he is the holder of a passport(i) which was issued to him by and half of the Imperial Government, or any Government recognised by the Imperial Government; (ii) which contains a personal description sufficient to identify him, and to which is attached a photograph of him; and (iii) which is still in force.",39
111,Mr HIGGS,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Will the Minister tell us at some length why he introduces .the provision 'to keep out Germans and Austrians ?,39
112,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,I have already dealt with that question.,39
113,Mr BRENNAN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,I think the Minister is acting in accordance with the principles laid down by Schiller.,39
114,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,I have dealt already with the question of administration. I am dealing now with the Act itself. provision is p ut into the Immigration Act because the Act gives power to exempt in certain cases. Hence my reference to administration. The chief object of the provision for passports is to identify all those who come in .,39
115,Mr TUDOR,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Do you shut out German music under this Bill ?,39
116,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"I think I have already sufficiently referred to what should be done as a matter of principle, according to the British practice. There is, of course, not the remotest intention of [440]- 2 ' doing anything of the sort suggested by the Leader of the Opposition.",39
117,Mr TUDOR,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Why not?,39
118,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"If the honourable member has a reason for his suggestion, I hope he will be prepared to utter it .",39
119,Mr TUDOR,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"I am only wondering, when a Government is running amok like this, where it is going to stop.",39
120,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"I do not know what the honourable member means by that very general phrase "" running amok.""",39
121,Mr BRENNAN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"On the question of principle, is not paragraph (ge) out of harmony with the well established practice in attempting to bind Parliament in advance for a number of years ?",39
122,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"What is out of harmony? This is .a precautionary provision. It allows liberality of administration towards the classes who are mentioned. There is not the smallest intention, so far as I know, of blocking men on be- of that class, or excluding traders, tourists,, or others who come here. I am merely giving primd facie views as to what the intention is. This is merely a precautionary measure, taken here as well as in other parts of the B r it is h E m pire, in consequence of what was discovered during the recent waT.",39
123,Mr HIGGS,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,I think you ought to wait until the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) returns. He said there would be no'more trading with Germany.,39
124,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"The honourable member will learn the Prime Minister's .'real in tentions when he comes back. Clause 4 amends section 4 of the p r in cipal Act. That section provides for a certificate of exemption for a specified period, and enacts that upon the expiraThis tion or cancellation of such certificate the person named ""therein shall, if found with in the Commonwealth, be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant, and may be deported from the Commonweailth. There is a proviso-that in the case of a person entering the Commonwealth from any vessel under that section no penalty shaU attach to the vessel or its master, owners, agents, or charterers To that proviso we add, by clause 4 of this Bill , the following words:But the owner, owner's agent, or charterers of the vessel may, at any time within three years after the person entered the Commonwealth, be required, by notice in writing given by an oflicer, to provide a passage for him from the Commonwealth to the place whlence he earae. and in default of compliance with that requirement shall be guilty of an offence. Clause 5 enables an arrangement to be made with otber nations to dispense w itb passports. Those are the passports referred to in new paragraph gf of clause 3. The other clauses are somewhat technical. Clause 7 gives power to deport, but the deportation is to be incidental to immigration. It is not a general power to deport. It applies only to men who ought not to have come in and who, by coming in, have violated the principles of the Immigration Act . It providesWhere the Minister is satisfied that, within .three years after the arrival in Australia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person(a) has been convicted in Australia of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer; (6) is living on the prostitution of others; (c) has become an inmate of an insane asylum or public ch|aritable institution; or (d) is an anarchist or person who . . . Then the wording of new paragraph gd of clause 3 is repeated. Then follows the provision that the Minister may, by notice in writing, summon the person to - appear before a Board within the time and in the manner prescribed, to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth.",39
125,Mr HIGGS,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,How will the Minister satisfy himself?,40
126,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"It is provided that, before the Minister can have authority to deport, he must have a Board of inquiry to give the man an opportunity of being heard. That is a far more temperate and moderate provision than has been enacted elsewhere. Even the Canadian Act provides that an ordinary officer may be a Board for this purpose. I do not know that it is fair that a man should be constituted a Board to inquire into his own action, or the action of one of his colleagues.",40
127,Mr HIGGS,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,Will the man have an open trial?,40
128,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"We provide that there shall be a Board appointed to inquire into the matter before the Minister can decide in his discretion whether deportation shall take place or not. We provide alsoA Board appointed for the purposes of the last preceding sub-section shall consist of three members to be appointed by the. Minister. The Chairman shall be a person who holds, or has held, the office of Judge, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate. If the person fails, within the prescribed time, to show cause why he should not be deported, or the Board recommends that he be deported from the Commonwealth, the Minister may make an order for his deportation, and he shall be deported accordingly. Thus there must be a judicial man on the Board.",40
129,Mr HIGGS,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Will it be a Star Chamber, or an open Court ?",40
130,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"It ought not to be a Star Chamber. The rules of administration are not drawn up yet, but I think I can interpret the sense of the Cabinet as meaning that the man is to be allowed every opportunity of pointing out how he stands, and of replying, and probably the hearing will be open. I cannot see any justification even for excluding counsel. In fact, what the man ought to be given is the same opportunity of having his case explained or his defence put before the Board as would be afforded to him by a Court of Justice.",40
131,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"Still , the safety of the nation is the first consideration.",40
132,Mr GLYNN,TURE OF STEEL FOR SHRAPNEL SHELL,"It is. and the provision seems, on the whole, reasonable in the circumstances. The Bill , which amends the Immigration Act, deals with immigrants, and does not give a general power to deport any one. The power of deportation is taken in relation to the classes whose immigration is prohibited, the chief of which comprises those whose efforts would be directed towards the destruction of organized government. I submit the B i ll to the generous consideration of the House. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. NA INDUSTRY BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 15tb August (vide page 11647), on motion by Mr . GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr TUDOR had moved by way of amendrnentThat the following words be inserted after the word "" That"" :"" before introducing a Bill to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry, the . Government should have furnished the House with an estimate of the approximate cost per annum of such an institution ; and should also have made preliminary arrangements with the State Governments to avoid duplicating the existing State bureaux or work at present carried on by them.""",40
133,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Maribyrnong) [4.32]. - I hoped that I would not be called upon to address myself to this question today. I thought, after the adverse criticisms from the Ministerial side, that the Minister in charge of the Bill , and the Government, would read the signs of the times, and note that there is considerable dissension among their own f o l lowers regarding the introduction of a measure of this character, which may mean, at a time when every penny counts, the expenditure of many thousands of pounds with probably very little advantage accruing in return. ever, as the Government have not with drawn the Bill , we have perforce to resume its discussion. Without wishing to be too drastic or harsh, I would much rather be engaged in discussing something else that might be for the real benefit of the people in whose interests we are supposed to legislate. My belief is that the measure will result, not only in the duplication, but in the triplication, of activity, and, in fact, in more than its trip l ifar accomplished. cation, because nearly every State, in some sphere or other, has already covered, or is covering, the ground that is proposed to be traversed by the Institute of Science and Industry. If the Commonwealth is to launch out on the lines of this Bill , it is essential to precede it with a measure to settle once and for all, not only the Constitution of the Commonwealth, but the Constitution of every State in the Commonwealth. Without the adoption by the people of an amendment of the Constitution, giving this Parliament those powers that every National Parliament ought to enjoy, I can see that not only in this measure, but in others, we are going simply to follow slavishly along the track that has already been blazed, and more than blazed, by the State authorities. We ought to know where we are before we incur further expenditure on proposals of this nature. The present M in istry will be handed down to history as the Ministry of departmental constructors. They are establishing new Departments here, there, and everywhere, and new Departments under the auspices of government as carried on in Australia cannot be built up without a huge expenditure of money. This new Department, which has not been given statutory authority, has been struggling along now for some time, because it is four years since the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) indicated to the people of the Commonwealth that he, or his Government, intended to establish a Federal In stitute of Science and Industry. At the latter part of 1915 a Committee was established by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and held one meeting under his presidency. On that occasion How- his promise to his followers was that the Instituteof Science and Industry he sought to establish would not be controlled by faddists, theorists, or university professors, but would be an intensely practical concern, which would be useful to. the people of Australia. Since then we have dragged on for four years, and I would like to hear the Prime Minister indulging this afternoon in a retrospect of what the Institute in its embryo stage has so It would not be a very entertaining narrative. As a matter of fact, it would be a displeasing one, not only to the honourable gentleman himself, but also to the people of the country. However, we should know where we stand before entering upon a departure of this kind, involving a considerable expenditure of money, and bringing about the establishment of new Departments to do practically the same work as the States are now doing. As a first step, the Constitution should be amended to place Australia in the position that Canada o r South A f r i ca occupies. Only then will the necessary work of scientific investigation be carried, out by one authority for the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. The proposal now before us simply means adding a "" seventh "" wheel to the coach. In each of the six States there is already a wheel at work on scientific research, particularly in regard to agriculture. introducing the Bill , the Minister (Mr Groom) eulogized the efforts of some of the scientists employed in State institutions, and spoke of the benefits they had conferred on the people generally. The experiments conducted at the various agricultural colleges of the States in regard to the breeding of wheat have resulted in increased production, even in what may be termed the arid areas of the Commonwealth. A report of the Executive Committee of the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, dated the 2nd July, 1917, contains the following paragraphs :In the opinion of the Executive Committee, one of the most important functions of the Institute will he to encourage higher scientific training,, and thus increase the output of skilled specialists available for the development of the primary and secondary industries of Australia. It is hoped to achieve this result hy both direct and indirect - means; directly, by the employment; of salaried investigators to assist i i i specific researches, as well as 'by - financial grants to institutions for improved equipment; indirectly, by proving to the public the value of industrial - scientific research, thus increasing the demand for trained specialists and improving their status and .the emoluments open to them. . . . Technical Education and the Training of Artisans - In addition to the subject of the supply of scientific investigators, the Executive Committee has given attention to the question of technical education and the training of artisans. A large amount pf information has been collected from reports issued by the several Departments of Education and by Royal Commissions, and through personal interviews with experts on the subject. I quite agree that an Institute of Science and Industry will be of little value to people of Australia unless our industries - primary or secondary-are by practical men. The Working Mr Fenton. College, in Melbourne, has done splendid work in the education and training of artisans. Similar institutions are available in the other capital cities. It is a pity that they have not been established as freely as they should have been in the larger provincial centres.",41
134,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Hear , hear !",42
135,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"There is a splendid technical school in Maryborough, in the honourable member's electorate. The old School of Mines has been enlarged to in clude all the subjects taught in up-toIn date technical schools. I simply draw attention to this fact in order to point out that already the same set of .taxpayers have spent considerable sums of money in doing the class of work now proposed to be done under Federal control. I object to this proposed duplication of expenditure. No doubt there will be. need for "" cooperation "" and "" co-ordination,"" words which have been freely used during this debate, but in the States there are already technical .colleges at which a lad who is serving his apprenticeship may attend night school. Every State Department encourages .its bright young officers to improve themselves in the lines in which they are working, or in other avenues, and gives them every opportunity to get into touch with the experts in . engineering and other subjects attached to the Working Men's College and similar technical institutions. Money which is spent on .education, technical, ordinary, or university, is money well spent, but, unfortunately, the universities of Australia are not open to the sons and daughters of the poorer sections of the community.  University is open to them.",42
136,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Possibl y the road may have been made easier in New South Wales in recent years, but even if reforms have been brought about, the facilities for giving a university training to the sons and daughters of the poorer section of the community are not what they ought to be in a democratic country. I would like to see the barriers wiped away, so that wherever a genius is discovered, that the lad or lass may be given the - opportunity to pass from the higher schools to a controlled university. The present Speaker of the Men's Legislative Assembly in Victoria, who .at one time worked at my trade, succeeded in winning a couple of scholarships, and was able to attend a university. and there we can pick out men who have been able to climb to thei top of the educational tree, but great numbers of young people are debarred in most of the States from doing so. However, notwithstanding the disabilities attaching to our higher educational system in the various States, particularlyVictoria, I contend there is no need to duplicate, educational institutions simply to enable Federal control to be exercised over them. One gentleman's name has been men1 tioned during this debate,, and I desire to mention it also, because some of his work has come under m y personal view, and because I am gratified at the manner in which he applied himself to the task of getting the. producers of Australia out of their difficulties during the war. I refer to Mr Wilkinson, the Commonwealth Analyst. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Is he looking, for this job?",42
137,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"- I do not know. The only request that he has ever' made to me was when he said on one occasion, "" I wish that we had better' equipment and more appliances in this laboratory, so that we could' help' the industries of Australia, more thani we can at present."" I do not think that the honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel. Abbott) spoke in a disparaging way of Mr W kinson's work. Lti-Colonel ABBOTT - Many honourable members seemed to be carrying a brief for acertain gentleman.",43
138,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That may be the honourable member's way of expressing himself, but it is a peculiar way, and is not very nice; nor is it complimentary to those honourable members who have mentioned Mr Wilkinson's name, or to the Commonwealth Analyst himself, who, I am sure, would be one of the last to thrust himself on honourable members in seeking a position in connection with the proposed Institute of Science and Industry. From what I have seen of his work, I believe that Mr Wilkinson is one of the bestqualified men in his profession in Australia. If the honourable member for New England is anxious to learn something about the work he is doing, and about his qualifications, he has only to visit the Here Commonwealth laboratory. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT -""The appropriate time for dealing with that matter is in Committee. At this stage the debate should be confined to general principles.",43
139,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I was pointing out the machinery already in existence, and was about to show that the expenditure of a comparatively small sum of money would place the Commonwealth Analyst in the position of being able to do far more for the people of Australia than the proposed Institute could do. When the cheesemakers of Australia found that they could not carry on without rennet, which had been previously imported, Mr Will kinson set about to manufacture that very necessary' element in cheesemaking, and relieved the producers fro m a very serious difficulty. That is only one illustration of the good work he has been able to do for the producers of Australia.",43
140,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"'Then the honourable member is advocating that we should have an Institute that could do useful work of that, character t",43
141,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,We ' have such an in stitution already.,43
142,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But the work which Mr . Wilkinson did in the .manufacture of rennet was only incidental to his general duties. What we want is an Institute i l - capable of doing that work generally.,43
143,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I have instanced what Mr Wilkinson did for one primary in dustry. In conversation with me three or four years ago he said, "" I regret that I have not in this laboratory equipment with which I could test the tensile strength of steel."" No doubt the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has the machinery and experts for carrying out that work. But a comparatively poor manufacturer who undertakes a contract, the specifications of which provide for the use of steel of a specified strength, cannot afford to pay experts as the big corporations can do. What a fine thing it would be if he could go to a Common1 wealth laboratory controlled by a man like Mr Wilkinson, and have the tests made for him. Big names and magniloquent language will not bring assistance to primary industry. What is needed is the practical touch and the immediate help. At the outbreak of war the Government were urged, as one of the first actions that should be taken to help the country through the coming struggle, to mobilize chemists and analysts. Australia today is particularly lacking in commercial chemists and analysts. Those manufacturing firms that are endeavouring to place upon the market certain goods which were formerly supplied by enemy countries complain, "" Our great disability in the effort to supplant Germans and others in Australia today is that we have not the properly equipped and trained commercial chemists."" The present and past Governments would have been wise if they had paid attention to that deficiency. Chemistry has played a marvellous part in the establishment and carrying on of the industries of Germany. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) referred to the aniline dyes, which, he said, had been originally invented in Great Britain , and pilfered by Germany. I question that statement. I know that twenty-six years of chemical investigation preceded the production of synthetic dyes in Germany. Several of the great commercial concerns combined in setting chemists to work upon this problem, and after twenty-six years they discovered the secret of aniline dye manufacture. Since that day Germany has had command of the world's dye markets. In a sense, she deserved that reward, because her manufacturers and financiers were prepared to pay expert chemists to investigate continuously until they discovered the secret which has since paid them so handsomely.",43
144,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But the anjiline dyes Were first discovered by an Englishman.,44
145,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"At one time the main constituent of ordinary commercial dyes was imported from India. Then a synthetic dye was invented in Great Britain , which for some years dominated the trade in that article. Later, German chemists discovered an improved method of manufacturing synthetic dyes, and lef t the British people, as we deserved to be left, in a very bad position. In moving the second reading of the Bill , the Minister (Mr Groom) read a quotation from the report of the Scottish Commission that visited Australia. The members of that Commission were mainly practical fanners. I had the pleasure of meeting some of them, and was struck, not only with thenScotch accent, but also with their practical outlook. One paragraph of their report statedBesearch - In comparison with research work carried out in Scotland, where the subject has not received the attention which it deserves, the extensive arrangements which are made, the encouragements which are given to experiment, and investigation in Australia, are gratifying and surprising. Pleasant also is the universal enthusiasm discovered in the directors of experiment stations, and, indeed, in all connected with the work of development. It appeared to us, however, that a considerable amount of overlapping was going on, that in general there was a want of co-ordination and co-operation, that the policy of allowing each State to attempt to attack the solution of each agricultural problem by itself was not the most economical. I admit that the paragraph goes on to draw attention to an overlapping of State activities and suggests that it would be better if the Commonwealth undertook the whole of the work under one organization and authority. I repeat that if the Commonwealth Parliament were in a position to assume entire control of the application of science to industry I would support such action, but the Commonwealth is not able to do that. B y reason of the constitutional limitations placed upon the Commonwealth authority the proposed Institute will become merely the seventh authority to carry on scientific and industrial research in Australia. I see.no chance of avoiding that; therefore, I hope that the Government will see fit to withdraw the Bill for the time being.",44
146,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,There is no hope of that. The national necessities are such that this Institute should be established at once.,44
147,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The national necessities could be provided for at much less cost than is proposed in this Bill . Mr GROOM. So far the honourable member has made a 'good speech in proof of the necessity for linking science to in dustry.,44
148,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is true, as the Scottish Commission pointed out, that there is overlapping of State activities, but by the Commonwealth entering into work which the six States are carrying on the overlapping will be merely in creased.",44
149,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Scottish Commission pointed out the necessity for a Federal authority. Mr Fenton/ - Our visitors were not aware of how the Commonwealth is handicapped by the Constitution.,45
150,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,They knew of that.,45
151,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Does the Minister suggest that practical Scots would propose the establishment of a seventh expensive authority to duplicate work that is being done in each of the six State? In plain language they stated that considerable overlapping was taking place; now the Government propose more overlapping. The expenditure on this Institute will not be justified. Four years have elapsed since the scheme was first promulgated, and nothing practical has been done. The latest issue of Science and Industry, No . 4, contains a very fine photograph of Mr . I I . W. Gepp, "" an industrial leader and member of the executive committee of Science and Industry."" Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - It is a good publication.",45
152,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"F r o m a printer's point of view, I have seen nothing better. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - But plenty of meat in it .",45
153,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"There is an article by Dr Gilruth on the introduction and spread of stock diseases which most Victorians have read before. members may find articles very similar in the old files of the Victorian Agricultural Gazette. What is the advantage of issuing an expensively printed magazine for the reproduction of articles with the contents of which Victorians have been acquainted for years? In the issue to which I refer the following comment is made upon this Bill : It is proposed to snake it a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal, and capable of suing and being sued. It will have power to hold land and other property, or may accept gifts or become a beneficiary under a will. These provisions differentiate it from ordinary governmental Departments. The object is, clearly, to encourage wealthy citizens of the Commonwealth to endow the Institute, either by gifts of land or money, during their lifetime, or by making provision for it after their death. I wonder if they will rise to the occasion. I would gladly seize any opportunity to get such contributions during their lifetime from the rich men who have prospered so well in this land. If they have the money to give for public purposes why should we wait for it u n t i l they die?",45
154,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Some of them have already richly endowed the States.,45
155,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Certainl y in South Australia the wealthy men have done their duty by the State. I believe that South Australia holds the premier position in that respect, and for that I give it every credit; but in Victoria and other States we must search far and near to find a wealthy man who has endowed the community with some of his wealth, except by the endowment of chairs in universities where in the past only the sons of rich men could be educated. The article in Science and Industry continuesThose who drafted the measure evidently had in their minds the handsome bequests that certain institutions of this character in the United States of America have received from patriotic Americans desirous of seeing their names perpetuated through the centuries. The pork butcher of Chicago rendered his name imperishable by endowing some scientific or learned institute with a new library, or a much there is needed laboratory. So it is hoped that the wealthy pastoralists, mine-owners, or merchant princes of Australia will show their appreciation of the land from which their wealth has been derived by helping present and future generations to render themselves more efficient Honourable antagonists in the economic struggle to come.",45
156,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Apparentl y they intend to send out circulars asking for donations.,45
157,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I should think that the Income Tax Commissioner could f u r nish the Institute with a list of wealthy men who might well be circularized for contributions. It is to make the way easy for the handling of these prospective endowments that these provisions in the Bill are being made. The pious hope may be expressed that these clauses may not prove a dead letter, and that those Australians who have waxed prosperous in this fair and fruitful land will not be neglectful of their obligations to generations yet unborn.",45
158,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Who is the writer of the article 1,45
159,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The article is signed "" F . M . G . "" , and at the foot of . i appears the following quotation from Tennyson, "" Science moves but slowly, slowly creeping on from point to p o in t "" . That quotation would aptly describe the go-slow policy of the Government in connection with the establishment of an In stitute of Science and Industry.",46
160,Mr BAYLEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member is not helping the Government to any extent in its effort to establish it .,46
161,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am helping the Government by indulging in healthy criticism. In these days, all proposals of this kind should be closely scrutinized. we fail to look carefully into such propositions, we may expect the taxpayers to deal vigorously with us. There are other special quotations set out in the August number of Science and Industry. Here, for instance, is one that will interest the honourable member for Grampians. (Mr Jowett), who has recently joined the Farmers ""UnionThe farmer of today is an infinitely more praptical man .than .the farmer of twenty-five years ago, who sowed and reaped in uncritical imitation of his father, and who gave the old cow her free choice of what food she considered most suitable for herself. This quotation is displayed in special type, and surrounded by rule work which the printer would take much time to adjust. Here is yet another, which seems to be in the nature of a reply to the M in ister's introductory speechNatural science is a subject which a man cannot learn by paying for teachers. must teach it himself by patient observation, by patient common sense. In other words, we must teach ourselves; and unless we have a natural aptitude for the work, it is useless for us to go to teachers for instruction. The Commonwealth has not control of education; but when our Constitutions are cast into the melting-pot, I hope they will emerge in such a form as will give the National Parliament supreme power, with the right to delegate certain matters to minor provincial councils. When that is done, we shall, doubtless, have charge of education, in connection with which we ought to do in Australia what is being done in other countries. Japan, which is going to be a very keen competitor of ours, adopted western methods, comparatively t there speaking, only a few years ago, and in doing so availed herself of her educational system with marked results. The master of every school was instructed that any Japanese lad displaying certain qualities should be specially taught, with a view to the development of those qualities, and sent on from class to class u n t i l he reached the top of the tree in the particular profession, trade or calling for which he was adapted, and so with every Japanese lass. There is no such following up of our geniuses by the Education Departments of Australia. Here If and there a genius may have rich parents or an interested teacher to guide him in the course that he should follow to achieve success. But, unfortunately, one of the troubles of society in Australia today is that we have too many round pegs in square holes. We have many people performing duties for which they are totally unfit, whereas in other walks of life they would prove eminently useful. I do not know that the Institute of Science and Industry, for which this Bill provides, will help us to steer clear of such a system. Until we know where we are in this regard, why should we agree to establish an Institute to work on lines similar to those pursued by various institutions in the States? We have no money to burn, and we should know exactly what is to be done under this Bill . - The sugar mdustry of Australia owes the position that it occupies today to the He introduction of scientists and other experts by the rich company which controls it . It can be safely said that commerciallyI am not referring now to certain economic and industrial' conditions-the sugar industry of Australia has reached the highest measure of perfection because of the employment of scientists in connection with it . That may also be said of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. When the Broken Hill mines were first opened up the intention was to mine for silver.",46
162,Mr MCDONALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Some of the best ores were thrown aside.,46
163,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I believe that is so. Later on the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company waxed f at on the production of silver, but it discovered that there were important by-products, the production of which was even more valuable than mining for silver.",46
164,Mr CONSIDINE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They go in mainly for lead and zinc,",47
165,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Quite so. I dare say that today mining for silver is only of the subsidiary operations of the Barwas required. r i e r mining companies. Great developments have taken' place as the result of the application of science to the industry. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has had the assistance of chemists and other scientists, and is today turning out quite a number of products that have situation. made its name famous in all' parts of the world. Unfortunately, while we are doceeded ing all this, We are not turning our' raw said that we must proceed with it . materials into manufactured' articles anything like the extent that we ought to do. Before proceeding to establish an tute' of Science and Industry, we should political and other matters. provide for' a really' sound Tariff to tect our industries. We might have a measure. dozen scientific institutions, but without such a Tariff their work would be' of no avail. What is the use of training' our Australian artisan's if our ports' are to reand Industry? main open to the importer, who can' come in year after year with millions of pounds' worth of goods from oversea ? ' It seems' me that we should first of all endeavour to secure an amendment of the' Constitution to enableus to deal with matters ! that sbould properly be the subject of Commonwealth legislation'; that we should then build up a Tariff that' would protect our industries, and that, having done that, we might establish an Institute Science and Industry on proper' lines. In order to show that some members of the present Government at one time held the view that an Institute of Science and element about it . Industry on the lines provided for in this Bill , was not sufficient, I would point out we should train our artisans. that, in 1916, while the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was in England a large lish number oftradesmen following various dustries. callings in Victoria and South Australia waited on Senator Pearce, who was then Acting Prime Minister, and said that they were not satisfied with the promise that had been, given by the Prime Minister as to what would be the benefits accruing to industry from, the establishI ment of an Institute of Science and In dustry on the lines proposed by him. Senator PeaTce, although he is a Pree Trader, admitted that an. Institute of Science and Industry would assist Australian industries in only anindirect way. one He agreed that something more practical Mr GROOM' - And after that the Government of the day went on with the measure, and honourable members opposite did not accept the situation. Mr Fenton ^ - I did not accept the The party was not consulted in regard, to the' measure; it was prow i th because the Prime Minister He to had called Conferences on this, subject, and no doubt when he comes back he will convene other Conferences in order that Instihe may confer with) them in. regardte Our party prowas not consulted with regard to this",47
166,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Has the honourable member been opposed from the first to the establishment of an Institute of Science,47
167,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I have. That is to shown by the fac t that I took part in the deputation to the Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) on' the subject, notwithstanding' that I had received from the Prime Minister a letter stating that I would find that the Bureau which he proposed to establish would' be of great advantageto Australian industries'; I was of not satisfied with that promise, and when we wafted upon Senator Pearce we elicited from him the view that the proposed Institute had too much of the professorial The Advisory Committee say that it is most important that My contention is that we should first of all estaba scientific Tariff to protect our in We already have in the States various institutions for technical training. I think, honourable members would besurprisedto hear how many institutionsi n which technical training is given are' already established in the several States. do not complain' of. expenditure,- but - I regard this as unnecessary; and, certainly, the same set of taxpayers - who will have to foot the bill are objecting to being thus overloaded. According to the report to which I have already referred, the expenditure in connection with the Institute up to 30th June, 1917, was £3,593, and I suppose that it has very much increased in t'he intervening two years. If this expenditure was placed on the Estimates it must have been hidden away in some small corner and left unexplained by the Government; indeed, of recent years we have had no opportunty of looking into the finances, and when we do we shall be appalled. Y e t we have honourable members glibly supporting a Bill of this kind, which must involve a much larger expenditure than we can foresee. The telephone, there is not the slightest doubt, is going to play an important part in the life of Australia, which is a country of great distances. At the present time we cannot be said to have an up-todate telephone system. I am not now referring to the cities only, but more particularly to the out-back districts of the country, where it is highly necessary that the people should be placed in communication with their markets, with medical men, and so forth . Some time ago I had the temerity to ask the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) whether his Department were elaborating any extensive scheme of telephone extension in the country districts, and the honourable gentleman expressed surprise that such a question should be asked in these times. We are complaining of the rush of people to the cities, and of the few advantages enjoyed by the country people, and proper telephone extensions would tend to make country life more bearable. I feel so strongly on this matter that I should be prepared to support the expenditure of £500,000 in the direction I have in dicated. During the war work has been done in the Government workshops that was never done there before. personally inspected telephone appliances in steel, copper, and more delicate material still, and I can say that from every point of view they are not only as good, but in many cases superior, to imported articles. I have appealed to the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) to give a Mr Fenton. chance to our own trained artisans, of whom many have attended technical colleges, and one, at any rate, of whom I know effected a valuable improvement in certain appliances. And yet that man is today walking the streets unemployed, although his invention was the means of saving money to the Postal Department. Not .long ago I asked the Postmaster General whether he was prepared to have a number of common battery machines manufactured in Australia. The honourable gentleman's reply was peculiar, but I am satisfied that he will not be able to satisfactorily gainsay what has been asserted in opposition to his attitude. As was proved during war time, this telephonic material can be manufactured in our own workshops; but as soon as-peace is declared we find the Postal Department sending their orders abroad. No one can deny that all work of this kind should be encouraged, but the men who were making the appliances during the war have been put on the streets by the Government, the work now being executed by artisans in other parts of the world. I think a little "" science and industry "" in the Postal Department would not be amiss. Reform, like charity, should begin at home; we should reform ourselves before we try to reform the world. This Bill is not one that ought to be accepted by the House at such a time as this; and I feel convinced that its supporters will at some time confess that they are wrong. We ought to weigh well every proposition, especially one like this, involving the expenditure of large sums of money. I am certain that the people of the country generally will not endorse this legislation. There are great Government workshops at Newport, at Islington, Ipswich, and Clyde, and every appliance we need ought, as far as possible, to be manufactured there. We all recognise that the inventor is very much wedded to his ideas, and apt to be I have regarded as a nuisance, but inventors ought to be encouraged. The combined harvester and other agricultural implements had their origin in Australia; but it is not every inventor that can command the capital to carry out his ideas. Many men of brains have had to take their ideas abroad in order to find appreciation. In one case I can remember, in. pre-war days, two young Victorian engineers, who had an invention to dispose of, were given the cold-shoulder, not only by Australian manufacturers, but by British manufacturers. They took themselves to Germany, and there they found a firm ready and willing to give them every assistance. A special part of a workshop was set aside for them in which to carry on their experiments, and they were giver h is h salaried positions. Their invention turned out a huge success, as I am informed by a man who has personally inspected the results. If I had my way every inventor who could satisfy a committee that his invention was on the right lines, would be given room in the Government workshops, and assisted in every way to perfect his ideas. There are a thousand and one ways in which, without the expenditure of large sums on an Institute of Science and In dustry,- assistance could be given to both our primary and secondary industries. I am suprised that the Government are not keeping a tighter hand on the purse strings, for 'they must recognise that the character of the men at the head of this Institute indicates exceptional expenditure.",47
168,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,There is such piffle in their reports!,49
169,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"As to the article by Dr Gilruth, I am mistaken if I did not see a similar one in a Victorian publication some years ago. The honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) urges us to deal with, this question on general principles, but there is - too much general principle, and too little of solid practical fact brought to bear. The reports of the Institute may make very nice reading, but the hard pressed taxpayer will say, "" To Hong Kong with your grandiloquent language; who is going to foot .the bill ? "" The Institute will move along at a snail's pace, and only long days hence can the primary or secondary industries receive any benefit. I regret that the Bill is to be proceeded with. I understand that it is kept on the boards merely to fill a gap until the Teturn of the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes). If we want to establish one authority to carry out research work throughout the Commonwealth, there should be granted to this Parliament, precedent to that, the power to do so, and to tell the States to keep within their proper spheres. As it is now, with the States enjoying greater powers than we as a National Parliament exercise, they will continue their expensive work; investigation, research, and technical training will all go on in the six States; on top of all this the Federal Government will establish another Bureau, and the same set of taxpayers will have to pay for it all. I do not want much better meat to chew at election time than I shall have if we are going on with a measure of this kind. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT (New England) [5.37] - After listening to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton/ and other members on the Opposition side, one asks oneself whether they are approaching a Bill of these dimensions in a national spirit .or looking at it from a narrow, parochial, party point of view, with an idea of squashing it and refusin"" to see the meat and goodness contained within its four corners. Some of the members even on this side of the chamber seem' to have lost sight of the actual provisions of the Bill . It provides for the election of three directors, one of whom need not necessarily be a scientist, but the other two are to be scientists. They are to be appointed for five years. The Governor General appoints one of them to be chairman, and the Cabinet recommends the salaries. They are to be paid certain travelling expenses, and, in case, of incapacity, the Minister has power to suspend. A Board of Inquiry of three is appointed, and makes a recommendation to the Minister, and on that recommem'dation the Government will act. That means that it will remove the suspension cr discharge the officer. The directors have to give the whole of their time to the work. In each State an Advisory Council is appointed, and receives simply travelling expenses and fees. The most important part of t'he Bill , which seems to be lost sight of by honourable members on the other side, is that defining the powers and functions of the directors. This is clause 13, which providesThe powers and functions of the Directors shall, subject to the regulations and to the directions of the Minister, be(a) the initiation and carrying ont of scientific researches in connection with, or for the promotion of, primary or secondary industries in the Common^ wealth; (b) the establishment and awarding of industrial research studentships and fellowships;. (c) the making of grants in aid of pure scientific research; (d) the recognition or establishment of associations of persons engaged in any industry or industries for the purpose of carrying out industrial scientific research and the co-operation with and the making of grants to such associations when recognised or established; (e) the testing and standardization of scientific apparatus and instruments, and of apparatus, machinery, materials and instruments used in industry;. (/) the establishment of a Bureau of In formation for the collection and. dissemination of information relating to scientificand technical matters; and (g) the collectiou aud dissemination of information regarding industrial welfare and questions relating to the improvement of industrial conditions. The next, clause deals with arrangements with t'he States in the following terms : The' Governor General may arrange with the Governor of any State for any of the ing purposes:(a) the utilization for the purposes of Act of State research departments and laboratories and experimental stations and farms; (b) the co-operation in industrial scientific research with State vernment Departments, universities, and technical schools; and (c) the co-operation with authorities and scientific societies the Commonwealth with a view to(i) advancing the teaching (ii) the training of investigators (iii) the training Anotherimportant: clauseis 18, which gives the Institute power to dooutside work for firms:, corporations, and Govemvisit Lt - ColWel Abbott. ments, and charge for it. That is a very correct and right proceeding. The Leader of the Opposition- (Mr. Tudor) has moved as an amendment on the motion for the second reading, the insertion after the word ""That"" of the following words: before introducing a Bill to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry, the Government should have furnished the House with an estimate of the approximate cost per annum, of such an institution; and should alsohave made preliminary arrangements with the State Governments to avoid duplicatingthe existing State bureaux or work at present carried on by them. This is a Bill which will bring to life an institution that will be very far-reaching and have a considerable influence on the welfare of Australia. I do not want to approach the question from a party point of view. I thought with pleasure when I saw the Bill that it was outside the realm of party politics, and that we could look at it through national eyes, in the light of what has been done in other parts of the Empire and of the world, particularly* during the last four or five years of this gigantic war, and so profit by the experience of other countries. There is no doubt that at present scientific research in Australia suffers from the scarcity of trained men and of apparatus. We have too few laborafollowtories, and too few trained men tofill them. I have been rather fortunate in this the last three or four years in having the opportunity to see what is beingdone in other parts of the world to fill the gap and between science and industry. I had the Gopleasure of seeing at Teddington, nearLondon, the National physical laboratory, which absolutely opened one's educational in eyes to the possibilities and potentialities of this movement, and to of what a nation is absolutely losing by science in schools, technical, failing to grapple with these scientific colleges, and universities where the teaching is deterand industrial questions. Thi3 Institute, mined by those authorities; when brought to life under this Bill, is in going to fill the gap in the. same way as pure and applied science,, and the national, physical laboratories in the of technical experts; and and education of Old Country are doing. craftsmen and skilled artisans: The honourable member for Maribyr the Scottish Commissioners after their to Australia in 191.1,. but he did not read the whole of the excerpt given by the Minister (Mr Groom) when introducing the Bill .",49
170,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"He gave the substance of what you alluded to, and told you so, too. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I am going to give the honey and the meat which was not actually put before the House by the honourable member. That part alters the Whole effect of the honourable member's remarks. The Scottish Commission pointed out what had been done in Scotland, and said that they were fallin g very far short of the ideal. They indicated what we had not done in Australia, and what we ought to do. The Commission consisted of practical, far-seeing men. This is the part of their report which goes on from where the honourable member for Maribyrnong lef t off:Thero are many problems which are common to the whole of Australia, or to the greater part of it, and it would appear that time and money would be saved by placing some of the work of research in the hands of a Federal Department. For example, every State is afflicted with various stock diseases. In Queensland, there is ""tick fever""; and in another, "" dry bible""; in another, there is ""coast disease""; and so on. A strong and well-equipped Federal Department would seem more likely to cope with such diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped States Departments. The prickly pear, again, is not a State monopoly, but may, through time, spread over most of the country; and here again is an argument for Federal control, which would not absorb or limit the energies of the State Departments, but concern itself with a broader and a wider field. If that were true in 1911, how much more true is it today, and how much more has it been rubbed into us that it must be true, after our experience in recent years. It has been alleged by honourable members opposite that the Universities are academic and unpractical institutions, but what we shall see here, when the In stitute is established, is a closer association between it and the Universities. It will work in close co-operation with the Universities, just as similar institutes in the Old Country are doing. The U n i versities are permanent training bodies. Their duties are primaril y those of teaching and training. The primary duties of the Institute will be connected with research. The Institute will employ graduates; it will not make them. The graduate who has gone through the U n i versities will , in this body, finish, or perhaps start, his career. He will launch out where he can make some money for himself-a n opportunity which is denied to the scientist in Australia today. If the Institute is successful, it will impart a great stimulus to the science side of our Universities, and I think we shall find that we have the co-operation of the U n i versities, as well as the co-operation of the States themselves. It has been advanced by honourable members on the other side that we are overlapping and trenching on the preserves of the different States.",51
171,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Dea l with the members on your own side. They have said that pretty trenchantly. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I will qualify my remark by including some of the short-sighted members on this side. We find, however, that conferences have been held on all these different subjects, a great many of them in Victoria ; and i fail to discover that any of the States, or the scientists of any of the States, are opposed in any particular relation to the measure now before us. I admit that, perhaps a little less than a year ago, Mr Ryan, the Premier of Queensland, circularized all the members of this august body to oppose this Bill , for the reason that we were trenching on State rights; but I am in clined to think that, with the opportunity of further experience, and of broadening his views, Mr Ryan has withdrawn that circular, because he sees that the objection he had at that time to the prospective operations of the Institute of Science and Industry, particularly his idea that in the matter of the cattle tick, it was going to undo, instead of assisting, all the work that had been done in Queensland, was unfounded. I quite admit that the cattle tick was a problem which almost wholly and solely interested the State ofi Queensland, and that it was only the northern part of New South Wales, in the Lismore district, that had a visitation of the pest.",51
172,Mr RICHABDFOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It has climatic limitations. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - It has; but scientists tell us that in the rainfall area along the littoral of Australia-no t the dry interior represented by the honourable  that is, along the fringe bounded by the coastal range, the cattle tick will meander gracefully, in time, right down to the south. Queensland was rather afraid that we were going to spoil the work done by her Bureau in that matter; but she now sees, I think, eye to eye with us. Her people recognise that to deal with the pest is a matter of national importance. . They know that scientists in America have been able to cleanse certain areas in a certain time, and thus to push the tick gradually back. It seems to me that when a pest such as the cattle tick is likely to cross the boundaries of one particular State, it is time for the national laboratory and national scientists to step in and cope with it. It is generally recognised that Australia has been absolutely neglectful of the scientific education of her young people.",51
173,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That has been the case throughout the British Empire. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - On e cannot pick up a publication written by a man of letters of today without seeing that the shortcomings of the British Empire from both an industrial and a military point of view have been due to the nation's short sightedness in educational matters. Many young men seeking a profession in life choose law or medicine, but if it were possible to hold out inducements to our youths and girls to continue their studies at the Universities in the science classes, with the possibility of securing preferment afterwards in remunerative occupations, we should find them freely taking up a course of training which would be of the greatest benefit to the whole community. When Professor David, who accompanied Shackleton expedition to the Antarctic regions, and who has done a tremendous amount of geological and metallurgical work in New South Wales, was entertained on his return from the Pront, he said that science had played a far more important part in the war than .any one would imagine from the small hints that had been dropped from time to time. For obvious reasons, the W ar Office and the Navy had kept to themselves many of the most recent types of scientific discovery; but it was a simple hard fact that science had played an enormous part in the winning of the war. "" It is up to each one of us, as scientific men,"" he proceeded, "" to see that the importance of science for national existence, whether in peace or i h war, is properly appreciated by the public, and that scientific research finds its proper place in the history of this great Commonwealth.""",52
174,Mr BRUCE SMITH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Surely those are what one would call obviosities. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - They are; but we are so slow to apply things which are and things which have been apparent to every one, that it is necessary to rub them in with a very severe quality of salt. Honourable members have referred to some of the repetitions in that very excellent publication Science and Industry, but it is only by agitating and agitating that any reform is obtained in the world. It is only by w r it i ng and w r it i ng upon dif ferent subjects that public attention can be focussed upon them. M i . BRUCE SMITH - Does not the honourable member think that one's readers can be tired by too much repetition, so that they cease to read. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I admit that, in some newspapers, the same thing is rehashed and rehashed, but it is absolutely necessary to stress certain points u n t i l redress is obtained, and reform is brought about. Formerly the youth of this country fought shy of science. There was no opportunity of making a living as a chemist or biologist. The proposed Institute wil l convince producers and manufacturers that science will pay. If it succeeds the Universities will have more students. We know that it is only education and training that fit a man for the his life's work. The Universities and schools look to the States for financial assistance. If this Institute ceased to exist tomorrow not one penny of the money spent upon it would be available for the States. Recently in connection with an investigation into the kaolin deposits and clays of Bendigo, an advertisement was inserted in the newspapers asking for the services of a clay expert, but there was uot a sufficiently trained man in Australia. Recently, also, in Western Australia experts were required in a particular line, but they could not be obtained. There is such a dearth of trained men in Australia that some of our industries, if they axe not already languishing, soon will be. I believe in the proposal to establish research scholarships, but our experience in Australia of such scholarships is that the men of genius who have won them, and gone further afield, have remained abroad where their scientific attainments have obtained recognition. I hope that such provision will be made that Australia will not lose the services of those who gain travelling research scholarships! The most important work of an In stitute of this kind is the establishment of laboratories in which practical tests will be carried It is suggested that the cost of running the Institute will be about £15,000 or £20,000 per annum. I do not object to that expenditure provided the Commonwealth gets the value that other countries seem to get from expenditure in this direction. I recommend to honourable members opposite, and to those honourable members on this side who do not see eye to eye with the Ministry in regard to this Bill , two reports of the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the years 1916-17 and 1917-18. Lord Curzon of Kedleston was Lord President. The Advisory Council comprised-Si r William S. MCCormick, L L . D . , administrative chairman; the Right Honourable Lord Rayleigh, O . M . , F.R.S., LL . D . ; Sir George T. Beilby, F.R.S.; Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, C.M.G.; Professor J . A . MCClelland, F.R.S.; the Honourable Sir Charles A . Parsons, K . C . B . , F.R.S.; Professor J . F . Thorpe, CBE., F.R.S.; and Sir Richard Threlfall, K . B . E . , P.R.S. The recommendations of that Advisory Council in Great Britain follow almost word for word the lines which it is proposed to follow in Australia. Page 10 of the report for 1917-18 contains the following: During the year 1916-17 we devoted a larger part of our attention to the difficult questions arising out of the recommendation to your i Lordships foreshadowed in our first report, viz., that the most hopeful line of advance is "" co-operation between the various British firms in each industry and between the industries and the State in the furtherance of research."" We are glad to be able to report that the experience of this past year seems to show that the foundations have been truly laid of a movement which is likely to suit the needs of many types of industry, and may prove capable of extension to many industrial interests besides that of research. Besearch of this class is national in a more direct and obvious sense than that undertaken in the interests of any single industry, however important, and "" for that reason it is simpler and more just that all should contribute to the taxes"" to its cost. We have encouraging evidence on all hands that there is constantly increasing realization of the need for organized research in connection with industry, but the movement for the formation of research associations will receive a serious set-back if the supply of trained researchers cannot be expanded in proportion to the increasing demands, and there is considerout. able danger of this happening. They advocate what we are endeavouring to do here, and yet honourable members quibble at our Government's proposal. They advocate spending more money on laboratories where practical tests can be made. This is what is proposed by our Advisory Council- Moreover, it is quite essential that any investigator who has worked out a new process or material should be able to apply his work on a semi-manufacturing scale, so that it can be transferred to the factory byskilled men who have already met the general difficulties which would be encountered in factory application. This development on a semimanufacturing'scale is, indeed, one of the most difficult parts of research, resulting in a new product, and the importance of it is shown by the fact that all the large industrial research laboratories, however concerned they may be with the theory of the subject, have, as parts of the laboratory, and under the direction of the research staff, experimental manufacturing plants which duplicate many of the processes employed in the faotory itself. It is hoped that, as far as Australia is concerned, the Institute will soon be able to supply this defect. Later on, I hope to be able to tell the House what is happening in other parts of the world in regard to science and in dustry. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) has objected to the establishment of an Institute without parliamentary sanction. As a general rule, I do not applaud the commencement of Government institutions ""without parliamentary authority, but the step having already been taken, the Institute having been established, and its necessity having been demonstrated, - it is now useless to cut its throat simply because some one did something a few years ago that should not have been done. The Leader of the Opposition has also twitted the Government with the expenditure on the journals printed by the Institute Advisory Council, but I recommend those publications to the close perusal of every honourable member. I go further, and recommend the publishers to be prepared to lose a little more money on them, by reducing the price to 6d., so that every person in the community may become .acquainted with the work which is being done by the Advisory Council. The appointment of directors is a matter which does not concern the House. I take it that the Government will see they are properly advised in making appointments. However, we ought not to be pernicketty in regard to the salaries or fees to be paid. Let us get the best scientists and the very best brains available, and pay them well. If we can give the University graduates the assurance, that they will have ample opportunity of preferment; if we get the very best apparatus that money can buy; and if we send to the other side of the world and bring back those Australian students who have been doing most excellent work for the Empire during the war, and are now completing their - studies abroad-if we bring them back to - help us in developing our secondary and primary industries-any expenditure in this direction will be money well spent. Honourable members say that in passing this Bill we are entrenching on the rights of the States. I fail to see how some of the complex questions which are common to the whole of Australia can be handled by the States treating separately unless they go over the same ground-work. These aTe problems which should be solved by a central body, as is done in the United States of America, Canada, Great Britain, and elsewhere. Lt - Colonel Abbott. Only by realizing what is done in other countries can one see in proper perspective the need for a physical laboratory, and the part it is playing in the world's work. It was an eye-opener to me to see what was being done in scientific industry in. the Old Country. The lack of a National physical laboratory in Australia today is a crime. I am not speaking of a small academic retort in a scientist's room at the University. What we require is a .physical laboratory at which we shall be able to make practical tests in the mass, demonstrate to the manufacturer what can be done, and ask him to apply those demonstrated pro-, cesses to his industry. In order to apply science to industry, - we must have a. staff of trained scientists, .and if we wish to hold our place in the race of nations we must be at least abreast, and, if possible, ahead of, our competitors in scientific investigations and the practical application of its results. We must offer greater rewards to science. The laws of nature must be the same in the works as in the laboratory; principles which apply to the one must apply to the other. There must be no divergence between practice and theory. The tests of alloys,-to be effective, must be made on the same scale as in the works. Small .pieces of metal cool too quickly, and differ in many other respects from larger masses. So, too, in Tegard to mechanical treatment; the forging, rolling, and even casting must be carried on with an experimental plant rather than in the ordinary laboratory. Impurities, and the rate of cooling, also, must be studied. We know that in the past Great Britain has been slow to realise the need for scientific advice. What is required now is scientific control, and the sooner we realise that the better. It is ""necessary that we should create in Australia, amongst those who control our industries, an adequate appreciation of science and them its possibilities. We must make industry attractive. We must set up a National laboratory, with apparatus and experimental plant, involving the permanent employment of skilled labour and scientific supervision. One physical laboratory, for Australia should be able to supply an equipment which cannot be reproduced, in a number of colleges. we ought to be able to set up one National laboratory that will investigate and solve all the problems that beset Australia. In such a laboratory appliances could be used which it would not be safe to place in the hands of a student; to handle them we-""must have trained men. The National laboratory would work in close touch with theu n i versities and colleges, co-ordinating and supplementing their activities. the war; not on©j but many such laboratories were established by Germany. Two of the most famous were those at Char-lottenburg and Gross Licherfelde. Famous also are the Federal laboratories at Zurich, in Switzerland. States of America there are: Bureaux of Standards, and in. France the National laboratory. I . hope to seethe establishment in Australia of a National physical laboratory.",52
175,Mr MAXWELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Where ? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I have no. parochial sympathies in regard, to such project as a National laboratory. Estabtesting, lish it where you like. Le t its organizaportant tion be such that private firms may utilize it . paying fees for the work done them.. In . the greatest physical tory in England,. I , , as an Australian, delighted to find that the most important thousandth part of an inch. branch of the metallurgical work was under the control, of a young Melbourne doctor of science, who had won a travelin. ling scholarship. His work included testing of guns, weighing in some in stances over 80 tons when, completed; testing of. aeroplanes,, measuring 60 feet across the wings ; laboratory tests of the tensility of metals, the alternating stress of metals, and the breaking strain of ferent steels, so that when the parts were different munitions. put info motor cars, aeroplanes, and instance, guns, the makers knew exactly what strain they would stand. they were subject to was the test in mass in a practical laboratory, worked out on a model scaling 4 or 5 feet to an inch. When the formulas and plans - approved, they were passed on to operatives in the factories. this work as showing that, whilst we i Australia have yet to recognisescience, other parts of the world have been quick Surely to appreciate and take advantage of its potentialities. It would be the greatest delight of my life to see a. National physical laboratory established in Australia, let the cost be £10,000, £20,000, or £100,000. One honourable member stated the other day that he would spend £500,000on telephone extensions. No doubt, telephones are necessary; but let us put our money into a National reproductive work, from which we shall get Before real value, and which will determine the place that Australia is to occupy in the race of nations . 1 My hope is that when this Institute is established, it will include a properlyequipped laboratory, which will underI n the United take, amongst other things, a study of aeronautics. Aeroplanes' cannot be built under Australian climatic conditions upon models and plans designed and tested in the Old Country. We must have facilities for' testing electrical machinery, and for the testing and standardization of all forms of electricity metersy the a. standardization of thermometers, and the of gauges. One of the most im "" things in connection with metal manufacture is thetesting of. gauges. for Gauges of thediameter and calibre of laboracylinders in engineering works must be was exact enough to register within one tenI should like to know what was the experience of Australian manufacturers during the war connection with the making of munithe tions, and,, particularly shell cases.",55
176,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"We had not got, and the could not get, the formula. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I saw the women graduates of English Universities difand other scientists testing gauges for Shell gauges, for were tested to with in one tenthousandth part of an inch in order to The only test insure perfect fitting in the guns. The the gauges were then sent to the different private munition works. When I saw that testing, work in progress, I wondered were what would happen if Australia made the munitions and sent them to the Old I mention Country. I do not think it is possible, n without a proper laboratory and! a standardization branch, for us in Australia 1 to be self-contained, and to produce munitions for use with our own big guns.",55
177,Mr GBEGOKY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Tb e results obtained in England were not due to any Institute of Science and Industry. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Tb e testing of these gauges took place at the National physical laboratory, and without such a laboratory and trained scientists, it would be impossible to make shells to fit the guns with the requisite precision. Australia hopes to engage in shipbuilding on a large scale, and we must have a laboratory at which we can make our own models, which must undergo practical tests. It is a mistake to imagine that without such models and tests we can design, build, and launch ships. This National laboratory will carry on experiments in physical metallurgy and the production of tungsten steel, and will make analyses of iron, steel, and nonferreous alloys, and, chemical glassware and porcelain. The British Government has set apart £1,000,000 for a department of scientific and industrial research. Returning to the Orient, we find that Japan has voted for one year £500,000 for a similar purpose. Prance is allocating many hundreds of thousands of pounds for scientific research, and Canada, with a population of 7,000,000, less than double that of Australia, has promised to make available £1,000,000 for this work. Activities in this connection are world wide. In India, Chili, and other parts of the world, Bureaux of Science and Industry have been set up, and particularly for standardization, because they are regarded as neeessary to insure the industrial survival of nations, and because it is realized that those countries which do not give industry the aid of science straight away, will be late in the hunt. One of the results of the war has been to teach Britain that she can be, to a large extent, self-contained. Before, the war all her supplies of potash came from Germany. Now England gets all the potash she requires from a new electrolytic process. Optical glasses, for which we were formerly dependent upon the factories of Jena, in Germany, are now manufactured in England. English magnetos have supplanted the German product, and. the Mother Country is now independent of foreign countries in regard to tungsten steel, which is used in the manufacture of filaments for electric lamps; thorium, which comprises 90 per cent, of the constituents of incandescent gasburners; hard poreclain; thymol, a valuable anti-septic which the Germans produced from oil of an Indian seed; aspirin, and salicylic acid. Germany formerly had the monopoly of the production of aniline dyes, which originally were an English invention. English chemists have now made the Old Country self-contained in that respect. I mention these facts as illustrating what science can do for a country. The production of Australia in 1916 represented a value of £270,427,000, comprising: Agriculture, £60,207,000; pastoral, £89,940,000; dairy, poultry, and bee farming, £26,949,000; forestry and fisheries, £5,505,000; mining, £23,621,000; and manufactures, £64,305,000. The purpose of the creation of an Institute of Science and In dustry is to show how this production can be increased. If that is not to be its duty, its establishment will be a waste of time, money, and energy. But we know from . the history of other nations that production can be increased by the application of science to industry. Honourable meinlbers have asked what has this Institute done to justify its existence during the last three or four years. What has it done, for instance, in regard to the prickly pear? In Queensland there are 20,000,000 acres overrun with this pest, and that area is increased to the extent of 1,000,000 acres every - year. Queensland has introduced the cochineal bug to cope with it, and by this means, as well as by gas spraying and other schemes propounded by the Institute, it is hoped to keep the pest in check. Prickly pear is found chiefly in Queensland, but it also occurs in New South Wales. The discovery of a means of eradicating it is a national matter, and the Commonwealth must subsidize this Institute, and arrange for it to work with the State scientists in devising means for the extermination of the pest. We know what the Institute has done also in regard to improvements in the tanning _ of leather, engineering standardization, paper pulp, and the treatment of weevil in wheat. What Professor Lefroy has done in regard to the last-named evil speaks for itself, and the same scientific remedies will deal with weevil in maize. Much has been done in Australia to promote the cultivation of wheat. The late Will i a m Parrar, of New South Wales, by hybridizations, evolved different types of dry-country wheat, as the result of which we have been able to carry on wheat-growing in different parts of Australia where before it was thought to be quite impossible.  the same thing at Dookie College. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Perhaps so; but the foundational work was carried out by Mr Farrar. Professor Lowrie, a Scotch professor, has also, by his scientific research work, put millions of money into the pockets of wheat-growers in South Australia and Western Australia. All these works should not rest where they are today. It is for the National Parliament to say that there shall be co-ordination of activities, that the scientists in the different States shall be brought together to carry on the work where Professor Lefroy, Lowrie, and Mr Farrar left off, and that overlapping by scientists shall be prevented ; in this way, Australia as a whole will be benefited.",56
178,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Does the member approve of the method by which co-ordination is to be secured under this Bil l 1 Does he approve of the idea of having separate State Committees. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I do not know that I wholly approve of it , but I cannot suggest a better system. The directors of this Institute, whether they be in Melbourne or Sydney, must be paramount.",57
179,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Would it not be for the States to appoint their own Committees to work in conjunction with the Commonwealth Institute 1 Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I take it that recommendations made by the different States as to the personnel Committees will come before the permanent directors unless there is any special reason to the contrary. The cattle tick, although it has been an almost purely Queensland matter, is one in which New South Wales is now interested. Quite recently, largely on account of the work of this Institute, the life's history of the cattle tick has been worked out. In 1916 a committee of experts estimated that Queensland had lost £7,000,000 as the result of the direct ravages of the tick, exclusive of the losses due to loss of condition of other stock and the reduced production of milk as the result of the pest. There is also much room for in vestigation with regard to bitter p it , f r u it fly, and the codlin moth; also lung worm in sheep, nodules in cattle, and blow-fly in sheep. The ravages of the f r u it f l y have been responsible for a loss of some millions of pounds to our fruit-growers. Professor Lefroy, who recently visited Australia to in vestigate the blow-fly trouble, has told us tnat the parasite controlling blowfly in sheep in England has been discovered, and that the control of the Australian blow-fly can be definitely guaranteed. It is estimated that we suffer a loss of £3,000,000 a year because of this pest. The blow-fly maggot was first discovered in the Riverina district in 1897, and honourable members are familiar Professor with the ravages caused by it . The spread of the pest has been largely brought about by the improvement made in the weight of our sheep, and in the fineness of the yolk. One of the penalties of improving honourable cur breed of sheep has been the creation of a better harbour for the blow-fly. While dealing with the necessity for scientific research in relation to the sheepgrowing-industry, I would point out that statistics of recent years do not show that we are improving to any extent, except in so far as the price and quality of the wool are concerned.",57
180,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable better member is now on the wrong track. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I speak of the figures in relation to our flocks. In 1890 we had 97,881,221 sheep in Australia, and 10,299,913 head of cattle, whereas in 1916 we had only 76,668,604 sheep and of the State 10,459,237 cattle.",57
181,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"In Victoria today, unfortunately, we have more sheep than, we can feed, even in: a normal season, so that I would not advise the honourable member to pursuethe line of argument he has just opened up. This inability is> due only to climatic conditions. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I thought was due' to Victoria's circumscribed Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7.45. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Mr.",58
182,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I beg to call attention to thestate of the House. formed.""] Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - There is much room for scientific research by the I stitute of Science and Industry in' regard to coal. There is a loss of £200,000,000 yearly in Great Britain by the consumpwas tion of raw instead of carbonized coal. That sum represents the value of the products wasted. It is estimated that £20,000,000 is the yearly loss through failure t»' save the benzol from; which toluene, one of the three constituent parts of the high explosive T . N . T . is made. The wastages' from coal include sulphate of ammonia, the base for high explosives; anilinedyes and paints, antiother septics, and drugs'. In Australia, must make full scientific use of our' coal by-products-. In England these prices of coal'1 1913--10s . I d . per ton. 1915-12s . 5d. per ton. 191&'-15s . 7d. per ton. And now there is an additional 6s. rise. Hence, the price of iron and steel aTe in creasing' by leaps and bounds. more or less, applies in Australia; and to cheapen production, we must take tage of scientific research, and that is province of the proposed Institute. Kiau-Chau, ih' China, on the Shantung Peninsula, formerly held by Germany, are now Japanese. Japan is not so much against a' White Australia, but she is against western interference with her eastern plans. Labour' unrest in England makes capitalists wary, hence investments in China and the East with itscheap labour. Australia must combat thiscompetition, because she is a country of high favour of it . wages'; and science and cheaper production must be our. remedy English and American capital invested i factories' in China, where, by means of sweating and cheap labour, goods are produced,, and Australia is flooded, with these goods; and the Tariff, will not prevent this sort of thing. This is really a flouting of the White Australia policy, and is perhaps, worse than if; the coolies were it brought here. As a matter of fact, area. there is a boom in. foreign investment in China and other foreign countries Speaker- greater than was the case after the Napoleonic wars'. The Japanese have [Quorum gained control over the Tayeh iron mines, in central China, where there areenormous quantities of. easily-worked ores. These, of. course, are very valuable to n - Japan, in which, country there is hardly any ore; and in the twenty-onedemands that Japan presented to China in 1915 included recognition of control over those mines. When we see such developbyments in the East-chea p labour and enormous production-w e must ask ourselves the question as to what is to be the f u t u re of Australia ? Science applied to industry is the answer. The Hanyang iron works, on the river, are ru n as an adjunct to these mines. I regret that time does not permit of my dealing with many aspects of this question, which is one we of supreme importance to Australia. Perhaps I might be permitted to conclude, in are the the words of ShakespeareThere is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the' flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Isbound in. shallowsand in miseries-. On such a full sea are we now afloat; - And we must take the current when it serves, The same, Or lose our ventures.",58

Railways and Actthe ing Attorney-General) [7.54] - I desire to make a few remarks with reference to the amendment only, reserving my right to a general reply at a later stage. This Bill has been challenged by the up Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), who has submitted, an amendment; but the honourable member very properly does not challenge the necessity or the utilit y of the proposed Institute-.",58
184,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,He says he . is in ,58
185,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member There is is in favour of it , and that is' only to be n expected, for' he, himself, and his colD league, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) were members of the Government in 1916 - when the Institute was proposed. Both of these honourable members are full y acquainted with the details, and both, as I say, were members of the Government which was pledged to the h i l t to see that the Institute was brought into existence. We, therefore, ask why the Leader of the Opposition has submitted this amendment ? L et us see what the amendment is. In the first place, it declares that before the Government proceeds with this Bill , they ought to infor m the House as to the approximate cost of the InstituteThat is a strange contention when we remember that the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Capricornia were members of the Government during January, 1916, and from then to about September or October of 1916, and that the honourable member for Capricornia, although Treasurer at that time, never in that period, on any of his Estimates, indicated what was to be the cost of the Institute. A meeting was held during the month of January, 1916, to which I shall refer later on, and the proposal for the Institute was launched. During the nnancial year the Advisory Council, which was a body created for the purpose of doing work prior to the establishment of the Institute, expended £ 3 , 5 9 3 ; in 1917-18, it expended £ 7 , 1 7 4 ; and in 1918-19, £8,939.

As a member of the Cabinet, the honourable member took part in its deliberations, and is responsible for its policy by silently acquiescing; but when out of office he tries to disclaim responsibility.",59

201,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member knows as well as I do that the ABC of Cabinet government is that every member of the Cabinet is bound by that which is done by the Cabinet as a wholeis bound by the acts of his colleagues.

According to Hansard, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in replying to the honourable member on that occasion, saidThere will be the opportunity whioh the honourable member desires. In speaking on the motion for the adoption of the Address-inBeply, I shall explain what is proposed to be done, but a Bill will be introduced to provide for the permanent appointments referred to.

203,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member for Capricornia will find also from Hansard, page 4297, that at a later date he said that the establishment of such 'a bureau was a good thing.",60
204,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I say that, too.",60
205,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Obviousl y the honourable member and his colleagues will say it, because they were responsible all along for it. I have shown that while they were in the Government money was spent. I have shown the sums of money spent in each successive year. Honourable members put to me, later on, the question of what the cost of the Department wa3 going to be. That was a very reasonable question to put. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) during the debate, the detailed expenditure obviously must be shown in the Appropriation Bill ; but as a guide to honourable members as to what was in the mind of the Minister in charge of the Department when the last Estimates were passed, I refer honourable members to these two items:' On page 165 of the Estimates, £20,000 was put down for salaries, contingencies, and expenses in connection with investigation; and at page 290 of the Works Estimates, £3,000 was put down for the establishing and equipping of laboratories, experimental stations, &c. Honourable members asked me last year when that item was before the House, "" If we pass it , will it commit us to the Bill that is before Parliament ?"" The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) will remember putting that question. My reply was, "" No; the question of the Institute in its permanent form will have to come before Parliament in a separate Bill."" We are now acting absolutely in accordance with the policy as then declared. It is utterly impossible at this stage to attempt to tell the House what the cost of this Department is going to be. All I can do is to give an indication of what sums of money the Minister who will administer the Institute thinks he will require during the first year, when he is making his commencement and laying the foundations.",60
206,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It will cost only so much as Parliament permits.,60
207,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It cannot cost more than Parliament permits. In connection, with the creation of the Commonwealth Departments, a Bill was generally brought down establishing the particular Department, and then the Estimates followed, showing the appropriations that would be necessary to carry it out. Parliament, therefore, has the power of appropriation.",60
208,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Parliamen t does not always get the chance of expressing its opinion on the Estimates.,60
209,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Hear , hear! Come over here.",60
210,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I quite admit the force of the remark of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson). It is quite right, also, for the Leader of the Opposition to say, "" Come over here,"" because he and his Government were the men responsible for introducing that system. When the honourable member for Capricornia was Treasurer,' he could not always bring his Estimates down and get them through within the financial year to which they applied. Now that the war is over, let us hope that we shall revert to the normal condition of affairs.",60
211,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Are we likely to?,60
212,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I hope so. Let me remind the honourable member that last year this Government was the first Government for some time to come down with its Estimates, and get them through before the close of the year.",60
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"You "" closured "" them through in a few minutes.",60
214,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am pointing out that we got them through before the end of the year, and the moneys were voted before they were spent.",60
215,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They were very bad, and you have been pretty bad; that is the difference. Institute of Science",60
216,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Tlier e is this further difference, that we hope to he better, and our hope is founded on reason. I have shown that £3,000 was provided on the Works Estimates for laboratories and so forth. Of necessity, this scheme must mean the establishment of National laboratories. They are essential. impossible to carry out scientific investigation without them. Probably the main expenditure, apart from salaries, will be on buildings, plant, equipment, apparatus. The next point made by the Leader of the Opposition was that we should have made preliminary arrangements with the State Governments to avoid duplicating the existing State Bureaux, or work at present carried on by them. Let me reiterate what I said when introducing the Bill , that the Government has no desire or intention to duplicate work.",61
217,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But the duplication happens all the same.,61
218,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Not only have we' no intention to duplicate, but the very structure of the Bill provides for arrangements being made, not between officers, but between Governments, which should avoid duplication.",61
219,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Unfortunately , that has not been done.",61
220,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Bill provides for the making of arrangements for it to be done, and I shall presently show the House what hae been done. This work will really be supplementary to State activities, except so far as the States themselves desire to abandon activities. The desire is to cover a field that cannot be effectively covered by the States. Honourable members will see presently from one or two quotations which I shall make that there are some States which cannot possibly cover the ground effectively. If Tasmania is left unaided, will the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) tell me what appropriation it can make out of its revenues to establish a proper scientific research department to investigate, for instance, the question of mining?",61
221,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Do you think Tasmania will get any benefit in its mining from this Institute? (""20 AUGUST, 1919.] and Industry Bill. 11737",61
222,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I sincerely hope that not only Tasmania, but all Australia will benefit. Is not the vegetable l if e of Tasmania of any value?",61
223,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Tasmani a i6 the most valuable part of the Commonwealth.,61
224,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I agree with the honI t is orable member that the island is one of the most promising parts of the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth, by its appropriations, can establish scientific reand search, increase the productivity of Tasmania, and add to its population, it will be doing a truly national work. The policy of the Government, and of those who have been in charge of this Department all through, has been to act in complete harmony and co-operation with the State authorities. Let us see first how the Advisory Council originated. In January, 1916, an Inter-State Conference was convened in Melbourne by the Prime Minister, and the following were presentPresident-The Prinie Minister (Hon. W. M . Hughes). State Ministers of Agriculture-Hon . F. Hagelthorn, Victoria; Hon. C. Goode, South Australia; Hon. W. Lennon, Queensland. The Ministers of Agriculture for New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania were invited, but were unable to attend. I would emphasize the point that at that Conference, before the A d visory Council was established, the representatives of every State were invited to be present, and take part in the deliberations. In addition, the following representatives came from the several Universities: Sydney, Professor Sir Thomas Anderson Stuart; Adelaide, Professors Sir Douglas Mawson and Kerr Grant; Melbourne, Professors Masson and Baldwin Spencer; Brisbane, Professor Gibson and Dr Richards; Hobart, Dr Glasson. There were also presentInter-State Commissioners-Chairman , Mr. A. B. Piddington, Hon. G. Swinburne. President, Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia- Mr Appleton. President, Associated Chambers of Manufacture of Australia- Mr Forwood. Messrs. W. C. T. Goodman (South Australian Tramways), E. W. Knox (Colonial Sugar Refining Company), A. de Bavay, W. Russell Grimwade, W. S. Robinson, G. D. Delprat, C. P. Courtney, J. Winter Irving, Sir J. M. Higgins, W. P. Wilkinson (Federal Analyst), Griffith Taylor, G. H. Knibbs (Commonwealth Statistician); Dr Cameron (Director of Agriculture), Victoria). Dr Griffith Taylor belongs to our Meteorological Department, and is a man of very high repute. I have given the names of the representative body that was asked to consider the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry. From that body an Advisory Committee was constituted to formulate proposals to the Government to. establish a Commonwealth Bureau Science and Industry. It was most representative Committee, and presented a series of recommendations, the first of which was that a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry should be established by Act of Parliament. The functions of the Institute were then set forth, and, generally speaking, the main points were very much the same as those incorporated in. the Bill now before us. The recommendations included the followingThe functions of the Institute should be(i) To consider and initiate scientific researches in connection with, or for the promotion of primary or secondary industries in the Commonwealth. (ii) The collection of industrial scientific formation, and the formation of a Bureau fbr its dissemination amongst those engaged in industry. (iii) The establishment of national laboratories. and so forth . Another function set out was(xiii) To seek from time to time the cooperation of the educational authorities and scientific societies in the States with a view to advancing the teaching of science in schools) technical colleges and universities, where its teaching is determined upon by those authorities. The Committee further recommended(a) The control of the present Commonwealth Laboratories be not disturbed, but that they be co-ordinated, their staff increased, and their equipment improved. (6) Any new national laboratories which may be created for special purposes of research and experimental inquiry, including a physical laboratory for testing and standardizing purposes, should Be controlled by the Institute. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) recently brought under Mr Groom. my notice the question of testing referred to there. The"" Committee also recommended certain proposals of organization for the meanwhile, and suggested certain arrangements that should be made im mediately. They proposed for the in terim, pending the establishment of the Institute, the constitution of an Advisory Council. The report went back to the Conference, and I understand the scheme was adopted. It was then approved by the Government in power at the time. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Tudor) and the honourable member for of Capricornia (Mr Higgs) were members a of that very Governanent.",61
225,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,When were the university professors all brought in?,62
226,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Some were present at the Conference in January, 1916, as shown by the official records.",62
227,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,They were not there then.,62
228,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is astonishing that the honourable member should say that, when the chairman of the Committee appointed by that Conference was Professor Orme Maeson.",62
229,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What I mean is: When was it confined practically to university inprofessors, and men like Mr Donald Clark and Mr Wilkinson shut out?",62
230,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am not aware that it has ever been confined in that way. I have shown that when the scheme for the Institute of Science and Industry was first formulated, the whole of the then State Governments were asked to send their representatives. There were also present the representatives of the Universities and of different - State institutions* They formulated the scheme for this Institute, and the Bill is based on their repoTt. An Advisory Council was also constituted as they proposed, and it has done a good deal of work. It was never anticipated that it would continue in existence for so' long, because it was thought that the Institute would be established much sooner. In pursuance of the scheme certain persons were appointed members of the Advisory Council, a meeting of which was convened in Melbourne in A p r i l , 1916, by .the then Act in g Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) to consider the questions of the appointment of an Executive Committee, and of a State Committee in each State, and to make arrangements for staff, ore. At this Conference the following were present:-The then Acting Minister, Senator Pearce, as President; the State Ministers of Agriculture, Hon. F . W . Hagelthorn, Victoria ; H o n . C. Goode, South Australia; and Hon. W . Lennon, Queensland; with Mr G. Valder, Under Secretary and Director of Agriculture, New South Wales, representing the Minister for Agriculture, New South Wales; representatives of the State Universities, Sydney, Professors C. E. Pawsitt and R. D . W at t ; Melbourne, Professors D . Orme Masson, T. H . Laby, and Dr T. R. L y l e ; and Brisbane, Professor A. J . Gibson; the Inter-State Commissioners, and several other gentlemen. As a. result of the first meeting of the Advisory Council, in order that each State should have not less than three representatives on the Council, in addition to Ministers of Agriculture, who are ex officio members, the Commonwealth Government asked certain of the State Governments to nominate representatives as follows:-Queensland , two additional members; South Australia, three additional members; Western Australia, two additional members; Tasmania, two additional members. These additional members were duly nominated and appointed by the Commonwealth Government, so that representative State Committees were brought into existence in each State. In May, 1918, a. Premiers' Conference was held in New South Wales, which was attended by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) and myself. The New South Wales Premier was critical, and had suggested the following motion for the consideration of the Conference: That the Commonwealth Government be requested to cease the .procedure at present being carried out whereby unnecessary expenditure is being incurred in the assumption of functions 'by the Commonwealth Bureau of Science and Industry, which are at present being efficiently performed by the States. On page 70 of the official report of the proceedings at that Conference, honourable members will see the speech delivered by the Acting Prime Minister, who presented a complete report showing the intentions and the scheme of organization of the proposed Institute of Science and Industrv, and f u l ly explained the position. It Prime will interest honourable members if I refer them to a few of the opinions expressed by the Premiers of the various States.  Premier of South Australia, as reported on page 73 of the DebatesIn my view, this is one of the big questions which we might very well feel satisfied belong rather to the Commonwealth than to thei States, because no scientific discovery will be purely a State affair. It is simply a question of whetlier the Commonwealth can show us that we are going to have increased efficiency without duplication of the cost of the State Departments. If it can show us, then I for one will heartily support the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the departments of scientific research, because I think they would do the work much better. When introducing the Bill , I divided the work of scientific investigation into three classes-administrative , educational, and research-and pointed out that the Commonwealth Institute was primarily and practically intended for research and in  say, page 76I would like to put another view from the stand-point of the States. I do not think any State stands more strongly for State rights than does South Australia; but we regard science as on an entirely different footing from practical administrative work. Science has no boundaries, and the operations of a scientific bureau could very well .be spread .over the whole of Australia, both from the point of view of more effective work and from the stand-point of economy. What is the use of five or six different State Departments pursuing inquiries on different lines when, possibly, one body could much more effectively perform the woTk of investigation and research? Later on he addedI think that there must necessarily be greater strength in the scientific methods of the Commonwealth than in those of the States. The greater scientific knowledge which money will enable' the Commonwealth to obtain will strengthen every department, and I think that in this case the Commonwealth can very well take over all scientific investigation on behalf of the general community. Mr Lee, the Premier of Tasmania, said I think no very great harm can come of this departure, provided the Commonwealth Bureau exercises a reasonable amount of discretion-tlia t is to say, that any matters which are being investigated by a State Bureau should not be undertaken by the Commonwealth, matters peculiar to the State in which the Bureau exists. If those are left to the States, I can quite imagine there are many questions that can well be investigated by the Comnioiiwealth. In matters that are common to all the States, it appears to me the Commonwealth Bureau can effect very essential service to the whole Commonwealth. Mr Lefroy, the Premier of Western Australia, saidNo doubt the question of scientific research is more important at the present monent than, perhaps, at any previous time in Australia. There are many diseases in stock that are common to the whole of Australia, and I am of opinion that better research work could be done by one central body. There are not many men in the world who are experts in these matters. They are very difficult to obtain. If one State were able to get the services of the most experienced man to go into research work, the other States would be unable to avail themselves of his services. Although I am very jealous of the sovereign rights of the States, at the same time, I think this research work could be better done through one central body. I should be prepared to fall in with any arrangement that might have that object in view, seeing that it js in the interests of my own State that it should be done. There are ' many difficult problems which we shall have to deal with in Australia in the future, and they could be better dealt with by one central body. As I have already explained, the Premier of New .South Wales was critical. fact, he went so far as to suggest, that the Commonwealth had no interest in science. This is what the Premier of Victoria (Mr Lawson) said:I confess to a large measure of sympathy with the President's views as an expression of nn abstract principle. It is, perhaps, possible that the Commonwealth, in the exercise of this right, might logically take over certain other matters which are specifically State functions, but I do not fear that. I think we might reasonably welcome this institution as capable of doing something which, unfortunately, the States have not succeeded in doing. In the State activities and State inquiries there have been overlapping and duplication, but by. means of centralization more satisfactory results can be achieved. Mr Swinburne's memorandum, which the Acting Prime Minister read, states the case fully. In 1907-8, when I was Attorney-General, a Bureau of Agriculture was suggested, Nr. Groom. and there was adverse criticism from various parts of Australia. A carefully prepared memorandum an the matter was submitted to the Ministers for A g r i culture in the various States, and Mr Swinburne, who was then M in ister for Agriculture in Victoria, on seeing this memorandum, made a report favourable to what was proposed to be done by the Commonwealth Government. He pointed out that research work could well be undertaken by the Commonwealth, and it was this report to which Mr Lawson made reference. Mr Barlow, who was Minister for Lands in Queensland at the time, took up the same attitude. Mr Lawson went on to sayI do not want him to link up the States uncler the Commonwealth. I want him to link up the States with the Commonwealth. W it h the express object of enabling the States to link up with the Commonwealth, we have inserted a provision in the Bill which provides for the making of an arrangement between the Governor General of the Commonwealth and the Governors of the States. Later on, Mr . Lawson saidIf the Acting Prime Minister can assure us that there will be general co-operation and coordination, and that this will be done, not in any overbearing way by Commonwealth officials, but with the desire to achieve the best results, to make the most effective research, and give the community the benefit of it, I think we ought to shake hands and work together for the purpose to be achieved. In Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Therefor e the intention is to focus the work of the various States and complete it in a central Institute?",62
231,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The idea is to have a central Institute, to co-operate with the States, to work in complete harmony and conjunction with , them, and to confer with them. If there is any particular class of investigation which can be carried out better by the central In s t i tute, it will be undertaken by it ; but if investigation can be better done by the co-operation of some of the State Departments and the Commonwealth, they will work together on it . I can conceive that there may be subjects for investigation in which it will be necessary to carry out research work in more than one part of Australia.",64
232,Mr EODGEBS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,A plant may be noxious weed in one State and good fodder in another.,65
233,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Varietie s of soil and different elements must be taken into con-' sideration when looking into the results of experiments. The idea is not to duplicate unnecessarily, but to co-ordinate and work in conjunction with the State institutions in order to carry out a common purpose for the benefit of Australia as a whole.",65
234,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,And to utilize the State agencies with that end in view.,65
235,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes . As I have already pointed out, it would be ludicrous for us to put up experimental stations side by side with State establishments, which are already carrying out their work very effectively.",65
236,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It is not tended to supersede them? The intention is simply to supplement their efforts?,65
237,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That is the idea.,65
238,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,When did the honourable member for Wakefield loop the loop?,65
239,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I have not done so, but I regret that the Minister did not make this speech when he introduced'the Bill.",65
240,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,When the honourable member for Wakefield spoke I remarked early that there were between him and myself more points of agreement than there were .points of disagreement. Mr .SAMPSOST - What machinery would prevent overlapping? Is there an agreement between the States and the Commonwealth?,65
241,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,There can be no agreement until the Bill becomes law.,65
242,Mr SAMPSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What power of discipline will the Commonwealth have over the States?,65
243,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Commonwealth will have no power over the States, nor does it seek it. In this regard the States have complete sovereign power within their own jurisdiction, just as the Commonwealth has. In fact, the Bill recognises it. The intention of the Constitution is that the States shall exercise their powers, and the Commonwealth shall exa ercise its own, but that where a common purpose can be effected, both shall work together for the mutual good of the people of Australia.",65
244,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What is to be the result?,65
245,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"On e result will be a great benefit to the State of Tasmania.. I wish to show now that since the Executive Committee were appointed, they have been - working on lines of co-operation with the States. In July and August, 1916, members of the Executive Committee visited New South Wales and Queensland to explain to the State Ministers the policy of the Institute, and to secure their assistance and co-operation. In both States the Ministers who were interviewed expressed their sympathy with the work, and promised their support. At a later date a meeting was held with in- the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, with similar results. Honourable members have drawn attention to some reports published by the Advisory Council, which, they allege, contain nothing new and represent merely a compilation of previous information upon certain subjects. The way in which the Executive Committee work is this: Special committees are appointed to deal with particular subjects. Before making further investigations, they compile information of existing knowledge and past achievements. These compilations become the starting point for future investigation. In regard to the general policy of cooperation, I can illustrate to honourable members some of the steps that have been taken. In June, 1918, Dr Gellatly again visited each of the six States with a view to securing the co-operation of their Governments in the work of the In stitute. He carried letters of introduction from the Acting Prime. Minister (Mr Watt) to the State Premiers, and explained to them the proposed working of the Institute. When he was in Queensland the State Government agreed to co-operate with the Institute on the subject of the eradication of prickly pear. A scheme was devised by. which, for a period of five years, experimentation was to take place. Then he conferred with the State Government of New South Wales, who also agreed to coforest operate with the Institute in this work. As a result of those interviews, an agreement has been made .by which the monwealth undertakes to expend £4,000 per annum for a period of five years, each of the two States £2,000 per annum for the same period, to carry on experiout mental work with a view to the eradicaalso tion of prickly pear.",65
246,Mr FOWLEK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Hav e all the States agreed to that expenditure?,66
247,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No . The prickly pear pest is a problem affecting two of the States, and which might affect the Northworm ern Territory also - with the New South Wales Department of",66
248,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Why should the monwealth prefer to give money to two States? Because of the need for uniSydney, for m treatment of the States, the people of Tasmania are denied special facilities in respect of lettergrams, but the Goin vernment are able to give away thousands of pounds to other States.",66
249,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member said that he believed in the application of science to industry. It so happens that the two States w h i . h will particularly benefit from expenditure upon the investigation of the prickly pear pest are Queensland and New South Wales. The honourable member did not object to an investigation by Mr MCAlpine into bitter pit, a problem that does not concern some of the States. A truly national institution will not be bothered about State boundaries. It will be guided only by the consideration 'that there is a disease affecting - animal or plant l if e in some part of the Commonwealth, and that it may spread and - can.se great destruction.",66
250,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I am not objecting to the expenditure on the investigation of prickly pear.,66
251,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Her e is another illustration of co-operation with the States. The New South Wales Government have agreed to provide £1,000 per annum for five years to be used in co-operative work with the Institute in investigating the white ant, blow-fly, and other pests. In addition, the New South Wales Forestry Commissioners have agreed to co-operate with the Institute on a pound per pound basis in carrying out research work into products, the work to be controlled by a joint committee, and to be carried - out at the Sydney University. The New ComSouth Wales Education Department is . also co-operating with the Institute in and connection with the investigations into tanning matters which are being carried at the Tanning School, Redfern; and into yeasts and bread-making, which are being carried out at the model bakery at the Technical College. The Director of Agriculture in New South Wales and several State officials are members of the Advisory Committee of that State. Work is also being done on investigations into nodule in cattle in co-operation ComPublic Health and the Sydney University. Officials of the Australian Museum in a semi-State institution, are cooperating in investigating marine biological problems; and experimental work regard to the electrical sterilization of milk ds being carried out at the tramway workshops in Sydney. In Victoria, Dr Cameron, the Director of Agriculture, and Mr A . E . V . Richardson, the Superintendent of A g r i culture, are both members of the Executive Committee of Che Advisory Council, and the Department which they control is heartily co-operating with the Institute, more particularly in connection with the viticultural researches being carried out at Mildura under a co-operative scheme in which the Mildura Research Association of Growers finds 50 per cent, of-the necessary money which is raised by means of a levy <on their - produce. The Victorian Department of Agriculture is also cooperating with regard to castor seed in vestigations, and in connection with the work being done on seed improvement. Dr Gellatly visited South Australia. Both the Director of Agriculture and the Director of the Chemical Department in that State are members of the State Committee. Investigational work is also being carried out in the laboratories of the Adelaide University. In Western Australia a large amount of investigational work is in hand, mostly under the join t control of the State Government and of the Institute, each party bearing 50 per cent, of the cost. This Bill empowers the Institute 'to hold land. The 'Western Australian Government have offered to the Institute a sum. of £5,000 towards the capital cost of the erection of a forest products laboratory, as well as 25 acres of land as a site. Honourable members know how important the timber industry is to Western Australia. The clays of that State are being tested at the laboratory of the State Mines Department, and the State Wheat Commissioner is working in conjunction with the Institute. At the request of the Western Australian Government, an investigator has been sent abroad to inquire into modern methods of running a forest products laboratory, and half the expense of the t r ip is being borne by the State Government, and half by the Institute. The chairman of the Western Australian In dustries Assistance Board is a member of the Executive Committee of the Advisory Council, his appointment having, been made at the request of the State Government. The Tasmanian Government also is represented on the Advisory Council, and a certain amount of investigational work h being carried out' in that State. Mr MCWILLIAMS , - Will , the mention onepest for which, the scientists have found a remedy?",66
252,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Eve n if I ' am not able to do that, the honourable member will admit that it is high time we established a properly equipped and staffed Institute which would make those discoveries. In the past the State Services have included men of exceptional ability, but who have, in some cases', not been able to work to the best advantage because of the limitations placed upon them. I remember that some years ago the Queensland Government had in their service one of the best scientists in Australia; but instead of being able to devote the whole of his energies to the solution of one problem at a time he was expected to give attention' to many different problems, nnd, of course, he could deal with none of them completely. In order to satisfactorily investigate a particular pest, one man must be deputed to work out its whole l if e history. The investigation may occupy years. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) was responsible for appointing Mr MCAlpin© to ins1 vestigate bitter p it in Australia.",67
253,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The investigation cost about £10,000.",67
254,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The expenditure, whatever it was, was justified.",67
255,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I am not sure that it was.,67
256,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If the honourable member had consulted the reports in his Department, he would, have found that the scientists in theTJnited States recorded the fact that Mr MCAlpine had carried the investigation of bitter p it to a higher point, than it had ever before, reached, and he was complimented on the work he had done'.",67
257,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What good did he do?,67
258,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member might put the same query in regard to every scientific investigation.. Scientific investigators often obtain only negative results.,67
259,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,He discovered nothing.,67
260,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That does not prove that nothing will be discovered in future. Minister If the> honourable, member believes that he might as well, surrender all hopes for future greatness in ournational life. My view is that these problems which confront, us must besolved; the difficulties must be overcome-. Surely every advance of science gives us hope for a solution of the troubles that beset us. - I have dealt only with the amendment, and have endeavoured to show that the charge made against the Institute of fail ing to co-operate with the 'States is not justified. I have shown, also, that it is impossible for me, at this stage, to give in detail the cost of the Institute. If it is to do useful work, it must be able to command the services of the best men.",67
261,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Can the Minister say what amount the Government propose to spend this year on the Institute ?,67
262,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No . When starting the Institute, the Minister in charge thought it would be necessary to place upon the Estimates for l'918-i9 £20,000 for salaries and contingencies and £3,000 for the laboratory. The Estimates for the current financial year have not been laid upon the table, and I cannot disclose them.",67
263,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Has not Dr Gellatly said that he expects to get £60,000 or £70,000 per annum.",68
264,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Assumin g that the Institute's annual expenditure did amount to £60,000 or £70,000, that would not be very large, having regard to the fact that Canada is spending £1,000,000 per annum on the same work. It is not so much a question of the amount as of the wisdom that will be shown in making the expenditure. The Institute is not going to be a success unless we can secure the services of the best men to tackle the problems with which it will have to deal. The Executive must have a free hand in determining the selections to be made and the salaries to be paid. Given capable scientists, we must not stint them in so far as laboratories, apparatus, and materials are concerned.",68
265,Mr RICHABD FOSTEE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The ments made in Tegard to the elimination of weevil from wheat have been worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth.,68
266,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"In respect of those experiments, I think the salaries paid involved an expenditure of only some £3,000 per annum. The important point we have to remember is, as mentioned recently by a State Premier, that highly-trained investigators are difficult to obtain. We hope that in time we shall be able to secure such men from our own Universities. They are the training grounds, and in our laboratories our men will serve their apprenticeship. I hope that in days to come we shall have, perhaps at the Seat of Government, a post-graduate University. are post-graduate classes in the United States of America, to encourage - men to develop the higher branches of science. We, however, have not yet reached that stage. We are a young community attempting to people a continent, and are face to face with all the pests and difficulties of first settlement. We are facing these practical problems in a practical way. We are anxious in the fight to apply the highest principles of science to aiding the man engaged in industry. The object of this Institute is entirely practical. It is facing, and will face, practical problems, with a view to applying science to industry. Surely Australia is not to be the only nation that has come out of the war without learning the value of the application of science to industry. Every country is realizing the necessity for the extension of these institutions, and their greater utilization in the direction of helping its industries. I hope Australia will not lag behind. As an Australian, I am jealous of the reputation of my country. I want to see Australia taking its part in scientific investigation. A number of young Australians have gone abroad and have secured employment in the highest branches of scientific research. Names of such men who are occupying high positions in the scientific world of the British Empire today could, if necessary, be experigiven. My desire is that they shall be employed in our own laboratories, and making here contributions to the scientific knowledge of the world. The Leader of the Opposition spoke rather hurriedly when he said we had not been co-operating with the States. We have been co-operating with them, and desire to continue that co-operation. Most of the scientists of the States with whom I have come in contact are anxious that this reform should be brought about. I hope that before Parliament is prorogued this Institute will have become established in Australia, and that it will prove one of the most beneficial institutions in the Commonwealth.",68
267,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"B y way of personal explanation, I desire to inform the House that, in regard to the statement made by There the Minister (Mr Groom) concerning my attitude towards this Bill, I stand where I stood on l l t h July, 1917, when I urged that honourable members should have an opportunity to read and study the report before being called upon to take definite action. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) promised, in reply, that he would make a full explanation. He saidTliere will be the opportunity which the honourable member desires. In speaking on the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply, I shall explain what is proposed to.be done. A Bill will be introduced to provide for the permanent appointments referred to. Honourable members will search Hansard in vain for any such explanation. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister, for a reason that honourable members may recall to mind, did not make a speech on the Address-in-Reply.",68
268,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I also desire* to make a personal explanation. The Acting At torney-General (Mr Groom) has produced a volume of Hansard, and has told the House, in so many - words, that on 1st May, 1918, I - was supporting the Government in regard to this measure.",69
269,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I did not say that.,69
270,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member quoted, from a speech made by me, the statement, ' ' The establishment of such a Bureau is a good t h in g . "" He did not in* form the House that the remainder of that speech by me was devoted to a criticism of the methods of the Government, and that I complained that £22,000 was to be spent in an unpractical way.",69
271,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I merely made the quotation to show that the honourable member was in favour of the establishment of the Institute at that time.,69
272,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member misrepresented me.,69
273,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I did not intend to do so.,69
274,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Honourable gathered fro m the Minister's statement that I was adopting an inconsistent attiand tude, whereas the whole of the speech from which he made this brief quotation was in criticism of the methods of the Government. I urged that they were malting political instead of scientific apprimary industries. pointments, and complained of. the - way in which the Bureau was acting in investisaying gating the prickly pear pest, and issuing lengthy reports about the production alcohol for power purposes, same time it was apparently ignoring volumes of writings on the subject. am much obliged to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to make this planation, and I hope that honourable members will not take the Acting At torney-General to be the Simple Simon that he looks.",69
275,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Wannon) [S.52] - We can safely say that in the debate that [4411 has taken' place upon this measure ' we have, been undergoing a lesson in the kindergarten of Australian science. The speech made by the Acting Attorney General (Mr Groom) in introducing this Bill , I regret to say, was, from my point of view, lacking in that material information with which the House should be furnished when it is asked to launch a measure so wide in its scope and so full of possibilities as this will be. This question of the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry h'as been before us in one form or another for many months, and I do not hesitate to say, without any personal disregard for the Minister who' in troduced it , that up to the present I ain dissatisfied with the sketch that has been made of the great national work to be undertaken by it . It is quite wrong for the Minister, in a restive way, and with some show of irritation to charge honourable members, and particularly those who sit on this side of the House, with a call6us disregard for the teachings of science, and the value of science as applied to industry. We all honour the world's great and eminent scientists. Scientists, however, do not grow on every tree. We cannot pluck them as we pass, and have the great problems of our country submitted to an Institute of this description, believing that when it reports upon them the last word will have been said, or that we members, shall have scientific discoveries that will remove all the' ills to which the animal plant l if e of .this planet are heirs. I want, quite early in my remarks, to say that I have been keenly interested I D the application of research - work to our The' Acting At torney-General will do me the credit of that when the Bureau of Agriculture Bill was before us he probably had of not a more ardent supporter in this while at the Chamber than I was ",69
276,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Hear , hear! I Mr Rodgers - But when the Government come down with this new-fangled exnotion of immediately harnessing science to industry-whe n they introduce a Bill which is really another blank cheque, .to be passed on by the Government to a board of directors, just as was done in connection with repatriation- I feel that' I have cause to complain. In connection with, the work of repatriation, the Govern- \ ment passed on a blank cheque to the ' Commission, over which Parliament certainly had control, although it had no voice in the allocation of the money.. It had power only to stop an expenditure to which we were already committed, and so to hold up the whole scheme. It is not in this way that I am prepared to support the Government in the establishment of a Bureau of Science' and Industry.",69
277,The DEPUTYSPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND," I remind the honourable member that there is an amendment before the Chair, and that if he continues on the lines he is now following he will be held to have spoken on the main question.",70
278,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I shall be satisfied to speak to both the original question and the amendment at the same time, provided that in doing so I shall not be in conflict with the Standing Orders. I desire to deal with the principles embodied in this measure. On the very day that the Acting Attorney-General moved the second reading of the Bill ' those of us who represent country interests were faced by the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster), who, with his back to the wall, said that he was unable to secure another pound to provide postal and telephone facilities that are actually required to enable people to carry on existing industries, and to meet actual necessities from day to day. The honourable gentleman said that he could not promise that the Treasurer would provide any morejnoney to help us in that direction. other hand, the Minister came down with this Bill , which is in the nature of a blank cheque to be filled in , and expended upon an investigation of scientific blessings yet undiscovered. It provides for an expenditure without l i m it , and, in the main, without any parliamentary supervision. I regard the financial aspect and the possibilities of this Bill some alarm. I am not prepared to vote for such a blank cheque. We are confronted with a staggering debt of £750,000,000, with its attendant gigantic interest bill . We have staring us in the face the fact that within a few years the whole of the debts of the States and the Commonwealth will have to be converted at a high rate of interest, which will mean the levying of still greater imposts. We 0 have gigantic obligations in respect of pensions, and the work of repatriation, for which many millions, of pounds wili have to be found. There is also to be considered the daily increasing cost of government. In these circumstances, £ am not prepared to sign another blank cheque to be handed over to a board of directors, who will certainly be under the guidance of a responsible Minister, but of whose research and investigations a Minister who is a layman can know but little. If the Minister holds up these scientists in the investigation of any problem, what will be said? If honourable members scan the four issues of Science and Industry, the official journal of the Institute, they will find that practically .every subject under the sun may come within the scope of the Institute and be the subject of its investigations. Of course, we can only hope that sane, practical, common-sense men will not waste the nation's money in fruitless research after illusory and impossible remedies. I ask honourable members to scan the whole of the subjects dealt with in the f o u r issues of Science and Industry. If we are going to submit the whole of the difficulties that face the industries of the country to scientific research, the public purse will be affected to an extent to which I am not prepared to consent without some further safeguard against a body over which Parliament has no control. I do not wish to reflect on the ability of Australian scientists, but I wish to make it On the clear that I think the Government might have gone on more practical lines. The Minister (Mr Groom) in , as it were, another second-reading speech, has mended his hand a good deal since his first speech, and has now given us much more information. I do not believe, however, that practical co-operation exists between the Commonwealth and the with States in connection with scientific research. I invite the Minister to read the debates going on at the present time in the Victorian Legislature on the Dairy Produce Bill . He will there find the keenest resentment expressed by the State Government at the attempt by the Commonwealth Government to take absolute control of the whole of the dairying in dustry of the Commonwealth, irrespective of the varying conditions of the States, ancl of the investigations by State dairying supervisors and scientists. The proposals of the Government are of such a character that"" if they are carried out they will take out of the hands of the States the whole control of the dairy output of the country. This, in itself, shows an absolute lack of any arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States in these matters.",70
279,Mr RICHAR DFOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,And the markable thing is that last week the Queensland Government fell right into the Federal Minister's arms tion.,71
280,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am in closer touch with the Legislature of ""Victoria than with sults. any other, and I know that today there is no pre-arranged plan between the Combut monwealth and that Legislature with resent gard to scientific research in primary industry. I beg to offer a suggestion to the M i ister. The harnessing of science to i dustry in the proposal before us may that regard be judged by the machinery provided. There is the Board of Trade, the Department of Commerce and In dustry, and the Institute of Science Industry ; and these bodies are, no doubt, country. intended to represent the system under which science is to be applied to industry. My suggestion to the Minister is to with draw the measure and take counsel w it the States. He must remember that, with regard to primary industries, there are already in existence in the States partments of Agriculture with responsible Ministers, directors, superintendents, and scientists for research. For instance, in Victoria there is investigation going in wheat-breeding, and the Commonwealth Government cannot improve on it except by transferring the officer in charge to Commonwealth Department. State officers with higher salaries to the Commonwealth Service is not a likely way to produce harmony. I am sorry that the Minister (M Groom) should, apparently, take up the attitude that everybody who speaks fro m against the Bill is opposed to the ings of science, and takes a dark and consulted in connection with [441]- 2 gloomy view of the f u t u re of the country. That is a fallacious, and, if I may say so, a silly attitude. Men who believe they are doing their duty in analyzing this measure should not be regarded as objecting to science in industry.",71
281,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I never said that.,71
282,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But it is so; at any rate, I am sure it has been felt by the Minister himself that I am an opponent of the measure. re- Mr GROOM - I always looked on the honourable member as in favour of in vestigation and research work, especially on the quesin primary industries.",71
283,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But I wish to proceed on lines that will give practical reFor scientific research, I am in favour of the most liberal endowments; I repeat that in the States at the pretime every branch of agriculture has its particular experts and scientists. In addition, there are the unrewarded scienn - tists who work practically in the field ; n - and as one who is closely associated with in primary industries, and who takes the greatest interest in them, I say that in the fields we have some of the best scientists of today. The knowledge these and men have gained is not lost to the I was much interested in the speech of the honourable member for New England h (Lt - Colonel Abbott), which, from the point of view of secondary industries, was an excellent one. He referred .to the Deapplication of modern methods, particularly to armaments, and showed us the quickened activity that has been brought about by scientific research. But does on the Minister think that in this young country we can apply those methods to all our secondary industries? If we try to a do so, we shall have all sorts of wild-cat To tempt schemes, and men rushing to get the In join stitute credentials. We ought*to.proceed along careful, well-thought-out lines, and therefore, I suggest to the Minister that r . the Government should confer afresh with the State Departments. I can say first hand knowledge that the blessVictorian Government has not been many fields of research connected wdth primary inudustry - If this Institute commences on lines which the States have already followed, it will only he going over elementary' investigations already made. Let whatever is .done he practical. The Govrnment should call a halt, and see, at any rate, if the field of primary production cannot be left to the States. Under the Federal Constitution the lands and the land laws are left to the State Government, on which there is the greater obligation to deal with the difficulties and troubles in primary life. The soil, for instance, is a subject for investigation as wide as the continent, and there are also the underground water supply, the timber resources, and the metal resources, apart altogether from animal and plant life. With regard to secondary industries the States have done very little; and here a fruitfu l field is offered to the Commonwealth. In each of the States there are universities and schools; and if the Government think that there is not now sufficient investigation, let those universities and schools be liberally endowed. But does the Minister think that those who are engaged in secondary industries have not their own scientists? With the Colonial Sugar Refining Company there are twenty-one chemists, who have studied every side of the sugar industry. No Institute of Science and Industry would ever be able to achieve the results that have been achieved in connection with that company.",71
284,Mr BAMFORD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Thes e results were brought about by scientists.,72
285,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Does the honourable member assume that there can be no scientific discovery except under Act of Parliament? The great scientists are mostly unrewarded men, who are able to devote their lives to the investigation of particular subjects. I understand that it is the desire of the Minister to adjourn this debate now, with a view to introducing other business, and I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later hour of the day. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA OFFICES. NA COMMITTEE. . Debate resumed from 7th August {vide page 11405), on motion by Mr GROOMThat, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Publio Works for their report thereon, namely :-Erectio n of Commonwealth Note Printing Offices on the site recently acquired in Victoria-parade, Fitzroy, Melbourne, Upon which Mr Charlton had moved, by way of amendment- That all the words after the word "" Offices "" be left out.",72
286,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [9.13] - I am prepared to accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton). Mr SAMPSON .(Wimmera) [9.14] I do not wish to delay the passage of this motion, but I think this is the proper time to point out that there have been certain irregularities in connection with similar motions in the past, and an absence of that authority which is necessary after the report of the Public Works Committee has been brought before the House. This Committee was instituted in 1913 with the object of giving the House an opportunity to check expenditure on public works. It was appointed as a Committee of this Parliament to be altogether independent of the Government. Its duty was to make independent investigations and present independent reports to the House, which had then to decide whether certain public works shall be carried out. That has not been the result. In order to doubly safeguard the position, the Act provides that it is necessary to bring down a motion, and to submit to the House estimates of the probable cost of the work proposed to be remitted to the Committee, and that after the Committee has presented its report the House shall, by resolution, instruct the Government whether the work should be carried out or not. So far as I can ascertain, the most important part, that is, the instruction by the House to the vernment whether the works shall be works. carried out or not, has rarely been asked for by the Government.",72
287,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,It was done last year.,73
288,Mr SAMPSON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"It was done on one occasion, I believe. It is very important that the House should know exactly where it stands in relation to the Public Works Committee.",73

290,Mr SAMPSON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"On reading up the debates that took place here when the Public Works Committee Act was passed. I find it was specifically stated that the was introduced to provide a check on the publio expenditure of the Commonwealth, so that no Department should be able start a work and have it very nearly completed before the House was asked vote the necessary money. It was felt that the House should be placed in possesCommittee sion of particulars showing the necessity, or otherwise, for the expenditure of money on publio works, by means of a Committee that would be the servant of Parliament and not the servant of the asked Government. Section 15 of the Act vides:No public work of any kind whatsoever (except such works as have already been authorized by Parliament, or which are authorized during the present session, and except works for the Naval or Military defence of the Commonwealth exempted by Order in w i Council from the operation of the Act), estimated cost of completing which exceeds Twenty-five thousand pounds, and whether such work is a continuation, completion, pair, re-construction, extension, or a new shall be commenced unless sanctioned as this section provided. It is provided that the Committee shall make the investigation with all convenient despatch, and, further, that after the receipt of the report of the Committee, "" House of Representatives shall by resoluon tion declare either that it is expedient carry out the proposed work, or that it is mittee ? not expedient to carry it out."" In only one instance has the Government complied with that provision. It is time t'o remind Act. the House that it is likely to lose its grip Goon the expenditure on important public",73
291,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Does the honourable member say that that has been done only once ?,73
292,Mr SAMPSON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I can remember only one occasion when the House has been expressly asked by the Government to confirm the report of the Committee by resolution before the work recommended by the Committee was taken in hand. that I Mr TUDOR - What instance was that? [Quorum Mr SAMPSON - I think it was the last work recommended by the Committee. I was not in favour, as a member of the Committee, of the Cabinet remitting the question now under discussion to the Bill Committee. This House should jealously preserve its right to instruct the Committee to make investigations. It is the duty to of Parliament, and not the duty of the Government, to remit questions to the to Committee. I hope in future the House will see that any work referred to the is so referred by the House, and that no investigation shall be undertaken by the Committee on the instruction of the Cabinet. I know there is a possibilit y of an amendment of the Act fteing for to give the Cabinet authority to proremit important works to the Committee for investigation, but I hope the House will never sanction anything of the kind.",73

297,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Hav e you ever done so ?,73
298,Mr SAMPSON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The Committee has on several occasions in its annual reports drawn attention to anomalies or evasions of the Act. There is a disposition .on the part of some Ministers to evade deliberately the provisions of the Act by constructing public works piecemeal. That have parts of an important work carried out from time to time, until the total cost greatly exceeds the £25,000 l i m it mentioned in the Act. The House should jealously watch its rights in that direction.",74
299,Mr MATHEWS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Particularl y in the case of the Defence Department.,74
300,Mr SAMPSON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I am glad the honregard orable member has reminded me of that. From my investigations as a member of the Committee I have come to the conclusion that very few, if any, of the public works carried out for the Defence Department should not be brought strictly under the purview of the Committee. No public works of any importance for the Naval or Military Departments can be carnied out without State secrets connected with them being imparted to responsible members of the Naval and Military Boards, and it is a reflection on Parliament, and on the members of its Committee, to say that the House cannot trust them to investigate important naval or military works. It might not be advisable to publish the full evidence, but Parliament certainly ought to have a knowledge of the details of the policy which ultimately it has to finance. I hope that in futur e the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act will be strictly adhered to, firstly, by obtaining the authority of Parliament to remit to the Committee every work that comes within the purview of the Act, and, secondly, when the report of the Committee is presented, by the authority of Parliament being sought for the carrying out of the work. I trust, also, that the disposition shown in the past by the Government to exempt what they consider to be important naval and military works from the investigation of the Committee, will be very sparingly shown, if shown at all. The present practice means that the Cabinet overrules the right and privilege of this Parliament to control the expenditure of public money. It is difiicult enough for the House to check the ordinary expenditure of the public Departments. The tendency is for that expenditure to grow, unless the House has the opportunity of discussing the Estimates before a great part of the money is exis, they pended, Parliament, however, can do something towards checking unnecessary expenditure on public works, and the Public Works Committee Act was passed to insure that that expenditure should be brought directly under the purview of Parliament. The Public Works Committee was created as the buffer between the Parliament and the Departments in to public works expenditure, and the Committee should be responsible only to the Parliament that has created it . I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton). It will give the Committee a freer hand in investigating this important work. In that sense, I am pleased that this debate has taken place. I trust that in future the House will make a little closer investigation into the question of whether the Committee is carrying out its duties as they should be carried out, and preserve its rights and privileges in the directions I have indicated. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BILL. SECOND READING.",74
301,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Gwydir-Postmaster General) [ 9 . 2 9 ] - I m o v e That this Bill be now read a second time. It does not require very much argument to convince honourable members of the soundness of the principles underlying this brief measure. The proposition is merely to bestow upon the Commonwealth the same power and right to control wireless telephony as it has in connection with wireless telegraphy. When the principal Act was passed, wireless telephony was not in vogue. It has since become a reality, and the Commonwealth Government now seeks to acquire the right to control that particular f a c i l it y i u the in terests of Australia as a whole.",74
302,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Yarra) [9.30] - I am anxious to safeguard the Government in every possible way, and have no objection to the Bill going through. It is right that control should be exercised over less telephones as well as over wireless telegraphs, but I should like to know whether the litigation with the Australian Wireless Limited has been settled, and what is the exact position of those persons in the community whose little experimental plants were necessarily dismantled on the outbreak of war. I understand that these small plants can receive messages, but cannot send them, but many young Australians are interested in them and have been experimenting in wireless telegraphy in order to discover improvements if it is possible to do so. I think it well to allow the youth of the community to conduct experiments in, this connection if they could be permitted to do so with perfect safety to the community.",75
303,Mr LAIRD SMITH,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Denison) [9.33]. - iSmal l wireless stations, although they may not have the power to make themto-night selves felt in the big commercial stations, are in a position to pick up every message sent out from the latter. In my opinion, wireless telegraphy will be more and more used in place of metallic lines, and, consequently, these small stations, if are permitted, will learn everything that is taking place in business matters. utmost secrecy is observed on land lines.",75
304,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,But are not most busithe ness messages sent in code?,75
305,Mr LAIRD SMITH,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Many messages are not sent in code. A report from the Northern Territory was handed into wireless station in the Territory, and, my opinion, the Germans picked up the message, because subsequent events seemed to indicate that they knew as much about it as the man who had sent it. If small wireless stations are licensed all over tralia, there will be nothing to prevent the people who establish them deriving considerable advantage from learning of commercial transactions about which they should know nothing. The Posthear mlaster-General (Mr Webster) should have explained clearly to what extent proposed to go in this direction.",75
306,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Is it not a fact that in addition to the Commonwealth stations in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, and Northern Territory, there wireare big wireless stations controlled by Australian Wireless Limited?",75
307,Mr LAIRD SMITH,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Such may be the case, and I want to learn the extent to which these private stations will be allowed to receive messages, and whether there will be periodical inspections by a Commonwealth officer.",75
308,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,There is far more danger of these big stations picking up messages.,75
309,Mr LAIRD SMITH,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Yes ; and it shows how far-reaching this business is. When I was connected with the Post and Telegraph Department a young official was seriously dealt with for divulging the contents of a message. I may be beating the air now, because of the limited information given by the Postmaster-General. Had I known that, this Bill was coming forward I would have been better prepared, but I think it was Senator Gardiner, who said that Mr Swinburne, the expert who was brought out from England to report on the Australian wireless system, reported that it was a Telefunkenthey Marconi combination, and that the Australian Shaw wireless was 30 per cent, The more efficient. We know that the Telefunken system is the German one, and that Germans will still have their power stations. The Postmaster-General should have told us how far these people would be permitted to equip wireless plants all over Australia, because, the, if permission to operate plants is in given to one school, it must be given to another. It is quite an easy matter to fit up a local system within a building for the training of operators; in fact, complete wireless plants arp offered for sale Ausin the windows of various establishments, and wireless operators are being trained everywhere. It is quite a fascinating occupation. One has the ear to pick up sound reading and can very quickly and easily what messages are being received or despatched. It is simply a question of he becoming accustomed to sound reading as against sight reading. Operators are required all over Australia; in fact, all over the world. There will be a great demand for them on vessels, and my opinion is that the Government should exercise some control over their training. The man who is wrongly trained is nothing but a nuisance to a carefully trained operator. One can easily make a mistake in sound reading. Many so-called sound readers are simply guessers. Some men who were brought from Great B r it a in to Western Australia in the gold boom claimed to be good sound readers, but messages sent at twenty words a minute very soon stuck them up, whereas Australian-trained operators were quite capable of taking messages sent at for t y words, a minute. A poor operator on a quadruplex line is a great nuisance to good operators, because he is constantly breaking in , and asking the man at the other end to repeat something he has already sent over the line. At sea the lives of people are dependent on the wireless operator; and it is the Government's duty to see that no poorly trained man is appointed on any vessel. The Postmaster-General who introduced this important Bill with half-a-dozen words is a man who usually goes into details, and claims to have a thorough grasp of the work of every section of the Department under his control. I am very disappointed that he did not give us a complete statement as to the control the Government will exercise under the Bill .",75
310,Mr FENTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Maribyrnong) [9.44]. - I presume that the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) takes it for granted that honourable members are as conversant with this subject as he is. No doubt he is the repository of a considerable amount of information upon this matter, but I would like to have had some more information from him in reference to the position of those persons who were conducting private experimental stations prior to the war. These gentlemen have rendered splendid service on transports and other vessels. I have in mind one man who was engaged as a wireless operator on transports during practically the whole of the four and a half years of war. He sailed on all seas, and rendered excellent service, and I am glad that the Government have decided to include these wireless operators amongst those who deserve recognition for having done their little bit in connection with the war. I expected the Postmaster-General to in form the House of the latest developments in wireless telephony, which, I believe, will be of great advantage to Australia. If the equipment does not cost more than that required in connection with the present system of telephony, the wireless system should mean much to this country of great distances. I should like the Minister to inform the House of what measure of success has attended wireless telephony in other countries, and the possibility of its general adoption throughout Australia.",76
311,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Gwydir-Postmaster General) [9.47] - I am surprised that honourable members should expect wireless telephony to be discussed on this Bill , which merely extends to wireless telephony a control that is already vested in the Commonwealth in respect of wireless telegraphy.",76
312,Mr BOYD,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,How much does the Postmaster-General expect to save by the Bill ?,76
313,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"No question of saving is involved. As a matter of fact this Bill emanates from the N a v y Department, which controls wireless telephony. Section 4 of the principal Act providesThe Minister for the time being administering the Aet shall have the exclusive privilege of establishing erection, maintaining, and using stations and appliances for the purpose of(a) transmitting messages by wireless telegraphy within Australia, and receiving messages so transmitted.; and (t>) transmitting messages by wireless tele« graphy from Australia to any place or ship outside Australia; and (c) receiving in Australia messages transmitted by wireless telegraphy from any place or ship outside Australia. That section gives the Commonwealth complete power over wireless telegraphy, and the Bill will extend the power to wireless telephony. Then section 5, dealing with licences, saysLicences to establish, erect, maintain, or use stations and appliances for the purpose of transmitting or receiving messages by means of wireless telegraphy may be granted by the Minister for the time being administering the Act for such term and on such conditions and on payment of such fees as are prescribed. Therefore, honourable members will see that the points they have raised in regard to licences are already provided for by1905-15 existing legislation.",76
314,Mr FBJJTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Is the Postmaster General considering the introduction of wireless telephony in his own Department?,77
315,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"ISTo . Unless the sages control of wireless telegraphy to the Postmaster-General, wireless telephony will not come under ray control.",77
316,Mr LATRD SMITH,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Does the Postal Department receive any revenue from members radio messages that compete with the telegraph lines? If , for instance, overland line from Western Australia is overcrowded, and the message is sent by wireless, which Department receives revenue?",77
317,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,There is an arwireless rangement between the Navy Department and the Postal Department for an equiequipment table division of such revenue. Mr Born - Does not the Postmasterger General think that wireless telegraphy and telephony should he controlled iby Department?,77
318,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Parliamen t decided otherwise, and I am not anxious to cover control of those activities. Before wireless telegraphy was transferred to Navy Department the business was still in its infancy, and involved the Departgraphy ment in a loss of between £3,000 and £4,000 per annum. If the traffic grows as we expect it to grow, and the loss increases correspondingly, I shall he loth to resume control of such an unprofitable service.",77
319,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Will the Minister state the position of persons whose licences were revoked and their stations disamending mantled soon after the war broke out?,77
320,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The Naval' BoaTd is now considering the conditions under which licences may be issued in future. Probably, later on the Acting Minister  to intimate to the House the decision the Naval Board on bhat point. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

321,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Yarra) [9,56] - The Postmaster-General referred honourable to the Minister for the Navy  position of persons whose licences were the revoked at the beginning of the war. Section 6, sub-section 2, of the Act deals with wireless appliances on ships, and the the Navigation Act requires that certain passenger ships shall be equipped with telegraphy. That is quite right; I would go farther, and make, wireless compulsory on the smaller boats, in connection with which the danis greater than in connection with the up-to-date .passenger boats. I agree with his the honourable member for Denison (Mr. - - Laird Smith) that the control of wireless telegraphy should never have been reremoved from the Postmaster-General's Department, into which it naturally fits. the It may have been necessary, while the war was dn progress, to place wireless teleunder the control of - the Navy Department .as a Defence measure, but should now that we are at peace the control revert to the Postal Department.",77
322,Mr WEBSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,I thought the honourable member was-a friend of mine.,77
323,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"It will be quite easy to restore wireless telegraphy to the control of. thePostal Department, because the Aet of 1915' struck out the words'. Postmaster-General"" from the ,r original Aot, and substituted "" the .Minister for the time being administering the Act . "" That means the Minister to whom the Prime Minister gives the administration of the Wireless of Telegraphy Act. Therefore that administration can be restored to the Postmaster-General by the Prime Minister. Sometimes the land lines are congested,' and some of 'the work must be done by wireless. At the present time there is a good deal of wireless communication between the land Btations and transports. The Appleoross Station, Perth, is being kept busy with messages from relatives to returning soldiers on transports. If we were to restore the control of this service to the Postal Department we should save the trouble of adjusting the revenue from this source between that Department and the Navy Department. In regard to the objection of the Postmaster-General to the restoration of this service to his Department, I have never considered that the Postal Department was established for profit earning. It is meant to be a convenience to the people of Australia. I am glad to hear that the Naval Board is considering what shall be done in regard to the issue of licences. Clause agreed <to.
