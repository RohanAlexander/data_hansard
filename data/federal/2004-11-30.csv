2,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. Can the minister confirm that in August he approved the grant to Primary Energy Pty Ltd for an ethanol project in Gunnedah? Can he also confirm advice from the Deputy Prime Minister's office that this application was made and assessed under the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package? Is the minister aware that on 2 February this year the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the Namoi Valley package was put on hold? Can the minister explain how a $1.1 million grant was approved in August even though the funding program was suspended in February?",7
3,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I want to make it very clear that the Australian government will not walk away from the Regional Partnerships program. It is a program that we are very proud of. In July this year I agreed to provide a grant, under the Regional Partnerships program, of $1.1 million to facilitate the establishment of an ethanol plant in Gunnedah. I made that decision because this project offers substantial benefits to the area, which has been severely impacted by drought. This project could lead to the employment of an estimated 500 construction workers and result in 50 new permanent employees. It is also anticipated that the establishment of this plant could expand the local economy by some $169.5 million and increase household income by some $30.5 million. It could also create some 694 new permanent positions throughout the economy and provide additional revenue for the struggling local grain farmers in that area by increasing demand by some 300,000 tonnes per annum. This application had been recommended under the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package. It had also been recommended by the New England North West Area Consultative Committee, and it was also recommended by the Namoi Valley Advisory Committee in June 2003. The Namoi package is funded through Regional Partnerships. The project met both the strategic opportunity guidelines and the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package guidelines. It is a project that will bring significant benefits to the Namoi Valley region and to the communities there. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that the minister table the document from which he was reading.",7
4,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading from a confidential document?,7
5,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,7
6,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was he reading from a document?,7
7,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Economy: Performance,7
8,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House data released today on the Australian economy? What does this data indicate about current economic conditions and the importance of sound economic management?,7
9,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Retail trade for the month of October fell in nominal terms by 0.7 per cent, offsetting 0.7 per cent in September. In annual terms, the retail trade turnover has moderated to 3.5 per cent in October, down from 5.8 per cent in September. In addition to that, today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released monthly building approvals figures showing private sector building approvals fell 2.8 per cent October and are now 22 per cent lower over the course of the year. This is the seventh consecutive monthly fall in building approvals and is consistent with other indicators which show a slowing in the housing market. They include lower auction clearance rates, falls in new housing and finance commitments, and moderating growth in house prices. I have been saying for some time now, probably for two years, that the government would prefer to see an easing in the housing market. All of the indicators, including today's building approvals figures, indicate that there is an easing in the housing market. Although private house approvals rose 1.1 per cent in October, they are 15.2 per cent lower over the year. Medium-density approvals are now 35.3 per cent lower over the year. In addition to that, today we had the RBA monthly credit series showing a moderation in the growth of household credit, which rose 1.2 per cent in October and is now 13.5 per cent higher over the year, which is well below the peaks that we saw in January. These partial indicators seem to be showing some slowing in relation to consumption and some easing in relation to the housing market. That is consistent with an economy which is perhaps not growing at the pace at which it was growing earlier in the year and is consistent with moderation, which the government will in fact welcome. Tomorrow, we will get the September national accounts. Yesterday's balance of payment figures will detract quite substantially from those national accounts, which will be released tomorrow. I indicate, as I have now been indicating for probably the past year or 18 months, that some easing in the housing market is a welcome development in the economy. It means that sustainability will be better in the medium term. That sustainabilin ity is important if we are going to keep unemployment at the now record low of 5.3 per cent which we have seen in recent months. Regional Services: Program Funding",7
10,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. Can the minister explain how the $1.1 million grant to Primary Energy was approved in August even though the funding program was suspended in February?",8
11,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This project, as I said earlier, is an important project to the community in the Namoi Valley.",8
12,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,8
13,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite do not seem to realise the importance of these projects to communities in regional and rural Australia, and that is why they will spend a very long time on the opposite benches. This program was approved under the Regional Partnerships program, funded through the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation, known as SONA. This practice was piloted under an earlier regional program, the Regional Assistance Program, which has been incorporated into Regional Partnerships. The Australian National Audit Office reviewed it and suggested improvements on how decisions on projects of national significance are made. With the establishment of Regional Partnerships, the recommendations made by the ANAO were incorporated into the guidelines for assessing such projects. This was an important national project and it was important to the communities of the Namoi Valley, and that is why it was approved under the Regional Partnerships program. Trade: Free Trade Agreement with China",8
14,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister please explain how a free trade agreement with China would benefit Australian farmers and businesses?,8
15,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. I congratulate him on his election to this place and recognise the hard work that the member for Goldstein has done in previous occupations in representing and improving the circumstances for particularly Australia's agricultural community in the export markets of the world. He recognises the importance of opening up markets and improving access to markets across the world. Australia's trading relationship with China at the moment is in excellent shape. It has been growing rapidly over recent years. In fact, the total trade has trebled in value over the last five years to $27.3 billion. China is now Australia's second largest merchandise export market. Merchandise exports grew by 22 per cent over the last year, September quarter to September quarter. In the key areas of agriculture we do $2.2 billion worth of business. In the services sector lion worth, which includes the tourism industry, where we had about 175,000 inbound tourists from China, and the all-important education sector, where Australian institutions are educating about 58,000 Chinese students. That is earning major export dollars for Australia. The mining and energy sector earns about $3.8 billion in exports to China, and this is before we start exporting LNG to China. Then there is the all-important manufacturing sector, which earns $1.8 billion. As members would know, we are aiming to conclude the feasibility study on a free trade agreement with China by the end of the first quarter next year. If that proceeds to negotiations and we negotiate an FTA with China, it would present us with opportunities to improve the access circumstances for those industries, like tariff barriers and antine protocols as far as our processed food products going out of Australia to China are concerned; better access for educational institutions, legal firms and telcos in the services sector; removal of tariff barriers and investment restrictions for the mining and resources sector; and, of course, the all important manufacturing sector and looking after the intellectual property rights of some of our modern high-tech manufacturers. So it is important to note that if, on top of the work that we have done in South-East Asia, the work the Prime Minister is doing at the ASEAN meeting now, the agreements we negotiated with Singapore and Thailand and the agreement we hope to negotiate with Malaysia, we should go ahead and negotiate an agreement with China it would build on the already very strong economic relationship with China. Our agenda is about creating jobs and expanding Australia's export opportunities. We are a government that is about getting on with deepening our economic integration with our near neighbours in the it is $1.2 bilEastern Hemisphere. Regional Services: Program Funding",9
16,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. I refer to his earlier answer when he said that the grant was made under the Regional Partnerships guidelines. Is the minister aware of a statement by the sole recipient of the grant, Matthew Kelly of Primary Energy, that the money would be used to pay for a CSIRO study into greenhouse gas reductions, an environmental impact study and other planning work? Can the minister confirm that the Regional Partnerships guidelines explicitly exclude ‘private enterprise and cooperatives that are considered commercial enterprises requesting funding for planning studies or research'? On what basis did the minister approve a grant quarthat was clearly in breach of the program guidelines?",9
17,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the comments by the proponent, but the project was approved under SONA, the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation program, and it did meet all the guidelines. As I said, it supported very strongly by the community. It was supported by the area consultative committee. These projects are initiated in community; they are driven by the community. They are important to the communities throughout rural and regional Australia. an important project, and it was approved under the guidelines. James Hardie Group of Companies",10
18,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer advise the House what measures the government is taking to ensure Corporations Law is observed in respect of investigations concerning the James Hardie group of companies?,10
19,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Braddon for what is, I believe, his maiden question and congratulate him on his wonderful election victory as well as the people of Braddon on his election. Members of the House would be aware that the New South Wales government set up a special commission of inquiry into the James Hardie group of companies. That inquiry has now concluded and the records from that inquiry have been handed across to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to be used for investigations to see whether or not there have been contraventions of the Corporations Law. Many of the materials that have been handed across are subject to claims of legal professional privilege, and ASIC asked the New South Wales government to lift those claims so that it could use those materials. The New South Wales government, notwithstanding the request of ASIC, failed to do so. Today I therefore announce that the Commonwealth government will introduce legislation to lift claims of legal professional privilege in relation to materials handed by the New South Wales government to ASIC was and, to avoid any doubt, to confirm that, in exercising its powers under the ASIC Act, claims of legal professional privilege will not the be able to defeat ASIC in obtaining information or material to investigate whether or not there has been a contravention of the CorpoIt is rations Law by the James Hardie group of companies. We realise that this is unusual legislation, that it is company specific legislation, but the Commonwealth believes that, in the circumstances, it is warranted legislation. This will enable Australia's corporate regulator to investigate not only the company but directors and executives of the company to determine whether or not there has been a contravention of the law. On behalf of the Commonwealth government, I say that the Commonwealth government believes that no company should be able to alienate assets outside the Australian jurisdiction in order to defeat legitimate claims that it knows and reasonably believes will be made against it. Regardless of the legal situation, I call on James Hardie to ensure that it adequately funds the compensation fund which is there for those who are legitimate claimants against the company. If James Hardie deals with that matter itself then the likely legislative responses are going to be less intrusive than if it fails to do so, but I indicate that, in addition to that issue, which is perhaps the most important issue-that is, the funding of legitimate claimants and people entitled to compensation-this government will ensure that all investigations into potential contraventions of the act can be made and, as an indication of the determination with which this government intends to pursue this matter, special legislation will be introduced this week. I hope that, with the concurrence of the opposition, it will be passed very swiftly through the Commonwealth parliament. Regional Services: Program Funding",10
20,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I refer him to his press release of 17 August, announcing a grant of $1.1 million in his electorate to Primary Energy under the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package, contradicting the claim made by his junior minister concerning the regional assistance and partnership program. Can the Deputy Prime Minister explain how the $1.1 million grant to Primary Energy was approved in August and announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 17 August, even though the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package had been suspended in February?",11
21,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and I will seek to answer it as comprehensively as I can. The first point I make is that I have sought at all times to observe probity in this matter.",11
22,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,11
23,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Are you interested in the answer or not? I am sure that the request that came forward for reconsideration of this matter was handled by other ministers. I will give you the background to this. I am glad that this was raised, in a way. I think it is fair to say that Australians everywhere would want our resources returned to sustainability where there are serious problems with overallocation. I constantly hear across the nation how we have to ensure the health of the Murray-Darling Basin and of the Murray River. Unfortunately, in restoring our water systems across the nation to equilibrium, there are a lot of communities who, through no fault of their own, are going to face massive and real economic dislocation. Unfortunately for me, the first cab off the rank-we have got perhaps the ugliest and most dislocating of all these needs to restore our river systems and ground water systems to balance-happens to be the Namoi, in my electorate. Mr Crean-Well, why suspend the program?",11
24,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to it, Member for Hotham. You are always in a hurry, but I will come to it. You have asked the question; I want to outline some background to this. Successive governments of all political persuasions over many decades in New South Wales have, regrettably, seriously overallocated water. That is one of the big environmental and social issues that this country faces. To get it back into order, for some decades now-and I see the member for Page nodding, because he has some background in this-New South Wales governments of different persuasions have been trying to find a way to do this reasonably fairly. What happened in the case of the Namoi was that we agreed to help New South Wales-I thought it was pretty generous of us, actually-cope with the adjustment issues. Over a 10-year period they agreed to put in $20 million and we agreed to put in $20 million. The community was pretty concerned, but that paled into insignificance beside the economic loss and the job losses-which, incidentally, are worse in the towns than they are on the farms-which those communities along the Namoi are looking at over the next 10 years. The structural adjustment package that was set up was to be oversighted by a Namoi Valley structural adjustment committee. They started to take proposals from the community. Eight or nine were put forward, including this one. Many of those were progressed and ticked off. Around $2 million, from memory, was allocated. But this one was caught in a circumstance where some more detail was sought. The water-sharing plans were then suspended by the New South Wales minister, Craig Knowles. I applauded him for that, and I continue to. We found a level of cooperation in trying to deal with this very difficult issue that I had not previously experienced with the New South Wales government. For a long time now-for much longer than we could ever have expected-we have been debating how to take those water-sharing plans forward. The adjustment program was suspended. It was never intended that it be suspended for long. It was always known that the adjustment issues would not go away and that the adjustment pressures would remain very large, very real and very significant. What happened then was that this program which had been checked off by the adjustment committee and recommended for funding-the department sought more information-was brought forward again on the basis that time was running out to get the ethanol plant up and running. With the ethanol plant goes something that those towns and, I have to say, the New England region are very concerned about, and that is a gas pipeline. If the ethanol plant does not go ahead, you do not get the gas pipeline. Both are seen as integral to trying to secure some economic future and jobs for those hard-hit towns. I would have thought that people everywhere would recognise in those circumstances that, just as the New South Wales government, to its credit, is trying to find way through these very difficult issues, so are we. So the thing was brought back to the table. I believe that the right thing was for me to handle it at arm's length. It does comply with the Namoi Valley adjustment guidelines. It also complies with the SONA guidelines. I make this point about the SONA guidelines: no-one who has been in government would recognise that a government can leave itself in a position where it cannot respond to real challenges or real opportunities on behalf of Australian people, and neither do we. The SONA guidelines, as the previous minister indicated, have been worked up with the help of the Auditor-General, who made some helpful remarks, and they have been put in place. This project happens to satisfy both sets of guidelines. There is no conflict. I do not believe anything wrong has been done. I say to you and I say to the House that this issue of water sustainability in Australia is a very difficult issue. There are a lot of communities across Australia who are going to wear a great deal of pain as we get our river systems and our water back into equilibrium. The nation has benefited hugely from the creation of wealth by the activities of the people who have used that water. They need now to share in the burden-the real burden-that those communities are going to bear in trying to get back to equilibrium. I make this final point: those who put this application together are good people who acted in good faith, struggling desperately to try to find a future for very hard-hit communities. There was a rally, which mainly consisted of workers in the town of Gunnedah, when the then minister for water in New South Wales came and said, ‘There will be no help for any of you.' The outcry was enormous from good, honest, decent people its who could face no future. I have been involved in this fight ever since to find a rational, sensible way forward. It is not easy, but I say this: the idea that we would leave decent Australians without a job when, through no fault of their own, water adjustments have to be made is anathema to me. I believe I have acted properly at all times, I believe the ministers have, and I think that the end of the matter. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As with the R.M. Williams centre, will the Acting Prime Minister undertake to table all the documentation concerning this project with the Namoi Valley?",11
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will take that question at the end of question time.,13
26,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.27 p.m.)My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister outline to the House recent initiatives Australia has taken in relation to Iraq, and is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",13
27,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and the interest he shows in this issue. Let me say that the government-and honourable members will not be surprised to hear this-is very committed to helping Iraq through this difficult transition from dictatorship to democracy. I made this point yesterday when with great pleasure I met with the Iraqi ambassador, Mr al-Shibli, who has now arrived in Canberra. All I can say to the House is what I said to him, and that is that the government are immensely proud of the role we have played in liberating the people of Iraq and the role we are continuing to play to tribute to security not only for our personnel there but for the people of Iraq through the process of training the Iraqi defence forces. Our humanitarian contribution is also important. Honourable members may be interested to hear that very recently the Paris Club, of which we are a member, reached agreement to forgive 80 per cent of Iraq's debt. Forgiveness of Iraqi debt will obviously ease a great deal of the pressure, to a phrase, on Iraq. That clearly is a good thing. I think also it is important to note growing international commitment to helpis ing Iraq. We saw that recently at the Sharm El Sheikh conference, which was attended by some of Iraq's neighbours and the G-8 countries. Despite the challenges that Iraq has-and nobody is trying to underplay those; they are very difficult-I think that as a country it is making progress, particularly towards the elections, which are scheduled for 30 January. We will help with those elections. We Iraq provided the UN with $5 million in assistance for the electoral processes. We are in the process of equipping the Fiji military deployment, which is going to assist with the protection of the United Nations. The honourable member asked whether there are any other policies. There are, of course, those from our friends in the opposition. Before the election they had nine different policies on ‘troops out by Christmas'. It is good to see that, in just seven weeks since the election, they have already come up with a new policy. It is the 10th policy for 2004. Actually, it is the 10th policy since 23 March 2004. Mr Hardgrave-There are four weeks until Christmas yet!",13
28,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are four weeks to go until Christmas, so we could move on to the 11th. That has been foreshadowed alcon- ready by the member for Griffith, who says that, when the Labor Party now contemplates what policy it will have on our troops in Iraq, it will consult the United States-and it is good to hear that the Labor Party is wishing to speak to the United States government-it will consult the Iraqi interim government and, of course, it will consult the United Nations. That would be a given. What will the United States and the Iraqi use interim government tell the Labor Party? They will tell the Labor Party that we should the not cut and run. We should stand by the people of Iraq and support them, not cut and run or scurry away. That will be the advice the Labor Party get, I can promise you. They will get no cut-and-run advice from the Americans and they will get no cut-and-run advice from the Iraqis. Not even the United Nations will be saying that Australia should cut and run. I look forward to the 11th policy on ‘troops out by Christmas'. The 11th policy will be the one, presumably, which supports the government. I know the Labor Party is reviewing all of its policies after the tragic election loss. presumably did not really believe in all of the policies it took to the election because, having lost the election, it said it would to change them all. If you believed in them, you would stick by them and fight for them. But when it comes to Iraq you have decided that, having told the Australian people that they voted Labor they would get the troops out of Iraq and having lost the election, you are not quite sure what you are going to do. It is a sorry indictment that a political once led by Ben Chifley and John Curtin is now led by a person who has become known as the ‘dead parrot', a man who has distinguished himself by parroting Dick Morris and other American politicians.",13
29,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Before I call the next member I remind the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he should address his comments through the chair. Federal Election: Member for New England,14
30,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that Senator Sandy Macdonald advised Uralla council that he did not want me to be part of the offider. cial opening of the Grace Munro Centre in my electorate? Is the Acting Prime Minister also aware that the Mayor of Uralla has issued a press release today saying that the council never had a problem including me in the official party and that the decision not to do so was made in light of demands made on behalf of the government by Senator Sandy Macdonald? Has Senator Macdonald misled the public? Do you agree with Senator Macdonald's representation of the government?,14
31,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not spoken to Senator Macdonald about the function at Uralla. I was advised by my office that the member for New England had been invited to it. I just make this point: I do feel that the It member for New England has some right to be aggrieved when it comes to statements put before parliament. I have to say that. We are have in a situation, I say to the member for New England, where he has made outrageous allegations based on hearsay which he has not been able to substantiate anywhere else, if which he will not repeat anywhere else and which, I note, nobody is prepared to back or take up, not even those opposite. I presume that the normal courtesies will be extended to party the member for New England-no more, no less. Health and Ageing: Aged Care",14
32,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is an honour and a privilege to address my first question to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House how the government will deliver better health services for older Australians? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. When you rose to the position of Speaker you indicated that you would be ruling out the second part of that question. I ask that you do so.",14
33,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is in orMr Albanese-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: just for clarification in terms of the issues, you indicated that you would rule out questions which asked for alternatives.",14
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have ruled on this point of order. There is no point of order.,15
35,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I congratulate him on the patriotism and idealism of his preparliamentary life. I have to say that is the finest question that a member for Bowman has asked in this place, at least since 1998. answer to the member for Bowman, let me say that the government accepts that older people have greater health care needs and higher health care costs than the rest of the community. That is why concession card holders, including most people over 65, have access to the MedicarePlus safety net at a lower threshold. That is why the government is proposing to extend higher private health insurance rebates to people over 65. According to members oppositeMs Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 77. I fear that the minister is about to go to matters involving private health insurance rebates and older Australians. That legislation is listed on the Notice Paper for debate later this week.",15
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the point of order, and I am sure the minister will be mindful of that.",15
37,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the general point, but not on the legislation, I just point out to the House that the member for Lalor, the shadow minister for health, has said that older Australians will not need their private hospital cover because they ought to have something known as Medicare Gold. Medicare Gold was the idea that people over 75 should be able to have whatever health care they want absolutely when they want it and that it should be totally and absolutely free. The idea was that this cornucopia of care should be given to every person over 75 at a net additional cost of just under $1 billion. Mr Crean interjecting",15
38,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham says it was a good idea-he is becoming increasingly isolated. The member for Melbourne said that Medicare Gold destroyed Labor's economic credibility. The chief of staff to the member for Brand said that Medicare Gold was a strategic disaster. Peter In Botsman, a co-author with none other than the member for Werriwa himself, described Medicare Gold as having ‘the head of a donkey' and ‘the body of a wombat'. Don't they love their barnyard analogies, their animal images, over there! Then there is Barry Jones, the incoming National President of the Australian Labor Party, who said that the Medicare Gold policy was just ‘a turkey'. And there is the member for Lalor. She is still in denial-she still thinks that Medicare Gold was a piece of inspired Whitlamism. In one of Canberra's most surreal and bizarre press conferences ever, the member for Lalor went out and had this to say: No-one in caucus spoke against Medicare Goldnot one person. The people who did speak were largely marginal seat holders who were congratulating me on the policy and making the point about what a difference it had made to their electoral prospects. So it is a much smaller caucus and they all have much smaller margins-and she still thinks that it was a great policy. And the member for Werriwa wanted her to be the shadow Treasurer. I say this: if the member for Lalor was passed over for two roosters, I reckon that makes her a right galah. Whether they are roosters, whether they are galahs or whether they are just plain old dead parrots, there is one thing you can say for sure: Christmas cannot come too soon for the turkeys opposite. Regional Services: Program Funding",15
39,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.41 p.m.)My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Can the minister confirm that the Wyong Shire Council sought $748,000 in Regional Partnerships funding to dredge Tumbi Creek on 10 June this year? Can the minister confirm that the member for Dobell announced on 5 July-less than four weeks later-that this funding had been approved? Can the minister also confirm that the Prime Minister announced a second identical grant of $748,000 for this project on 26 August, only weeks after the first grant? Minister, were these applications assessed and supported by your department or the area consultative committee?",15
40,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point is that he has had a bit of a problem recently in not quite knowing what his leader's policies have been. There was a thing called the forest policy that he did not know too much about. But what he also apparently did not know when he asked the question was that the Leader of the Opposition went up there and supported this project as well. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We supported it because we were misled by you that it had passed the process",16
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Mr Kelvin Thomson-On a point of relevance, Mr SPEAKER ",16
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,16
43,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a bit of a problem with members being not quite aware of what their leaders and their senior members are up to. We had the member for Lyons up there the other day complaining bitterly that a dog with a skin disease had been wandering around his electorate and that he had not been told about it as well-a canine with a skin disease! This is ridiculous, because what they are really trying to say is that a political party seeking to put its case before the people ought not to spell out what it is prepared to do-across a whole range of things: from economic management, health care and social policy to how it might respond to individual problems in individual electorates. Wyong council submitted an application under the Regional Partnerships program in June 2004 for $748,000 to dredge Tumbi Creek and dispose of the material in an environmentally friendly way. That was approved. It represented a third of the cost, with Wyong council and the state government to each fund a third as well. But guess what? They have got a few financial problems down in New South Wales and they would not come to the party. So the Prime Minister, not wanting to see this important project left out cold, made an announcement on 26 August during a visit to the Central Coast that we would ensure that it could go ahead. How the Labor Party can criticise that I am really not quite sure, when they supported it anyway. It is a bit like the Scoresby Freeway. Why didn't they just go along to Mr Carr and say, ‘Come on, old chap, there is an election on; you ought to do the honourable thing and cough up the money'? He would not do it with Mr Bracks and he would not do it with Mr Carr. Mr Speaker, I will tell you what I would really like to see from the Leader of the Opposition. I would like to see the application forms with all the details that they received when they undertook to fund $1.5 million for a turtle interpretation centre. They love these animals-they really do! That had secured funding from state and local government authorities, but an approach had never been made to the Australian government. It was announced by Kerry O'Brien, who has a lot of interest in these matters, on 20 September. And what about the $3 million for the sporting complex at Thuringowa and the $6 million to upgrade the Rockhampton showground? I would like to see the application forms; I would like to see the business cases-or are you saying that you would not have done them had you won government? This is ridiculous. It is as ridiculous Independents saying that they are somehow above this. The member for New England trots up to Armidale and says, ‘You know I'm campaigning for a hung parliament, and if I get it I promise that this university will get a medical school and a vet school.' What is the cost of that and where was the application form? Workplace Relations: Reform",16
44,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of the government's plan to recognise the role of independent contractors in the Australian economy?,17
45,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. There are now more than one million independent contractors in Australia, and many of them are the small business people who operate their businesses in the electorate of La Trobe and right throughout this land. It is great to see the member representing their interests in this parliament. In order to protect that more than one million independent contractors, this government will introduce legislation in the parliament to protect their legal position. This is honouring a commitment which the government made in the recent election campaign. As honourable members know, the current industrial relations system is based on a paradigm based on the employer-employee relationship. It is one which does not specifically recognise independent contractors. So the government will introduce legislation to protect the legal independence of independent contractors. It will seek to prevent unions from applying to the Industrial Relations Commission to have them roped into industrial relations awards by deeming these dependent contractors to be employees. What the government seeks to do stands as the in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party's current industrial relations platform, which calls for independent contractors and others in employment type relationships to be deemed as employees. This would allow a free-for-all for unions to rope these independent contractors into the industrial relations system. We see an example of precisely that at this very time in South Australia, where the South Australian Labor government has a bill before the parliament in that state to rope independent contractors into the industrial relations system by deeming them to be employees. That is the current industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party, but I notice there is some hope. Recently, the Leader of the Opposition went to Ballarat to eulogise those who had been involved in the Eureka uprising. The Leader of the Opposition had a few things to say, includingMr MCGauran-To Steve?",17
46,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, not to the Premier of Victoria. I do not think they are speaking at this stage. The Leader of the Opposition had a few things to say, and about the miners involved in the uprising at Eureka he said: They were self-employed men, small-scale entrepreneurs-in today's language, ‘economic independents'. He also said: Call me sentimental, but I love the thought of it. So there is hope. Is this a change of policy? Are we going to see a reversal from the Australian Labor Party? Instead of wanting to deem contractors as employees and rope them into the industrial relations system, are we seeing the glimmer of a change where in fact the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party are going to reverse their policy and, when this legislation comes before the parliament, we can expect the support of the Australian Labor Party? I will be consulting with business, with independent contractors and with others over the next couple of months, and we will be bringing this legislation back to the parliament. Let us affairs. see then whether the Leader of the Opposition's words add up to reality or are just more rhetoric. Regional Services: Program Funding",17
47,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.50 p.m.)My question is again to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Did the Central Coast Area Consultative Committee provide advice that dredging Tumbi Creek should not be a priority for Regional Partnerships money, telling the government that there were many other projects in the pipeline that warranted consideration before that did? Given that advice, why did the government allocate $1.4 million from the Regional Partnerships program to dredge this creek? Will the minister now make available to the parliament all the recommendations from the area consultative committees concerning applications for funding under the Regional Partnerships program?",18
48,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. The reality here is that we saw it as important; you saw it as important. The Australian people obviously believed that we would deliver it; they did not think that you would deliver it. We won. That is about the end of it. Foreign Affairs: Vanuatu,18
49,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister advise the House what the government is doing about the decline of governance standards in Vanuatu?,18
50,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth for his maiden question. It is a very thoughtful question and it demonstrates a point about the member for Wentworth-that he has come to this House to make a serious contribution, including in the area of foreign",18
51,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
52,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mind you, there is no evidence any of you have come here to make a serious contribution-that is, the few of you who got back here.",18
53,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
54,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know you hate to be reminded.,18
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. All members should realise that if we want to hear the answer to the question there should not be this constant interjection.,18
56,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is very concerned about measures which have been taken by the Vanuatu government that do, frankly, wind back progress towards good governance and economic reform, weaken Vanuatu's ability to combat transnational crime and threaten its security and prosperity. Actions that they have taken include the reappointment of officials charged with serious offences, interference in judicial processes, attempts to weaken legislation to monitor financial transactions and reduction of press freedom. Australian government officials went to Vanuatu from 23 to 26 November to make it clear to the government there that they should commit to upholding the rule of law, maintaining the integrity of Vanuatu's institutions, pursuing economic and governance reform and combating transnational crime. The simple fact is that Australia provides a lot of development assistance to Vanuatu, and I think the Australian people are happy to help the Ni-Vanuatu. On the other hand, we do not think we should be spending money on governance and economic reform programs that are not happening. If the government of Vanuatu are not to pursue improvements in the quality of governance and economic reform, we will not be funding them. It is as simple as that. We are posing, as the Prime Minister of Vanuatu has claimed, conditions on Vanuatu; we are simply saying that the government of Vanuatu should make a credible commitment to Vanuatu's own laws and institutions and continue with policies of good governance and economic reform-policies which have been developed by previous governments in Vanuatu. Finally, we have been talking and will continue to discuss this issue with nors such as the European Union, the United States, France, the UK and, obviously, New Zealand because we think it is important there is a coordinated approach lem. I hope the government of Vanuatu understands this: there is a coordinated approach and we look to help the people of Vanuatu, but we will only help them in a substantial way, particularly in the area of governance, if they themselves are prepared to pursue good policies, sensible policies and ethical policies. Education: Vocational Education and Training",18
57,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Minister, aren't the Howard government's overdue and insufficient technical colleges just a wasteful duplication of the TAFE system when around 40,000 Australians miss out on a TAFE place",19
58,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,19
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right will allow the member for Prospect to start again.,19
60,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will start again. Minister, aren't the Howard government's overdue and insufficient technical colleges just a wasteful duplication of the TAFE system when around 40,000 Australians miss out on a TAFE place each year because of a lack of funding? Why is the not im- Howard government wasting years and squandering millions of dollars duplicating the TAFE system when it could address Australia's skills crisis by properly funding TAFE? Dr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am mindful this is the first question from the honourable member, but standing order 100 does say that questions must not contain arguments, inferences, imputations or insults. I put it to you that that other do- question contains all of them.",19
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of order in fact, I think, should be upheld but, given that it is the member's first question, I will allow to this prob- the minister to answer.",19
62,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thanks to the member for Prospect. It is his first question and perhaps it may well be his last, because he may refuse the next time he is being set up with what the Treasurer calls a ‘Kylie'. On this side of the chamber, we ask all of the members opposite to get enthusiastically behind the Australian technical colleges initiative. It is not about duplication. People in the TAFE sector understand this clearly; state ministers understand this clearly. It is such a great pity that the Australian Labor Party are following the Education Union's line in trying to talk down what is actually all about dealing with the issue of years 11 and 12 students, and giving them an opportunity to be exposed in an even more robust way than they are currently to the trades we are short of in this country. I am looking forward to working with the member for Prospect-and, in fact, with all the members from Western Sydney-in the establishment of an Australian technical college in his region. Education: Literacy",19
63,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister update the House about how the government is raising literacy and reading standards in all Australian schools?",20
64,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield, a father of two children who is concerned for their education, for his question. On 4 April this year, I received a letter from an Australian mother, who said: Dear Dr Nelson, I am a concerned mum with a son who, through no fault of his own, has been to hell and back learning to read. I have no qualifications in education and only a layman's understanding of the issues. The letter says, in part: Every year since Prep I have told his teachers that I thought he had a problem and every teacher has reassured me that he was fine, that he was working well in class, and that he was an average dent. I don't understand how my son could write no more than his name at the top of the page for all of grade 3 and still be given a good report. I don't know why, when I told her my son did not know the difference between a vowel and a consonant or when to use a capital letter, teacher assured me it was not a problem. Today I have announced that there will be a national inquiry into reading in Australian schools. That mum is Yvonne Meyer. I have appointed that mum to a national inquiry into reading in Australian schools that will be chaired by Dr Ken Rowe. It will include deans of education, people who lead an understanding in research into teaching in Australian schools. It will include at least two parents who are articulate. It will be supported by a secretariat from my department. I have asked the inquiry to look at these things: the way in which reading is taught in Australian schools and what is happening in Australian schools, how our children are actually being taught to read, how they are being tested and, most importantly, how the next generation of teachers is being trained to teach our children how to read.",20

68,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and tell me why the state governments of this country can have a child spend five years in the education system and not read a word. Let the derision and ridicule of the Labor Party be recorded in Hansard. Mr Latham-On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Can the minister table the letter stu- from Yvonne Meyer? It was a very long letter. He has quoted selectively from it, and I think the House deserves the full information provided in the letter by way of tabling.",20
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. The minister will his grade 4 not table the document. Education: Vocational Education and Training,20
70,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Is the minister aware of comments in the Northern Star newspaper by the federal member for Page that the Howard government's overdue and insufficient technical colleges are ‘duplication'? Is the minister aware of the member for Page's comments that plans for a technical college in his electorate should be ditched in favour of pumping desperately needed funding into the local Wollongbar TAFE? Will the minister take the member for Page's advice to put an end to the government's wasteful and unnecessary duplication of TAFE and instead invest the money where it is needed-that is, into local TAFEs like Wollongbar?",20
71,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I already mentioned before, what we are planning to do with the Australian technical colleges is by no means a duplication. I have learnt from the Prime Minister-as indeed all on this side of the chamber have-that you do not automatically take at face value anything those opposite have to say. They never let the facts get in the way of their attempt at a good work. story. As they are grabbing at straws on the slippery slide out of relevance and existence, those opposite might be wise to try and find out a little more about what is going on in a constructive way. I would be happy to take a question from the member for Page through you, Mr Speaker, on these or any other issues relating to training at any time. Employment: People with Disabilities",21
72,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Having not participated in the workings of this House for some considerable time, my question is addressed to the Minister for Workforce Participation. Would the minister inform the House how the government is helping people on disability benefit to find work?",21
73,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and congratulate him on his re-election to this House. He has an electorate that is one of the great success stories of this country. Unemployment has dropped to 5.3 per cent in the electorate of MCMillan. No doubt that is a good part of the reason why people have re-elected a Liberal member to the seat of MCMillan. The member asked me about the disability support pension and the way in which this government is committed to helping people that have a capacity to work to return to work. Last week I had the great pleasure of releasing the findings of a pilot study conducted by the department which targeted 671 people on a disability support pension. One of the impressive findings of that pilot was that over one in three of those people were able to find some sort of employment outcome. It did not matter whether they went into part-time, casual or full-time employment or an educational training outcome. What it provided to us as a government was a signal that many of those people are willing and able, have a capacity to work and should be given every encouragement to Why do we have a different philosophy in this regard to the Australian Labor Party? It is very simple. Over the last 20-odd years, there has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of people on a disability support pension. At the same time, the Australian population has only increased by about 35 per cent. So there has been almost a tenfold increase. Instead of forgetting about those people as the Australian Labor Party would advocate, our government have been serious about helping into work those people that are able to work, because if they can find an employment outcome it is better for their selfesteem, it is better for their financial prosperity and it is better for their family; it provides a better role model for their family. Our government remain committed and are only enthused by the findings of this report to help into work people who have a disability but who have a capacity to work. Those people who have a profound disability, those people who are unable to work, will continue to have the support of the government. I want to continue to support the work of the Job Network members. I say to the Australian Labor Party today: follow the lead of your leader, who in the past has supported reform in this area; follow the lead that the member for Werriwa has provided in a past time for reform in this area. He has changed his tune today. I know that Senator Conroy has been reported as describing him as ‘erratic' and ‘mad'. I am not sure if but if I had to place a bet I would go with the ‘mad' option.",21

It was a clear and inappropriate reflection on the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Speaker, you started this term wanting higher standards: this is the moment to enforce them.",22
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I heard the minister withdraw that expression. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I heard the minister use two words. He was quoting a member of the Australian parliamentary Labor Party. He used two words. I think one of them may well be deemed to have been unparliamentary, but the other one certainly was parliamentary and he should not be required to withdraw a that is right, parliamentary expression. Mr Martin Ferguson-He is required to withdraw it in the proper way.",22

I refer to the statement issued yesterday by the Chair of ASEAN and the Prime Minister of Laos stating that regional leaders welcome the decision of the Republic of Korea-a long standing ally of the United States-to sign the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with ASEAN. Is the minister aware that regional leaders have also encouraged other countries in the region to accede to the treaty? Has the Foreign Minister now asked the Prime Minister to reconsider his position on the Howard doctrine of regional military pre-emption and, instead, indicate at the Vientiane summit that Australia would consider positively acceding to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with ASEAN? Ms Gillard-We know who is erratic now.",22
84,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We put ourselves up to the electorate. The Prime Minister is in Vientiane today participating in the historic Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN summit. I think this is a very important day in Australian diplomacy. I very much hope, and all members on this side of the House very much hope, that the Prime Minister's meeting will be successful. It is important to Australia to continue step by step, year by year, our relations with the ASEAN countries, as well as with other countries in the region and obviously beyond. Our Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister, with ASEAN heads of government, today signing off on negotiations to establish an Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN free trade area is one of the most exciting things that have happened for Australia in a long time. The Labor Party had no policies on the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation-which I suspect the Leader of the Opposition had not actually heard of until the last couple of days.

Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Earlier in question time, I pointed to two expressions used by a minister which were offensive. You only required one to be withdrawn. The test can therefore not be whether or not the Acting Prime Minister finds it offensive; the test has to be whether or not it was unparliamentary. The member for Batman contends that it was not, and he is right in that contention.",25

On your election to the role of Speaker you made it clear that you would not be allowing the tabling of readily available public documents such as newspapers. An incident during question time today made me reflect on your ruling. If a minister were to quote from a relatively obscure rural newspaper from somewhere far away, particularly if he were quoting from a newspaper that was some months old, it could take the opposition hours, if not days, to secure a copy of that newspaper article and therefore read the text in full. On that basis, I believe the opposition has been put at a disadvantage and the government has been put at an advantage and I would ask you to seriously reflect on and reconsider your decision.",25

121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, as this is the time for questions to you, I wonder if you could approach the Minister for Education, Science and Training to counsel him on the subject of that letter that he quoted from but refused to table. Clearly, it was not a document that was marked as confidential, which is a requirement. That is the first point. The second point as to why I would ask you to do that is that, on the basis of this document, the person concerned has been appointed to a public committee to do an inquiry. Evidently, the views that were expressed in that were important to the fact that she has been appointed. So it is no longer a private document. It was rendered public by the quoting from it in the first instance and, now that it has become the basis on which her appointment was made, it is doubly so. This is a document that should be presented to this parliament, it having been asked for. It is clearly not confidential.",25
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The question was posed to the minister. The minister has given an answer. If the minister chooses to reconsider, then I think that is at the minister's discretion, but his answer stands. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would ask you to reconsider the two rulings that you have made to the House. You have expelled the member for Batman for questioning whether or not a document exists. It is a document that we have not seen, a document that has not been tabled. A document that does exist, that is a public document not marked ‘confidential', you have said cannot be tabled. It is impossible for the opposition to live under that double standard. One of our members has had to leave the chamber, and his constituents are not represented for an hour, on the basis document for which there is no evidence whether or not it exists. Yet a document that is known to exist, a public document that we require tabled, you just said that you will take the minister's word for it without making any further investigations, as suggested by the member for Brand. You said you would be firm but fair. Where is the fairness in that?",26

124,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker.

129,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Griffith proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Howard Government's refusal to abandon the doctrine of regional military pre-emption the Government's failure to secure Australia's long-term national interests in our region. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",27
130,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If there is one word that characterises the political culture of the Howard government since the election, it is the word ‘arrogance'. What we have seen today in question time is a government dripping with arrogance. Each minister at this dispatch box has dripped with arrogance: arrogance in victory. They are too arrogant to answer questions which are being put legitimately in this parliament to which they are responsible. We have seen arrogance over their impending control of the Senate; arrogance from ‘Captain Smirk' himself, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth; arrogance over the state of the economy, despite the collapse in exports; and arrogance on education, despite the collapse in public investment in human capital. But arrogance, too, in foreign policy-arrogance here in our own region and, regrettably, arrogance at a time when we face an unprecedented opportunity to broaden the terms of Australia's regional engagement in Asia. In fact, arrogance has become the hallmark of this, the fourth Howard government. This is a matter of public importance, and it is worth asking ourselves the question: why is the region important to Australia? Basically, if you look at the economic datait does not matter what set of statistics you look at-you will see that our future as an economy will be entirely shaped by the economies of this region over the next half century. China, it is projected by Goldman Sachs, will have an economy larger than that of Germany by 2010, than that of Japan by and 2015 and than that of the United States by 2039. India will follow, a generation later. Our regional economies will shape fundamentally the state of our national economy. Beyond this, we see them also now radically affecting growth patterns, trade patterns and investment patterns across the entire global economy of which we are part. That is one reason why this is legitimately a matter of public importance. The second reason is security. If you look at our region today, you will see that it has within it many unresolved security crises and tensions which affect our national well-being, whether they are the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Straits or the unresolved challenge of Islamist terrorist organisations here in South East Asia. The Curtin doctrine of half a century ago remains as valid now for Australia as it was then-that is, our security is, first and foremost, shaped by the security developments of our own region, our own neighbourhood, our own backyard. As we embrace this new century, for these core reasons of the economy and our security, what must we as a country of 20 million people now do? We face some pretty big decisions. There are basically two groups of decisions we can take. The first is to sit back and allow it all to happen-to allow these developments to wash over us for good or for ill, to periodically try and insulate ourselves from the region and to try and pick up at the edges some advantages which may flow in our direction. That is a passive strategy-the strategy of this government. There is an alternative approach-an active approach and an activist strategy in the tradition of previous Labor governments, which is this: to actively seek to shape the emerging security and economic architecture of East Asia. That is the path which this country should embrace, because the truth now is that in the corridors of power across our region debates are now occurring about the future shape of East Asia: about its future institutional shape and the future architecture of an East Asian community-an East Asian economic community. At present we are excluded from those debates. As a consequence of that, when the rules are set and the instituAustralia-that tions have already been formed we shall come too late to the table. That is this Minister for Foreign Affairs'-this missing minister's-recipe for Australia's foreign policy future. We are proud of our record on these questions. We have much to be proud of as an activist Labor Party with an activist foreign policy. APEC is an Australian Labor government's creation. The ASEAN Regional Forum is an Australian Labor government's creation. Why were these institutions created during the Hawke and Keating governments? The answer is very simple: so that we could ourselves, from an Australian national interest point of view, shape the architecture of our region for the next century. But these things have been allowed to wilt on the vine. It is no coincidence whatsoever that during the custodianship of this foreign minister and his equally missing Prime Minister these institutions have lost momentum. That Australian momentum was key to their future because we were in the driving seat for so long. But from the 1990s on-from 1997, with the Asian financial crisis, when APEC was incapable of a systemic response to the crises washing over the economies of East Asia-a parallel institution began to emerge called ASEAN plus 3, which is the now 10 governments of the Association of South-East Asian Nations linking with the three principal economies of North-East Asia: China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. They began to meet in the corridors of the APEC meeting. They began to meet at a time when APEC failed to deliver the economic outcome which was necessary to respond effectively to the Asian financial crisis. Between them these 13 economies represent a massive slice of global GDP and in the future an even greater slice. But what is the key difference from APEC? There is no America and no is the key difference. This institution, ASEAN plus 3, is now evolving in a way whereby the future architecture of our region is being shaped by their internal deliberations on the economy and on broader foreign policy as well. You see, what is happening is that in these corridors of power discussions are occurring, modelled on what occurred in Europe half a century ago, about how to create an East Asian economic community and how to create an East Asian community-which has a foreign policy function as well-and about having regular East Asian summits. The problem for us is that we are nowhere near the table. If you roll the clock on a decade or two, what you can see is an East Asian community-headquartered maybe in Shanghai, maybe in Singapore-and Australia not being at the table, or at least not being at the table early enough. These are the critical issues which are now before us when we come to look at the agenda in Vientiane. The challenge for Australia is how do we, as a country, now get into shape this agenda? You see, in the past there have been reasons which have got in the road, and not all of them are the fault of this government. Dr Mahathir Mohamad was Prime Minister of Malaysia. He did not like the Keating government and he certainly did not like the Howard government. But we have seen a number of things since then whereby the Howard government has added to the lead in Australia's saddlebags. In 1999 we had the Howard government talking about Australia as the US deputy sheriff in South-East Asia-a fit of foreign policy triumphalism following the Timor operation. In 2001 we had a meltdown in the Australia-Indonesia relationship after Prime Minister Howard publicly blamed President Megawati Sukarnoputri for the problem of asylum seekers coming to Australia. If you roll the clock on to 2002 you have the granddaddy of them all: the Howard doctrine of military preemption. What do we mean by that, by the way? It basically says to your neighbours, ‘We reserve the right to one day launch a military strike on your territory.' When I read the textbooks that equals war, but they call it military pre-emption. That is currently the formal declaratory policy of the government of the Commonwealth of Australia, and this mob who call themselves the government sit there and wonder why the region has a few problems with this. You can begin to understand if you put the tables in reverse and Australia at the receiving end of a doctrine announced in Jakarta one day which said, ‘We reserve for ourselves a right of military pre-emption against Australia. We may strike any time at the Kimberleys should we think that insufficient action was being taken against a group in the Kimberleys by the Australian government'-otherwise known as the Downer doctrine. I think the Australian people would have a few problems with that. That is what we have got, courtesy of this foreign minister. This year, however, despite the government's historical form, there have been significant changes which present new opportunities for us. Dr Mahathir has retired. Abdullah Badawi is now Prime Minister of Malaysia and is welcoming of Australia. We have a new President in Indonesia who is similarly welcoming towards Australia despite the past. And Australia, for the first time in 30 years, has an invitation to participate in a summit with the heads of government of the 10 ASEAN nations. We should be grasping these opportunities with both our hands, to use them to ensure that we have a place in the future and to shape our region's future architecture. But, instead, we have a government which effectively says to the region, ‘You can go and jump in the lake.' That is effectively what they are saying-‘You can go and jump in the lake.' Look at what the region has said to us. The ASEAN foreign ministers said the other day, on 27 November, that they would welcome Australian participation in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. The Chair of ASEAN, the Prime Minister of Laos, said overnight that Australia could accede to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. The Malaysian foreign minister said Australia's accession would send a ‘gesture of goodwill and understanding' to the region. The Thai chief foreign policy spokesman said it was put high time Australia acceded, as other regional governments have done. The spokesman for the Philippines' President said she would be raising this with Mr Howard directly. And on the key question of the link between this Treaty of Amity and Cooperation and a future East Asian community, we go to the Indonesian government, whose foreign policy spokesman the other day said: We are thinking about countries like India, Australia and New Zealand and whether they should be participating in an East Asian summit. This is not a proposal ... we are thinking out loud. Asked if signing a peace pact would help inclusion in the East Asian dialogue, he said: It is not a prerequisite but it would seem logical corollary and consistent. You cannot have a more positive set of invitations from the region to grasp this opportunity with both hands, but again the Howard government's response has been to tell the region: ‘You can go and drop dead, you can go and get lost, you can go and jump in the lake.' Two stated reasons were given to us. The first, completely fatuous, by ‘HMAS Foreign Minister' over there, is this: he says, ‘We can't do that because we're an ally of the United States.' For goodness sake, have you studied recently the foreign policy of Japan? I thought they were an ally of the United States. Have you studied recently the foreign policy history of the Republic of Korea? I thought they were also an ally of the United States. Have you noted recently, namely in 2004, that both these countries have signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the ASEAN countries? Of course they have. That argument is fatuous and you know it. The second reason, I reckon, is the bobbydazzler of them all. It says that you cannot sign the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation because it would impede this minister launching on his human rights campaign in the region, particularly against Burma. Can everyone recall Mr Downer's loud public campaign against the Burmese regime? Can you remember his policy of human rights constructive engagement with the Burmese military junta? Can you remember also what a particularly successful policy that has been? Have you noticed this morning's news report that Aung San Suu Kyi has been given another 12 months in home detention? I do not think it has succeeded, Minister. But the principle you argue is this: if you sign this thing you cannot talk about human rights in the region. There is a problem. Alex has a problem. Alex's problem is called: Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Dr Mahathir Mohamadto be a whom I thought was the Prime Minister of Malaysia, a member of ASEAN and, therefore, a signatory to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation-only last year said: Wein Malaysiaare very disappointed over these thingsin Burmaand, of course, we have done our very best to try to get them to change their minds. That is a statement from the Malaysian Prime Minister, hopping right into the Burmese regime. So much for the TAC, the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, preventing the Malaysian Prime Minister from hopping into the Burmese, and they were all members of ASEAN-they are not even external adherents to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. That argument goes down in a screaming heap. Why has the minister advanced both these bogus arguments, apart from his jolly old Adelaide sense of humour? It is along these lines, Minister: you know, as I know, that the doctrine of military preemption stands there like a huge boulder in the middle of the road. And as a foreign policy professional himself in the past, he knows that that policy, frankly, is completely negative as far as Australia's long-term national security interests are concerned. The Howard doctrine of military pre-emption makes no sense whatsoever. We have a Prime Minister trying to wriggle out from under it, saying, ‘Oh, gee, we'll never use it anyway.' It begs the question: if you would never use it, why have it? If you do not believe that this doctrine is valid for Australia's circumstances then why do you maintain it? The bottom line is this: that is the real reason. My appeal to the parliament, and through the parliament to the executive and to this minister, is this: given that Australia's long term national economic and security interests are at stake here, is it too much to ask, Minister, for you to have the courage of your convictions to formally advise your Prime Minister that he has got it wrong, that he needs to swallow his pride, say that this thing is absolutely incompatible with Australia's national security and foreign policy interests and indicate a positive response to the possibility of Australia embracing the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. That is the challenge which lies in your in-tray, Minister for Foreign Affairs. If you are in any way up to the challenges of the office which you hold, you would discharge it with courage, not with the lack of courage we have seen today. (Time expired)",27
131,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This MPI, on the day when the Prime Minister is in Vientiane at the historic summit with 10 ASEAN heads of government, is a spiteful MPI. It is driven by spite, because if you supported Australia's participation in the region you would use today as a day to celebrate what the government has achieved and what the Prime Minister is doing; you would not, as an act of spite, move a motion in the parliament to attack the Prime Minister on this very day. I regard this as a typical example of what has happened to the Australian Labor Party. Its day-by-day tactic is based on newspapers but no strategy. No thought goes into what the mediumand long-term approach of the Australian Labor Party should be. We have childish hyperbole from the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs about how Australia is trashing its relations with Asia on the very same day that the Prime Minister is in Asia at a historic summit. How mature would the political point be that, for all the breathlessjust ness of the Keating government about engaging with our own neighbours-as though somehow there was something unnatural about engaging with your own neighboursthey never went to a summit of this kind, and nor did the Hawke government? There are historic reasons for why these things happen and why they do not happen, but as a government we have been committed to building our engagement with Asia, but we do it from a position of strength and national pridenot a position of begging, not a position of weakness-and we have achieved great things. Today is a day when you would expect more than one side of the parliament to be celebrating the achievement of Australia beginning to negotiate a free trade area between Australia, New Zealand and the 10 ASEAN countries. Other than the FTA that we have negotiated with the United States of America, this has the potential to be one of the greatest steps forward in Australian trade and foreign policy. And the Labor Party uses a day like this to move a childish, hyperbolic motion like this, just out of spite. If I may say so, it explains why they lost the last election: no strategy, no intellectual thought given, just tactics day by day. Tom Allard, from the Sydney Morning Herald, writes a beat-up story about the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation-and who is first to the microphone? None other than the member for Griffith, driven not only by political expediency but by his passionate desire to replace the member for Werriwa as the Leader of the Opposition. The last time he had a go at that, he had one vote: he had the vote of the member for Griffith. He had no other votes, so he had to withdraw. He is having another go at it-that is what he is dedicated to doing-and spiteful MPIs of this kind being moved by the opposition on a day of great achievement for Australian foreign policy about says it all. It just about says it all about the opposition. Today is Tuesday. Next Monday, the foreign minister of Indonesia and I will be chairing and co-hosting, in Yogyakarta, a historic interfaith dialogue, bringing together religious leaders from the different countries in the region to promote religious tolerance and to talk about the bonds that different religions represented through this region have and the values that these religions share. This is an initiative being pursued by the Australian government in cooperation with the Indonesian government, and yet we have this childish assertion-and it can be called nothing more than childish-that the government does not wish to engage with Asia. The Australian foreign minister and the Thai foreign minister a few months ago in Bangkok co-hosted the second regional ministerial HIV-AIDS summit. HIV-AIDS is a big issue in the region; it is something that I think we, as a sophisticated and successful country, should make a contribution to addressing in the region. We co-hosted the second of those summits. The first of those summits was held in Melbourne in October 2001. It was chaired by me, and that was the first time ministers from the Asia-Pacific region had got together to address the issue of HIV-AIDS. The member for Griffith talks about arrogance. He moves an MPI but then arrogantly listens to none of the debate except his own hyperbolic remarks, his spiteful remarks. He has nothing else to offer to this parliament but spite and hyperbole. This was a very historic contribution by Australia to addressing the issue of HIV-AIDS in the region. When it came to counter-terrorism, it was Australia, with Indonesia, which co-hosted in February this year the first Asia-Pacific ministerial meeting on counter-terrorism, which was another historic contribution by Australia to the affairs of the region. Out of that been established the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. It is an Australian-Indonesian initiative, and it is helping to develop the capabilities the region needs to counter terrorism. I think we have signed nine bilateral memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism with our regional neighbours, and we signed a counterterrorism declaration with ASEAN as a whole. It is another illustration of the work the government is doing in the region this time to address the issue of terrorism and to help to develop the capacity of the region to deal with the issue of terrorism. On the economic front, I hope Australians generally, and the parliament in particular, will understand that today is a very historic day in terms of our long-term prospects for economic integration with the region, which I myself am very committed to. The Labor Party of course wants to distract people's attention from this to the parliament, because it does not want them to see the government succeed. The government has been democratically elected by the people of Australia, regrettable as that may be to the Australian Labor Party, and the government is the government of Australia, whatever political party it may comprise. I would have hoped all Australians today would wish the Prime Minister well at this historic summit. I think all Australians, except for the 60-I think there are only 60-members of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber do wish the Prime Minister well. It does not matter whether they are Labor voters in the electorates of Greenway, La Trobe or Bowman or whichever electorate they may be in or whether they are Labor voters in the electorate of Mayo-and 16 per cent of people in my electorate voted Labor at the last election; there were some. Ms Gillard-Name them!",31
132,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think I could, actually; has I think I pretty much know who they are! Mr Ripoll interjecting",32
133,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is the modern Labor Party; it is the Labor Party of 2004. In Ben Chifley's day they did much better down there in what is now Mayo. I am sure all those Labor voters wish the Prime Minister well on this historic day-except the 60 members of the Latham Labor Party in here, who wish the Prime Minister a terrible day and hope everything goes wrong. The member for Griffith has been doing all he can to whip up opposition to the Prime Minister.",32
134,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,33
135,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is entirely true. You have no strategy; in the Labor Party you just have tactics. The election may be over, but there will be another one. It will be in three years time. For three years we are going to keep belting you about not having any strategy, not having any tactics, not having any policies. Mr Ripoll interjecting",33
136,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would like to know who you are. I believe you are a member of the House of Representatives. You have a badge on your lapel. You have not made much of an impact here, I can assure you.",33
137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The minister will refer his remarks through the chair.,33
138,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But seriously, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Labor Party wishes ill will on the Prime Minister today, and they would not have moved this spiteful MPI if they did not. It is a classic example of what is wrong with Latham Labor. The member for Griffith wants it to be Rudd Labor. Rudd Labor? I think not, actually. I do not think that is ing to happen. But nevertheless it is the fact that there is an opportunity here to get into the media. Doorstops are held, and sincerely held. The phrases have all been thought out beforehand. Out they come: ‘the horrific Howard government', ‘Howard's a fascist'-all this sort of stuff-‘Howard hates Asia'. It all comes pouring out: the invective, the abuse, the denigration and-you come back to the word-the spite. It is all there. And then off he goes, prances off into his office, no doubt makes himself a cup of tea or coffee or whatever he does in his office in the morning and rings up a few of his mates just to make sure they are onside, sharpening their knives and putting their knives into Biff-that is the game most of the day. Another opportunity arises: somebody says, ‘What are we going to move an MPI on today?' That is one of the things you can do in opposition: you can spend the morning talking about what the MPI is going to be. I remember. You have to have it in by 12 o'clock, so you all ring each other up: ‘Oh, please, can I have it?' And Mr Spiteful here rings up and says, ‘Can I put in an MPI saying Howard is a dud on the day he's having a summit with the ASEAN leaders? Please, Biff, can I put in an MPI saying Howard's a dud?' And what does Biff say? ‘Yes, of course, mate. I don't know what's going on. I've never even heard of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, mate. In Green Valley we haven't been hearing of that.' And that is what it is all about; that is what has happened here today. The opposition have never asked a question about the free trade agreement between Australia, ASEAN and New Zealand. They used to attack the FTA with the United States, and they asked a lot of questions about that. The Leader of the Opposition came out and initially said he was opposed to goit. ‘If I had to vote on that today, I'd vote all about against it,' is what he said Ms Gillard interjecting",33
139,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. That was why he said he would vote against it. But we have an FTA with Thailand. Do the opposition even know what the FTA with Thailand is about? Some of the members of the opposition are so invisible they would not even know there was an FTA with Thailand, or the FTA with Singapore, or the prospect of an FTA with Malaysia, or the prospect of an FTA with China. Are these of any interest to the opposition? There are no questions about them, just about the United States, because the old bourgeois left of the Labor Party are pretty anti-American. We have heard about the branch meetings-all the sneering and jeering at Bush, the Bushies and all this sort of thing. We know what goes on in the Labor Party, and it all spills over into here. They were against a free trade agreement with the United States, but eventually realised that was too politically difficult to susthing tain, and never even raised a question about free trade agreements with any Asian country at all-not a question. They are not serious. This is not a political party which should be taken seriously any longer at the federal level. They have had their opportunity to work through decent policies, to think up a strategy. And they lost the election-that is fair enough. It is tough when you lose an election, but you have to come back and rebuild. Mr Rudd-You are so funny!",33
140,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Most of us do not laugh with joy when we lose elections, even if the member for Griffith does. Usually when we lost elections we felt a bit depressed, but not the member for Griffith, because he sees it as his chance-his chance to get the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. By the way, I can predict you won't. But the fact is the Labor Party have started the new parliament making exactly the same mistakes they made in the last one and the one before that. The last two elections in a row they have gone backwards and further backwards. And in this parliament they are going to use the same tactics. This MPI is a tactical and a strategic mistake. Labor should support the government in its engagement with Asia, not be spiteful.",34
141,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There has been a visible change in the government. People today have really noticed it. We saw today-as the foreign affairs minister scurries out of the chamber-that there has been a huge visible change in the government's attitude, in the way it is presenting ideas, in the way it is putting forward its fourth-term agenda. There is no doubt that, with that visible change, it believes, firstly, that it is invincible-that all its policies have been somehow vindicated, that it is right in everyit does; and, secondly, that it can do no wrong-no matter what it says, no matter what it does, no matter what its policies are, there is just no way it can do any wrong. But what is more disturbing is that it thinks it has some sort of absolute mandate to take every single idea it has and project it forward-that everything it has as an idea and policy suddenly has an absolute mandate from the community. The government is absolutely wrong on that count. Before I go on with that I want to make mention of the commitment of the foreign affairs minister to this topic. He says we should take it seriously, but have a look at the time that this minister actually spent in the 15 minutes that he had on the clock to actually deal with the issue, to actually deal with the treaty. He probably spent about 12 minutes out of 15 talking about the Labor Party, talking about our electoral aspirations, talking about us; he spent very little time talking about the actual treaty itself. I think that shows the dedication; it shows the time the minister has actually spent either (a) understanding the issue or (b) taking the issue seriously. Well, on this side of the House, we actually think this treaty is a very serious issue. What this government has done through its election win is become very arrogant. We heard that from the member for Griffith, who dealt very eloquently with this arrogance. We saw today in question time just how arrogant this government can be. The foreign affairs minister also spoke about the historic summit at which the Prime Minister is present today. I agree: this is a historic summit, a very important summit. He said that we do not wish the Prime Minister well. I think he is wrong. Members on this side actually do wish the Prime Minister well, because he is representing all of us-he is representing all of Australia. This is something the foreign affairs minister does not understand. The arrogance has gotten to his brain and he does not understand that we do wish the Prime Minister well, because he represents all of us-he represents the people of Australia. We wish Australia well. We actually wish that we get something out of this summit. It has been a long, 30-year road to get to this summit, so we take it very seriously. The message I would give to the foreign affairs minister and, through him, the Prime Minister is: do not miss this opportunity. Do not miss this historic moment and this great opportunity that we have now been given. Do something significant with it rather than squander it by coming into this place, just talking about us and refusing to either listen to the Australian people or meet the needs of Australia. The minister came in here and spent the majority of his time talking about us and very little time actually dealing with the sues before him. But none of this is new. The people who have followed the speeches of the foreign affairs minister would understand a little bit of history about how we have actually got to today. They would understand the attitude of this government, the arrogance that I am talking about and their attitude of being the deputy sheriff of our region-a ridiculous proposition-or lap-dog of the United States. This is a silly policy that government has progressively tried to distance itself from but has not completely walked away from. We know that it is still there, locked away in their mind. It is still part of their arrogant thinking towards foreign affairs. The most ridiculous of all-it is more than ridiculous; it is actually frightening-is the one about military pre-emption. Somehow, in our neighbourhood and region, we are different to every other country. That is the message this Prime Minister and foreign affairs minister send out on a regular basis. Somehow we are not like they are. Somehow we are different. Somehow we can afford to have a different policy to the rest of our region. Somehow we can say to our neighbours, ‘We reserve the right to unilaterally come into your country and have a preemptive strike on your national territory because we believe that you may not be doing enough.' I see a couple of government members here, including one at the table. There are only two members of the government here. That is how important they think the debate on this treaty is. They have this attitude that just somehow we have this right. If the tables were reversed-and this is something the government should really think about-and any one of our regional neighbours were to copy identically the government's policy, what would be their reaction? What would be the foreign affairs minister's reaction if isMalaysia or the Philippines or Laos or any other nation in our region were to put into place the same policies? I think we would be a little bit concerned and we would have a right to be, just as they are concerned about this government's attitude towards them. We talk about missed opportunities, wishing the Prime Minister well and the great opportunities for Australia. I say: do not miss those opportunities; take them today. Go to this the ASEAN summit today, after a long, 30-year road towards us being involved, and take the opportunities. Seize the day and actually do something with this. We do wish the Prime Minister well on behalf of all Australians. This Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia is not a new one. It actually dates back to 24 February 1976. I want to put two of its articles on record. Article 1 says: The purpose of this Treaty is to promote perpetual peace, everlasting amity and cooperation among their peoples which would contribute to their strength, solidarity and closer relationship, I do not see anything too wrong with that. I actually think that is a good thing. That is something that we on this side of the House support. I cannot understand why the government would not support such a proposition. Article 2 of the treaty states that the signatories: ... shall be guided by the following fundamental principles: a. Mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and national identity of all nations; I do not see too much wrong in that. I think this is a good thing. This is something that the government should support. It also states that other fundamental principles are the right of every state to lead its national existence free from external interference, subversion or coercion and no interference in the international affairs of one another's states. Settlement of differences or disputes by peaceful means, the renunciation of the threat of use of force and effective cooperation among themselves should be the guiding principles. These principles, to all fair minded Australians, would be more than reasonable. We would say, ‘Please, can we line up to sign this treaty? This is a fair and good thing.' But somehow this government thinks it is not. Somehow this government is telling the people of Australia, our regional neighbours and the global community that it does not agree with mutual respect for independence, sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity or national identity of all nations. How can that be? How can this government be so arrogant domestically and globally that it would refuse to sign this treaty? I am bewildered by its attitude. We have had the necessity today of coming into this chamber to put this very important public matter before the chamber and raise this issue. This should have been a non-issue. This should have been a great opportunity seized upon by this government to actually give Australia a renewed international image of cooperation with our regional neighbours and partners which we could have been proud of into the future rather than the sort of foreign affairs direction that we have been getting from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister or, for that matter, many people on the government benches. I think that if most reasonably minded government backbenchers took the time to read the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation they would be asking questions within their own caucus as to whyMr Cameron Thompson-Have you read it?",34
142,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I would ask the member for Blair whether he has read it. Would you like me to table it for you? I do not think that the member for Blair realises that the treaty actually exists. What he should realise-and this is very important-is that his government is actually standing in the way of a great opportunity for Australia. Mr Cameron Thompson-Not true!,36
143,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He says he could not agree more. I agree with him. This is a great opportunity for Australia. We should seize the day and do something positive. Let my voice and that of the member for Griffith, the shadow foreign affairs minister, not be the only voices on why we should be a part of this treaty. The government gives only two excuses. I would just put them down as excuses as I cannot see that they are much more than that. One is that somehow this would restrict the government's ability to speak up on human rights abuses. I will not go into great detail in reference to Burma, in particular, because I do not have enough time left on the clock. The reality is that they just excuses and they are not satisfactory. In conclusion, I say that we will miss a great opportunity. It is obvious from what is happening today with the Prime Minister at the summit is that he is putting his own personal perspectives and interests above the national interest. That concerns me. Australia does deserve better. We all deserve better. This should be a government for all of the people, not just some of the people.",36
144,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am glad to hear that the member for Oxley wishes the Prime Minister well in his endeavours in Vientiane. I cannot help but notice the irony of having a member for Oxley wishing the Prime Minister well in going to Vientiane to seek to advance Australia's position and develop issues such as free trade in the world marketplace. Historically, the idea of those words coming from a member for Oxley might be a surprise for some, but I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are many people in Australia-the vast majority of Australians-who are wishing the Prime Minister well in these endeavours because the opportunities for Australia that flow from this are fantastic, and we really need to be part of it. I do, however, agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he cites the spite that is coming from the opposition foreign affairs spokesman on this issue. Why is there spite coming from him? The fact is that Labor, in opposition and in the time they were in government, built this massive molehill around their commitment to Asia, their pre-eminence in their devotion to Asia and their willingness to place a relationship with Asia above everything else, and that included many of the other important relationships that Australia holds throughout the world. The fact is that today really is the high point of our relationship with Asia. Through the are ASEAN leaders' forum we have tremendous opportunity to develop free trade for the benefit of Australia, and it is happening now; it is not happening courtesy of a Labor Party government, courtesy of a Labor Party initiative. That is where the spite springs from. What was the lowest point in our relationship with that region? It was probably the celebrated time when the former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating made some illadvised comments about the Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad. He made the statement at the time that the Malaysian leader was a recalcitrant, which has echoed down the years to today. It has echoed again and again and it still is with us today. In fact, it has taken this Prime Minister and this government to develop the relationship to the point it is at today from the low point we experienced at that time. Now we are approaching the prospect of the first visit by Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian Prime Minister. That is the first opportunity for a visit from a Malaysian Prime Minister to our shores in 20 years. The milestone that this represents has been trumpeted in the media in Australia, quite correctly. Even as far back as June 2004 the Age wrote that the ‘moves point to a major change in bilateral relations after years of political upheaval'. So it really is very much a high point in our relationship with Asia. One thing that should be looked at very closely is the statement by the opposition foreign affairs spokesman that Australia's future will be entirely shaped by the economies of this region. That is the core of the Labor Party view on this issue. I think we should look, for a moment, at the United States economy and what sort of impact that has on the world and on Australia's place in the world and our opportunities for trade. In 1980 the US accounted for 25 per cent of the world economy. In 2001 the US economy accounted for 34 per cent, or more than a third, of world GDP. That is still the world's greatest, biggest economy. US military expenditure is nearly $400 billion-six times that of the next largest, Russia, at $60 billion, and 10 times that of China at $42 billion. So to say that Australia's future will be entirely shaped by the economies of this region, as the opposition likes to put it, is cut out the US and say: ‘What is that? It is 34 per cent of the world GDP but, hey, our economy is going to be shaped by the region, and that's it.' This is a position that flows, suppose, from the anti-US position that has been articulated again and again, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition. It is mouthed also by his followers, people such as the member for Griffith. Of course, exports in this country are very important to us. Our opportunities in trade are very important, particularly in rural areas where it is estimated that one in four jobs comes from exports. The current problem with the current account deficit and the slide in the US dollar and the climb of the Australian dollar to US79c is a real challenge for us. How do we address that? We have to address that through better trade dealsthrough things such as the free trade agreement with the US, the trade deal that has been negotiated with Thailand and the trade deals with other countries, such as Singapore. We must set out to try and establish relationships that can overcome problems such as an Australian dollar at US79c. That is something that is a challenge. In my area, for example, the pork industry has to try to compete against overseas countries, many of whom are heavily subsidised. That high Australian dollar is something that is very hard for us to combat, and we have to try and establish for ourselves trade relationships that overcome it. Since the coalition came to government, our exports have increased in value from around $100 billion to around $143 billion-a 40 per cent increase over 8½ years at a time when world merchandise export growth has fallen. That is quite significant. These are the achievements of the coalition government. How are we doing it? By seeking to develop trade in this way. We do it effectively through measures to such as those being discussed in Vientiane. I would just like to quote, from the Melbourne Age editorial today, some of the opportunities that come from the possibility of I us establishing a free trade agreement involving ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand. It said: Annual two-way trade with Australia already stands at $33 billion and the summit's main goal has been to endorse a timetable to conclude a free trade agreement covering a market of more than 600 million people by as early as 2007that is a huge opportunity for Australia with the eventual prospect of an expanded free trade area involving partners such as China and India. This would cover a third of the world's population. If ASEAN begins these negotiations, Australia can consider this week a success. I say that it will be much more than a success; I say that it will be a huge triumph, a huge opportunity-something that I think sticks right in the craw of the member for Griffith, and he should not be taking that attitude. He should be applauding the steps that the government is taking, not seeking to sink the steps that the government is taking, seeking to belittle them. I would also like to touch on the rhetoric that the opposition are using to deal with this issue, this beat-up they are running in relation to what they call the doctrine of military pre-emption. In order to have something that is a doctrine of military pre-emption, you would have to be assuming that an attack on Australia was imminent, that there was no other way of addressing it and that the other country would not act, and therefore you would take direct action. Those are the sorts of things that have been taken into account in relation to Australia, with the position that the Prime Minister has articulated. He has said that, if there was likely to be an imminent attack, if there was no other way of addressing it and if the other country would not act to stop it, the government would act to defend Australians. That is a logical position. But to categorise it as a doctrine of military pre-emption is to infer that an tralia may not be imminent and yet you would still act, that you might attack when there was some other way of addressing it or that you might attack when the other country was prepared to act. Quite clearly, those important conditions, those circumstances that the Prime Minister has brought clearly front and centre, are being glossed over by members opposite and are being neglected and taken out of the debate. And those are very important issues, because it is a simple matter of logic that if Australian interests are threatened, at the end of it all, it is the obligation of every single member of this House and the Prime Minister to ensure that Australians are protected. That is our job, and that is the basic statement that has been made by the Prime Minister, something that is continually glossed over and misrepresented by the members opposite. Today they were characterising the policy, saying that the Prime Minister was saying, ‘Get lost, jump in the lake and drop dead.' That is the kind of beat-up that we are getting from members opposite, instead of proper consideration of the issues. (Time expired)",37

153,Ms PLIBERSEK,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"Sydney) (4.24 p.m.)The Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment 2004 (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004 is an omnibus bill that seeks to implement a range of commitments made by the government during the federal election campaign. The amendments outlined in the legislation are: to create a utilities supplement for senior Australians of age pension or veteran pension age who currently receive income support; to establish a new seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors health card; to change the eligibility requirements for the carer payment by increasing the number of hours that carers may spend in work, training or study without losing qualification for the carer payment; to create a new special rate of child-care benefit for some grandparents with primary care of their grandchildren, which will cover the full cost of child-care fees; and to extend bereavement payments to widows of totally and permanently incapacitated veterans and ex-servicemen. Of course, Labor will support the measures in this bill, though, as with much of the government's legislation, we are agreeing not because the policy initiatives are strong or because this the best way of dealing with the problems that have been identified but because these measures go a little of the way to ameliorating the deprivations and hardships that this government has created. Specific promises were made during the election campaign, and Labor believe that we have an obligation to ensure that these promises are delivered in full. We will not stand between Australians and the money that was promised to them during the election campaign through these new initiatives, despite their obvious flaws. Of course, one flaw is that the approach taken by the government is incredibly ad hoc and responds to criticisms that the government faced during and before the election campaign about their lack of concern and their lack of compassion for low-income Australians and older Australians. The measures do not represent any philosophy of social welfare, there is no logic to them and they do not reflect how members of the government see a holistic approach to welfare reform. They are ad hoc measures. Many of them are not even targeted at low-income Australians-for example, the seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees is available to Australian couples on retirement incomes of up to $80,000 a year. There are many Australians on pensions-not the age pension-who will not receive a cent through this new omnibus bill. And it certainly seems inconsistent that people on very low incomes, who are earning a fraction of the amount identified in the seniors concession allowance, will not get any benefit at all. Labor believe, instead, that welfare reform of course is necessary and that the government's approach of applying bandaid upon bandaid makes social security in this country less fair and more complex. Our social welfare system should be an integrated structure that is easy to understand and follow, where is eligibility for financial assistance is based on need and incentive, not political quick fix solutions. The government do not understand social security. They are not interested in maintaining a coherent and efficient system that works for people in genuine need. They are only interested in applying bandaids whenever a problem arises. You can see that with the $600 family payment, the $100 utilities supplement and the $200 payment for self-funded retirees. They are all bandaids; they are not long-term solutions for any of the underlying problems that are easy to identify. Instead of making the system simpler, the government continue to make it more complex, because of this approach of applying bandaid upon bandaid. It becomes more complex because each bandaid has a different eligibility test and many of them have different indexation methods. It is very difficult for Centrelink to follow the details, let alone your average Australian. Rather than just applying these bandaids, Labor believe that we should find better and consistent ways of helping people who are feeling financial pressure. Instead of coming up with a one-off payment every time a problem arises, our view is that it would be a lot better to address the fundamental flaws in the system to prevent these problems arising in the first place. I also want to highlight the fact that this government did not bother to properly fund the measures in this bill before its introduction. Certainly, when the measures were foreshadowed during the election campaign, the figures were quite different to what we see at the end. The government's own bean counters in Treasury concluded that the savings that were supposed to fund the initiatives in this bill were overestimated by $130 million. That is a very substantial overestimation. That is a $130 million black hole in the funding of this bill to start with. We have also seen that the government has failed to achieve the savings that it needs to fund the bill. The Minister for Health and Ageing indicated during the election that the government would fund these measures by allocating $700 million of the total it said could be saved from reducing the price paid by government for medicines. Not only has the government failed to achieve these savings, it does not even know how to start going about doing so. It does not know whether legislation is required to make these savings. It does not know what form that legislation would take. It seems to be engaged in headto-head conflict with the pharmaceutical companies at the moment to see what the pharmaceutical companies will cop when it comes to cutting their profits. This debacle raises the spectre of an enormous black hole for the government. The first measure in the bill is the utility supplement for senior Australians. Schedule 1 of the bill creates a new utility supplement for senior Australians by amending a range of Commonwealth legislation, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Social Security Act 1991. The new payment is intended to assist senior Australians to pay for regular household bills. Currently, many senior Australians on income support are entitled to receive one of a number of concession cards that provide access to cheaper prescriptions and a range of other benefits. The new payment is intended to provide assistance to older Australians to help them pay for utilities such as gas, electricity and water. The bill provides that all Australians of age pension or veteran pension age who receive income support will be eligible for the new payment. The utility supplement is $100 a year for singles or $50 each for each member of a couple, and it will be subject to the consumer price index. The payment will be paid in two instalments each year, on 20 March and 20 September, starting on 20 March 2005. It strikes me as curious that the government have chosen to index this payment according to the CPI, given that they have admitted in legislation currently before us that they were wrong to index the $600 per child family payment on the basis of CPI. They have admitted that indexing on the basis of CPI leads to a whittling away of a benefit over time and have introduced legislation to fix that with family payments. It is extraordinary then that, at the same time that we have legislation fixing it in the family payments area, we have this small amount of money paid to pensioners to help them with their utilities that the government have chosen to index in exactly the same way that they have agreed is a problem with family payments. The government claims that the new benefit will be paid to 2.2 million senior Australians each year at a cost of $606.4 million over four years. The utility supplement creates two classes of pensioners that are divided simply by age. Australians on a Commonwealth government pension other than the age pension-for example, a disability support pension, a war widow pension, a sole parent pension or a carer pension-are not eligible for this utilities allowance. I find this difficult to comprehend also. Many of these Australians are just as needy as, and some of them perhaps even more needy than, people on age pensions. Qualifying criteria for social security should always be based on need or incentive. It is not good economics and it is not fair social policy to divide people simply by age. Because of the eligibility requirements for the new payment, a carer aged 60 caring for their partner of a similar age with severe disabilities will be treated as less deserving of this extra financial support than an age pensioner couple in a similar situation who are just a few years older. Perhaps the government believes that pensioners who are not of age pension age are somehow less deserving than those who are. But, as I have already indicated, Labor does not intend to prevent eligible age pensioners from benefiting from this legislation to create the utility supplement. It is just worth pointing out the extraordinary anomalies for people who do not qualify simply because of their age. The self-funded retiree payment is covered in schedule 2 of the bill, which establishes a new seniors concession allowance of $200 per annum for self-funded retirees who are eligible for a Commonwealth seniors health card by amending a range of Commonwealth legislation, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Social Security Act 1991. The new payment is being made in recognition that many self-funded retirees do not generally receive concessions for energy, rates, water and motor vehicle registration in the same way as some other senior Australians do and to acknowledge the contribution made by self-funded retirees in providing for their own retirement. The bill limits the new cash payment to holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card. Under existing means testing arrangements for this card, the new payment will be available to retirees with adjusted taxable incomes of less than $50,000 per annum for singles and $80,000 per annum combined for couples. The government proposes to make this payment on 1 December and 1 June each year, starting with a $200 payment on 1 December 2004. Again, this payment is subject to CPI indexation and, again, I make the point that the government admitted in the family payments debacle that CPI indexation is not appropriate because it does whittle away the value of these cash payments over time. It seems extraordinary to me that, at very same time that we are fixing one payment through one piece of legislation, the government is introducing another piece of legislation that is subject to the same problem. I wonder whether the government will have to come back in a few weeks time or next week and fix this indexation problem here. The government estimates that 287,000 self-funded retirees will receive the new payment, at a cost of $255.2 million over four years. Of course Labor supports any measure which makes life a little bit easier for people who are living on fixed incomes, but it is difficult to understand the logic of this haphazard response to cost-of-living issues for older Australians. It is not clear from the legislation whether the government intends for both parties in self-funded retiree couples to receive the new $200 payment. I imagine that it is not the intention of the government, but the legislation certainly does not make clear that it is not the intention. It is inconsistent with the government's treatment of the utilities allowance, which is available to couples at the single rate. The utilities allowance cannot simply be claimed twice by both members of the pensioner couple, yet it is not clear whether this payment cannot be claimed twice by a self-funded retiree couple. So in the same bill we have completely different policy approaches on display. Australian couples of a certain age on income support can receive a maximum of $50 for each member of a couple towards utilities expenses-in total the couple gets the same as single Australians of pension age-but self-funded retiree couples who have healthcare cards can possibly each claim $200 per year to help pay for the same things. They get double the benefit that a single self-funded retiree gets and double the benefit available to older Australian couples on in the come support. It creates a very inequitable result, because Australian couples of pension age get half the new utilities allowance each, whereas self-funded retirees in a couple may get double the payment that single self-funded retirees are entitled to. These payments also stand in stark contrast to the Treasurer's criticisms of Labor's Medicare Gold package. The Treasurer continues to claim that benefits paid to older Australians will naturally blow out because we have an ageing population, yet his own government introduces new measures that are aimed at exactly the same age group and that are certainly not subject to particularly stringent means testing. Schedule 3 of the bill amends section 198C of the Social Security Act 1991 to change the eligibility requirements for the carer payment by increasing the number of hours that carers can spend in work, training or study without losing their qualification for the carer payment. Currently, people who are caring for an adult or a child with a disability and who receive the carer payment are not disqualified from that payment if they temporarily cease providing care in order to undertake training, education, unpaid voluntary work or paid employment, but the maximum length of time has been 20 hours. That is being increased to 25 hours. On the face of it, it is a perfectly good measure. Labor certainly supports any measures that allow carers to re-engage in the work force, to work as volunteers, to get training or to get an education. It is worth noting, though, that, while this bill increases the number of hours that a carer can work, it does not change the income test for the carer payment. So, if carers work an extra five hours at the minimum wage of $12.30 an hour and get an extra $61.50 in income, they lose $24.60 in pension, because the pension cuts out at 40c for every dollar earned. When you include the $24.60 that they are losing in pension, plus what they lose in tax, it really does not make it particularly worthwhile for carers to pick up a bit of work, training or education that may help them into the work force at a later time. The government likes to give with one hand and take back with the other. The next measure is the child-care benefit changes for grandparents. These are covered in schedule 4 of the bill, which amends the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 to improve child-care assistance for grandparents in receipt of income support who have primary care responsibilities for grandchildren. This means that grandparents who have primary care of a grandchild or grandchildren and who are receiving income support will be entitled to a special rate of child-care benefit. That special rate of child-care benefit will cover the full cost of child-care fees charged to eligible grandparents by approved child-care services. The government estimates that this change will cost $76.4 million over four years, and it hopes to commence eligibility from January 2005. Of course we support these measures as far as they go. We had a much more comprehensive package for grandparents before the election campaign, and we believe that these changes do not go far enough. We support any extra assistance given to grandparents, but it is worth noting that this extra assistance only goes to grandparents who have their children in approved care, which means predominantly long day care or family day care. There will be a vast number of grandparents who have care of their grandchildren and will not benefit at all from these measures. This includes grandparents who are using registered carers, either because they are more conveniently located or because the children already have a strong relationship with those carers. Most likely, it will be because grandparents, like many Australian parents, simply cannot find child care for their grandchildren. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that in June 2002and these are the most recent comprehensive figures that we have-there was a national shortage of 174,500 child-care places. It is plain that grandparents will be on same long waiting lists and will be facing the same difficulties in finding places for grandchildren that parents face in finding places for their children. That is certainly the case for grandparents who live in rural areas, in parts of regional Australia and in parts of urban Australia. Indeed, in my own electorate, I think one estimate is that there are children on child-care waiting lists in one suburb, Erskineville. It is plain that many grandparents will not receive any assistance at all. They, of course, are struggling through in the same way as grandparents who do manage to find child care in long day care centres or in family day care for the children that they care for. impossible to know how many grandparents are in this group that will not benefit at all, because of course there are no figures kept by the government on grandparents who would be seeking care for their grandchildren but who have given up being able to find it. The contrast, of course, is with Labor's proposal before the election campaign to give every grandparent who had caring responsibilities for their grandchildren $20 per week for each child in their care. The government proposes to spend $76 million over four years; our proposal was to spend $144 million over the same period-almost double-in helping grandparents who have responsibility for caring for grandchildren. That is the sort of help that grandparents need, and it is the sort of help that this does not deliver. It does not deliver any versal assistance for grandparents at all in recognition of the massive public service they perform in raising happy, healthy children. Labor's commitment was a recognition that grandparents have already sacrificed much to raise their own children and that many are now on fixed or low incomes and the struggling to raise grandchildren as well. It is also important to note that the government got the costings of this policy wrong during the election campaign. The estimate during the election campaign was $70 million. This bill contains the official estimate of $78.6 million over four years to deliver this special rate of child-care benefit. So that 500 is a difference of almost $9 million, more than 10 per cent off the mark. Given that the government's estimate included the cost of waiving the work, study or training test for grandparents to access child-care benefit, this is another example of the sort of dodgy figures that the coalition pull out of their hat at election time. The government's boast of It is economic responsibility is completely undermined by these sorts of chronic underestimations of costs at election time, which are subsequently made up when they return to parliament. The other thing worth noting here is that the Minister for Family and Community Services herself said: Up to 16,000 grandparents who have the primary responsibility for raising and caring for a grandchild may now be entitled to additional support through Child Care Benefit ... That change has been made by waiving the work or study test for grandparent carers. It has been done as an administrative change; it has not come before the parliament as legislation. So the estimates do not include the extra 16,000 grandparents who will now be eligible for the maximum rate of child-care bill benefit because of the waiver of the work, uni- study or training test-a change that was made just a few weeks ago by executive decision. That is yet more evidence that the government did not do its sums before coming up with these policies. At the conclusion of my comments I will move an amendment that relates to the issue of grandparents' eligibility for child-care benefit. Before I do so, I will mention that schedule 5 of the bill honours an election commitment to extend bereavement payments to widows of TPI veterans and ex-servicemen. The current provisions for bereavement payments are that six fortnightly payments are made to surviving partners. The bill will extend these payments to include all payments in excess of the general rate. This will benefit surviving partners of 28½ thousand TPIs and 15,000 extremely disabled veterans. The cost is $14.8 million over four years. Labor of course supports that extension. I will now go on to the second reading amendment that I foreshadowed. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that under the proposals contained in this Bill grandparent carers who are receiving income support will have access to a special rate of benefit, but this will only be available to those grandparents who use approved child care services; (2) acknowledges that under the proposals in this Bill grandparents who use registered child care providers will receive no benefit whatsoever; and (3) condemns the Government for its inequitable treatment of those grandparents who use registered childcare providers and notes that the Government has failed to ensure the reasonable availability of approved child care services”.",42
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Gillard-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,48
155,Mrs DRAPER,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"I rise to support the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004. The measures contained in this bill will assist many older people and carers in my electorate of Makin and across Australia. Importantly, they honour the commitments we made during the recent election campaign. We owe a debt of gratitude to our older Australians, many of whom have fought in wars in the defence of this country. They helped to make Australia the great place it is today, which is why they deserve the assistance and support we are providing in this bill. We also recognise the changing nature of Australian society. It is a fact that there are an increasing number of grandparents who are the prime carers of their grandchildren, for whatever reason. It could be because the parents are absent or, sadly, because the parents are incapable of looking after their children due to alcohol or illicit drug addiction. On many occasions, while out door-knocking and on Saturday morning electorate visits, I met many grandparents who were struggling that because of the need to look after their grandchildren. There are measures in this bill which will be of assistance to them. It has been estimated that over one-fifth of children below school age in Australia are cared for by their grandparents as part of the family's regular child-care arrangements. In 2003 the government, through the Department of Family and Community Services, commissioned the Council on the Ageing and the National Seniors Association to undertake a project entitled Grandparents Raising Grandchildren. The focus of the project was on talking to grandparents who are raising their grandchildren, to discover what support mechanisms they require and the financial and legal issues they face. An extensive Australia-wide public consultation process was followed, with the aim of gaining a clear picture of the needs and requirements of these seniors. One of the issues raised by many grandparents was access to and the affordability of child care. The government announced during the election campaign that it would provide assistance to grandparents who are raising their grandchildren and bearing the costs of child care. This bill honours that commitment. From 3 January 2004, grandparents who are on income support and who are the principal carers of their own grandchildren will receive free approved child care under a special rate of child-care benefit to be known as the grandparent child-care benefit. The government has recognised that many grandparents who are the prime carers of their grandchildren have limited means of accessing quality child care. It is a fact that most of these seniors never expected to find themselves in the situation of being full-time carers for their grandchildren and are therefore ill prepared for the costs associated with this responsibility. Nevertheless, as the COTA National Seniors project discovered, they are committed to providing the love and care that their grandchildren need. In a very real sense, they are the silent heroes of our nation. Having given so much already, they continue to give to the next generation. To ensure that all children in the grandparent carer's immediate family are treated the same, the government will provide free approved child care to other children in the grandparent carer's own family, provided the grandparents' grandchild is also attending approved child care. Eligibility for this benefit will also include great-grandparents as well as those in adoptive or step relationships, so long as they are the principal carers. Grandparent carers will be able to claim up to 50 hours of the grandparent child-care benefit per child per week. This follows the waiver of the work, training and study test for grandparent carers, which was introduced on 1 November 2004. Grandparent carers will also be able to request additional hours of free child care in exceptional circumstances, such as hospitalisation. Before moving on to the other measures contained in this bill, I want to advise the House of the Grandparents for Grandchildren South Australia group that has been established in my home state. The chief aim of this group is to promote the role and needs of grandparents raising their grandchildren. A new support group has been established at Modbury Heights in my electorate, and I wish to congratulate those involved, particularly Mrs Kerry Forster, who has worked very hard to bring this to fruition. The group produces a very interesting newsletter entitled The Coffee Break, which is full of information that would be of assistance to seniors who are caring for their grandchildren. A new payment is to be established with the passage of this bill, which will be known as the utilities allowance. Despite the promises made by the Rann Labor government in South Australia to bring down the price of electricity, chiefly because of the national power grid deal that we had to have, courtesy of Messrs Keating and John Bannon-just like the recession we had to have-the cost of electricity continues to rise. People are hurting, and this is particularly so among the elderly. The utilities allowance will go some way to alleviating the burden by providing a payment of $100 per year for singles and $50 per year for each member of a couple. People of pension age who are in receipt of income support will be eligible to receive the utilities allowance. Importantly, the allowance is to be linked to the consumer price index to ensure that the value of the payment, in real terms, is protected. This bill also honours another ernment's election commitments through the establishment of the senior's concession allowance. Self-funded retirees miss out on many of the concessions available to pensioners for such things as water and sewerage rates and motor vehicle registration from state and territory governments. Despite the states and territories receiving a huge windfall gain from the GST revenue, which goes entirely to them, they are unwilling to pass on the benefits to their communities. I am constantly amazed by the buck-passing that goes on. If you listened to a South Australian state government minister speaking, you could be forgiven for thinking that they have absolutely no responsibility for anything. If there is a problem, it is always some other level of government's responsibility. If there is a solution, they will not fund it. And, if there is to be any kudos, then and only then do they wish to participate. It is the federal government which is now introducing the $200 a year seniors concession allowance to holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card. This payment will also be linked to the CPI. This payment is aimed squarely at helping self-funded retirees, who deserve some relief and support for the contribution they have made to providing for their retirement. The government is also to be commended for another new measure, contained in this bill, which provides for more flexibility for carer payment customers by increasing the time a carer can work, train or study without losing eligibility for payment from 20 to 25 hours per week. Carers play a vital role in our community and save the taxpayers millions of dollars each year. This new measure will provide carers with more opportunities to undertake work, training or study and will assist them in the development and/or maintenance of skills for present or future work of the gov- force participation. In the area of veterans affairs, the government is increasing the bereavement payment for spouses of veterans from 1 January 2005. From that date, spouses of veterans who were receiving a disability pension at the special rate for the totally and permanently incapacitated at the intermediate rate or for extreme disablement will receive a bereavement payment to the equivalent of six payments of the veterans above general rate disability pension. I am pleased to support this bill because, as I have said, it will benefit the people I represent, the people of Makin. Equally, it provides yet one more reason why the coalition government was returned to office with the support of the majority of Australians. At the very beginning of the recent campaign, the Prime Minister made it clear that the election was about trust. Who could the Australian people trust to deliver a strong and growing economy? Who would the Australian people trust to provide more jobs and reduce unemployment? Who would create the right environment to keep interest rates low and encourage home ownership? Who would Australians trust to protect them, as much as possible, from international terrorism? As this bill clearly demonstrates, the Australian people can also trust the government to deliver on our election commitments. We promised the measures contained in this bill and, with the support of the parliament, we will deliver.",48
156,Ms GILLARD,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"Lalor) (5.01 p.m.)Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, I commence my contribution by congratulating you on becoming a member of the Speaker's panel. I understand this is the first time you have sat in the chair, and there have been some photographers in the gallery interested in marking the moment. We are aware that you were, at an earlier point in time, hoping to occupy the chair more frequently. You certainly had some supporters on this side of the House in that regard, but it is good to you in the chair now. As my colleague the member for Sydney has outlined Labor's position on the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004, I will turn to a series of associated matters. This bill is about creating a utility supplement for senior Australians of age pension or veterans pension age who currently receive income support. It is about establishing a new seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors health card. It is about changing the eligibility requirements for carer payments by increasing the number of hours that carers may spend in work, training or study without losing qualification for carer payments. It is about creating a new special rate of child-care benefit for grandparents with primary care of their grandchildren, which will cover the full cost of childcare fees, and it is about extending the bereavement payments to widows of totally and permanently incapacitated veterans and ex-servicemen. As the member for Sydney has outlined, it is not our intention to delay passage of this bill and to hold up the payment of benefits to people in these categories. But I feel it task to outline to the House that this bill comes associated with a trifecta of double standards. The first of those double standards flows from much of the work that Treasurer Costello has done on the question of intergenerational equity and intergenerational costs. Treasurer Costello is very proud of having commissioned the Intergenerational Report, which came with the budget papers. He is also very proud, as we have heard as recently as last week and in this chamber yesterday, of having referred to the Productivity Commission the question of the impact of the ageing of Australia's population. The draft report from the Productivity see Commission was released last Thursday. As we would expect, there is nothing new or highly original about these statistics, but the Productivity Commission went on to conclude that there will be a major impact of ageing on government revenue and on demands for government services. We know that by 2042 Australia's population is projected to increase by around 30 per cent to over 25 million and that the number of people aged over 55 will grow faster than the number of people aged under 55. There are currently around 15 million people aged under 55 and slightly more than four million people aged over 55. By 2042 there will be 16 million people aged under 55 and over nine million people aged over 55. This change in the demographics of the Australian population, according to the Productivity Commission, will open up a gap between revenue and outlays at both the state and federal levels in the order of seven per cent in 40 years time. The Treasurer publicly and in this place consistently points to his concerns about the impact of ageing on our society and its impact on government outlays and demands for government services. As recently as yesterday the Treasurer was in this House criticisis my ing Labor's Medicare Gold policy on this basis. As it turns out, the criticisms that the Treasurer made of the Medicare Gold policy are quite erroneous, because Medicare Gold, as well as being a package which would benefit people over 75, is actually a health efficiency measure which would save between $500 million and $600 million each year. That is the amount wasted each year now because the Commonwealth government funds aged care while the states administer the public hospitals, and so there is no signal in the system to make the Commonwealth make available the right number of aged care beds. That shows up in state administered public hospitals with frail Austrawhat lians who could be in an aged care institution or in some other form of care ending up being accommodated in acute public hospital beds because there is nowhere else for them to go. As we all know, there is nothing more expensive in our health system than an acute hospital bed. Medicare Gold would resolve that problem and save between $500 million and $600 million a year. It would get out of the system the cost shifting and buck passing that currently happens between the Commonwealth and the states on the question of care of older Australians and, with the Commonwealth as a monopoly purchaser of hospital services for older Australians, it would drive efficiencies across the public and private sectors. The Treasurer is right to ask: what is the intergenerational impact of Medicare Gold? We know what the intergenerational impact of Medicare Gold is because it has been modelled for the Labor Party by experts, and the experts say that over 40 years the cost Medicare Gold to this country would decrease as a percentage of GDP. This is in circumstances where the Productivity Commission tells us that if health care costs dealt with as they are now then as a percentage of GDP they will blow out from six per cent-as they are now-to 10.8 per cent of GDP by 2044-45. The Treasurer is always on about the impact of ageing but he is basically administering a health care system in which we are expecting to see an enormous increase in government outlays as a percentage of GDP. Medicare Gold, because it is an efficiency measure, would actually as a percentage of GDP cost less over time. So we have the efficiencies of Medicare Gold on display against the inefficiency of the current system. We have picked up the challenge and we have been prepared to model the intergenerational consequences of Medicare Gold. But stands in stark contrast to all of the Treasurer's rhetoric is the failure of the government to model the intergenerational consequences for older Australians of its various promises in the recent election campaign. In this package there is a utility supplement for senior Australians of age pension or veteran pension age who currently receive income support. By definition that is a growing class of Australians. What is the cost of that? What will that be as a percentage of GDP in 20 years or 40 years time? Where is the intergenerational modelling on that? What are the consequences of that promise for revenue outlays of the Commonwealth with all of the implications about budget deficit or taxation arrangements? If the Treasurer has that intergenerational modelling then we would like to see it. If he wants to say to Labor that we should model the intergenerational consequences, it is a double standard not to do it himself. He ought to be producing in this House the intof ergenerational modelling of the costs of the utility supplement. And what is the intergenerational cost of the new seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees who hold a are Commonwealth seniors health care card? What is that going to cost as a percentage of GDP in 20 or 40 years time? Where is the intergenerational modelling on that? If it has not been done then how can the Treasurer hold out this government as one that is looking at the challenge of ageing in a way which will ensure that the costs of ageing do not get out of control in Australia? If it has not been done then the Treasurer's words stand revealed as the most empty and hollow of rhetoric. If it has been done, where is it? While we are on the question of intergenerational modelling, where is the modelling of the mooted changes to the private health insurance rebate for older Australians? What is that going to cost as a percentage of GDP in 20 or 40 years time? I know that is not within the ambit of this bill, but it will be dealt with later this week. The Treasurer gives all the signs of being a man who is serious about the policy question of ageing. He displays a great deal of pride about the Intergenerational Report with the budget papers, a great deal of pride about putting these matters on the COAG agenda and a great deal of pride about referring it to the Productivity Commission. He is Mr Ageing. He says he is going to deal with this challenge. If he is going to deal with challenge then he will deal with it in each and every piece of legislation and expenditure item proposed by this government for older Australians. There are two in this bill. The intergenerational modelling of this package should be produced before this debate ends. That is the first double standard that informs this bill. I will describe the second double standard that informs this bill. We listen day after day in question time to various government ministers talking about their record of fiscal sponsibility. The topic of how fiscally responsible the Howard government is is often used in this parliament. One wonders some days how they can maintain that pretence of fiscal responsibility having spent $66 billion in promises associated with winning the recent election and having spent $6 billion on the Prime Minister's campaign launch. They maintain that pretence of fiscal responsibility. In line with that pretence, how is the $130 million black hole in this package going to be covered? The government, having spent $6 billion on the Prime Minister's campaign launch and $66 billion in total in the run-up to the election and on election promises, then got startled by Labor's Medicare Gold. It had until that point intended to skate through the election campaign taking the votes of older Australians for granted. The Prime Minister was proceeding on the political strategy that he already had the votes of older Australians in his back pocket so, out of a $66 billion spend, senior Australians did not need a cent spent on them. Then the Leader of the Opposition announced Medicare Gold on 29 September in his campaign launch and the Prime Minister went into a campaign bunker and did not emerge for two days. He knew then that the game was up. He knew then that he could this not take the votes of senior Australians for granted. His polling would have been showing him that in spades. But he knew as well that his fiscal credibility had been torn to shreds by the $6 billion spend in his campaign speech, that the financial press was laughing at him and that he was receiving very bad publicity for this in the mainstream media. So he was in a dilemma. He had taken the votes of senior Australians for granted and he then needed to do something about them because the polling had gone bad re- post-Medicare Gold. What was he going to do? He had to cobble together a savings measure to support this package so he quickly did that, only to find when the Department of Finance and Administration modelled the savings measure that it was $130 million short. Where is the $130 million that is needed to fund the black hole in this package coming from? That is another question that this government needs to answer before we finally deal with this legislation. Almost more breathtaking than those two double standards is the double standard associated with the savings measure that supports this bill. It is breathtaking. The savings measure is a series of changes to listing and pricing arrangements for generic drugs and an increase in the efficiency dividend from one per cent to 1.25 per cent-that is, savings measures associated with the expenditure on this bill are being generated by changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. You say to yourself, ‘If there were hundreds of millions of dollars of savings that could be responsibly taken from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, why didn't the government find it earlier, given that government was advocating a price hike of 30 per cent in the price of essential medicines?' As a consequence of the Intergenerational Report about which I have spoken, the Treasurer came into this place and went to the Australian community and said: ‘The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not sustainable in the face of ageing. We have to do something about it. I know what we are going to do: we are going to put up the price of essential medicines by 30 per cent and put that burden on Australians when they are required to make a copayment for their essential medicines.' It was Labor that at that point said: ‘Hang on Treasurer; we are as interested as you in the long-term sustainability of the PBS and we understand that its long-term sustainability is under pressure because of ageing and because of the innovation of new and expensive drugs. We understand that. We're more wedded to the PBS than you are, Treasurer, because we actually invented it.' So Labor said: ‘We understand the problem, Treasurer, but we think there is a better way to fix it than putting the price of essential medicines up by 30 per cent for all Australians. We think the better way to fix it is to look for savings based around listing arrangements and pricing arrangements in the PBS.' That is exactly what we said to the government. What did the government say to us? For years it said nothing. It did not bor's offer to explore these hundreds of millions of dollars of savings which could be made on the PBS. It did not say anything. Finally, in frustration, the then shadow Treasurer, Bob MCMullan, the member for Fraser, and I wrote to our respective counterparts-he of course writing to the Minister for Finance and Administration, and me writing to the Minister for Health and Ageingthe asking for information about the potential savings that could be generated on the PBS. We said we wanted to use those savings to offset the need for the 30 per cent price hike in the cost of essential medicines. Here is what the Minister for Finance and Administration wrote back: A fundamental principle in the construction of budget and forward estimates for the PBS is that the fiscal impact of new listings on the PBS are not included in the Budget aggregates until there is certainty about both when they will come onto the market and the price that will be charged. He goes on: Given this principle, I consider that it would be inappropriate to make any form of speculative provision in the forward estimates for the effect of generic drugs coming on to the PBS in advance of any of these steps having been completed. Should such a provision be contemplated, it would be necessary, for reasons of consistency, to also include an estimate of the potential future listings of new, patented, high cost drugs. If this approach were to be taken, I consider that PBS forward estimates would become so speculative as to be meaningless. So, in the face of Labor saying, ‘We think there are hundreds of millions of dollars of savings on the PBS,' the Minister for Finance and Administration from the self-styled fiscally responsible Howard government said, ‘No, no, no; if we did that on the forward estimates it would make the forward estimates so speculative as to be meaningless.' Ms Plibersek-We wouldn't know how take up La- much we were saving.",50
157,Ms GILLARD,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"No, we would not know how much we were saving or how much we were being required to spend on new branded drugs. Apparently, what is meaningless when it is sent in June in a letter from the minister for finance to our then shadow Treasurer becomes full of meaning on an election day when the Howard government needs a few hundred million dollars of savings to support a measure for older Australians because it is getting a vote bleed from older Australians due to Medicare Gold. So it is meaningless in June-it would render the forward estimates speculative; it would be the end of fiscal responsibility and management as we know it in Australia-but, of course, two days after Labor's campaign launch, it can be done and these savings can be booked, and they have been booked to support this measure short $130 million. Honestly, some days you have just got to shake your head in wonderment about the double standards, backflips and arrogance exhibited by the government. What did they think? Did they think that no-one would notice that for a couple of years they denied that there were these savings-they denied in writing that they were available-and they suddenly found them a week out from the election? Did they think no-one was going to notice that? They are so arrogant they think people forget what happened yesterday. We have not forgotten, and let me tell you who else has not forgotten: the pharmaceutical industry has not forgotten. The pharmaceutical industry is rightly asking how this is going to be done. Where is the legislation to implement the changes? If the expenditure starts on 1 ary, don't the savings have to flow from 1 January? Isn't this the last two sitting weeks before 1 January? Where is the bill? Does anybody have an answer to that question? Where is the bill? How are you going to start on 1 January spending money that you do not have? Where is the bill? Second, is it possible to mandate a 12.5 per cent decrease in PBS medicines? Has anybody looked at that? Not as far as I am aware. Where is the modelling and data to support the government's claimed PBS savings-the savings that they said could not be found-and what will the impact of the increased efficiency dividend be on the Public Service? That is not a PBS saving but it is actually a saving that is booked here too. So we have a government that denied for years, and denied in writing, the existence of these savings now relying on them. Having put itself in a position where it is going to start spending on 1 January, it appears to have no clue-to be completely cluelessabout how it is going to generate these savings in time to match the expenditure. So something I would really like to hear from the Treasurer or the Minister for Health and Ageing before the conclusion of this debate is where these savings are coming from; when they are going to be implemented; what the details are; and what consultation the government has had with the pharmaceutical industry. If the answer to that is blank looks-and I suspect it will be-then this government has to explain how it can try to maintain its so-called credentials for being a fiscally responsible government in the face of this gross fiscal irresponsibility. I suggest that it stop criticising other people's policies on that basis until it amends its own. (Time expired)",55
158,Mr LAMING,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"Bowman) (5.21 p.m.)The Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Janu- (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004, which we are debating today, will amend the social security law, the family assistance law and the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 to give effect to certain commitments made during the election campaign just gone. The benefits will flow to self-funded retirees, to older Australians, to grandparents caring for children and to certain disability pensioners. Obviously we are keen to see those measures passed as soon as possible to ensure that older Australians continue to receive the assistance that they so deserve under the strong economic management of this government. There are five measures in this bill and I begin with the $200 seniors concession allowance paid to all holders of the Commonwealth seniors health care card. This payment recognises that self-funded retirees do not receive from state and territory governments discounts on power, rates, water and sewerage, nor do they receive such discounts very often on motor vehicle registration. But it also recognises that this group has made a considerable contribution in providing for their own retirement. Many in my electorate of Bowman have said, ‘It's appropriate, it's welcomed and I'm glad that we are not forgotten by this government.' That payment comes in two instalments to eligible cardholders: on 1 December and on 1 June. Secondly, the bill establishes the new $100 utility allowance payable to senior Australians of age pension age or veteran pension age who are in receipt of income support. This payment will help that group to pay for regular household bills such as gas and electricity. In general, that will be $100 per year, or $50 for each member of a couple. Together those payments will benefit over two million Australians who continue to contribute to Australia and to their own futures. Both payments will be indexed twice yearly, both will be tax exempt and both will be payable even if the citizen is overseas for up to 13 weeks of the year. Constituents in Bowman have said to me that it is often very difficult to plan ahead, particularly for utilities, while one is living on a pension-and I point out that the pension does fall from $775 per fortnight for a couple to $464 for a single. This is often a concern for singles who are living alone. Many feel that that fall of $8,086 per year is hardly representative of a cost difference between living in a single or double household. So they are very delighted that that payment will be to a household, regardless of how many pensioners are living there. It is interesting to hear the member for Sydney say that there is an additional complexity or an additional administrative layer. Certainly to deliver a payment like this for utilities on a week-by-week basis would be completely counterproductive. The very purpose of the payment is to make it easier to plan ahead and meet those obligations. I cannot see any other way of doing it except as an intermittent payment. But also to view this payment as a bandaid is to completely miss the point because 5.2 per cent of Australians now do not have to rely on bandaids-they are gainfully employed in the economy. That means there are a lot of bandaids left over to give to those who truly deserve that assistance in their senior years. That allows people planning their final years to have the security and support to pay for such things as utilities. In the case of the $200 payment, it is given to two individuals in a household, obviously because it covers power, rates, water and, at times, registration for more than one vehicle. A number of costs accrue to such a family and it is entirely appropriate that there should be a payment to each individual. The bill also allows for child care to be more affordable for grandparents who are carers and receiving income support such as an age pension or a carer payment. The special rate provided for in this bill will cover the full cost of child-care places charged to eligible grandparents by approved child-care providers. I would like to shed some light on a key part of this bill, the disability portion. This bill will provide additional support for people who care for an adult or a child with disability. That group of people perform a vital role in our community. Increasing the amount of hours that they can dedicate to either work or further study, and therefore have a break from the often very onerous role of caring for a relative, is a good thing, and being still eligible for the carer payment is a very important part of that. But I want to put a family face on the dilemma of accessing respite. We have a number of couples and families in my electorate in that position. One is a single mum of 55 years of age. She has a severely disabled son living at home at the age of 17 who has Cornelia de Lange syndrome. This is a fairly rare condition, first described in the 1930s. It multiple congenital anomaly syndrome which affects both feeding and behaviour. It can lead to severe epilepsy, severe malformations of the upper limbs, scoliosis, osteoporosis and psychomotor disorders, which can make it extremely difficult for the person to leave the house, have an excursion or even go shopping with a carer. The family is one of nature's great masterpieces, so can there be any greater contribution than family members dedicating their life to caring for other family members who need almost day-today, hour-to-hour support for almost everything they do to meet their basic needs? Currently in Queensland a family in this situation receives not 20, not 10 nor five but 3½ hours of respite a week. The purchase of additional respite is $27 an hour, and 50 per cent more expensive on weekends. When this young boy turned 13 he no longer had access to the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, which provided two days a week of assistance at vacation care. Once he had turned 16, the income arrangements changed to where he now receives $400 a fortnight and his mum receives a carer payment of $375 a fortnight. Mum is forced to do extra work where she can and extending the period she can work by 20 hours to 25 is extremely valuable for her. But there is a catch. For her to be able to access and utilise and enjoy 25 hours, we need a state government that will provide adequate respite care. I seek the indulgence of the chamber to at least acquaint ourselves with a report released just last week: Disability support services 2002-03. That report contains a stateby-state comparison. I am cautious about my comments and I must say that the first chapter following the introduction is about the quality of the data, which has been collected only over six months-but it is the best we is a have at the moment. What we have here is a possible reason why in Queensland it is so hard to access respite care and to be able to enjoy 25 hours a week of either study or work. This mum, who cares for her severely disabled son who is unable to leave the house, is perhaps able to work on a special school bus and take her son to school and back and earn $300 a fortnight on top of the allowance, but there is very little option above that for any quality respite that is affordable. This bill makes those improvements from a Commonwealth level but, as this document will show, there is an extremely restricted supply of respite care in Queensland. So to start with that analysis and summarise it, it is obvious that the prevalence of disability will be somewhat homogenous across states, although small variations will exist. If we look at the number of people accessing disability services, there is a considerably lower level in Queensland than in other states. That is partly explainable by the demographics of the state, but you would expect there to be some policy response to that. Let us see if it occurs. When it comes to the number of people accessing respite care as a proportion of the population, the level in Queensland is at least 10 per cent lower than in comparable states-and about half that in Victoria. The number of outlets are down as well, and the number of people accessing each of these outlets for disability services not 6,600 as in New South Wales or 6,100 as in Victoria but a whopping 8,890 people per outlet. Further, for centre based care, which is a direct responsibility of state governments, there are 117 centres in New South Wales, 136 in Victoria and 51 in Queensland. That is clearly not a policy response to the demographics of a large and decentralised state. The number of people in Queensland trying to access each of these centres is not 56,000 or 35,000 as in other states but 72,500 per respite centre. In the social sector there is only one true measure of commitment, and that is in resources. In respite dollars per capita, we see approximately $8.76 per head as the national average. Queensland is once again well below that at $8.20, and a separate analysis performed independently showed that Queensland has the second lowest average of all states. Disability support money from the states is $906 million and $851 million in the larger states but $325 million in Queensland. This is well down, and the support payment per head of population is $136 in one state, $175 in another, $120 or above in every state but Queensland, which has a support payment of $88 per person. So it was doubly barefaced then for the Queensland government to put out a press release in the middle of last year that indicated there was going to be a boost to funding which had not been included in this report. It is important to try to figure those ditional resources in, even though it is cheating a little because we are not looking at what the other states have also committed. Even when you add in the new commitments from the Queensland government, you see that they are still well below the national average for disability and respite funding. The final line of the press release on respite care said: ‘Families are at the forefront of this government's reform agenda for disabilis ity services.' Families at the forefront-isn't that revolutionary policy formulation? Isn't it breathtakingly underwhelming? Commitment can only be measured in dollars, and we have here a reform agenda for the government. Perhaps Queensland should begin its reform agenda by committing as many dollars per head of population and per user as every other state does. It does not seem to be that complex. Queensland families can be forgiven for a touch of despair when it comes to accessing respite care, and I have made that divarication because it underpins why it is so difficult in Queensland to actually be able to benefit from any increase in eligibility for carers payments. It is one thing for a state government to cast itself as the friend of the disabled but quite another to then starve disability services for 2½ election terms and then crow about having crawled back to the national average or only just. The real issue-the bottleneck, the stumbling blockhere is the state's unwillingness to satisfactorily fund respite services. We have a number of families in my electorate who cannot even place their own child in work experience, which obviously is unpaid-in, for example, a pet shop-because they have to pay $30 an hour for the respite carer to accompany their child to work. As one mum said, ‘Our children don't cause us as much stress as the system and trying to get some help.' I have been provided with a bundle of coradrespondence from mums on trying to deal with Disability Services Queensland. While I commend the individual workers within the department, I have here a complete record of the frustrations of one mum trying to find support from her own state department. So it is interesting that Queensland only now is embarking on measures to increase respite funding when the GST revenues are also just beginning to flow. But the memories of families with disabled members will be long in Queensland, even though they only have 3½ hours of respite care in which to contemplate them. Currently, this is a key impediment for Bowman families, preventing them from fully benefiting from the alterations to the carers payments we are speaking of here today. I commend this bill and each of its five parts.",55
159,Mr HATTON,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"Blaxland) (5.35 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker Beazley, as this is the first occasion, to my knowledge, that I have been in the chamber while you have occupied the chair as a member of the Speaker's panel, may I congratulate you on your election to this office. As you have done in other appointments in the House, you will add lustre to the position.",59
160,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,Thank you very much. The view is very good from here.,59
161,Mr HATTON,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"The opposition, led today by the member for Sydney, has indicated it will support each and every one of the measures in the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004, which covers a suite of different election promises that the government is attempting to put in place through this House and the other place. But the member for Sydney has moved an amendment which goes to the core of not just how adequate but how fair and equitable at least one of these changes is. The government has moved to recognise grandparents providing care if they have the full charge and responsibility of a child. It has said that one group of grandparents looking after a child who can get access to approved child care should be given a benefit, so there is a case to be made - and we believe a compelling one-that a group not able to gain access to approved child care, which is then forced to go to a registered child-care place, should also get this benefit. Is there anything in the nature or circumstances of people in the second group that makes them less of a person, carer or grandparent in comparison to people who have been able to get an approved child-care place? We do not believe so. In putting this amendment forward the member for Sydney, as our shadow minister, has rightly argued that if you are going to put in this form of payment you must be fair and make sure that it is available to all grandparents in that position. It should be given to both grandparents and to an approved or a registered child-care place. I support that amendment completely. This is an omnibus bill. It has a range of measures, some of which I will speak to in more detail than others. This range of measures has a context, and well do we know itthere was an election recently. In that recent election in October the government put a series of proposals to the electorate. Indeed, there is an even broader context. Since the budget, which was brought down in the middle of May this year, there has been an even broader fiscal question about how much money is being pumped into this economy through the budget. Originally, I think it was in the order of $37 billion. The mark-up was at least $37 billion of stimulus. If we look at it again it is probably $50 billion worth of stimulus. In just a single day the member for Bennelong-despite his 4.3 per cent buffer in that seat-promised $6 billion worth of benefit to electors from one end of the country to the other, not only in his electorate but in every electorate. The sorts of measures that he was promising in the areas of caring and child-care places were announced for the benefit of people in his electorate, as well as others. What was the grand total? Some people say that it was $50 billion plus $6 billion. In our calculations the all-up total was $66 billion worth of funding in one year. In January and February of 2001 the coalition was in a bit of trouble. From memory, it spent in the order of $21 billion from the budget through to the election period, and it added to that in the election itself. Remarkably, we still have a low-inflation economy, despite the fact that this government has been in power. It tripled the amount of money spent in order to buy its way into office. Introducing a stimulus of $66 billion into the economy in one year has rightly been regarded by most economic commentators in this country as profoundly wrong and dangerous. The great irony in this election was that the government's greatest weaknesses were the ones that helped it get re-elected. Of course, the member for Brand would well know that that irony has not only visited us once. So too, the coalition's greatest weakness in 2001the fact that over 2½ years 13,000 people came illegally into Australia by boatbecame its strength. This is a government of inversions. It takes its great weakness, turns it upside down and campaigns on it very effectively by spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money informing us about its general programs and pushing specific programs. But then it is entirely profligate in its responsibilities to Australia's budget. Again in question time today the Treasurer put out a few warning signals. He has been talking about problems in the economy, about the fact that the housing market has settled down somewhat and about there being a few problems with debts. The greatest problem that the Australian people faced in this election was that they were up against a government that would spend anything, do anything and say anything to get re-elected. The government did not care what it promised to whom and how much it would cost, as long as it got back into power. However worthy these propositions are-and some of them, I would argue, are worthy-the context is that it was about the coalition buying its way back into government at any cost. Properly answered, the great concern that people had about interest rates would have seen this lot thrown off the Treasury bench and back into the oblivion that they deserve. Quite simply, they were utterly irresponsible in their spending this year. From one end of the country to the other-unless they are Liberal Party apparatchik, a member of the government front-bench or one of those people elected on the back of what the Prime Minister and others promised-no-one could argue that there is a shred of responsibility in what it has done. The general context, properly put by commentators Australia wide, identifies that what this government needs to do over the triennium until the next election is to bring the budget back into order. But one of the first pieces of government business is to lay before us a series of issues that have particular point: we have promises of half a billion dollars, $1 billion and $2 billion. I would argue that some are particularly worthy. We are not going to gainsay the fact that this will provide a benefit to ordinary Australian pensioners. It will also provide a benefit directly to self-funded retirees. In both those cases, the benefit is worthy. But it is also necessary because it is this very government that those two groups of people need to be defended against. Why is that so? Why has a government that has been profligate in its spending chosen to target these measures in order to help people. Why is it necessary? Why is that the case? It is because the cost of living for ple on a pension or benefit is not the same as the cost of living for everyone else in the community. The general low-inflation period that we have-courtesy of the HawkeKeating governments and of the major changes that were made through the middle of the 1980s and 1990s-has provided the basis for 14 years' worth of growth. It has also had an impact on self-funded retirees. Retirees who enjoy a higher level of income during a period of high interest rates have less money to survive on during a period of low inflation and low interest rates, particularly those people who provided for themselves. They definitely got a benefit from the Commonwealth, but they made a greater input into their future benefit by going without at the time and there is a case that they should in fact receive some extra recompense. I would agree with that. I spent a long time during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments attempting to convince the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Social Security, Brian Howe, that there was a case to answer with regard to self-funded retirees. I argued that those people who had worked hard all of their lives faced the same cost pressures that people on pensions faced, except that people on pensions had the health care concession cardparticularly at that stage, when the pension rate was $6,500 or $7,000 a year and self-funded retirees who had worked in the education sector, for instance, were on $11,500 or $12,000 a year. That concession card gave them access to a series of state benefits for travel and other things, which meant that their relative cost of living was lower than for those who were on that benefit. I have to confess that I did not succeed with Mr Howe, but I did succeed finally when Graham Richardson came in, because Graham understood two things: he not only peounderstood the merit of the case but he understood the politics of the case as well-that those people who had done it hard and were effectively in straitened circumstances deserved a go-and he made the decision to extend that health care card and those fringe benefits to that small group of people. I am proud of the fact that, working in the Treasurer's electorate office at the time, I pushed that case and I succeeded from that office in bringing that change into place under a Labor government. There are many people that have benefited from it. In this bill the government seeks to extend that benefit by allowing those self-funded retirees an extra concession to get access to some of the things that have been there for pensioners. For the utility concession the bill provides for a utility supplement for senior Australians of aged pension or veteran pension age who currently receive income support. Furthermore, there is a new seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors health card. In the first instance, I played a key part in getting them that concession to start off with, and here we have an expansion of people's capacity to receive what pensioners can access but that those self-funded retirees cannot. In a low-inflation period, the PBS costs have been reduced, but they still face problems with travel and with paying the electricity, gas and other myriad bills and cost pressures that come upon them. So I think this is actually a good measure. There is a problem of the ongoing cost to the Commonwealth of providing these benefits. Whatever the budget figures say now about the cost of these measures being $200 million, $600 million or whatever, the context, of course, is that this inevitably will be small bickies compared to what it is going to be when a quarter of the population is aged-when the boomers, I being one of them, will represent one-quarter of the community. So whatever cost indicators there are will increase almost exponentially. Therefore, supportability and sustainability of these measures is a key ingredient. There is health-care concession for people on pensions and, set beside that because they are on income support, the state governments have for a long time provided a series of measures to assist those people. So the second area where the government have attempted to balance this up is through a specific utility supplement for people on aged pensions so that they will get some assistance with the key things that really hit them now-gas, electricity and so on. That is a good measure as well, but you have to place that into a broader context. They need the assistance because people on pensions and other income supplements are at the end of the scale where the relative amounts of money they spend on utilities and on the everyday necessities of life are proportionately far greater than for people on much higher incomes. The proportionality is significant and it is important. In my electorate of Blaxland, there are a lot of people on income support as aged pensioners, and they have told me time and again just how hard it is to get by since the GST came into effect. Indeed, one of my branch members, Peter Morton from Chester Hill branch, has told me a number of times that his ability to provide for himself-and other people's ability to provide for themselves-is very much hit not just by the GST but by the fact that a government entity that this government now half owns is belting the daylights out of them to the tune of a dollar a day. That government entity, Telstra, which is relatively trammelled because the government still owns half, has increased its line charges to $28 a month. That is a dollar a day for every pensioner in Australia with a phone, which is an absolute necessity for them. Peter says that getting the rental supplement and utilities assistance will be a good thing for him but it is going to be swallowed up anyway-he will be a little bit better off with that but his bigger problem is some assistance with the Telstra bill, and he has properly identified that the government is entirely responsible here. Companies can get a tax deduction on their costs but, of course, individuals cannot. He said that on gas bills-he has told me about this a number of times and it is true-under the heading ‘gas supply' the state government provides a quarterly $16 credit on the bill and this has gone up along with the rental fees. He also makes a point about the one dollar a day for Telstra charges. Where is the utility supplement in relation to Telstra charges? It is not there. Line rental fees are compounded by the GST, so you have not only got the one dollar a day, there is an extra 10c on top that is going directly into federal government coffers. Of course, they argue that they are only collecting it for the states. Mr Deputy Speaker Beazley, as you know, this is a Commonwealth government tax, just like all other Commonwealth government taxes, imposed on people so they pay a double whammy, because 51 cents of that dollar go directly to the Commonwealth government. With respect to increases in charges for utilities, affecting aged pensioners Australia wide, the government says in this bill, ‘We'll help you pay the gas and we'll help you pay the electricity'-they are private entities or part state-owned entities-‘and we'll pocket the full amount of money that we can in Telstra line charges and we'll charge you the GST on top of it.' I think Peter is right: this is fee outrageous. They actually need another supplement to the bill to fix it up. There is a $100-a-year utility supplement. Peter Morton says that that would be welcomed, but it does not even cover the cost of the Telstra line rentals, let alone the electricity or gas. should be research done or an inquiry carried out on the impact of these hidden costs. But the government of course would rather that these costs were kept hidden. They do not really want to deal with the fundamental constraints on people on income support. Peter also asked how the utility providers justify those costs and why it costs Telstra $1 a day to keep a phone line connected. I think I can tell him that it does not cost Telstra $1 a day to keep a phone line connected. This is a $1 tax on every Australian pensioner and every person using a phone Australia wide. When the member for Melbourne was the shadow minister, we in the opposition rightly argued that these exorbitant increases in charges were reprehensible to the nth degree. There is no margin for people on fixed incomes to handle a big increase-unless it drops, as almost manna from heaven, from this government from time to time just before an election. There is $66 billion in funding this year. What does the government spend in the off-years? If you go back a year or so, you find it is about $4 billion. There a big difference proportionally. But we all know it is about the member for Bennelong and his cohorts buying an election. Peter Morton and all of my constituentsthe people who do it tough at the end of the line where you are dependent on some government largesse and these extra little bits to make your life more liveable-deserve to have a utility supplement that covers not only what the government are promising in this bill but also the real costs imposed in relation to Telstra. So, while I welcome the general provisions of this bill, I understandas everyone else in the opposition does-that this is a way for the government to buy favour. There are significant questions about the sustainability of these provisions into the future and there are significant problems that will arise due to their picking and choosing There which grandparents will get help and which grandparents will not. So we will support the provisions but we make the argument that this is about buying your way into office and it is ultimately unsustainable.",59
162,Dr EMERSON,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"Rankin) (5.55 p.m.)Labor supports this legislation on the basis that it will go some way towards easing the financial pressure on pensioners and self-funded retirees. However, I want to take this opportunity to express concerns, which have already been expressed by the member for Blaxland, about the sustainability of the government's spending program. I will go through a number of the provisions of the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004. The utility supplement is welcomed. It is not a lot of money. It is $100 a year for singles and $50 for each member of a couple. It is designed to assist our senior Australians to pay their regular household bills from the utilities whose services they use. The self-funded retiree payment is a new is seniors' concession that allows $200 per annum for self-funded retirees who are eligible for a Commonwealth seniors health card. We of course support that provision. There is a change to the carer's payment. This is by way of increasing the number of hours that carers may spend in work, training or study without losing their qualification for a carer payment. We certainly support that. The maximum length of time that a carer may temporarily cease providing care in order to take training, education and voluntary or paid work and still retain their qualification for the carer payment is currently 20 hours per week. Under this legislation, that will be increased to 25 hours per week. In addition, there are new benefits relating to child care. Grandparents who have primary care of a grandchild or grandchildren and who are receiving income support will be entitled to a special rate of child-care benefit. That will cover the full cost of care fees charged to eligible grandparents by approved child-care services. We have some genuine concerns with this provision, and that is why the member for Sydney has moved a second reading amendment. The amendment criticises the government for not adequately supporting grandparent carers. In particular, under this legislation there is no support for grandparents who cannot find a place for grandchildren in approved care and who are thus forced to use registered care. They are given no special assistance to meet the cost of registered care. We are bewildered as to why that distinction would be made. It means that a large number of grandparents who are carers miss out on this particular benefit. There are desirable changes in relation to veterans' entitlements. The bill extends bereavement payments to widows of TPI veterans and ex-servicemen. Of course, we greatly appreciate the contribution of ex-servicemen, who have made big sacrifices to keep our country free. We think this is also a reasonable measure. The cumulative impact of these measures is $972 million over four years. That is an affordable set of initiatives. But it is an cation of funding that is on top of a very large additional spending program from this government. In fact, it is a massive spending program. If we count the budget initiatives and all of the initiatives that have been taken since the May budget-that is, right up to and including the election campaign-the total amount of extra spending over four years is a staggering $61 billion. Not only is that a huge amount of money, but I have been able to make an assessment of how much of that $61 billion is consumption spending and how much is investment spending. Disturbingly, the answer is that only $5 billion of that $61 billion is, in fact, child- investment spending-and here I am being rather generous, because that includes Customs posts in Beijing and Jakarta. Of course that will do some good, but the direct economic stimulus from those Customs posts will be felt in Beijing and Jakarta, and not in Australia. I know it is a small point, but I thought it was worth making. The big point and the big story here is that, in order to be re-elected, this government has over the last few months committed Australian taxpayers to $61 billion of extra spending, of which only $5 billion is investment spending. The problem we have in this country is that there is a spending spree, a consumption binge, which can have only dire consequences for the Australian economy. Since this government came to office in 1996, it has deliberately addicted Australians to debt. We are now in a situation where households have negative savings-they are dissaving-and they are continuing on a consumption binge. Yet they are struggling to make ends meet in that, instead of saving for this consumption, they are more and more putting it on the credit card and taking out larger and larger mortgages. The total impact is that just as Australians are strugallogling to make ends meet so is Australia. That has shown up in a current account deficit of 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, that is a current account deficit of a similar order of magnitude to, or even larger than, the current account deficit of the mid-1980s which prompted your predecessor, Mr Keating, to warn of the prospect of Australia becoming a banana republic. The Hawke and Keating governments put in place a comprehensive reform program designed to ensure that we are never again in that situation. It was a problem which the Hawke and Keating governments inherited and understood, and they responded by putting in place that comprehensive reform program. As a result of that program, we should have been able to look forward and say, ‘We will never be so vulnerable again'-and yet we are. We are very vulnerable to any external shocks and to an economic slowdown because this government has addicted Australians to debt. That debt is showing up in our foreign debt. When the government said they would cut foreign debt-when it rolled out the debt truck, and when the debt truck was circling around Australia-the Prime Minister, then opposition leader, said he would follow policies which would over time reduce foreign debt. Instead of reducing foreign debt, they have more than doubled foreign debt. Using the Treasurer's favoured measure of the debt per person in Australia which he used when he was shadow Treasurer-our foreign debt is now $20,000 per man, woman and child in this country. It was in the order of $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country when the then opposition leader, and now Prime Minister, promised that an incoming Howard government would follow policies which would bring down the foreign debt. Instead the government has doubled foreign debt, and it has addicted the Australian people to debt. The short-term economic consequences are already starting to appear. Figures released just today and yesterday are already showing evidence of a substantial economic slowdown as people realise how vulnerable they are, how overburdened with debt they are. House prices have started to fall. There is evidence that retail sales are now starting to fall and that there is an economic slowdown. This is an economic slowdown I talked about in my address-in-reply speech just three or four days ago. I did not realise that within three or four days evidence would already be coming in pointing to the high likelihood of such an economic slowdown. We can only hope that it will be a soft landing and not a hard landing. We can only hope that consumers will realise how overextended they are and gradually withdraw their consumption spending so that we land softly. If they do not, and if they were to continue consuming at the sorts of rates at which they have been consuming, then ultimately the inflationary consequences of that would mean that the Reserve Bank would have to intervene. So let us hope it is a soft landing, and not a hard landing as a result of Reserve Bank intervention, as inflation moves out of the target range of the Reserve Bank. That is the short-term economic problem confronting Australia, but what of the long term economic problem? Mr Deputy Speaker, as member for Blaxland, you also alluded to the problems of the ageing of the population and the sustainability of the sorts of measures that were announced here today. We know that the $900 million associated with these measures will not, of itself, break the bank, but this government is going to have to start thinking seriously about investing in the nation's future instead of continuing to promote a consumption boom. The government has committed $61 billion of new spending over the four years from the May budget, and all but $5 billion of it is consumption spending. The measures in this legislation are directly targeted at an ageing population; they are targeted at pensioners and self-funded retirees. But I have to ask the question that is opened up by this debate: who is going to pay for the ageing population in the generations to come? The truth of the matter is that fewer and fewer babies are being born in Australia as the fertility rate collapses. In 1961, at the peak of the baby boom, Australian couples had almost four children, on average, and now it is down to less than two-1.7 children, to be precise. The Intergenerational Report, which the Treasury produced two years ago-as confirmed by a Productivity Commission report on the ageing of the population which was released just last week-forecasts that the figure of 1.7 children will continue to fall around 1.65 children. The fertility rate will continue to fall, and that means fewer and fewer children will be born. But those four babies per family who were born at the peak of the baby boom are ageing. They are now already in their 40s and 50s and over the projection period of the ergenerational Report-the next 40 yearsthose same baby boomers will be flooding into our hospitals and into our nursing homes. That is why the Treasurer has finally realised there is a problem with health spending in Australia. Marvellous technologies will keep those Australians alive longer. And that is what we want; that is a reflection of the progress we have made and of the improvement in living standards in this country. We want people to be able to stay alive longer and to be healthier. But declining mortality rates combined with collapsing fertility rates mean that there will be such ageing of the population that there will be four million extra Australians over the age of 65 four decades from now. How many more young people will there be? The answer is a very worrying one. There will be fewer young people. There will not be more people under the age of 15; there will be fewer people under the age of 15 four decades from now than there are in Australia today. We will have indeed around 250,000-we cannot be precise about these things-fewer children in 40 years time. What does that all mean for health care costs? The Productivity Commission estimates that health and aged care costs will take $13 of every $100 earned in Australia that is government spending on health and aged care costs. That will be almost a doubling of present costs. Should we be panicked about the ageing of the population? No, it is not a crisis but it certainly is a challenge. Sadly, the government only realised two years ago, after the to preparation-I doubt that the government commissioned it-of the Intergenerational Report by the Treasury, that the ageing of the population was a problem. The problem, or challenge, is best solved by reference to the three Ps: population, participation and productivity. With the first, population, the die is Int- already cast-as I have already explained. The ageing of the population over the next 40 years is a consequence of decisions taken by parents over the last 40 years. So the ageing of the population is inevitable. There is nothing that we can do about the ageing of the population. I will even invoke the phrase used by the Treasurer. He said, ‘Demography is destiny'. He is right about that. Occasionally he gets something right and on this occasion he is right. The die is cast. The ageing of the population is a reality and we are not going to be able to prevent it. So how can we meet the challenge of the an ageing of the population? We do it through the other two Ps. The second P is participation. Some good things can be done here. An increasingly skilled female work force will come into existence over the 40-year time frame covered by the Intergenerational Report and the Productivity Commission report. As those highly skilled women come into the work force in increasing numbersand as they come to represent the norm rather than the exception, as perhaps was the case 40 years ago when educational outcomes were not quite as good as they are now-that will increase participation by working age women in the work force. That is a good thing. We should be encouraging that by encouraging family friendly provisions in and beyond the industrial relations system. Labor is the only party that is prepared to use the industrial relations system to encourage the provision of family friendly arrangements in agreements. So we can improve participation, and it will happen for working age women. But the Treasurer has put almost all his eggs in one basket: improving the participation of older Australians. This is the work till you drop scheme. The Productivity Commission report that was released this week is a fascinating read on this matter. It is an indictment on the Treasurer. The Productivity Commission in fact did various sensitivity analyses in terms of changing the participation rate of older Australians. It came to the conclusion that changing the participation rate of older Australians in the work force can have at best negligible impacts on income growth in this country. So the very basket in which the Treasurer has put almost all his eggs is a dud basket. We cannot get there simply by requiring older Australians to work till they drop. That second P, participation of older Australians, will make very little difference. It will do very little in terms of responding effectively to the challenge of the ageing of the population. So that leaves us with the third P. The third P is productivity growth. That is the key. As Labor has long recognised, today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. That is why Labor put in place that comprehensive and coherent economic reform program of the 1980s and early 1990s. It was designed to lift productivity growth by creating the open competitive economy. And Labor achieved that. The results have been astonishing. Australian productivity growth since around 1993 has outpaced that of just about every country in the world except Finland and Ireland. It certainly has outstripped that of the United States. But, having opened the door and created the open competitive economy, we cannot open that same door again. Therefore, it is incumbent on this generation of Australians, who are benefiting from the prosperity gained from the yield of the economic reforms of the 1980s and early 1990s, to identify and invest in the new sources of productivity growth in this country. And we know what they are; it is not a secret. The new sources of productivity growth in Australia are investment in skills, investment in new ideas and investment in infrastructure. On all three grounds the government fails miserably. The Productivity Commission and the OECD have both concluded that in the 1990s skills formation actually detracted from productivity growth in Australia. We have underinvested in skills. We have certainly underinvested in new ideas: business spending on research and development as a share of gross domestic product has been falling since the change of government. It has picked up a bit just in the last couple of years but the gap between Australia and the OECD continues to widen. And we are underinvesting in infrastructure. When the Governor General outlined the forward program for this government, there was no coherent economic reform program designed to secure ongoing productivity growth in this country to combat the ageing of the population. While I welcome this legislation, the fact is that the government has failed appallingly to recognise the problem and to meet the challenges of Australia's ageing population.",63
163,Ms LEY,FAMILY AND COMMUNITY,"During the 2004 election campaign, this government pledged extra assistance to certain important groups in the Australian community. This extra assistance is aimed at self-funded retirees, older Australians, carers on income support, grandparents caring for children and certain disability pensioners. The Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004 gives effect to the government's commitments. Firstly, all holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card will benefit from a new payment of $200 a year-the seniors concession allowance. The new payment recognises the fact that most self-funded retirees do not receive concessions for energy rates, water and sewerage, and motor vehicle registration from state and territory governments. It also acknowledges the community contribution made by this group of people in providing for their own retirement. The payment will be split into two payments-one in December and one in June each year-to people who are eligible cardholders on 1 December and 1 June respectively. It will be indexed twice yearly, will be exempt from income tax and will remain payable during temporary absences from Australia of up to 13 weeks. In a further measure, the bill provides for senior Australians of age pension age or veteran pension age on income support to attract a new payment known as the utilities allowance. The payment will help these people to pay regular household bills such as gas and electricity. The new payment will generally be $100 a year for singles and $50 a year for each member of a couple. It will be paid twice each year following the pension indexation adjustments on 20 March and 20 September. Again, it will be indexed twice yearly, will not attract income tax and will still be paid if the person is temporarily absent from Australia for up to 13 weeks. These two significant new payments will help ease the financial demands on over two million older members of our community. This bill will establish additional support for an important group of people in our community-those providing care for an adult or a child with a disability. These carers will now be able to spend 25 rather than 20 hours a week in work, training or study without losing qualification for carer payment. This greater flexibility will improve carers' work force opportunities and allow more of a break from caring without affecting their carer payment eligibility. Grandparents with the primary care of their grandchildren fall into a further group who will benefit from the extra assistance provided by this bill. This particular measure is in addition to the waiver of the work, training and study test for child-care benefit already implemented by the government which allows eligible grandparents access to child-care benefit for up to 50 hours of approved child care a week. This bill will now make child care more affordable for grandparent carers on income support, such as age pension or carer payment, by enabling them to have access to a special rate of child-care benefit. This special rate will cover the full cost of child-care fees charged to eligible grandparents by approved child-care services. Finally, the bill will provide for increased bereavement payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 in respect of disability pensioners who are receiving above the general rate of disability pension. Previously, the bereavement payment had been limited to 100 per cent of the general rate. I thank all those on our side and on the other side who contributed to the debate today, and I again commend the bill to the House.

165,Ms GILLARD,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"At the outset I had better clarify some pervasive confusion about the Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. It is not like me to correct the clerks, because they are always correcting me, but it is not a 1,000 per cent Medicare rebate-as the clerk just read; it is 100 per cent. A 1,000 per cent Medicare rebate would be a lot more expensive than $1.7 billion, and I am not sure that the Howard government would stump up for that times 10. If the clerk is a little anxious about having misread the bill title, he should feel in good company because the Minister for Health and Ageing, when he spoke in the second reading debate on the last sitting Thursday, consistently referred to the bill as ‘the 90 cent Medicare rebate bill'. It is very clearly audible on the tape; I would recommend it as required viewing to anybody in this parliament who is interested in Medicare issues. Of course, by the time we had the Hansard, it was corrected so the right figure-100 per cent-was written, but it does give you the occasional moment of concern that the minister for health seems to so fundamentally misunderstand the basis of a $1.7 billion measure that he is putting before the parliament. In truth the measure is for a 100 per cent Medicare rebate for unreferred GP services. As members who were in this parliament prior to the last election might recall-and I am sure those who were contesting seats for election into this parliament would also recall-the health debate last term was about the Howard government's neglect of our health system. We saw bulk-billing rates plummet under the Howard government, we saw out-of-pocket costs to see the doctor soar and we saw that result in a national figure of six million fewer consultations in the Australian community with GPs. That is six million times Australians looked in their purses or wallets and decided they could not afford to see a GP under the policies of the Howard government. We on this side of the House feared that many of the times that people postponed getting medical care from their GP they were putting off preventative health checks-the sort of thing they think they will get done the next month or the month after when they have a bit more money but, because of the financial barrier, they end up never getting done-or they were turning up looking for free care in emergency departments of public hospitals, putting them under more stress and strain. Through its policies the Howard govper ernment was developing a crisis in the affordability of access to general practitioners. Bulk-billing rates were tumbling nationally, in some communities by as much as 30 per cent, and the out-of-pocket costs of seeing the doctor were almost doubling on the Howard government's watch. It was not a health policy issue that finally caused the Howard government to act. Having never been a supporter of Medicare, it was quite content to turn a blind eye as Medicare slowly withered under it. What startled the government into some form of action was public opinion polling which showed that the government's key weakness was in health. That was the only thing that caused the Howard government to react and to deal with bulk-billing issues and the outof-pocket costs of seeing a general practitioner. You have to give them marks for persistence, because they have had a few goes at it-there is no doubt about that. The first package was A Fairer Medicare, under the then minister for health, Senator Kay Patterson. A Fairer Medicare was really about creating, despite its name, a two-tiered Medicare-a means tested Medicare-where bulk-billing would forever have been confined to people with concession cards and everybody else would have paid to see the doctor. Like many of the Howard government's health policies it was inherently inflationary in terms of medical expenses. As tory will record, A Fairer Medicare hit the fence. It was laughed out of court by the health professionals, including the doctors, as an absurd suite of policies. Ultimately government backed away from it, and it achieved that in part by changing the minister to the current minister for health. As I have had cause to remark in the past, we on this side of the House were breathlessly awaiting a second package, which was to be called ‘Even Fairer Medicare', but perhaps the Howard government realised the absurdity of that title, because they decided to move on to MedicarePlus. We saw the MedicarePlus package announced by the minister for health. Then MedicarePlus morphed into ‘Strengthening Medicare'. By then they were on go No. 3 of trying to fix their perceived political weakness in the area of health. Of course, none of this has been about health policy; it has been cal fixes. ‘Strengthening Medicare' came with a television campaign which assaulted the screens of Australian viewers courtesy of the expenditure of more than $20 million of Australian taxpayers' money. There was a mailout of a glossy booklet to every household in Australia and a travelling roadshow-which had quite an amazing capacity to turn up in marginal seats-going through shopping centres. The main thing the Howard government was interested in was having a program on which it could found an advertising campaign. We will recall the media coverage at the time which had people whose job it was to buy advertising space on Australian TV for commercial entities-the people who buy advertising for Coca-Cola, Toyota, Coles and some of the biggest spenders on our TV screens-shaking their heads and saying that the spend that the Howard government enhis- gaged in for ‘Strengthening Medicare' was beyond saturation advertising and had gone to the diminishing returns part of the curve. Apparently there is a science about advertisthe ing which says, ‘If you ramp up and spend this much you will get the strongest public reaction, and if you spend over that amount you will get diminishing returns for your spend.' The Howard government was so flush with taxpayers' funds, funds out of my pocket and the pocket of every other Australian, that it kept spending beyond saturation. So visible were these as that I think many of us in the House would recall them being the subject of a very funny parody on the television show The Panel. These as really did become a kind of feature of the public landscape for a while as the government spent and spent taxpayers' money to try and convince Australians in the run-up to the election that they had done something effecabout polititive about health. Against that background-three goes at trying to address bulk-billing and out-ofpocket costs and more than $20 million of taxpayers' funds spent on government advertising-we were bemused that the government thought that it needed to announce another Medicare measure during the election campaign, and so it decided to announce this measure, which is referred to as the 100 per cent Medicare measure. Once again, this has all the hallmarks of political fix about it. If 100 per cent Medicare was a good idea, one wonders why it was not in the budget papers with A Fairer Medicare, way back when, under Senator Patterson. If 100 per cent Medicare was a good idea, why didn't Minister Abbott announce it at the time that he announced MedicarePlus? If 100 per cent Medicare was a good idea, why didn't the government announce it and then advertise it as part of ‘Strengthening Medicare'? The government did not think it was a good idea back then. The government was just feeding out health measures, complete with advertising, and watching the polls. It was nothing to do with health policy and all about the differential between the Labor Party and the coalition on the question of who would be best to handle health. The government watched those polls right up to the commencement of the campaign and said, ‘We've got to tip out another bucket of money. It doesn't matter what it goes on; we've just got to tip out another bucket of money. We've got to have a health story, create a health story, get a get a policy announcement'-and out came 100 per cent Medicare, which is in the bill that we are dealing with now. I think it is interesting that the Minister for Health and Ageing cannot remember the title of the bill and mistakes its intent by calling it ‘90 per cent Medicare'. Let us be clear about what this package does. It increases the Medicare rebate for what are referred to as ‘unreferred GP services' from 85 per cent of the schedule fee to 100 per cent of the schedule fee. Of course, there is a whole lot of technical detail about what an unreferred GP service is. Most interactions that a member of the public would have with a GP fall into that category; certainly all the standard consultations do, and the Medicare rebate for those is to be increased from 85 per cent to 100 per cent. That will mean an additional rebate of $4.60 for a standard 15-minute GP consultation. Across all GP services, the average additional rebate is $5. We know that the current average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk-bill is $15.24. If-and I will come back to that very important word ‘if'the GP hands on all of the additional rebate to the patient, the average out-of-pocket cost will be around $10. That is if it is handed on. It really is a fairly simple proposition. government is going to pay an increased Medicare rebate for most GP services. The fact that it is such a simple proposition actually means that it is a devastatingly flawed proposition. This package increases the Medicare rebate for unreferred GP services to 100 per cent of the schedule fee without putting any conditions on it. There is nothing in this legislation to increase bulk-billing or to sustain bulk-billing rates over time. There is nothing in this legislation to ensure that out-of-pocket costs for patients are minimised over time. They have just added the money in. Faced with adding the money in, yarn, what can a GP do? Apart from the minister for health's error in his speech about a 90 per cent Medicare rebate, the minister made it very clear that after this legislation comes into operation the doctor will work it out. So the government is going to pay an increased Medicare rebate and, to use the words of the minister for health, ‘decisions about bulkbilling will be up to individual doctors'. That is what he has said. A doctor who is faced with this new government policy has a set of choices. A doctor could say, ‘I'll bulk-bill and get the 100 per cent Medicare rebate plus the bulk-billing incentives that came through the other Howard government health packages.' Or a doctor could say, ‘I won't bulk-bill but I will pass the increased Medicare rebate on to patients,' which will reduce the patient's outof-pocket costs by $4.60 for a standard consultation. Or a doctor could say, ‘I'll pass on some of the increased Medicare rebate to the patient and moderate my out-of-pocket costs by $2 or $3.' So, effectively, when the transaction is completed, the patient has got some of the additional Medicare rebate with reduced out-of-pocket costs, and the doctor has got some of the increased Medicare rebate. Or a doctor could say, ‘I'm just going to keep my out-of-pocket costs as they are now. The If I factor those as being $15, $20 or $25, I will keep it at $15, $20 or $25 on top of the new Medicare rebate, whereupon I am basically earning the extra money.' Of course the Medicare rebate is the patient's. We understand that. It flows directly to the doctor when the doctor bulk-bills. It goes to the patient in other circumstances when the patient goes to claim their Medicare rebate, having paid the doctor the total fee. The circumstances I am describing are what will be the effective result at the end of the day when those transactions are completed. So the doctor might bulk-bill, or the doctor might change charges so that your out-of-pocket costs come down, or the doctor might change charges so that your out-ofpocket costs come down but not by the full amount of the new Medicare rebate, or the doctor might keep your out-of-pocket costs where they are now and effectively take the new Medicare rebate. There is nothing in this legislation which affects a doctor's decision about that. The doctor will make his or her own decision. Against that background, is it going to increase bulk-billing? The minister for health says there should be more bulk-billing, because bulk-billing doctors will secure higher rebates. In the meantime, the AMA is urging members not to let this increased rebate take them back to ‘the treadmill of bulk-billing'. The President of Australian Medical Association, Dr Bill Glasson, has said that this is beginning of the end of bulk-billing. There is nothing in this package that requires a doctor to bulk-bill and there are no conditions attached or tied into this package in any way. In view of what is being said by the AMA-and presumably it is saying that being informed by the attitudes of its members, the GPs on the ground-I think we can say that this measure is not going to do anything for bulk-billing rates. Bulk-billing rates will not be sustained by this measure. It is not going to make a difference to bulk-billing. There is no condition in the package that will make a difference to bulk-billing. What is going to happen with those doctors who do not bulk-bill? We know that in a number of communities all around the country finding a bulk-billing doctor is about as rare as seeing a blue moon or a pig flying; it is impossible for people to find a bulk-billing doctor, particularly people who do not have concession cards, even though they might be very low income earners with onerous family responsibilities. We know that all around Australia finding a bulk-billing doctor can be very, very difficult; many communities have faced falls of 30 per cent in bulk-billing. As a result of this bill, this new government proposal, what will happen to the out-of-pocket expense of the people in those communities who now pay to see the doctor? The only lead we really have on that is that the Minister for Health and Ageing seems to be figuring all of his work on the basis that the doctor and the patient will split the new increased rebate. Let us just go through the figures on that. We should note, I think, that the Department of Health and Ageing has confirmed to the opposition in briefings that it has not modelled the effect of this package on GP incomes. The department has chosen not to make any assumption on what percentage of the the rebate increase GPs will absorb into income and what they will pass on to patients. I suspect that the failure to get any modelling might arise from the fact that the government had not cooked up its 100 per cent Medicare rebate until we were in the campaign environment and could not draw down on departmental resources. The second theory is that it is classic Howard government-never ask a question that you do not want the answer to-because it might have been very worried about what that modelling was going to show: what was going to go into GP incomes and not into patients' hands. But, without any modelling, the minister for health-presumably assisted by a crystal ball which he rubs and in which he watches the clouds clear and then he makes an assumption about what is going to happen next-has made an assumption. We know that the average GP sees about 7,000 patients per annum. So the simple maths would tell you that, if the average GP were going to keep the full rebate increase, their income growth would be around $35,000 per annum. Minister Abbott, assisted by the crystal ball into which he has gazed, has decided that the answer to this is that GP income will increase by about $20,000 per annum. The minister's assertion that GPs are going to increase their incomes by about $20,000 per annum means basically that he is expecting doctors to keep around $3 of the increased rebate, and have that feed into income, and pass on about $2 in reduced out-of-pocket costs to patients. So even though the minister was in here saying in his second reading speech, ‘Let me stress that all patients will benefit from this measure,' the absolute high point he would put that at, even on his own crystal ball gazing, is that the average patient might see a $2 reduction in their out-of-pocket expense. That is not much of a result for having spent $1.7 billion. We do not even know if the minister is right, and it is well and truly possible that is wrong and patients will see even less than that. That would only be an assumption about the first effect, because the world does not stand still; health does not stand still. Over the medium term, doctors will make decisions about where they are going to put their fee level. Over the medium term, we would expect those fees to rise; historically they always have. In those circumstances, even the minister's predicted $2 gain for patients may well not be sustained. That brings me to the question of the sustainability of this package over time. We asked the Department of Health and Ageing to supply to us how it arrived at the annual cost of this measure. It is a $1.7 billion package with costs over the half-year, starting from 1 January next year, and then the remainder of the out years, and there are various figures at the bottom of those tables. We have asked the department, ‘How did you generate those figures? What is the indexation arrangement? What assumption are you making about the number of times Australians will visit a GP?'-things you would think you needed to do to come up with a robust figure in a budget bottom line for the forward estimates. But the department has indicated to us that the figures are indexed by the current WCI5 indexation rate, which is commonly used in health-it is a wage indexation rate-of around two per cent a year. If it is indexed at two per cent a yearand we know that health inflation runs at a greater rate than that it means that, even if the minister for health is right and even if patients on 1 January are going to see a $2 reduction in their out-of-pocket expense, that by definition is not going to be sustained over time because the increase in GP costs will in real terms exceed the indexed 100 per cent Medicare rebate. So this is all an illusion that may last for a little time. But 12 months, two years or three years away we he will be seeing once again patient out-ofpocket costs increasing-and let us remember that they have almost doubled under the Howard government so far. Just to prove the proposition that medical fees keep rising, the AMA has announced their annual recommended fee schedule and it is indexed at 3.41 per cent. So already we have the AMA recommending an indexation rate which is higher than the indexation in this package. A survey conducted in the November GP Journal found that 52 per cent of GPs were planning to increase their fees, with more than 80 per cent of GPs now surveyed now charging a standard fee in excess of $40. So the news over the medium to longer term is not happy when it comes to 100 per cent Medicare. The very small changes it will make to patient out-ofpockets in the short-term will not be sustained over time. There is another very interesting thing in the government's figures when you look at them. The first thing that struck me when I looked at the figures was the first full year the figures. There is obviously a half year because of the 1 January start, but the first full year of the figures actually has in it a higher number than the final out year. You have to say to yourself: why is that? Why is the cost of the measure apparently going down over time? How is that possible? When we asked the department that, we got back from it the indication about the indexation rate, but that cannot explain the figure going down if it is indexed. I tell you what explains the figure going down: it is that the government has assumed there will be fewer GP visits over time. It is impossible for the government's figures to add up any other way unless we are going to see fewer GP services provided over time. Is that a rational assumption by the Howard government, even in the face of population growth? Perhaps it is a rational assumption, because the Howard government's policies to date have driven fewer GP consultations over time because they have created the crisis in affordability and access. So it probably is rational for the Howard government to assume that this flawed policy is not going to make a difference to that, that the crisis of affordability in access, the continued declines in the availability of bulk-billingparticularly in some communities-and the increasing out-of-pocket costs will be sustained over time, that fewer and fewer people will go to the doctor, and that more and more people will go without care or will go to the emergency departments of public hospitals looking for care and causing unnecessary costs and cost-shifting in our health system. The figures in this assume that result, so we know that the Howard government believes from these figures that people will go to the GP less. When we have put this contention to the minister and the department we have had put to us some impenetrable mumbo jumbo of about there being an increasing number of long consultations. It might be right that there are increasing numbers of long consultations, but unless you are putting the proposition that one long consultation is a substitute for five, six, seven or eight standard consultations it still does not add up that the figures are going down over time. Longer consultations are more expensive than short consultations, so increasing numbers of long consultations should have the figures going up over time, not down. It also does not explain GPs reacting to the price signal that is in the government's bulk-billing incentivean incentive that is a flat dollar fee which is worth more to you if you add it on to a short consultation rather than a long consultation. The government has actually sent GPs a price signal that it prefers short consultations, so the government's spin about that does not stand up to anything that looks like rigorous scrutiny. That is where we find ourselves. The fourth political fix of the Howard government in the area of bulk-billing and out-ofpocket costs is yet again a failed political fix, and I would not be surprised if over the next three years we are back here several times. Having had A Fairer Medicare, Strengthening Medicare, MedicarePlus and 100 per cent Medicare, I am not sure what the government's ad agencies are going to come up with next, but we will have two or three more Medicare packages before we get to the next election because it will not have fixed the problem. You cannot fix the problem by spending $1.7 billion without attaching any conditions to it in respect of bulk-billing or moderating out-of-pocket costs. The Howard government will not fix the problem through this package. We obviously understand that the government put this policy before the Australian people in the election campaign. It has a 1 January start date. Whilst on the minister's own estimates the best it will ple an additional $2 in the short term as a decreased out-of-pocket cost, it is not our intention to stand between the Australian people and that additional $2, should they get it-and obviously many of them will not get any of it-so we have facilitated the government's arrangements to expedite the consideration of this bill. Whilst I will being an amendment in the House shortly, it is not our intention to delay passage of this bill either here or in the Senate, so the government can meet the 1 January implementation date. Then we will be holding the government accountable as to whether this $1.7 billion has been properly spent. The bill does have two other measures in it. There was an anomaly in the original design of the Howard government's so-called safety net. As we recall, the safety net has two different thresholds. There is a different threshold for families that are eligible for family tax benefit A. People get paid that family tax benefit in different ways. We know that some people get it fortnightly, therefore their entitlement to the lower safety net threshold is apparent. Some people get it paid as a lump sum at the end of the year through the tax system. They choose not to take it fortnightly, presumably because of the high degree of sensitivity about overpayments-and we can well understand that high degree of sensitivity. These families actually file a deferral with Centrelink and then get their benefit as a lump sum at the end of the financial year, but the safety net arrangements as they currently stand do not make it clear that those families trigger the lower threshold. That anomaly will be corrected. Then, of course, there will be a change to veterans' Medicare rebates to maintain the relativity between veterans' Medicare rebates and the Medicare rebates paid to other Australians. That is consequential on the rest of this bill and is dealt with in do is give peo- the bill itself. Our concern is not about fixing the safety net anomaly-and we will have things to say about the safety net on another occasion-or about maintaining the relativity on Medicare rebates for veterans and veterans gold card holders. Our concern is about the essence of this package and that, in a world where it is mov- hard to find extra dollars for health and where there are always pressures on the health system, this is a deeply flawed policy which will spend $1.7 billion on the Medicare component alone but will not fix the problems that are causing people major difficulties in getting access to GP care. With that, I move the following amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this Parliament condemns the government for: (1) doing nothing while out of pocket costs to see a general practitioner have soared from a little over $8 to a national average of $15.37 and failing to attach conditions to 100% Medicare aimed at reducing out of pocket costs; (2) causing bulk billing rates to fall from 80% under Labor to a little over 70% and failing to attach conditions to 100% Medicare aimed at bolstering bulk billing rates; (3) failing to ensure that any of the $1.7 billion spent will be passed on to patients; and (4) continuing its undermining of Medicare as Australia's universal public health surance system”.",69
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Roxon-I second the amendment.,77
167,Mr TUCKEY,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (7.08 p.m.)To respond to the member for Lalor's speech, I think she is operating under a number of flawed assumptions. The first is that general practitioners are grasping, greedy individuals and that the reason they might raise their fees has something to do with an increasing cost base. As a former plaintiff lawyer-an ambulance chaser-she would be a contributor to this, because it is well known in this place that one of those substantial cost increases in the conduct of a general practice is the massive increase in professional indemnity insurance fees. These fees have been brought about by the actions of plaintiff lawyers by suing general practitioners for just about anything that can happen, and over periods of up to 24 years. Somebody practising in the legal profession should understand-and it was understood by the designers of Medicare during a period when I was present in this Housepart V, section 51(xxiiiA) of the Australian Constitution, which, in simple terms, prevents a form of civil conscription of medical practitioners. The member for Lalor said in her speech that there was nothing in the Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 to virtually force doctors to comply with bulk-billing. No-one knows better than she does that that would be unconstitutional and that no government has had the power to dictate what general practitioners charge. She suggests that there could be an increase in fees that general practitioners charge, for whatever good reason-and I underline the words ‘good reason'-when the outcome of this legislation is that the paintient will be $4.60 better off or, to use her other example, $1.7 billion better off over four years, because that is the additional money that this government is providing to rebate to patients. It is a patient rebate. If medical practitioners who do not bulk-bill increase their fees, then the patient is still better off by $4.60. To suggest that there is some relationship between that and what the government provides is patently false and typical of the member for Lalor. The first thing we have to understand is that whenever bulk-billing was introduced in its various forms it was always a voluntary scheme. The member for Lalor cries crocodile tears and talks about people in country areas-of which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, would know something. The only people who ever made a real profit out of bulkbilling, and then went on to buy football teams and things of that nature, were doctors who were in a position to practise in areas of high-density population and who set themselves up in practices where they had all sorts of associated services, such as pathology, x-rays and you name it. That was very profitable for a period. The member for Lalor asked us to consider history prior to the last election. I would like her to consider back into the early 1980s, when this form of Medicare was created by Minister Blewett and the Hawke government. I would like her to remember that, during that period, they discovered the tiger they had by the tail and set about to reduce the incidence of bulk-billing. One of those policies eventually introduced by the Keating government was a media campaign that we had too many doctors and they were all rushing into the metropolitan areas to bulk-bill and buy football teams. There was a policy decision made, which is a matter of public record, to reduce the intake of medical graduates by 4,500 about 10 years ago-and, surprise surprise, what is now one of the pressures on bulk-billing and on the availability of general practitioners outside of the high-density areas? Whether in the peripheries of the big cities or throughout country areas, what is the other problem? We are short 4,500 doctors who, if it had not been for the initiative of the Hawke and Keating government, would be young undergraduates coming into the stream 10 years later. We do not hear about that effect on bulk-billing. We do not hear about the competition that that might have brought into the market that would probably have turned more general practitioners to bulk-billing. So when we look at it we find these various circumstances, but then of course-and it is oft forgotten in history-the Hawke government also decided, for the purpose of reducing bulk-billing, to introduce a copayment. Minister Howe brought in the copayment and it was passed through the parliament. Then Treasurer Keating decided he was going to challenge for the leadership of the Labor Party and, consequently, the prime ministership. What did he do? When he lost the first contest in Caucus, he went off to the left wing and said, ‘Switch your vote from Hawke to Keating and I will cancel the copayment.' That is the history of the Hawke and Keating governments-underline ‘governments'-in their management of bulkbilling and the attempts they made to reduce it. That is the last time we had a Labor government. It is all right to be the smart alec opposition with all your wonderful schemes-and I wish the member for Lalor had stayed around to be reminded that, while she is criticising the Howard government for spending money, she was the author of Medicare Gold and goodness knows how much that would have cost. Anybody who stands up and proposes something like Medicare Gold has no grounds whatsoever to criticise anybody else in this parliament who suggests some level of expenditure. The first factor arising from the speech made by the member for Lalor is that one of the causes of increased doctors fees chooses to criticise them and to suggest to this House that, in contravention of the Constitution, this legislation should contain measures to virtually force medical practitioners, and GPs in particular, to enter the bulk-billing system when it is unconstitutional and ignores the cost based variation that occurs throughout Australia in the delivery of medical services. I have already made the point that, in the electorate of O'Connor, there is not one general practitioner who, in my recollection, has ever bulk-billed. That is not because they are greedy, grasping individuals; it is because, given the population density of the areas they service, they could never survive on what various governments have set as the schedule fee, be it 80 per cent or 100 per cent. The point is that they just do not have enough patients but, on the other hand, they provide a magnificent service. For many years in my electorate it has not been uncommon that not only did doctors not bulk-bill but the community, through their local authority, also has had to provide subsidies-be that a car, premises, residence or sometimes just up-front cash. That was not because the practitioners were greedy, grasping people. Many of them, as time has gone by, have been overseas doctors-yes, I might say the majority. These people have given a in wonderful service, but they are entitled to a reasonable living. This bill improves their chances, particularly if they bulk-bill, remembering that, as was admitted by the member for Lalor, the $7.65 and $5.10 bulkbilling incentives also remain. But let us compare this proposal with what the member for Lalor and her leader took to the last election. It was bulk-billing, bulk-billing, bulk-billing. So, for people living in high-density population areas, a practice can probably economically operate as a 100 per cent bulk-billing practice. But the reality is that, in other areas, were Labor to have been elected on their policies, the people who had no choice about bulk-billing would not have received anything. Irrespective of the somewhat generous proposals that were announced at the time to get people back into bulk-billing, there were two factors that they did not consider. Firstly, some doctors have never bulk-billed and have a philosophical objection to bulk-billing and, if they are the only doctor for 100 kilometres around, there is a fair chance you will go and see them. Secondly, if you are elderly, you have attended the same practice for many years and you have faith and confidence in that practitioner, you are not going to leave. Where do those people stand? Under the provisions in this bill, they are at least $4.60 better off than they would have been under Labor if no bulk-billing were available. At least, when they make their claim, if they pay up front they will get the additional money-about $30. That is what they will get, whatever the doctor charges. I do not commit the government, but let me say that the schedule fee has risen ever since I have been in this parliament. I have never really investigated the formula or the arrangements but, quite clearly, it does increase and no doubt there are some arrangements associated with that. The member for Lalor just completely ignored that proposition. She suggested that this thing is set in concrete and as the doctors charge more-as they will; as I said, one of the reasons is the cost of their professional indemnity insurancethat is a cut from this $4.60 average. It is and that is another thing that must be said about her amendment, which is virtually misleading the House. She wants to condemn the government for ‘failing to ensure that any of the $1.7 billion spent will be passed on to patients'. It will all be passed on to patients, whether or not the doctor takes it and bulk-bills and they walk out of the surgery paying nothing. If that is the incentive that pushes a doctor into bulkbilling, the patient is the beneficiary. And, of course, if they are going to a non-bulkbilling doctor because they have no choice, when they get their rebate from Medicare it will be $4.60 higher than it was previously and, what is more, $4.60 higher than in any proposal from the Labor Party during the election. These are the fundamental issues that we are talking about. It is about time that, when people bring amendments to the House, they are at least based on fact or are otherwise truthful. This amendment is a blatant misleading of the House-unless of course you are in some way numerically challenged. I do not know how many sums you do when you are doing your law course, but it seems to me that there is not much evidence that the member for Lalor carried on with arithmetic. It is clearly and truly an assistance, and it is the only assistance to people in my electorate and people living in the outer suburbs. This is also about getting a supply of doctors, which this government has set about doing. We have a number of excellent policies that are associated with getting enough medical practitioners into the field. As a deliberate policy decision, the last Labor government-not the Labor opposition that come up with all these miracle cures in the hope that they never have to implement them-reduced the intake of undergraduates in the medical disciplines by 4,500. That not, pain is just hitting Australia. We all know that the lead time from starting an undergraduate course to becoming an independently practising GP is about 10 years. We have to look at all of these factors. So, whilst it is all right for the Labor Party to say that the system is not working, the fact is that fundamentally their system. Bulk-billing has always been a difficult sue, and it is something that the parliament cannot impose upon these other people. It cannot be done and it will not be done. That is the fundamental issue. I am amazed when I look at this. There are issues that are of considerable importance. The 100 per cent of the schedule fee is not restricted to the much publicised figure of $4.60. That is for a standard consultation of between six and 20 minutes. Were the time to be, for instance, over 40 minutes, the additional payment would be nearly $13, which of course has to be a great help. It is worth mentioning at this time that, under the Labor government and its Medicare policies, if you lived in the electorate of O'Connor and you had to see a non-bulkbilling doctor and pay cash at the door, when you got your account the only means by which you could get reimbursement was to post off your application form and wait for a cheque in the mail, notwithstanding that you might have a very low net income because you might have two or three kids or be a pensioner-because there was no Medicare office out there, whereas someone in a metropolitan area could virtually go around the corner to get a cash refund. The money was gone and you just did not have it for that period of time. The initiatives that this government took in that regard to deal with this system included electronic transfer into your bank account. More importantly, we put in Medicare Easyclaim. We have also funded a large number of rural transaction centres, where people can get the speediest possible access to a Medicare refund. Let us hope that, at least in the foreseeable future, with the endorsement of the Australian people, who provided this government with a majority in both houses-remember it is that was the people's decision-we might be able to introduce legislation, which the Labor is- Party once cancelled so someone could become Prime Minister, involving a sensible copayment arrangement whereby the medical practitioner can make a charge in his surgery. That of course was something that was deliberately forbidden under the Labor plan-again, to force people into a form of civil conscription that could not be done through legislation. If the doctor's fee is an additional $10, people should have the right to pay the $10 in the surgery and the doctor should be able to claim the full rebate that we are providing. That would be sensible and convenient for people wherever they were. But, of course, the reason that Labor have blindly opposed that simple arrangement is that they are scared stiff that fewer and fewer doctors will operate under their preferred method of bulk-billing. I congratulate the government for taking this particular measure. It will be infinitely beneficial to my constituents, who were going to get nothing under Labor. They very smartly worked that out, and my Labor opponent's vote went down by two or three per cent, from what was previously a relatively low level. People are not silly. They know the difference. This is good legislation and the appropriate response.",77
168,Ms HALL,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, I start by congratulating you on your elevation to the Speaker's panel. It feels a bit like old home week making this speech, with you in the chair and the minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, coming from the Central Coast. Ms Roxon-Or groundhog day.",80
169,Ms HALL,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Maybe not quite. The Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004, as has been said by all other speakers, delivers on the Howard government's promise to increase the rebate for all GP services from 85 per cent to 100 per cent. Whilst we on this side of the House will not be voting against the legislation, I believe it is based on a poor policy premise. I support the amendments moved by the shadow minister, and I will spend some time going over some of the issues that she has raised and which have been raised in these amendments. It is of great concern to me that this lation is based on poor health economics. Any decision that the government takes should have a definite outcome; the government should be aware of the outcome that it will deliver. I do not believe the government really knows where it is going with this. Yes, it will deliver a 100 per cent rebate to the patients of GPs, but there is no guarantee that those patients will pay any less, and there is no guarantee that there will be an increase in bulk-billing. I feel that the government has tricked the Australian people into thinking this is a good policy which is going to lower their health costs, when in fact there is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that this legislation will deliver lower health costs for the Australian people. Whilst the rebate for all GP services is going to be increased from 85 per cent to 100 per cent, that does not in any way, as I have already outlined, guarantee cheaper costs for the Australian people. This package was announced on 6 September. It is quite different from the Labor Party's new deal to save Medicare, which was designed to increase bulk-billing by GPs in the community. Since the Howard government was elected, the bulk-billing rate in my electorate has fallen by 30 per cent. Currently, 51.3 per cent of all services in the Shortland electorate are bulk-billed. This has created severe disadvantage for a number of people in the community. Coupled with the acute doctor shortage in the region, this is creating a lot of hardship for people. Since the election on 9 October we have lost two doctors from the area-one on the Central Coast and one at Lake Macquarie. This translates as longer waiting times for people to see their doctor and higher costs for services. The previous speaker, the member for O'Connor, has quite a selective interpretation of the cause of the doctor shortage. I have a distinct memory of the 1996 legislation introduced by this government which had a legisvery negative impact on the number of GPs available and resulted in poorer service levels and longer waiting periods for people in the community. This 100 per cent rebate benefit will apply to non-referred attendances provided by vocational and nonvocational registered GPs, consultations in GPs' surgeries, after-hours consultations, home and aged care visits, and services provided by GPs to their unadmitted patients in hospitals. I would like to concentrate on home and aged care visits. In my area, particularly on the Central Coast, residents are not being admitted to aged care facilities simply because they do not have a GP who will treat them in those facilities. It is all very well for the government to say they are going to extend the 100 per cent rebate, but I would be really happy if they would take some action to ensure that people can get medical treatment and get a GP to visit them when they are in those facilities. We need at least a commitment from a GP so that those persons can be transferred from our public hospitals to aged care facilities. This bill will also ensure that veterans get a 115 per cent rebate as opposed to the 100 per cent rebate that nonveterans receive. I would like to spend some time talking about the fees that GPs are charging and how I really do not believe this legislation will do anything to stem the increase in doctors' fees. The previous speaker attributed all fees to medical indemnity insurance. I have already identified one reason for those increases in fees, and that is a doctor shortage. It is a way that doctors can manage their caseload. Until the government does something that is real in that area, I do not believe the situation will improve in any way. Since the election, an increase in doctors' fees has already been recommended, and I think this is just a symptom of something to come. These increases will be ongoing and, of course, once again it will be the patients, the Australians who rely on their doctors, who will have to bear that cost. It is very bad policy, as I have already stated, to grant an increase-to introduce a policy without having in mind a measured outcome. In her amendments, the shadow minister noted the increase in people's out-of-pocket medical expenses. These expenses have soared from a little over eight per cent to 15.3 per cent, and this does affect people when they have to make a decision as to whether or not they can afford to see their doctor. I have had a number of constituents visit me in my office and tell me about how they have to balance their budget in order to be able to go and see the doctor. You see, in my area it is not just people in receipt of wages who are not being bulk-billed; rather, it is the pensioners and people with health care cards who are attending the doctor and not being bulk-billed. The government's previous measure, which increased payments to doctors for the bulk-billing of pensioners and young people under 16, resulted in a couple of surgeries within my electorate introducing or reintroducing bulk-billing. But do you know when that finished? I hate to tell you, but it was as soon as the election was over. Isn't that interesting? Here we had a government initiative put in that was taken up by a very small minority of practices and which in most practices has now been dropped. Once again, it was a short-term fix and one that I believe benefited the government more than the people in my electorate. The minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, would be aware that in our area on the Central Coast none of the doctors started bulkbilling after the government introduced its package earlier this year. Rather, they approached both the government and the opposition and asked for help in managing the crisis that exists on the Central Coast of New South Wales. This crisis has been caused by the doctor shortage and the ageing population. All the electorates on the Central Coast have rather elderly populations. The minister's electorate has the fifth oldest population in Australia. Shortland has the 10th oldest population in Australia. Dobell, which is the other electorate on the Central Coast, has the 29th oldest population in Australia. This, coupled with the fact that there is also a very young population and an extremely disadvantaged population, causes a situation that I would have to say is explosive. It has caused an enormous increase in the waiting times in our public hospitals and it has caused enormous hardship for people who have difficulty either getting an appointment with a doctor or being able to afford an appointment with a doctor. The government need to do a little bit more than what they have done in this legislation. There needs to be a guarantee to Australians that this legislation, previous legislation and subsequent legislation are going to deliver better access to health care and lower health costs to the Australian people. Otherwise, we are going to have a situation where there are only going to be a few people who can afford to access a quality health service and quality health treatment. The remainder of the population will be forced to accept a second-rate health service and in many cases will not be able to afford to attend their GP. That is a very sad state of affairs. There are also some concerns about this legislation from the doctors' point of view. Whilst the legislation says that the rebate will be indexed, it does not say how it will be indexed and it does not guarantee that the level of indexation will actually match the increases in costs for doctors. Over a period of time the benefits of this package for doctors will be eroded. On the one hand you have the package not delivering for patients, as it is quite obvious that many doctors will for one reason or another continue to charge their patients at a level similar to the level they are charging at the moment. On the other hand, you have a situation where doctors will find that this promised increase erode. If practice costs increase at about 4.5 per cent per annum, the new rebate will be eroded by 2010. That is if the average index is based on the WCI5. That is approximately two per cent per annum. I do not believe this package was modelled properly. I do not think that it was given a robust assessment. I believe that the health economics employed here are unsound and that the outcomes for patients will be very poor. I am sure that initially it will benefit a number of people but it will not take too long before any benefit that patients receive is eroded. This legislation is quite flawed. I do not want to be coming back here in a year's time saying, ‘I told you so.' What I want to be coming back here in a year's time and saying is, ‘All Australians have access to quality health care and we do not have a second-class health system here in Australia.' Unfortunately, under the Howard government we have had a decline in doctors, we have had enormous doctor dissatisfaction and we have had a dramatic fall in bulk-billing. The losers are the Australian people. I support the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister and I would like to suggest to the minister that he looks at and accepts it-and that he employs a good health economist to evaluate his legislation before it is introduced into this parliament.",80
170,Mrs DRAPER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the Speaker's panel. I rise to speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. Australians enjoy what is arguably the best and most affordable health system in the world. This bill honours the government's election commitments to make it potentially even more affordable. Our general practitioners perform admirawill bly on a daily basis. They have earned the respect of their communities and-just as importantly-they have earned their confidence. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, a great deal of work has been done to protect and strengthen Medicare and to provide even greater access to high-quality GP services. Under Strengthening Medicare, provision has been made for a further 1,500 doctors and 1,600 practice nurses. The aim of the federal government is to ensure that as many Australians as possible have access to quality and convenient GP services when they are needed. During the recent election campaign, the government gave a commitment to make GP services more affordable for all Australians. This bill honours that commitment. This is as opposed to the ridiculous proposition, during the campaign, by the member for Lalor and opposition health spokesperson, of Medicare Gold, described I think by Peter Botsman as having the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat. In the animal farm that is the present Labor Party, where would we place this piece of political recklessness? For the sake of Australia, we can only hope it goes the way of the dodo. When Labor caucus voted for a previous opposition leader, media comment suggested that the turkeys had voted for Christmas. There are now fewer turkeys but just as much squawking by members opposite. Apart from the mangy dog, the dead parrot, the collection of roosters and a new entrant, the red-crested galah, during the election campaign we had the Labor Party promising a turtle interpretation centre. Why? Who knows. I do not think the turtles were requiring a Medicare rebate! And we must not forget the Milky Bar Kid, who politely awaits the demise and removal of the dead parrot so that he may then lead this menagerie. He is not hoping to send the dead parrot for resuscitation to his local GP-no, he is just waiting politely for the other's demise and removal, which I am sorry to say is not funded under Medicare. Indeed, the public must be feeling extremely pleased that the coalition was returned to office at the recent election as it looks on at the bewildering display of political shenanigans. What people expect from an opposition is at least some form of policy coherence. At least the people of Australia will get good health policy and economic management from the coalition government. Subject to the passage of this bill, from 1 January 2005 the rebate for all GP services will be increased from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the Medicare schedule fee. This means that, for the standard 15-minute surgery consultation, an additional rebate of $4.50 a visit is paid. If the GP does not bulkthem bill, the patient will still out-of-pocket costs after they receive the 100 per cent Medicare rebate. As a further encouragement to doctors to bulk-bill their patients in addition to the incentives contained in Strengthening Medicare, the payment will be made to the doctor for consultations that are bulk-billed. Through this measure, the government will invest more than $1.7 billion over four years to make GP services more affordable. The 100 per cent Medicare rebate will apply to consultations provided in GPs' surgeries; after-hours, home and aged care facility visits; and attendances by GPs on their unadmitted patients in a hospital. Many Australian families are already benefiting from the new Medicare safety net introduced by this government. This bill contains further measures which will confirm eligibility for the extended Medicare safety net at the $300 threshold for all families that are eligible for family tax benefit part A. I remind honourable members that the extended Medicare safety net covers 80 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services provided outside hospital once the yearly threshold is met. By increasing the level of rebate to 100 per cent of the schedule fee, more services are likely to be bulk-billed. This is in addition to the already considerable incentives provided to doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and families with children. General practitioners will see their base Medicare fee incomes for services increase by around 15 per cent as a result of these changes. These can be further increased if they choose to accept the government's $5 and $7.50 bulk-billing incentives for children under 16 and concession card holders. Bulk-billing remains the choice of individual doctors, but there are now considerable incentives in place for to pass on lower out-of-pocket costs to benefit from lower their patients. It is unfortunate that Australia's worldclass health system is not supported by the Labor opposition. It is troubling that Labor took policies to the last election which would have undermined Medicare and put at risk the very real improvements in medical services that have been delivered over the last 8½ years. Australia has a unique system of public and private delivery of health services which needs to be kept in the right balance. If Labor is ever given the opportunity to implement its draconian policies then not only will the private health system collapse but the very safety of Medicare will be in doubt. Labor needs to remove its ideological blinkers and understand that you cannot destroy one sector without seriously undermining the other. If it is to be taken seriously, Labor also needs to learn that it needs to adopt more fiscally responsible policies. Open-ended funding promises issued during an election campaign are simply not to be believed-not even by those for whom the benefit is meant to accrue. It should never be forgotten that this government inherited a $10 billion black hole from the Keating Labor government. There were problems in the aged care sector, which had been ignored for years, and immunisation rates had dropped to Third World levels. While the Labor states continue to renege on their responsibilities for public hospitals, mental health, and disability funding, the Howard government will provide funding of up to $42 billion under the 200308 Australian health care agreements. This is a further $10 billion, or a real increase of per cent. The government is also providing $252 million worth of projects under the Pathways Home Program to assist people to return home after a period of acute care in hospital. Mr Deputy Speaker, 55.6 per cent of total public health expenditure in Australia comes from the Howard government, compared with the 44.4 per cent provided by the states and territories. We are doing more to achieve improved health outcomes, such as providing $812 million over five years to support breast cancer, cervical screening and a range of other public health services. We are doing more to improve the blood supply process by committing over $500 million to the purchase of blood and blood products. On 29 June 2004, the Prime Minister announced a further $116 million package of initiatives over four years to build a healthy, active Australia. This package provides a national framework for addressing childhood obesity and complements the work of the National Obesity Taskforce. With each initiative we aim to provide more accessible and affordable health services to all the Australian people. Thanks to the government's policies, bulk-billing is on the increase again as more doctors take advantage of the incentives on offer. The doctors benefit, the patients benefit, and Australia's economy continues to prosper-a good result all round. I commend this bill to the House.",83
171,Ms PANOPOULOS,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004, and to speak against the proposed amendment. I am delighted to be speaking on this bill because it implements one of the government's major election policy announcements made in early September during the election campaign: to increase the Medicare rebate for GP services from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the 17 schedule fee. In dollar terms, this means that there will be an almost $5 increase in the rebate for a standard GP consultation. The bill supports the government's commitment to delivering high-quality, affordable health care. This bill represents one of the most important improvements to Medicare in 20 years. It assists both GPs and their patients. Through the measures in this bill, which are complemented by the government's previously announced Strengthening Medicare initiatives, the government is providing real incentive for GPs to bulk-bill. But, importantly, GPs are not forced to bulk-bill. Where a GP does bulk-bill, they will receive the higher rebate; where they do not and the patient is charged for a visit to the doctor, the patient receives the increased rebate. During the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition proclaimed: When it comes down to it, on the ninth of October it's a referendum about the future of Medicare. It's a referendum about the future of care this country. If this statement is anything to go by, I am pleased to note that the people of Australiaand indeed the people in my electorate of Indi-think that their health care system is in pretty safe hands under the Howard government. Bulk-billing is important and it should be available to those who need it. But in the end, as we all know, bulk-billing is a matter between doctors and patients. This was the case in 1984 and it remains the case 20 years later, despite the sometimes hysterical ranting of the member for Lalor. She supports coercive measures to transform the GP profession into an enclave of government controlled, bureaucratic public servants offering a new style of socialist medicine. Perhaps the member for Lalor should not be so peremptory. It is a little-known but curious fact that if the proposals that the Labor Party took to the election were implemented, the actual incidence of bulk-billing would have declined. For months, the Labor Party trumpeted its bulk-billing proposals, which, according to the policy document, would have meant that ‘GPs on average will receive an extra $3.35 per consultation'. They later raised it to about $5 per consultation, but did it not occur to the Labor Party that GPs in my electorate were already receiving an extra $7.50 loading when they bulk-billed a goodly number of their patients? This point opens up a number of interesting scenarios. Let us say that a person is charged $40 for a visit to their GP. Under this legislation they will be rebated at a higher rate of $30.20. If the Labor Party's approach were followed the patient would receive only $25.70. Taking this point even further, in conjunction with the Strengthening Medicare initiatives, when the measures contained in this bill come into force on 1 January 2005, health if a child or a Commonwealth concession cardholder in my electorate is bulk-billed, the GP rebate will be $37.70, whereas under the Labor Party's proposals the rebate would still only have been $30.20. Labor only had a plan to offer higher rebates to GPs who bulk-billed. This flies in the face of the long standing principle of universal access to the Medicare rebate that underpins a patient's contact with their GP. Once again we have winners and losers, discrimination and division and insiders and outsiders. These are the binding philosophies behind the modern Labor Party's approach in 2004 that were so clearly illustrated in the recent federal election. The Labor Party believes in division and strife. Its leader is obsessed with class warfare and envy. The Leader of the Opposition sees us as a dogeat-dog society infested with categories of irreconcilable interests. With the current Leader of the Opposition it is always the parts, never the whole. He remains an angry class warfare warrior who sees the world through the eyes of his roots. The tiresome repetition of the Green Valley story is in no way born out of empathy with those he left behind; it is driven by envy and anger towards those who never lived there. Not only did we see a manifestation of this in the Labor Party's schools policy-which even the Catholic and Anglican archbishops of Melbourne and Sydney saw as ‘potentially divisive' and ‘regrettable', and ‘which would have benefited schools of one faith background largely at the expense of another'but we see it in the approach to the legislation we are debating today. The reality is that, for a whole host sons, some GPs will not bulk-bill all of their patients all of the time. In fact, some patients would resent it if they did. Doctors and patients understand this, but the modern Australian Labor Party does not. Then the Labor Party goes to an election with a policy that penalises patients who are not bulk-billed. The government's views on this are broadly similar to those espoused by the creative architect of Medicare, Neal Blewett, when he said of bulk-billing that government ‘has not the power to compel them to do so nor does it desire to compel them to do so'. For a political party that arrogantly prides itself on being the true arbiter of good health policy, the Labor Party's announcements on health during this election period were a great and severe disappointment. The centrepiece announcement of the campaign for Labor-the promise to give free first-class hospital cover to over-75s-must surely rank as one of the most appalling pieces of health and social policy ever advocated by a political party in the Western world. It was unsustainable, it was irresponsible, it was eminently unachievable and it also happened to be underfunded by around $700 million, according to Treasury. Medicare Gold became ‘Medicare Copper' in a matter of days. Medicare Gold was a farce from the very beginning, as nonsensical a piece of public policy as heroin-injecting rooms. But what has the Labor Party done to the architect of Medicare Gold? Kept her, promoted her and held her up as a beacon of what a perfect Labor member of parliament should be, instead of relegating her to beyond the back benches for this disgraceful, irresponsible and amateurish piece of policy. The Howard government remains proud of its achievements in the health portfolio in recent times. At a local level, as the federal of reamember for Indi I am pleased with many of the exciting developments which improve primary health care in north-east Victoria. For instance, we have the $1.6 million announcement of a rural medical school in Wangaratta, we have a new bulk-billing clinic in Wodonga, we have the $7.50 bulkbilling incentive for our local GPs and we have the Mount Beauty medical student accommodation block, which I opened last year and which was funded by the Commonwealth. Local doctors will tell you of the success of the Bogong Regional Training Network scheme, which has grown in GP training numbers from 10 to 43 since its inception. We have the measure we debate today where, from 1 January 2005, there is an increase in the Medicare benefit from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the schedule fee, and we also have more than 5,340 people in Indi benefiting from the Medicare safety net. It is timely to mention the Medicare safety net and to recount the comments of the member for Werriwa, who in 1995 said: The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place. This is apparently now not the case, because Labor went to the last election promising to ditch the single biggest improvement to the architecture of Medicare seen in recent history-that is, the Medicare safety net. I also wish to comment on another feature of this bill: the assurance that all families eligible for family tax benefit part A are automatically eligible for the lower $300 threshold. This particular issue was raised with my electorate office prior to the election by a constituent who received her family tax benefit in one lump sum and, due to a drafting error in the original legislation, was not immediately recognised as being eligible for the lower safety net threshold. She is now eligible, and I am pleased this legislation rectified this matter to enable even more of my constituents to go on receiving immediately the significant benefits that come with the Medicare safety net. On another local initiative in my electorate related to bulk-billing, I have spoken in this place before on the success of a new bulk-billing clinic operating adjacent to the Wodonga hospital. This clinic is offering an important service to border patients and is clearly paying dividends to the Albury Wodonga community, mainly through the initiatives contained in ‘Strengthening Medicare' and MedicarePlus. Minister Abbott came to this clinic in March this year and met with GPs and patients. I refer to a representation made to me by the CEO of the Wodonga Regional Health Service, where this clinic is situated. The CEO said: ‘I am pleased to inform you that the clinic has been successful to date, largely due to the MedicarePlus initiative'. He also notes the ‘significant returns to the community of Indi that arise from a clinic committed to bulk-billing under the MedicarePlus initiative'. What all this confirms is that this government is not interested in playing politics with people's health. It is interested in getting runs on board for the benefit of patients and the Aus- to this. tralian community. This bill commits an extra $1.7 billion to make Medicare fairer and stronger. Few governments in the world can claim to oversee a world-class health system as Australia's government does. The Australian people like Medicare and, as the Minister for Health and Ageing has said, believe that Medicare is a fundamental part of our health system: ‘Medicare remains an article of faith for this government.' The measures in this bill continue the good work of the government in making our world-class health system even better and able to deal with the challenges of the changing demographics of this nation has over the decades ahead. I look forward to seeing the benefits of this legislation being delivered to the people of my electorate and to the broader Australian community from 1 January 2005, and therefore I have great pleasure in commending the bill to the House.",85
172,Mr HATTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Blaxland) (8.06 p.m.)Tonight is a night for remembering. On hearing the previous speaker, the member for Indi, speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 I remembered former member for Indi Lou Lieberman. He was a nice bloke. He cared about his people and he was a good country member, with no capital city associations. He did not have the same sharp vituperativeness as the current member for Indi. He did not have that darkness in the heart making him want to cut people open on their policy approaches. As far as I know, Lou Lieberman was never on Insiders. He did not give us the 50-second member's approach to what was wrong with life and the rest of it. He was a gentle and interesting man who readily crossed the chamber and who dealt well with people, but we get no charity from the current member for Indithe either in personal or policy terms-in regard I think that the fundamental difference is that, if you are in opposition, with the intention to come to government again, you have on your shoulders the fact that the measures you propose have to be weighed up with what you would do if you came to government and took on the great responsibility of providing services for the Australian people. If you are in government, you have to be willing to take a bit of stick in the reactions from people who do not like everything you do. You have to be willing to take responsibility for those government measures which will be accepted by some but may injure others. In terms of the bill and the way in which the member for Indi just dealt with it, I was at a bit of a loss. I had done a bit of preparaswiftie. tion for this bill-not as much as I had hoped. I had just come from the Main Committee, where I had to shorten my time speaking on vocational education, and I walked in and thought I was going to deal with a different bill altogether, because we got a lot of vituperativeness. The opposition and the Leader of the Opposition got an unmeasured attack, but we did not get much sense of what this bill is about. Apart from an almost reflex approach, saying that whatever the Minister for Health and Ageing or the government was doing was right, we did not get much real understanding of the implications of the bill or-judging from past experience in Indi, having been there on a task force-much close association from the member with her electorate. She is a blow-in from Melbourne. I do not think she really yet has the beat of country Victoria or country Australia and the importance of Medicare and bulk-billing. Whether she realises it or not, she comes from an electorate that has one of the lowest levels of bulk-billing in Australia. These measures brought forward by the member for Warringah as the minister for health attempt some kind of stopgap. They were put in, firstly, to cover the fact that government had significant problems with Labor's approach to bulk-billing as a significant problem in Medicare delivery and, secondly, because of the bulk-billing statistics. If you look at the stats, you see the level of bulk-billing when we were in government going up almost exponentially and-guess what-the level of bulk-billing when we lost government in 1996 sliding its way down the other side of the isosceles triangle as fast as you can imagine. Australians are not dummies. They know whether services are or are not being provided, they know when things slip away and they know when the government has pulled a The minister for health has put forward a number of things in a belated attempt to try to catch up with Labor's approach and arguments with regard to the fundamental problem of bulk-billing. He has put some provisions forward that a number of people in the community will readily accept. Not just the members on his back bench but people generally will see that some comfort will come from those. In particular, the provision that he has put forward and argued for for people who have to go to specialists and could not otherwise cover their out-of-pocket expenses has won reasonable support within sectors of the community. What this bill is fundamentally about, giving extra money in terms of the Medicare rebate, is the minister for health's attempt to cover the key problem that has existed for the last 12 months plus. I wish happy birthday to the member for Kooyong, who has just joined us in the House. He is a good friend and a great member for his area. The member for Warringah has attempted to provide another way to help solve the health riddle that Australia faces. He has chosen to say within this bill: ‘We've got a significant problem in terms of Australia's doctors. The GPs have said to us in waging a campaign the for more than a year that they're not happy with the rebate that they get.' Labor had one response; the minister has come up with another. Medical practitioners in Australia have argued that bulk-billing rates have gone down primarily because there has not been any movement in their base remuneration. They have not got the increases in salary that other sectors of the community have. They are dependent for their income, whether they bulk-bill or charge privately, on what they get back from the government in the first instance. They have argued that the costs of their medical practices in line with the cost of other private businesses from one end of Australia to the other have risen inexorably, in good partand they have argued this pretty vigorously-because of the cost imposed by this government. Remember the GST. Remember the quarterly returns that have to be put in and the accounting costs associated with that. Because they are providers of services, where there is a provision from the government as a rebate to them-bulk-billing or not-they have to wear a lot of those increased costs and they have not been able, according to what they have argued, to find an adequate way to get recompense. The solution for the GPs is, in part, to gue for an increase in the Medicare rebate. This government has delivered to them an increase in the rebate from 85 per cent to 100 per cent, and this goes a reasonable way to assuage the demands and the fears of those GPs. But they pointed out, even when it was first promulgated-certainly it has not been legislated yet; this is the first part of that process-that, first, it is a step forward but is not enough; second, they need a more genuine agreement with the government because they want to continue to provide their services and run their practices in a reasonable way; and, third, if the government had done not only this but also had met them and done a real deal in terms of recognising their actual costs and what the government has imposed by that, the government would be even more generous. For them, it is not just about increasing the base rate from 85 per cent to 100 per cent. They argue that the base rate is fundamentally deficient. Further to that, in terms of the cost pressures that are faced by GPs, you have got another anomaly arising. It is only nascent at the moment, but an anomaly will arise because the government have said: ‘We will do two kinds of payment. It is 100 per cent if you are bulk-billing, and we will give you 100 per cent no matter which GP you go to see.' I well remember during the election campaign that the Prime Minister argued, hand on his heart, that this was a great boon for the Australian population, because no matter whether a person is bulk-billed or not, they could have access to their doctor, the doctor would get a 100 per cent rebate, and that would fundamentally assist the doctor and the patients would be better off. Interestingly, the cost of this measure, at $1.7 billion in the initial year-and the technical advisers can bear this out-is exactly the same as the cost of the private health insurance rebate. The cost of the 30 per cent ar- private health rebate, in its initial year of operation, was $1.7 billion. The government have argued that they are doing the right thing by GPs. They do not expect a cost blow-out in relation to this and they do not expect patients to have to carry more of the burden, but I would look at some recent history and ask a simple question: if it is the same amount to start off with, given that it there has been inflation over the period since it was introduced-although we are in a lowinflation period and you would not expect it to be so great-what is the cost of the private health insurance rebate now? The advisers would be able to tell us, and the parliamentary secretary and the minister would be able to tell us what the cost of the rebate is now. From memory, it has more than doubled. It is over $3 billion now, isn't it? Or I may not have caught up with it in the last year or so, when it may have been on its way to doubling again. The private health rebate has increased exponentially in terms of cost to the government. What do you think is going to happen with this $1.7 billion in terms of cost to the government and, more importantly, in terms of cost to the community? Part of the problem is the differential that is embedded in this legislation. Say you walk into a bulk-billing doctor-and there are not many of them around the joint. You go from 85 per cent to 100 per cent rebate. Those characters should be happy. I am from the electorate of Blaxland, in the city of Bankstown, in the middle of Sydney. My electorate had a 97 per cent bulk-billing rate, and has now plummeted to about 95 per cent. One could ask: what have I got to complain about? It is a very high rate, and the surrounding electorates have the same thing. But if you go outside of the area, if you go the electorate of Lowe, which is right next door-for example, you go to a doctor in Drummoyne-you will find that you are up against a bulk-billing doctor. This proposal says it provides 100 per cent rebate of the basic fee to that bulk-billing doctor, cross their hearts and hope to die. We hope they do not increase the charges over and above what you would expect to get. The doctors say, and they were saying it for more than a year before the election: it is not enough money. What is the doctors' response to this proposal? Their response is to increase their fees. They have done what the private health insurance industry has done with the 30 per cent rebate: ‘Thank you very much, let's pull in the fish.' The government has provided this incentive. The government has, seemingly for electoral purposes, forgotten the fact that economics works in the real world. If you provide an incentive to a private provider that you are going to undergird, in terms of private health funds, 30 per cent of the cost of those funds, they promise-cross their hearts and hope to die. It was the government that did that, not the health funds. When the government said that they would be stopping those increases in prices, it did not actually happen. And guess what? What has happened as a result of the government promulgating that these measures would come into force in their parliament? Almost immediately, the private doctors have said, ‘Thank you very much, it is not enough and our price is going up.' So there might be 100 per cent of the basic rebate, but that increase from 85 per cent to 100 per cent has been incorporated in the increase in the cost to the person walking through the doctor's door. it There is no fundamental solution to the problems in terms of doctors' remuneration. They get part of what they want, but they are taking the other part directly out of the electorate. Although the member for Indi and other members on the government side have said that this is their key solution to the perceived problems with Medicare, although this government will argue that having a rebate of the core amount to go back to doctors from 85 per cent to 100 per cent is a fundamental solution, it is a way station for the doctors and it still allows them to exercise their own economic muscle-not just with the government, where they do not think they have exercised enough, but out in the broader community. They take this as effectively a supplement that should have been provided earlier and a supplement that does not really cover the demands that they have made. If you take this further, in terms of what we have heard this week and in past weeks from the Treasurer, from the Minister for Health and Ageing, and from others about the Intergenerational Report and problems associated with the fact that the community is ageing, the graph works its way up very exponentially. Not now, but in the next decade, and the decade after that. Mr Georgiou-Medicare Gold!",88
173,Mr HATTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Poor simple souls; they just want to interject and have a go at what Labor has put forward as a policy that rationalises health costs in the private area. Be that as it may, we have a critical problem here. For my sins, I am a 1951 baby boomer. Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, like you and others, I am part of the baby boomer generation. We will be in the simple situation where the number of aged people in the population will double from 12½ per cent to 25 per cent of the population. Mr Lloyd interjecting",91
174,Mr HATTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads may be younger than that. Be that as it may, whether he is a baby boomer or not, whether he is joining me or not, those of my generation and I take full responsibility for the fact that our share of the total community will increase, the health care costs of the total community will increase, reliance upon Medicare will increase and people on reduced incomes-because incomes will always be less than the baby boomers will want-will also face the situation where they will make a determination about going to the doctor: is the 100 per cent rebate enough or will their cost inexorably increase? I do not think this is going to do the job. I think it is patchwork. I can understand why it has been put together: the government has done whatever it took to get re-elected. I can understand that, in order to get back into office, it spent in the order of $21 billion in May 2001 plus what it spent in the election. I can understand that, despite the fact that we have low inflation, in just three years the government spent triple what they spent in 2001 of the constituents' money-the money of the people of Australia-in order to get back. I can understand that that worked. But the short-term improvement of the government's position is to the long-term detriment of the Australian people. It depends how you take it. On budget day there was the $66 billion or the $61 billion of expenditure, variously categorised as $37 billion or $50 billion, and in one single day of the election campaign there was the $6 billion worth of promises. It is staggering stuff. The drunken sailor stuff really resonates regarding the amount the government promised in order to snatch back office. It was very successful. It got an increase of 1.8 per cent in its national vote. It got an increase in the number of members in this place. But the price to be paid will be paid by the people of Australia. Across a whole series of portfolios, across a whole series of programs, it will be taken out of the hide of the Australian people. This is the government's vainglorious attempt to match Labor. It is their attempt to say, ‘Labor is not really the party of Medicare'-despite the fact that Labor started Medibank; despite the fact that the Fraser government year after year, over seven full years, gutted Medibank and sought to stab it in the stomach, as the Prime Minister wished to do with Medicare. The coalition, in that wonderful inversion which is so much a part of their approach to things, are now the great defenders of the status quo; they are now the great defenders supposedly of Medicare. Unfortunately, I have to tell Australia's doctors and the people of Australia who line up either in Blaxland, Lowe, Kooyong or Indi that this is not the full story. This little package is about covering the coalition's derriere in regard to health policy. It is about dealing with an antagonistic interest group, the Australian Medical Association, and attempting to assuage not only their fears but also their demand for an increase effectively in their wages. It will only go part way to solving the government's problem; it is not a full attempt at all to deal with the underlying realities in terms either of the doctors or of service provision for the whole of Australia. The fundamental provision in this legislation is the 100 per cent Medicare rebate. One hundred per cent sounds good, unless you are a GP practising in Australia and arguing that it is not enough. (Time expired)",92
175,Mrs HULL,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"To come into this House to speak on legislation like this bill is a great opportunity. Many times when you come into the House to speak on legislation you might not have great news and great history to help put forward a very convincing debate, but health is one area that this government has excelled in. I am very proud to walk into this House many times and espouse the virtues of this government and its provision of additional health services. Let me set the scene. I do not want to be accused of not being relevant by the member for Blaxland, so I want to start off by setting the scene by providing the history of benefits that this government has provided over the past eight years. These benefits have worked to correct and improve Australia's health system and to maintain our world-class services. It might not be recognised on the opposite side of the House that we do have world-class health services, but I absolutely confirm for the member for Blaxland that we have world-class health services, believe you me, and this government has played a very big part in ensuring that we continue to have world-class services and that we continue to have them in rural and regional Australia. We have worked to increase the number of doctors training and practising outside metropolitan areas. We have established rural clinical schools, one of which I am very proud to host in my electorate of Riverina: the University of New South Wales School of Rural Health. It has gone a long way to ensuring that those young students who are doing their degree will look to return to and regional practice in establishing their craft of medicine. We have made private health insurance more affordable and accessible, thereby reducing the strain on the public health system. We have introduced the successful after-hours clinic program; it has been very successful in my electorate of Riverina. It has established clinics throughout Australia including, as I have said, in the Riverina, with the Riverina Division of General Practice as an excellent example of a successful after-hours medical clinic. This after-hours clinic operates from rooms in Calvary Hospital. The clinic provides valuable and much needed medical services to people throughout Wagga Wagga and the surrounding area. It is serviced by a majority of local doctors, who work on a roster system to ensure that this clinic is staffed after hours during the week and on weekends and public holidays, thus reducing the load on the terribly stressed state hospital system. What we have is an ineffective New South Wales Labor government which has stressed the hospital system to the maximum, and this Howard-Anderson federal coalition government has put in place with the various ministers an opportunity for people to be able to action other health services beyond those public health services that we see so often espoused by the opposite side of the room. We have achieved many great things in the area of health. We are committed to continuing those improvements to our health system and ensuring access for all Australians. Since I was elected as the member for Riverina in 1998 more than $36 million in federal government funding has been delivered into my region in the area of health alone. This funding has gone into many different areas of health, including $1.2 million to establish a rural obstetrics training network in the Riverina and Murray region. That is something that we need to be critirural cally concerned with. We were faced with the prospect of mums having to be flown to Sydney for perfectly normal deliveries, and we were faced with the shutdown of all private obstetric services. But this government under the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, combined with myself of course-I had a bit of an input into thisdetermined that we would establish a rural obstetrics training network. Now we are up and running, contracts are signed, and we have some very good people on the job, including Dr Ian Stewart, a gynaecologist and obstetrician who, for a number of years now, has been operating in this area and understands how we are going to provide obstetric services in rural and regional areas into the future. This project is a fantastic pilot. It be picked up and put anywhere in Australia to ensure services will be maintained for rural women who want to have their children in their communities. We also have $820,000 for supplying specialist medical services to towns in the Riverina and we had $13.7 million to set up a rural clinical school at Wagga Wagga to address the shortage of medical practitioners, and it has just been funded again for the next four years. In my electorate of Riverina one of the greatest concerns in health is access to a doctor, not access to bulk-billing. The communities throughout my region and beyond struggle to attract doctors, particularly ones who are willing to establish a permanent practice. One small community in my electorate had 22 locums in 18 months. Their issue certainly was not: ‘Am I going to be bulkbilled?' Their issue was: ‘Am I going to have a doctor?' We have resolved that issue for them. This government has provided a secure service in most of the towns throughout my electorate. Some of the initiatives that I have announced in the past have been significant in the way in which we have looked at health in a different capacity since this government put in place the health measures that were going to address many of the shortfalls that came about through 13 years of Labor rule. The Nationals have worked in coalition with the health minister to increase the number of general practitioners in rural and regional Australia and to encourage students to explore the options of practising outside the cities. I recall when John Anderson and former Minister Michael Wooldridge went out and had a look at the way in which services were declining in rural and regional Australia, had a look at the significant issues that confronted rural residents when they were seeking health services and then decided on a plan that would take us forward. We need to can be eternally grateful to those two members of parliament for looking outside the square and determining that they could in fact put in place many great initiatives that would see these things resolved. They do not get resolved overnight, they take some years, but it is a beginning. The journey of a thousand steps begins with just one, and this government took the first step. We are very proud of that. As a result of these policies over 25 per cent of Australia's medical students now come from rural areas. That is something we did not have when the coalition came into government. We did not have a quota of students who were able to come from rural areas to study medicine. Medicine needed a 99.9 per cent TER or UAI, and rural students were not able to feature very highly in that area. Now they can have 85 per cent and we can do an assessment and deliver rural students into medical courses before delivering them right back to rural Australia where they came from. That was an initiative that came from this coalition government. Doctors are much more likely to return to practise in rural and regional Australia if they have come from the bowels of our areas. The Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme provides $10,000 each year to undergraduate medical students from rural and regional backgrounds. There were only 100 medical students from rural areas in 1996 when this government came into power. Now we have 500 medical students receiving those RMS scholarships alone. That is a very significant input by any government. In addition, the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme provides over $20,000 a year to students during their medical degree. In return, these students agree to work for six years in a rural or remote area. I think that is very credible and laudable. It is a great program that gives students an opportunity, and these places are on top of general places. It is not conscription. These kids are signing up. They know what they are doing, and they want to have the opportunity to work in rural and regional Australia. These two schemes alone build on our other policies that will increase the number of these doctors. These policies include specialist retention payments, extra funding to support rural GPs who perform minor operations and obstetrics, and attracting more overseas trained doctors to areas where there is a shortage of doctors and communities are unable to get an Australian trained doctor. As I said, training doctors does not happen overnight. It is a process that takes many years. But we will continue to build on these existing policies, and we will continue to attract general practitioners into rural medicine. So all of these initiatives have delivered benefits-but then we come in and say, as Tim Shaw did, ‘Wait, there's more.' The decision by this government to raise the Medicare benefit from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the schedule fee has been welcomed in my electorate because it means an increase of $4.60 in the Medicare rebate for a standard surgery consultation. This increase in the rebate applies to consultations in doctors' surgeries, after hours, at home and in aged care facility visits. It is a tremendous initiative that the minister has put to the House. I listened to the member for Blaxland and I really did not much like the Labor Party's alternative to our Medicare rebate policy, which was to offer 100 per cent of the schedule fee of bulk-billed consultations only. If you are in an area where, as the member for Blaxland has just indicated, he has approximately 95 per cent of doctors bulk-billing, that is great. We have Labor areas propped up with mass city areas that can get bulk-billing at 95 per cent. In my electorate of Riverina, and many other rural areas right across Australia, bulkbilling has traditionally been non-existent. We would not have received any benefit out of the Labor policy at all. I ask the Labor Party: how would this have benefited people in the electorate of Riverina where general practitioners simply do not bulk-bill? I find it hard to comprehend why the opposition would seek to create a policy that neglected to consider the consequences for those who are unable to access bulk-billing. The situation is better now than it was when the opposition were in power for 13 years. We have traditionally had no bulk-billing in my electorate. We all want to have an opportunity to spread some good health news. In order to give my colleagues an opportunity to be able to spread their good message, their good humoured news, I suggest that we all accept that this is an exciting initiative. It is part of a suite of the many exciting initiatives that have been administered in this House by this coalition government.",93
176,Mr GEORGIOU,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I wish to support the comments of the honourable member for Riverina on the Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. Medicare has been one of the cornerstones of the Australian public health system since it was introduced by Gough Whitlam almost 30 years ago. I take the honourable member for Blaxland's point: I do not think there is much point in beating around the bush and pretending that the coalition has always been unequivocally committed to Medibank or to Medicare as it now is. That is not the case. Many of us recollect the constant changes made to Medibank under the Fraser government-indeed some of us participated in them. There were our successive promises in the 13 years of opposition to fundamentally change the basic components of Medicare once it was reinstalled by the Hawke government. The fact is, however, that, whatever the Labor Party says, this all changed with the demise of Fightback and when John Howard as Leader of the Opposition gave an unequivocal commitment that the coalition would fully retain the Medicare system. I believe this commitment has been honoured and indeed exceeded. One of the Howard government's great success stories has been its reinforcement of Medicare. It may have taken some ideological revolutions to get there, but once the commitment was made it was kept. The government has worked to secure the long-term viability of Medicare to ensure that all Australians have improved access to the multitude of medical services available to the community and to keep our medical system affordable for those who need to access it. The Strengthening Medicare policy was an important step towards meeting these objectives. It is worth reflecting on some of its key components. Some 60 per cent of GP consultations in Australia involve medical services delivered to children under the age of 16 years and to concession card holderspension, health care and Commonwealth seniors card holders. The government determined that when a bulk-billing GP treated these patients the payment to the doctor would be increased by $5, and further increased to $7.50 if the doctor were located in remote or rural areas which included all of Tasmania. These amounts have increased to $5.10 and $7.65 respectively as a result of indexation from 1 November of this year. Before we turn our attention to the next step in this process-the 100 per cent Medicare policy that is the subject of this bill-it is worthwhile noting the success of the earlier bulk-billing initiative. The national bulkbilling rate at the end of the September 2004 quarter was 71.8 per cent. Since the Strengthening Medicare package was announced earlier this year it has risen by 5.3 percentage points, or eight per cent in relative terms. The national bulk-billing rate for Australians aged 65 years or older is even higher, with 82.1 per cent of all medical consultations in that category now being bulkbilled. In sum, in all states and territories the rate of bulk-billing continues to increase even before the introduction of 100 per cent Medicare in January 2005. The 100 per cent Medicare will deliver additional benefits to GPs. It will make medical consultations even more affordable for patients. In our health system, medical benefits are based on a fee determined for each medical service, which is the ‘schedule fee'. Until now the medical benefit paid for a GP consultation has been set at 85 per cent of the schedule fee. That percentage applies to all out-of-hospital medical benefits. From 1 January 2005 the MBS will pay a 100 per cent rebate for schedule fees for all GP visits in lieu of the 85 per cent figure that applied historically. In dollar terms this change means an additional payment of $2.10 for a short consultation, $4.60 for a normal consultation and up to $12.90 for extended consultations in excess of 40 minutes in duration. For a standard 15-minute consultation in a GP's surgery, the new Medicare rebate will be $30.85. Importantly, this very substantial increase in payments for a GP consultation will apply to all consultations. It does not matter whether or not the doctor bulk-bills the patient for a medical consultation. That is a very important point of distinction, both philosophically and in policy terms, between the government and Labor. The Labor alternative announced during the election campaign was to increase the rebate for GP consultations 100 per cent of the schedule fee, but only in circumstances where the consultation was bulk-billed. The government is committed to the independence of the doctor-patient relationship. Under this policy the choice of whether or not to bulk-bill would remain with the doctor. The increase in the rebate to 100 per cent of the schedule fee will apply to all medical consultations regardless of whether or not the doctor elects to bulk-bill the patient. If the doctor does bulk-bill, the doctor will ceive the additional payment of $4.60. If the consultation is not bulk-billed, the patient will derive the benefit of the additional money to reduce the out-of-pocket costs. This is a policy position that allows doctors and patients to concentrate on the essential task of providing and receiving quality health care, knowing that minimal costs will be incurred by the patient. The higher rebate for medical consultations will apply to consultations delivered in a doctor's surgery, the patient's home or in a residential aged care facility, and even to hospital tions involving non-admitted patients. It should be noted-and this is important-that this decision to increase the rebate to 100 per cent of the schedule fee in no way impacts on or detracts from other bulkbilling initiatives and incentives that I lined earlier. The Howard government's $5 and $7.50 bulk-billing incentives, introduced as part of the Strengthening Medicare package, will continue to be paid over and above the base schedule fees. In a similar vein, titlements under the Practice Incentives Program will not be impacted on by the 100 per cent Medicare initiative. As was pointed out, the 100 per cent Medicare initiative will cost $1.8 billion over four years. This is a commitment that can be made and a benefit that can be passed on to all Australians because this government has delivered such strong to economic growth and prosperity over a substantial period. It is a policy that will ensure that Australians have better access to medical services and that those services are more affordable. There are a number of other initiatives involved in the government's commitment to Strengthening Medicare, including Round the Clock Medicare, which funds a diversity of after-hours medical centres. One of the key elements of Round the Clock Medicare is its flexibility and its capacity to respond to redifferent circumstances and environments. Labor's alternative, Medicare After Hours, relies on just one model-GP clinics colocated with public hospitals. This is a onesize-fits-all model that is characteristic of Labor and does not optimally serve the provision of better health care in the community. On some occasions, hospital co-located afterhours clinics will be an appropriate solution, but often community needs can be better met by different solutions: clinics in the commuat nity, perhaps located close to public hospitals; private hospitals themselves; or dediconsulta- cated freestanding practices. The bill also rectifies a drafting error in the initial legislation that established the safety net. Australians incur a range of costs for medical services that extend beyond a GP visit: specialist consultations, pathology and outan ever-increasing array of radiology tests. Anyone who has experienced the costs associated with a serious accident or a complex long-term illness will know only too well how medical costs can quickly accumulate. enThe safety net is another example of the government acting speedily to provide assistance for Australians in these circumstances. This bill ensures that eligibility for the safety net at the $300 threshold will be confirmed for all families that are eligible for family tax benefit part A payments. A drafting error in the original bill meant that families who deferred their family tax benefit payments might have missed out on safety net eligibility at the lower threshold. This confirms their eligibility and gives the minister the power to determine that a registered family is an FTB A family for the purpose of the safety net $300 medical out-of-pocket cost threshold. As I said at the outset of my speech, after some vicissitudes in its attitudes towards Medicare the coalition has demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to Medicare and to ensuring that all Australians have improved access to affordable medical services. Strengthening Medicare and Round the Clock Medicare were important parts of that process; so too is the subject of the bill now before the House-100 per cent Medicare. The government can be rightly proud of its achievements across a broad spectrum of policies and programs, and health is one of these. This bill continues the government's commitment to providing all Australians with better access to, and more affordable, medical services. I commend the bill to the House.",95
177,Mr HARTSUYKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (100% Medicare Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. During the recent election campaign, the Leader of the Opposition made it very clear that the 9 October election was going to be a referendum on Medicare. I would have to say that, when the people voted, they were fully aware that it is, in fact, the coalition that is one of the greatest supporters of Medicare. They recognised the fact that it is the coalition that has done so much to ensure the affordability of and access to medical services for Australians. And they were sure that it was the Liberal-National coalition that was going to keep the economy strong so that this government could spend the necessary funds to provide appropriate medical services for the people of Australia. This government has always been focused bill on providing the very best services under Medicare. The Medicare Plus program provided for some $2.4 billion to be invested in ensuring the very best in medical care for Australians. The government provided measures such as the $7.50 payment in my electorate to provide an incentive for GPs to bulk-bill children under the age of 16 and health care card holders. Under Medicare Plus there was additional support for practice nurses to ensure that our GPs get the support they need to provide the very best in medical services. There were additional places to train more GPs. More graduate doctors were being funded. This government has been totally focused on ensuring that the medical service needs of this country are adequately met. We also introduced the comprehensive Medicare safety net to ensure that the government bore a substantial proportion of people's health costs once their expenditure reached a certain threshold. I will talk a little more on that later. This government has also provided for the rural health initiative, providing substantial investment-some $562 million in the 2000 budget-to ensure that people in regional and rural areas had adequate access to health care services and to ensure that our GPs working in those isolated areas were adequately supported so that they could provide the services that people need. In my electorate, we have a branch of the rural clinical school, a highly successful initiative aimed at training doctors in regional and rural areas on the basis that, when they conclude their training, they are more likely to stay in those regional and rural areas. I have talked to some of the students and they have certainly indicated their intention that, when their training is done, they would like to practise in those areas. This government is highly aware that the shortage of GPs and the work force issues are major impediments to providing services in our more isolated areas and in regional areas. What was Labor's response to the health care needs of this nation? Quite remarkably, they came up with an unaffordable concept called Medicare Gold-offering a pot of gold at the end of the health care rainbow. On 9 October, the people totally rejected Medicare Gold. The people of Australia knew that it could not be provided. The people of Australia knew that the services as promised would not be delivered. The people of Australia knew that, for the provision of health care, it was inappropriate to discriminate purely on the basis of chronological age. I am pleased to see that the people of Australia supported this government on 9 October and supported the fact that this government supports Medicare. Part of the package that this government put forward is the subject of this bill we are debating today-increasing the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the schedule fee for GP services. Through this measure, the government is investing more than $1.7 billion over four years to make GP services more affordable for all Australians. The passage of this bill will be a real test the opposition. They have been very much a party of obstruction, a party keen to work not towards the best interests of Australia but towards obstructing those measures which this government wants to put forward for the improvement of this country. Under this bill patients will benefit substantially. They will benefit substantially because the fees payable to a GP will rise from $26.25 to $30.85-an increase of some $4.60. But this measure does not just benefit those patients who are attending a doctor who bulk-bills. Through a higher rebate, the legislation provides an increased incentive for doctors to bulk-bill but, for those doctors who do not bulk-bill, the patient will be required to pay a smaller gap because the amount reimbursed by the government is increased. The second measure under this bill relates to eligibility for the Medicare safety net. The extended Medicare safety net covers 80 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for medical services provided outside hospital once the annual threshold is met. The government wants to ensure that all families who are eligible for FTB part A are eligible for the extended safety net at the lower $300 threshold. This amendment will allow FTB A family groups, such as families who elect to defer all of their FTB A fortnightly instalment payments or families who do not receive any FTB A because of an obligation to repay a debt to the Commonwealth, to fall within the definition of the FTB A family for the purposes of the safety net. This amendment will allow the Minister for Health and Ageing to determine that additional families such as these are FTB A families who are eligible for the lower safety net threshold even though they are not in receipt of an instalment or lump sum payment. The Minister for Health and Ageing is abfor solutely committed to Medicare. He has worked very hard to address the issues of work force shortage. He has worked very hard to ensure that Medicare is meeting the needs of Australians. In contrast, Labor put forward Medicare Gold-a strategy that was undeliverable and unaffordable. It was pie in the sky. Labor, as I said, wanted to discriminate against patients who were under a particular chronological age. Labor's strategies were focused on bulk-billing doctors; therefore they discriminated against those patients who attended surgeries where there was no bulk-billing, where the doctors chose not to bulk-bill particular patients. It was of great concern to me when, in the election campaign, the Leader of the Opposition admitted that he did not believe in a safety net; that Labor did not believe in a safety net; that Labor did not believe that those who were the sickest in the community, those who were the most needy because they had the highest levels of medical expenditure, were entitled to the protection that this safety provided. During the election campaign I was walking through a shopping centre at Toormina Gardens and an elderly couple came up to me. They were absolutely terrified that the opposition was going to take away the safety net. They were a couple who were not enjoying the best of health. They were a couple who were on a limited income and they were depending on the Medicare safety net to ensure their access to medical services and to ensure that they were able to afford the necessary out-of-pocket expenses that would be incurred due to the fact that they were both quite ill. The words of the opposition leader were absolutely frightening them. It is of great concern to me that many people in my electorate were very worried by the prospect that the safety net would be taken away. In fact, in the electorate of Cowper, some 5,000 people benefited from the Medicare safety net-5,000 people who would have had their benefits rejected if, on 9 October, the people of Australia had elected a Labor government. As I have said before, this government has been absolutely focused on the need to strengthen Medicare. The Labor Party have been focused on the fact that they do not support a safety net and that they do not support the very good measures that this government has introduced. This government is focused on the fact that the bulk-billing statistic is not the be-all and end-all of proper medical services. A particular number, the bulk-billing percentage, is not the measure of affordability of and access to medical services around the country. The bulk-billing percentage is not a measure of whether people in isolated areas have access to appropriate medical services. This government has put in place the sorts of measures that have strengthened Medicare. This government has put in place the sorts of measures that have provided imnet proved medical outcomes for people in isolated areas, in regional areas and in rural areas. This government has given GPs the support they need to provide the medical services for those people. This government has given GPs an added incentive to bulk-bill, as I have said, children under the age of 16 and health care card holders. This government has proven to be a friend of Medicare. The people of Australia recognised that on 9 October. I commend this bill to the House. NA",98
178,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.00 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Communications: Media Ownership",100
179,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (9.00 p.m.)Honourable members will be well aware of my long standing campaign in this House concerning the Howard government's agenda to further concentrate the ownership of traditional media in Australia, and the serious implications this holds for the public interest and for our precious democracy. We need to remain vigilant on this issue, particularly as the government will soon be able to ram through the Senate legislation that will water down one of the few remaining checks against further concentration of media ownership in Australia. Having just two major newspaper companies in our country is bad enough. If honourable members want an example of how this lowers standards, I refer them to two recent editions of the Australian newspaper. Last Saturday the paper carried a story by Christine Jackman and Cameron Stewart, entitled ‘Losing it', which purported to be a ‘definitive account' of how Mark Latham lost the 2004 federal election. It opened with a claim that during the federal election the Leader the Opposition cancelled a barbecue for families that was planned for the seat of ParJackman. ramatta and went elsewhere that day to make an announcement. The first point I make to the House tonight is that this claim is false. Further, I have spoken with a number of people from my electorate who attended the barbecue and who spoke with Mr Latham. Today's edition of the Australian carries letter of response from Mr Latham's office. This letter also proves the claim to be wrong on at least seven grounds: (1) the Leader of the Opposition attended the function as planned; (2) he was greeted by more than 200 guests; (3) he spoke to the crowd for more than 15 minutes about Labor's plan to ease the squeeze on families; (4) the Leader of the Opposition made his announcement there, and not elsewhere as claimed in the story; (5) more than 20 journalists attended the function; (6) radio news bulletins that day, and television news bulletins that night, carried coverage of Mr Latham being there; and (7) the Sun-Herald carried a report on the following day that said the announcement was ‘unveiled at a community barbecue at Wentworthville in the marginal Coalitionheld seat of Parramatta'. In other words, a simple check of the lic record would have prevented the mistake made by the journalists involved in last Saturday's article. And yet, operating in complete denial, the Australian today carries an editor's note still insisting that Mr Latham ditched the plan and failed to participate as scheduled. When a newspaper, presented with clear and publicly available evidence, cannot acknowledge that it has made a mistake, it demonstrates arrogance and a cavalier attitude to the need to uphold the basic standards of journalism. An even more remarkable demonstration of the quality of journalism involved in last Saturday's article is the fact that the Australian's editor-inof chief contacted at least one person-that I am aware of-asking them to speak with Ms So I ask the House tonight: do editors now act as booking agents? If Ms Jackman cannot secure interviews on her own, and produces slaphappy journalism that is riddled with errors and light on facts, how does she hold down her job? What on earth is going on at a the Australian? One thing is certain: further concentration of media ownership will not help. Australians deserve to have a wider choice and broader competition. That is in the public interest, and it is good for our democracy. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",100
180,Mrs HULL,ADJOURNMENT,"It is good news week, and today is good news day for me. Tonight I have much pleasure in indicating to the House that we have finally resolved the issue of Regional Express airlines and the problem of their relocation from gate 39 at terminal 2 of Sydney airport. What we have today is a great agreement and a wonderful outcome for a running issue we have all been very concerned about. We have a new Regional Express gate lounge, we have a new Regional Express lounge facility, pub- and Regional Express will stay at gate 39 until the building improvements are completed at their new lounge at gate 47. The chairman of Regional Express, Lim Kim Hi, and the co-chairman, Lee Thian Soo, welcome this great news, because it has been an issue for their airline. I congratulate Max Moore-Wilton, Rod Gilmour and the entire team at Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd for their cooperation with Regional Express for the benefit of rural communities. My good friend Geoff Bruest, Jim Davis and the great team at Regional Express have worked tirelessly on this issue to ensure that regional commuters are able to get access to quality facilities that will ensure that the gateway to rural and regional New South Wales and other areas can be upheld and sustained. I would again like to give my enormous personal thanks to John Anderson's office. They have been magnificent in their commitment to a successful resolution for Regional Express. Again and again, the Deputy Prime Minister; his chief of staff, Peter Langhorne; and his aviation adviser, Peter Marchi, rallied to ensure that regional commuters and Regional Express airlines would be provided with facilities that are befitting this growing and successful airline. Mr Speaker, you will recall only too well that it was only two years ago that you and I had many conversations on the demise of Ansett and the demise of Kendall Airlines, which had been running in and out of our electorates. We had no airline operating right throughout regional areas. In fact, many of our areas would have had a very dire future had it not been for the commitment of the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, to ensuring that we would access regional services. As a consequence, we had an enormous amount of trial and effort but everyone stayed true to the few airlines that were combined to ultimately get Regional Express into the skies. I must at this time pay tribute again to one of the former operators in Regional Express, Michael Jones, who had the tenacity, the integrity and I guess the belligerence to ensure that this airline got up and running and offering services. I would like to congratulate the board of Regional Express for their commitment to ensuring that regional commuters have the quality, varied and continuing service that they provide. They have certainly proven themselves. They have now moved into profit after only two years of operation. Their profits are extending into the millions of dollars now and their passenger numbers are extending into the millions as well. I am very proud of this airline. This airline is based in Wagga Wagga. It employs about 120 people in Wagga Wagga. It makes a large contribution to the entire community and to the entire electorate. It is with great pleasure and relief that I congratulate Sydney Airport Corporation, Regional Express and the Deputy Prime Minister's office for again showing true commitment to ensuring that Australians in rural and regional New South Wales have facilities that are second to none and to ensuring that they are guaranteed a service which they can be proud of and which can continue to grow into the future. Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to give these congratulations in the House on the evening of a very successful negotiation between this airline, Sydney Airport Corporation and the Deputy Prime Minister's office. Electorate of Blaxland: Donovan, Ms Casey",101
181,Mr HATTON,ADJOURNMENT,"Blaxland) (9.09 p.m.)Touchdown! It is a touchdown for the Speaker because he has been elected to an august office in this House. He is a person who has served the parliament for a long period of time and someone who has been selected by his peers to fill a significant place within this parliament. It is a touchdown for a person who yesterday gave his first speech in this House, the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull. I congratulated him at the end of that speech-a significant one, I thought. The only regret I have is that he is not on our side of the House rather than the coalition side. His story is the story of a lot of Australians: ple who started with virtually nothing, who worked very hard and used their abilities and talents to achieve as much as was possible for them. I salute him for what he has achieved personally in that regard and for the fact that he has chosen to use his abilities his talents in this parliament. I simply regret that he is not one of ours but one of theirs. Mr Speaker, we have been friends since I came into this parliament in 1996. My knowledge of you was increased when you led a delegation of parliamentarians from both sides of the House to South America. I deeply appreciate the way in which you led that delegation. It was indicative of the fact that you will be able to operate as Speaker of this House in a bipartisan way, which will add to the reputation of the House but also to the way in which the House operates. But it is a touchdown not only for the member for Wannon and for the member for Wentworth but, more importantly for me as the member for Bankstown, this is a touchdown for Casey Donovan, Australian idol. Bankstown properly should be renamed Caseytown as a result of what happened very recently. Mr Ripoll-Shameless.",102
182,Mr HATTON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is entirely shameless but entirely right. Casey Donovan is a 16year-old kid. It is a long time ago but I can remember what it was like to be 16. I can remember what it was like to be pilloried throughout most of my life because I was not the Australian average in terms of size. I can remember what it was like to be different. I can remember what it was like to not completely fit in. But I can also remember what it was like to, despite all of that, win the acceptance of my peers in a leadership position. For me, the first instance was as captain of De La Salle College Bankstown at the age of 16. I can remember what it was like to be peotrusted over people who were more gifted in other areas-athletic ones and so on. They put a kid in that people would not normally have thought of. But what Casey Donovan has done, as a young person of 16 years of age-a person and mature beyond those 16 years-under incredible pressure but using her native talent, has been to show not just Bankstown but the world as well that talent can win through. She has shown that if you accept what you have and what you have been given and you develop that and you school it and, in the best instances of education, you bring it out of yourself and you do not have a fear of simply being yourself and expressing thatas the members for Wannon and Wentworth, and others, have done in this place-you can conquer and you can do well. Very few of the people who initially looked at it realised what an absolute phenomenon the Australian Idol program would become. I knew from the last time, when Paulini-who was also from Bankstowncame in fourth, that this was a significant social phenomenon in Australia. But I also knew that in Bankstown, Bankstown City Council, together with the state education department, put money and effort and time into TAP, the Talent Advancement Program, for all of those children in public schools in Bankstown who were willing to try to tap the best of their abilities. First time up in a national competition, Paulini came fourth. Second time up, against all of the odds, Casey Donovan beat someone who was extremely gifted, the young Mr Callea from Melbourne and the electorate of Lalor. For someone who established their naturalness and humanity, who simply expressed themselves as fully as possible and who allied that to a brilliant singing talent, Bankstown should be renamed Caseytown. For Casey Donovan and for Bankstown it is an absolute touchdown that she was able to touch the lives and the hearts of people across Australia. (Time expired) Regional Services: Program Funding",103
183,Mr HARTSUYKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I understand that today Tamworth businessman Mr Greg Maguire released a statement in which he categorically rejected as untrue further statements made yesterday by Independent New England MP Tony Windsor under parliamentary privilege in relation to an alleged phone call between Mr Maguire and Mr Windsor, supposedly concerning the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. The statement went on: In parliament, Mr Windsor alleged that Mr Maguire told him in a phone call a few days 20 September 2004 that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson, had made a phone call to Mr Maguire. Mr Windsor alleged that the message conveyed in that call was, “Get your mate to pull back; this is bigger than all of us.” Mr Maguire had no phone call with Mr Windsor in which he made any such statement as now alleged by Mr Windsor concerning the deputy prime minister, Mr Anderson … Further, neither in September 2004, nor at any time, did Mr Anderson convey any such message as is now alleged by Mr Windsor to Mr Maguire. Mr Maguire also said that at no stage did Mr Anderson or anyone else on behalf of the government convey to Mr Maguire that funding for the Australian Equine and Livestock Centre was subject to or dependent on political strings or any other appropriate conditions. On the contrary, Mr Anderson made it abundantly clear that the funding for the centre at the federal level was dependent on the project being supported on its merits. The New South Wales state government approach on this matter was the same. I am concerned that recently we have seen the member for New England using parliamentary privilege not to promote the interests of the electorate of order. I think the honourable member for Cowper may be adversely reflecting on a member of this House. There are forms of the House in which he can prosecute such statements. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, contrary to the position put by the Chief Opposition Whip, so far in my observation and hearing the member for Cowper has done no such thing.",104
184,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I call the member for Cowper, and I am sure he is mindful of the standing orders.",104
185,Mr HARTSUYKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr after Speaker. My concern is that perhaps parliamentary privilege is being used not to advance the interests of the electorate, not to advance the interests of the constituents, but for personal purposes. This to me is of great concern. I think in this House all members, despite our political differences of order. Clearly, the honourable member for Cowper wants to suggest that the actions of the honourable member for New England were motivated by personal reasons, not out of concern for his electorate or the needs of his electorate. If that is his belief, there are forms of the House which he can use to prosecute such an argument, but the adjournment is not one of them.",104

187,Mr HARTSUYKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I think that all of us as members of this House need to cultivate those relationships that will best benefit our constituents, and it is my concern that recent statements have not achieved that end-they have not advanced the interests of the people of New England. Today we had a number of questions on this issue, and one was about an invitation. Rather than using question time to obtain more information about issues relating to the equine centre and the furthering of that project, questions were raised about whether a particular individual was invited to a particular function. One would have to ask whether those types of questions, in the very valuable forum that is question time, are in the best interests of our country and the best interests of the people within the electorate of the member concerned. I ask: as members of parliament, how are we best placed to further the interests of our electorate? I believe it by working cooperatively, using the forum of this House to work together and achieve real outcomes for our constituents.

188,Ms KING,ADJOURNMENT,"This being my first opportunity to speak in the House, can I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your elevation to the chair. Sharing an electorate boundary with you and also having represented part of your seat previously, I am sure that the people of Stawell, Avoca and the towns of Glenorchy, Marnoo, Navarre and fabulous Waubra will be justifiably proud of you. The subject of my adjournment speech tonight will be of little surprise to members of this House. This week marks the 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade. In 1854, anyone wishing to mine on the goldfields in Victoria was required to pay a licence fee every three months. Many miners queued up in the early days to pay the fee, expecting improvements to roads and health and education facilities. These improvements were not forthcoming. The licence fee was considered by many as unfair, as it fell upon everyone regardless of their ability to pay or the amount of gold they did or did not find. The issue of taxation without the basic democratic right of representation led to a number of meetings of miners, where concerns were expressed about licence fees and the policing of the licence fees. The most significant of these meetings was the meeting of the Ballarat Reform League on 11 November and the ‘monster meeting' at Bakery Hill on 29 November 1854, where over a third of the Ballarat population gathered. The Ballarat Reform League had as part of their demands full and fair representais tion, manhood suffrage, no property qualifications for members of the legislative council, payment of members and short duration of parliament-things we take for granted as part of our democracy today. The diggers then marched from Bakery Hill to the area chosen to establish the Eureka Stockade. Tensions came to a head in a pre-dawn raid on 3 December 1854, with police and soldiers joining forces. At least 16 nations were represented at Eureka, with 28 people dying and a number of others unaccounted for. A century ago, Mark Twain visited Australia and said of Eureka: It was a revolution-small in size; but great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for a principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. It was the Barons and John, over again; it was Hampden and Ship-Money; it was Concord and Lexington; small beginnings, all of them, but all of them great in political results, all of them epoch-making. It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle. Eureka is not owned by any one political party or political cause. I am an avid student of history and its importance, and as the member for Ballarat I proudly highlight Eureka-and would do so regardless of which political party I was from. Eureka is a great national story that deserves greater national recognition. I was encouraged to see the leader of the Victorian opposition, Robert Doyle, in Ballarat alongside the Leader of the Victorian Nationals and the Premier of Victoria last Friday. The Leader of the Opposition and I were the only representatives of the federal parliament, as the Prime Minster had declined an invitation and sent no representative. In today's Age, Gerard Henderson has written a terrific piece that argues there is a tradition in the Liberal Party supportive of the Eureka legend that deserves a hearing. He argues convincingly that the Liberal Party is missing the point of the Eureka commemorations and should be proud to claim this national story as part of the Liberal tion, just as Labor does. I live in hope. Ballarat has put on a magnificent display this week, with events continuing until Sunday. I want to congratulate all involved. I could not have been prouder of the way in which the event is being commemorated by the local Ballarat community. In the few remaining minutes I would like to take the opportunity to note the passing this morning of Alan ‘Beau' Williams at the age of 93. Beau was a great stalwart of the Ballarat labour movement. He was a boilermaker by trade, who as a teenager commenced his apprenticeship at the Ballarat railways and worked there for over 20 years. Beau earned his nickname from the hat he used to wear while splitting wood in the Enfield forest with his friends. I am told the hat resembled the hat worn in the then popular newly released film Beau Jess. He earned the nickname in his 40s and it stuck for life. Beau served as Secretary of the Ballarat Trades and Labour Council from 1956 to 1975, a time of enormous tension within Victoria and certainly in Ballarat, at the heart of the split between the ALP and the DLP. He presided over many heated debates, splitting the chamber between the Left and the Right at the Ballarat Trades and Labour Council. The debates were particularly heated over the issue of conscription. Beau stood as a federal Labor candidate in the 1960s. I was proud to present Beau with a Centenary Medal in 2002. He was tireless in his efforts to represent working people in my district. Ballarat is a better place for you having been with us. Vale Beau Williams. Frost, Dame Phyllis",105
189,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.24 p.m.)-I would like to commend to the House the memory of a tradigreat Australian, Dame Phyllis Frost, who died recently. Dame Phyllis was one of the few people in our community who became famous for the best of reasons: for taking the role of a professional beggar for thankless causes, most notably the plight of women prisoners in Victoria. Born into a Croydon family in 1917, Dame Phyllis lived in that community all her life. Her Presbyterian parents instilled in her and her sisters the ethos of charity to the less well off. During the Depression her parents helped to feed and clothe, in their front parlour, those unfortunately devastated from their local township. Phyllis Frost became involved in prison reform when an acquaintance was incarcerated for a minor crime in the 1940s. Shocked into action by the degrading conditions that prisoners have endured since the 19th century, she lobbied to change and improve policies towards women prisoners. She studied criminology and, in 1953, she established the Victorian Women's Prisons Council, for many years assisting women as they served sentences. She served as the chair of this organisation for some 46 years. Phyllis Frost was also involved in around 47 mainly charitable committees and organisations, and helped raise millions of dollars for charity. In 2000 the Victorian government honoured her achievements with women prisoners by renaming the Deer Park Metropolitan Women's Correctional Centre to the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre. The centre, with its humanising design, was the apex of her policy drive and is a model for other states. Survived by her three daughters, five grandchildren and three great-grandsons, Dame Phyllis Frost was tireless, obstinate, frank, mischievous and a real achiever with real legacies. She was, in short, a great Australian. Many here would remember her daughter, Pauline Osmond, who served previous Speakers of the House of Representatives with great professionalism. Our thoughts are especially with her daughter, Pauline, tonight. Question agreed to.
