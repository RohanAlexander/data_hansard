2,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,"For some time now, the you President and I have been considering future administrative arrangements for parliament in the context of increasing mands for services at a time of budgetary restraint. After reviewing comments from the heads of the five parliamentary departments, we have decided to implement a management structure based on the two chamber departthis ments. The functions of the present three joint departments-that is, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Joint House Department-will be merged into the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate. This two-chamber department structure is the best way of achieving a dynamic and responsive organisation which will allow parliament to make significant savings while improving the services provided to senators, members and committees. The President and I know that we will the full and professional support of all staff meeting the objectives of greater efficiency and effectiveness in the parliament's operthe ations. We have asked the departmental heads to provide us by Tuesday, 18 March with implementation plan for the transition to the new structure. I will advise the House as as practicable after that.",13
3,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADMINISTRATION,"Watson) (9.32 a.m.)On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I have to say behalf of the opposition that we find this not an acceptable way of dealing with this matter. To just announce at 9.30, after half an hour's notice to the opposition, that you intend dramatically change the way the parliamentservices ary departments work here is just not good enough. Government members-Oh! Mr LEO MCLEA Y-Members on the other side might say, 'No, no, no,' but obviously once they have spent more than 12 months in this place they might start to realise that the smartest thing for them to do is not let the ERe decide what will happen in this parliament. Indeed, what they might decide to do-and what I would suggest, Mr Speaker, might decide to do-is have a little read the about what the now government when in the opposition said about what were far less dedramatic changes that previous Presiding Officers wanted to make in this place. If just by fiat of the Presiding Officers we are going to see the whole nature of the way parliament has worked for at least the last 50 years change so dramatically, that is not good enough. If your stewardship of the job of being the head of the House of Representatives is to see a short consultation with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as the way to do this, I must say to you, Sir, that that is not the way these things have been done in the past and not the way they should be done now. If we are going to change the way this parliament operates, all members on both sides should be taken into your confithe dence about how that is going to happen. You have come in here and made a short statement about merging the administration of the three service departments. I do not know have how you are going to merge it because my in recollection of how one needs to do that is maybe we have to have legislation to abolish three departments because there is legislation that makes it necessary to do that. What is going to happen to the people who an run those departments? What is going to happen to the structure of those departments? soon Is the Joint House Department going to end up going into the Department of the Senate or into the Department of the House of Repreon sentatives? Are the Library and Hansard going to go into the House of Representatives or the Senate? What is going to be the outcome for services to members and senators if to the Library goes into the Senate? Are the going to be directed according to the more rapacious manner in which the Senate manages to accrue assets to itself to the detriment of the House of Representatives? Presiding Officers on both sides in this place, and members, have spoken in the past about how it is interesting that the Senate manages to have somewhat the same appropriation as the House of Representatives when there are twice as many people here.",13
4,Mr CADMAN,ADMINISTRATION,"More. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-More, my colleague says. So, if we are going to have the service departments run by the Senate department, what effect is that going to have on the members of this House? You cannot just come in here and read a short statement at the beginning of a nonbroadcast day and say, 'That is it.' You cannot do that. You might smile and say, 'I've just done it and the government's got the numbers and we'll do it,' but, if you have any due regard for the rights of members here-and you have said on a number of occasions that you see your responsibility as being the person who reflects the rights of members-you need to take members into your confidence. You need to come in here and make a more lengthy statement to this parliament rather than just say, 'We are going to absorb the administration of the joint departments.' You need to tell us how you are going to do that and you need to at least canvass these ideas before saying-what was it?-it will be in two weeks time. We have not even seen a copy of the statement you have just made. In two weeks time, or something, this is going to happen. In the past when governments and Presiding Officers have looked to get efficiencies out the parliamentary departments, they have canvassed these things widely. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and I, for instance, put forward a private member's bill here some time ago. The government has not even given that time for debate. In the past, Speaker Child brought in legislation to this House which was canvassed, debated widely and then rejected by the Senate. We had widespread debate on that, but all of a sudden now you want to stampede us into agreeing to something in a few weeks time. The short statement you have made here is just a most unacceptable way of dealing with what are going to be the most dramatic changes to the administration of this parliament since the 1930s. It beggars belief that we should be expected to say, 'Terrific, go ahead and do it.' The opposition believes that there are ways of getting economies of scale out of the parliamentary departments. We said that while in government and we have said that while in opposition. But we think that members on both sides-and members of the government-should not just see this as something that they should be stampeded into. You are the people who will suffer from this. The people who will suffer most from this are members of parliament. Sometimes in debates in this House we have to consider ourselves to be members of parliament, not division cannon fodder for the government or division cannon fodder for the opposition. If being a member of parliament means anything it means having at least some control over what happens in this House and what services are provided to members of this House. Quite frankly, as a member of the House of Representatives, I would not be happy to see the Senate department have absolute control over the manner in which services are provided to members of the House of Representatives. What will happen Â·with the division of responsibilities between the two chambers? What will happen when there are-as you know and as a former Presiding Officer I know-the regular disputes, which do occur, between the two houses? What will happen when the Senate decides, as it normally does, of that there is a standard for them and a standard for others? If you divide the assets of the joint departments between the two chamber departments you will find that the appropriation of the Senate will grow fourfold. It also gets down to accountability. The Senate department has a standing Appropriations and Staffing Committee where opposition and government senators sit down with the President and tell the President how the President will spend the money appropriated to the Senate department. Quite frankly, as a member of the House of Representatives, I find it interesting that a group of senators will sit down and decide how they will spend money which in fact will provide services for members of the House of Representatives. Mr Speaker, I did not hear in your paper that you are going to take us into your confidence and set up the same sort of thing for the House of Representatives-I bet you are not. When I was the Speaker. I resisted doing that, my colleague the member for Cunningham resisted doing that and former speakers resisted doing that. But we are going to allow senators to decide what will happen to services provided to members. If the break up of the departments is such that Hansard and the Library go to the Senate, what you will see is senators deciding what happens to services that both government and opposition back bench members have to do their jobs. I must say in a cynical fashion that those of us who have been here for more than five minutes-with all due respect to my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), who saw the light and left the Senate and came here-know that the Senate will look after itself to the detriment of people here. There are a huge number of issues that we as members of parliament, not as members of the opposition or members of the government, should consider before this is done. Mr Speaker, you have the job of representing us. You are the person in the scheme of things whose job it is, if there is an occasion when the Speaker should be worried as previous speakers were that the Speaker's job in the Commons was to talk on behalf of the members of the Commons to the king, to not be stampeded by the ERC but to take us into your confidence about what the government wants to do with the parliamentary departments and seek our concurrence. You need to do that. If you do not do that you will havein fact not fulfilled your responsibilities as person whose job it is to represent the views of this House. I think if members of parliament in this House find that they do not have some say or some control over the services that are provided, particularly the all important services such as the research service and the Hansard service, and they are going to be run by the Senate department then that is just not acceptable. The whole reason the joint departments arose was so that you got, first, some economies of scale with expanding technology and, second, the Presiding Officers from both chambers were able to have some input into the way those services were delivered. If the President and Mr Evans are going to run some services that are provided here we will not have that input any more. You have not told us what power you will have on behalf of this House to ensure that those services are delivered. These are issues that need to be widely debated. These are issues that members on both sides need to get a full understanding of. They are not issues that we should deal with at half past nine in the morning with a one-page statement. They are not issues for which we say consultation is a short talk to the Leader of the Opposition one day and the next day come in here and do this. If that is the way you see the job of the Speaker in representing this House to the government then I think you have lost the plot, Mr Speaker. I say that in all seriousness because this will be one of the most important changes in the way this House works to have occurred in the last 50 or 60 years. There may be good and cogent reasons for this to happen. There may be different models from that of just absorbing a couple of acts of parliament-I do not know how you absorb a couple of acts of parliament, but somehow you and the President have found a way to absorb a couple of acts of parliament. This needs far more debate. It at least needs the same debate that we had when previous Presiding Officers considered smaller changes. Mr Speaker, we may not be able to do anything in this House because the government members may be willing to be stampeded into the what the government wants to do, but we will certainly have a lot to do and say about this when it gets to the Senate. Mr Speaker, if you and the President want to get some movement on this issue then far more widespread discussion might ensure that there is some movement in the Senate. At present I can say fairly clearly that our point of view is that there will not be any movement. There certainly will not be movement in the next couple of weeks if that is what you think. This is a profound change to the way the House of Representatives and the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will work; and because it is such a profound change it is something that you do not do at half past nine on a Wednesday morning on a non-broadcast day after a short discussion with the Leader of the Opposition. We want far more discussion of this. We have proposals to put to you and the government-if the government is driving this, and I am sure it is-about how this system ought to work. There are models such as the one put forward by previous Presiding Officers. There are models like the New Zealand model with a parliamentary commission where members on both sides sit with the Presiding Officers and have some say in how their house will work. Most certainly, Mr Speaker, you would be letting down this House if you went through with this proposal in the way you have briefly spoken about today. The proposal ensures that members of this House have fewer rights than members of the other house will have. Under this plan that you have put forward here we most certainly will have fewer rights. Neither government nor opposition members will have a chance to say to you what we think about how the services that are provided in this building work, but senators will. I would imagine that one of the first problems Madam President is going to have if she made the same sort of speech in the Senate 15 minutes ago is that the first thing the senators will say is, 'Has this been to the Appropriations and Staffing Committee?' They seem to think that they ought to be consulted about everything that moves over there. That might be rightly so, but I think it is a bit rich they will get that say and we will not. Your duty, Mr Speaker, is to ensure that we get that say; to ensure that this House is not stampeded into something in a few weeks time which will be to the detriment of the institution of the House of Representatives. If this goes ahead quickly like this it will be to the detriment of this institution. I have spent 18 years of my life here; I originally came to this place thinking it was pretty stuffy and probably ought to be blown up. Mr Speaker, you have achieved that objective in that short time. What you are going to do is blow it up. If what happens is as you have just said to us, then we are really in a position where members have had no say in what happens to what is the pre-eminent house of parliament in this country-the House of Representatives. You will hand over control of services to the Senate and if a serious altercation between the houses of parliament occurs this House may not be the pre-eminent house. Because governments of the day are unlikely to have a majority in the Senate in the foreseeable future-as they have not for the past 20 odd years-there is always the chance that that will happen. The Senate thought about that and, as you are probably aware, Mr Speaker, in recent years have ensured that, if the House of Representatives Presiding Officers ever decided that they wanted to restrict things for the Senate, the Senate had a whole range of things they could do themselves. They had their own printing operation over there long before this House did. They had a self-contained operation which would ensure that the Senate maintained its independence. Absorbing these things into the chamber departments, as you say, will, I believe, impinge on some of the independence that the House of Representatives has. You might say that I am wrong. You might be right; I might be right. But that certainly is a matter that should be debated and looked at when we know all the facts. A one-page statement at half past nine on a Wednesday morning allows no one to know the facts. That is not doing your duty on behalf of all of us. I do not say that in a nasty fashion. You have that done your job as the Speaker of this House very well. y:ou have been willing to say to the government that you think some things should be done differently. I am not trying to set you up in conflict with the government, but the government should understand this. Indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had numerous arguments with me and my colleagues who were Presiding Officers in the past about how this House ought to run, and he has been here longer than most of us have-since 1974. Someone who has been here for over 20 years and professes a great love for this institution should indeed take us into his confidence about how he wants to change it. This is a disgraceful way of doing this. I am sure it is not being done deliberately by you but by pressures from elsewhere. You and Madam President should resist these pressures at least long enough for everybody to understand what we are talking about. If the government then wants to come in here and do the opposition and Independents over on a point of view that we have, at least we will know what we are arguing about. At least we will know where you stand. At present we do not know any of this. I would seriously say to you, Mr Speaker, that you should find some way of saying that this was an advisory notice you have given us here this morning and that you as the Speaker will ensure that you will advise members widely and that there will be a debate on this. I know when my colleague the member for Cunningham wanted to change the way the parliamentary departments worked, he circulated members widely; I know when I wanted to, I circulated members widely; I know when Speaker Child wanted to, she circulated members widely. I must admit that at one stage I did think of an ambush, of coming in here earlier and saying, 'I've done it.' Even I thought that was a bit rich; so that says something, doesn't it? Mr Speaker, I would hate to think that you have picked up even the worse traits that I ever had. Maybe you have gone up in my estimation-I do not know. I would seriously say to you that you cannot change the way the parliament works by stealth, and I know that you are not wanting to do that. But the reality is you are changing the parliament by stealth and you are doing it without consulting in any meaningful way with members. I do not know, you may have had consultation with the government. But the only consultation that I know of on this side is a short conversation with Leader of the Opposition and with no-one else. I think you need to do far more than that. I can see that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran), who is at the table, has not even seen this statement, and I thought the minister had seen every thingalthough one probably would not give anything to the National Party because they cannot read unless there are pictures on it. Mr Speaker, I would hope that you might say that what you have just done here now is to bring this to our attention, that you will be circulating us before the end of the week with what these proposals are and that there will be an opportunity for some considerable debate. If the government wants to do this quicker, then you should put this squarely in their court. The Prime Minister can be asked what his view of this is. If his view is that he wants to change the House of Representatives by 9.30 fiat, then we find that fascinating. We had some changes that we thought we ought to make to the constitution about whether Australia becomes a republic or whether you ought to do things like this, and the Prime Minister said, 'We've got to have national, wonderful, incredible debate'-and that is right. But if we are going to change the way the House of Representatives in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia works, then that surely is worth a little bit of debate because in the scheme of things that is just as important. If this House is going to find that all of a sudden its rights and its modus operandi with the other house change dramatically-and this will change it dramatically-then that is something all members should be very much concerned about. If this means that the Senate President will have unfettered power to do certain things which could impinge on the way this House works, then you, sir, have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen. If the role of the Speaker means anything in protecting the rights of members, then you have an obligation to do provide that protection. We all have an obligation of understanding what you want to do and how far we want to participate in that. I found and my colthe leagues found that the only way that you were ever going to seriously get some change here was if you tried to get everybody into your confidence. I can say to you, Mr Speaker, and you can tell the President that you do not get to change things that easy in the Senate. We might find ourselves in the interesting position this time of taking the speeches that were made by the government and repeating them back to them in that chamber. If it was not right in the past to do this after long and involved consultation, it is certainly not right to do it in an ambush like this. Mr Speaker, I would ask you on behalf of the opposition to reconsider your position. would ask you to take all memberstation, government and non-government-of this parliament into account in making any these changes. While we have such a large number of new members on both sides, it is even more important, and incumbent upon you, to ensure that they understand what happened. This is not something that should happen in response to some decision that ERe has made. If the government believes that the parliaunfair. ment matters that little, then I think that sad commentary on what the government does. If the Prime Minister, who has stood up in this House year in and year out and talked about the importance of this House, thinks that to change all this by ambush is the way to do it, then my view of him as a parliamenAlbanese. tarian has significantly changed. The one thing that I have always had for John Howhim. ard-I might not have liked the things that he said or did-is a lot of respect for the view Watson. that he often took in here as a parliamentarian. If the Prime Minister is a parliamentarer-and Ian of any regard and if he has any love of the way this House works, then the governhave ment should ensure that there is far more discussion and that everybody understands just what we are doing.",14
5,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"My comparliament-I ments will be briefer than the almost 30 minutes taken by the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). I consider his comments the premature and unfair-premature because we wish to extend to the Speaker the courtesy awaiting details of the proposal before comme menting on its merits. It seems to me, looking at the statement by the Speaker, that the member for Watson is right that the government had no prior notice of this statement. It is not a government conspiracy, as you alluded to at different times, and is certainly not involving the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) least of all. This is a proper initiative by the Speaker. The Speaker concludes by saying that he will 'advise the House as soon as practicable'. The point is he will involve the House. We have full confidence in the Speaker's preparI edness to consult. But, on the issue of consulalways remember that you will never gamer a unanimity of view from this chamof ber-there are so many different points of view as to sitting hours, to the conduct of standing orders and the like. The Speaker, as is rightly the case, has the final decision. has Some of those decisions may be hard or otherwise as he seeks to meet his objective, the as he says in his statement, of 'increasing demands for services at a time of budgetary restraint'. The member for Grayndler has been He has employed-I appreciate that a is a number of points he made were very fair, reasonable and legitimateMr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not want the minister to continue to malign my colleague Mr He would not like to be called me and I do not think it suits me to be called",18
6,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,I thank the member for,18
7,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"Forgive me, Mr Speakthe member for Watson; Grayndler was a former seat of yours. I do believe you been unfair because the Speaker, as you rightly pointed out, has a commitment to this parliament equal to yours, mine or anyone else's in this parliament. To accuse him of blowing up the parliament or ambushing appreciate that it may have been the emotion of the moment-is to highly exaggerate the position. His commitment to institution of the parliament is unchallenged, undoubted and certainly as strong as of that of the member for Watson. It seems to that the Speaker has rightly embarked on a course of proper management, examining the business operation of the parliament as we would expect of him as parliamentarians and the public at large. Mr Barry Jones-When did you hear about it?",18
8,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"Neither I nor the government had any prior knowledge of the content of this announcement. That is proof positive this is an initiative by the Speaker. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the minister categorically telling this House that neither he nor the government has heard of any of these proposals before? And be very careful.",19
9,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,This is not question time. You may like to put that to the Leader of the House. Mr Leo MCLeay-So you just told us a fib.,19
10,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"Mr Speaker, I ask the member for Watson to withdraw that accusation.",19
11,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,"The honourable member for Watson knows the conventions of the House. The last thing we need on such an important topic as this is inflammatory language. I do ask you to reflect on your words and withdraw. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw that the minister is a fibber. But the minister has just said the government knew nothing about this when the truth is that this is driven by the government. He might not know it, but they certainly do.",19
12,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,The honourable member for Watson will resume his seat.,19
13,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"Mr Speaker, I require an unqualified withdrawal pursuant to standing orders.",19
14,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,I think you had it. There are no qualifications on the withdrawal from the honourable member for Watson.,19
15,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"Mr Speaker, can we clarify this. Is this an unqualified withdrawal or not?",19
16,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,"Yes, it is.",19
17,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"Let me repeat: the government had no notice of the Speaker's statement. So, for all of yourMr Leo MCLeay-Are you qualifying it now?",19
18,Mr MCGAURAN,ADMINISTRATION,"No, that is exactly what I said a few minutes ago. So, for all of your grandstanding, for all of your pretence about a love of the parliament-you have been rabbiting on for 30 minutes, making the one point ad nauseam time and time again in the most repetitive fashion, which is that the Speaker needs to consult, which he is going to do and always had every intention of doing-you are revealed as just trying to make some cheap political points. You are not the protector of the parliament as you make out to be.",19
19,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"I do not think anybody in this place is frightened of change. Certainly from this side of the parliament, as my colleague the member for Watson (Mr Leo Mcleay) has clearly demonstrated, on previous occasions it has been the Labor Party, when in government, that has sought to bring about some change in the way in which this parliament is managed. Both you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President, as part of the way in which our parliamentary arrangements currently operate, have very important responsibilities in that respect. The member for Watson alluded to the fact that on previous occasions Speaker Child, himself as Mr Speaker, and me as the Speaker in the last parliament endeavoured to bring before this place legislative changes which would bring efficiencies to the way in which the parliament operates. I do not think anyone disputes that that is necessary. I do not think anyone disputes that there is duplication. There are five government departments on the hill that look after the affairs of state with the parliament. Within each of those five departments there are separate human resources areas and separate pay areas-a whole range of areas where there is duplication. Behind driving change under previous Presiding Officers has been the desire to ensure that efficiencies were there, that it delivered some savings but that those savings would go back into ensuring that in no way was the opportunity for members and senators to carry out their responsibilities diminished. I think this is a paramount issue in this debate. The member for Watson has rightly talked about apparent disparities between the Senate and the House of Representatives and fears that he genuinely holds about the Senate driving the House of Representatives. We need to get an unequivocal assurance, Mr Speaker, not only from yourself, as the guardian of all of our concerns here in the premier parliament of Australia, but also from the government on this matter. Make no mistake about it, there is a very clear nexus between the parliamentary departments and the government. What the government wants at the end of the day the government will achieve, because the government allocates the funds for parliamentary departments. The concern we have is to ensure that any efficiencies which you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President drive in getting rational approaches to the delivery of services in this place do not diminish the ability of us as parliamentarians to do our job. There is a lot going on in Australia at the minute, there is a lot going on in the parliament and there is a lot of debate raging at the present time about members of parliament. There is a debate about entitlements and about what we do as members of parliament. It is all well and good out there for public mythology to believe that most of us do not do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, that we are all out there with our snouts in the trough and dipping into the public purse. I refute that. Most members of parliament certainly take the opportunity, whenever they are talking to schools or to the public, to refute that. Most members of parliament that I know work, on average, 70 to 80 hours a week. They do a long, hard and arduous task on behalf of their constituents, not for any self-gratification that they may get. I will always defend members of parliament right across the chambers on that very point. Therefore, I do not want to see any of these issues associated with making efficiencies in the operation of the parliamentary departments being driven by perhaps polling, or perceptions that the government has, that in some way this is going to make members of parliament look different in the eyes of the electorate at large. Our opportunities to work on behalf of our constituents, and more broadly the people of Australia, cannot be diminished in that respect. Also, as a former presiding officer, I know . the difficulties that you are faced with in running your department. I know, for example, that in the last election campaign the present government went to the people of Australia promising that there was going to be a $10 million cut imposed on the five parliamentary departments if they were elected to office. They saw some efficiencies that were required there, but they did not know what it meant. They simply said you were going to have to cut back on the amount of money which you expended in those departments. In the case of the Department of the House of Representatives there was a $2 million cut required of them. I have to say, in one of the more selfless tasks I have ever seen, a senior public servant in an SES band was given responsibility by the Clerk of this department to examine how those savings might be achieved. At the end of the day, in a great act of selflessness, he actually recommended that his position be eliminated-and it was, and he left. The department saved an enormous amount just in one SES salary. He also recommended changes which the Clerk had to put in place-at great personal heartburn to himself because, as a departmental head, he had responsibility for ensuring that the services to the department and to the parliament were not undermined to any great extent and, of course, he had a great feeling for the people who worked in the place. The abilities of our parliament here and the House of Representatives committee structure, and so on, had to be examined. So we now see smaller secretariats looking after a couple of parliamentary committees in the one hit. They have had to say, 'We can't do extensive examinations ,of issues because we haven't got the staff or the resources, we haven't got the travel budgets, and so on, to enable members of parliament to conduct their business as it should be done.' This is one of the sad reflections of what happened. We know that the ERC is continuing to look at the process of driving efficiencies across all government departments, and the parliamentary departments, in no way, are going to be left out of that. It is all well and good for my good friend and colleague the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) to stand up in here and say that this has all been driven by the President and the Speaker and that the government knew nothing about it. I have to say this, Mr Speaker. You achieved one thing which I never did as the Speaker, my colleague the member for Watson never did, and I do not think Speaker Child or Speaker Jenkins ever did. You actually got, with Madam President, to the ERC to argue a case on behalf of the parliamentary departments. I understand you had that opportunity last Thursday, if my information is correct, and I congratulate you for We used to have to rely on the Minister for Finance to go into an ERC and argue for parliamentary departments' appropriations. That is not exactly a great recommendation because all Ministers for Finance are looking for cuts, not necessarily looking for support for those particular departments. But you have been there and have been given an opportunity to argue the case on behalf of the members you represent in this chamber. Do not forget, you have been elected, Mr Speaker, to represent the members' interests in this place. That is what the Speaker's position is all about. You have obviously been there with Madam President and she has put some points of view as far as the Senate is concerned and as far as the other parliamentary departments are concerned. When I put a question to you earlier this week-and you might reflect on this as well-about whether or not you felt you might achieve some more success in some of the discussions that were ongoing about improvements to the parliament and how the services of members and senators and the parliamentary departments more generally could be delivered, I suggested that you might have a little better success with the Senate if any of these changes required legislation. At the time you indicated to me that there was a possibility of some consultative group being established and I put a supplementary question to you about whether the opposition would be involved in that and you indicated that it would be. I thought that was a great suggestion. It took a few people by surprise because I do not think anybody really knew that was on the go. We thought that was great because we thought, on our side at least, that, if the changes that we had tried to make in previous parliaments were going to be achieved, then clearly we would have a role to play and we could have some negotiations and put a point of view. As my friend the member for Watson said, he and I, and those on this side of the parliament, have tried to do much of this in the past but have always got knocked over in the Senate. If you have been able to achieve some that. radical change in creating just two departments out of five, then clearly you seem to have some indication from government that they are going to support that. It seems to me that that means the senators have been put on board because it was coalition senators who knocked off the last three proposals in this regard. The member for Aston (Mr Nugent) is sitting up the back. He is one of the true believers of parliamentary reform. In the parliament before last, the member for Watson, as Speaker, asked the member for Aston, an opposition member, to chair an inquiry into the way in which we wanted to see some changes brought into the operation of the parliament so that efficiencies could be achieved, parliamentary departments could be collapsed down and some recommendations could be made as to how that might actually work for the betterment of this place. Mr Leo MCLeay-Consultation.",19
20,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"Consultation was the hallmark of the report which was brought down. Interestingly, there was a minority report as part of it. That minority report was brought down on behalf of coalition senators and also, I seem to remember, a Democrats senator-who is no longer with us-who were got to by people on the other side of the building. Dare I say that it was the Clerk-I shouldn't, but it probably was-who convinced them that this was the start of all evilness, that this was the start of the evil empire where there was going to be only one parliamentary department and that any influence that he might have in the operation of the parliament may in fact be dissipated if in fact he did not get a say. He convinced the coalition senators about this and, of course, they refused to deal with it over there. At that time, the Leader of the Opposition was weak enough to say, 'Well, all right, I'm not going to take my own senators on about this.' I think it is fair to say that the member for Aston, the member for Watson and I-because it fell on me to implement the recommendations that flowed from the member for Aston's report-actually brought a bill before this parliament to effect some of that change. It got through this House with no dramas at all. The government had the numbers and we were right. But it got over to the Senate, and there it lay. My colleague and former President of the Senate at the time, Senator Sibraa, no matter how many discussions he had with Greens senators, Democrats senators, Independent senators and, dare I say, even coalition senators, could not get them to budge to even get it on the Notice Paper for consideration in that chamber at the time. So it lapsed with the passage of time and with the lapsing of the parliament. Then, early last year, I brought in a private member's bill which sought to bring about three parliamentary departments from the five, and it sat on the Notice Paper. The government refused to give it priority to be brought on for debate. Yet now, as my colleague the member for Watson has remarked, here we have it on a Wednesday morning. You have come into the parliament and made a onepage statement about how you believe this matter is to be resolved, that there will be a new structure that will be in place and that, by Tuesday, 18 March, your departmental heads will tell you how you can get the transition to that structure. I would read into that I hope I am right on this-that that report will come before you saying how the implementation might work in a practical sense. I am not sure of this. I would hope that, at some stage, as has been suggested, that can be addressed. The practical mechanism is one element, but we have to consider how it can be achieved when you have acts of parliament, which have established the five parliamentary departments on . this hill, that need to be amended to get down to the two departments that you are proposing. As I said, I do not have a great problem with change. I do not think that I will have, necessarily, a great problem with what has been proposed to get two departments. As long as the House of Representatives has certainly equal, if not a little stronger, influence on the way in which this might work in a practical sense, that is going to be fine. Originally, as I said, I put a proposal forward that had a third department, which, with the Department of the Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Joint House Department in one, provided the physical services, parliamentary information and so on. I thought that was a reasonable opportunity, but I am not dissuaded from what is being proposed. I just wonder, in part of the broader consideration of this, whether maybe we need to do what the member for Watson suggested; that is, have a bit more time for reflection and consultation about the methodology of this. We would like to know if legislative change is necessary. I think it probably will be. I think it has to be. You cannot just get rid of statutory departments by saying, 'We're going to amalgamate these' and just leave it up in the air. You have people such as parliamentary librarians and secretaries of joint house departments and the departments themselves, which are actually created as departments of state, already there. So if you are eliminating those, you must have legislative change to bring that about. We would like to know what that is all about. But, in terms of the broader overarching control of this, the member for Watson alluded to New Zealand's parliamentary experience. I would also commend to you the board of management concept in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the UK. From my recollection of the way that works, it was effective in as much as you had people from both sides of the parliament contributing as part of that. You also had the opportunity for things like some of the existing committees to continue to operate. One of the other practical elements of the implementation of this runs to the committee structure which is in place to oversight the way some of these departments presently work. The Joint House Committee, for example, the Library Committee, and I think there was a PISO committee, too, which was operating for a period, certainly in an advisory sense to the Presiding Officers. We would want to know whether there will still be an opportunity for people of the parliament-that is, the members themselves-to contribute in that sense to the way in which these departmental committees are run. My friend here the member for Lalor e Mr Barry Jones), for example, has been a great contributor to the parliamentary Library Committee over a long period. I think on both sides of the parliament it would be recognised that if the opportunity was not taken to use his great ability for contribution in that sense, if that was eliminated as part of this overall structure proposal, that would be a very sad thing for the parliament. The board of management concept in the UK parliament probably still gives us the opportunity to keep those departmental committees going and to provide an opportunity for the members of parliament still to contribute to the way they want their own parliament to run. It is all well and good for our friends in ERC to talk about bottom-line figures and how we are going to get cost savings and so on. Given that I have suggested and tried to implement some of these myself, I am not averse to that I say that to the Leader of the House e Mr Reith). I have talked to him about this in the past and suggested to him that if he wanted to achieve some of these savings the easiest way would have been to bring on my private member's bill last year to give it a bit of a run to see how it would go. You would have gone down to three departments and some rationalisation and savings would have been made. But this will go a bit further. Our basic concern, of course, as has been expressed by the member for Watson, is the consultative process involved in this so that the members themselves have ownership of the end pro-uct. It is a simple fact of management that If you can get the participants in the process-and the Leader of the House as the Minister for Industrial Relations would know something about this now-to eventually have ownership of the outcome then it is a much easier concept to sell. We would certainly want an opportunity to participate in looking at how the implementation of this is going to work. Mr Speaker, as I and the member for Watson have said, you have achieved something which it would seem we have been unable to do in previous parliaments. That shows a little more of the resolve of the government of the day to give some assistance to that. But what we do not want to see is this being driven by ERC concerns for bottom line figures. As the member for Watson rightly said, it was all well and good for first-time members of parliament, who were in here earlier after the statement was read, to start to heckle a little bit when we expressed some reservations about this. It is all well and good for those who have been here for five minutes to think 'This is great! Our government is doing something terrific,' and all the rest of it. What they should think about is their responsibilities in representing the people of Australia in this place and having the facilities to be able the to do that. We do not want to see that diminished. When they are here a bit longer, they will suddenly realise that that is the case. Mr Speaker, you are in the difficult position of trying to find that $2 million savings here in the House of Representatives, let alone in the other departments that you and Madam President have joint responsibility for. But when you get down to nitpicking things like reducing down to one a day the newspaper allocation for backbenchers in this place, then this is cause for concern. My colleague the member for Watson reminds me that, whilst you have taken that decision to reduce our allocation down to one newspaper, the senators get three. Mr Barry Jones-Plus the press clippings.",21
21,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"Yes, as I am reminded by the member for Lalor, the political clippings that come out on a daily basis also go to senators as well. It is a fact mation drives us all. The decisions we make are based on receiving appropriate information. One way to do it, whether or not we like the tenor of some of the stories-I will not go into some of the ones in the IIIawarra Mercury today-is to go to the information base and you will see that that still provides us with the basis of much of what helps shape our opinions and what we subsequently determine to vote on. I wrap up my contribution, and I am sorry that I have delayed the House a little longer than I had anticipated, by simply making a few points. We think that there is a need for more consultation-I try to say it in very much a bipartisan, apolitical way-for the parliament. We think there is a need for more consultation so that you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President can take the parliamentthat is, the House of Representatives and the Senate-into your own confidence on this matter so that we have a fuIIer understanding of what is intended here. We do not have a philosophical problem about making changes, and we are not opposed to change. My record and the record of the member for Watson stand on this; we have tried to achieve this ourselves. So we are not opposed to it, but we want that consultation process. We want to see what it means for members and senators. We want to ensure that we have that opportunity to make that contribution. We do not, however, want to see you and Madam President being driven by bottom line ERe considerations. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has always said that he believed the parliament was paramount; he believed the parliament was the chart maker of the destiny of this country. What we do not want to see is some smaII collection of ministers driven by people concerned with bottom lines and deficits and all the rest of it-although that is very important, and we do not dispute that. But if you are going to make savings by amalgamations of departments, then surely you can stilI contribute to the government's bottom line deficit reduction strategy and at the same time not continue a slash and burn policy within the parliamentary departments and the other of life that infor- departments. We as members have to be able to service our constituencies. We have to be able to service more broadly the people of Australia. As I have said before, if you look at the history of the way in which parliamentary committees and the House of Representatives have been effective conduits of information to governments and how governments have acted on that, you will see that you do not reduce those resources-you use them more fully. I say to the two ministers who are at the table here today: reports that the member for Lalor has brought down, reports of people like the former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch, when he was chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, reports of the committee which I had the great pleasure to chair on Finance, Banking and Public Administration, which the Sergeant-at-Arms was secretary to at one stage, and reports of other members in this place have, over time, made a contribution to the government of this country and to improvements in the lifestyles of the people of this country. To eliminate those opportunities, to just snaffle out any of the creativeness that comes from members of parliament operating in those sorts of forums, is short-sighted-very short-sighted. We should not be driven by ERC considerations. We would like to think that your statement today is flagging a statement of intent. We on our side would like to think that Mr Barry Jones-It's the beginning of the process.",24
22,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"That it is the beginning of the process, that consultation is going to occur with all members of this place. We would like to think that the government wilI facilitate that. We would like to think that what you have suggested here-that on 18 March you will be given an opportunity to receive from departmental heads an implementation plan on how this might work-will form the second tranche of this consultation process. We would like to think that you will bring it to the parliament and do what was suggested in your statement to me in answer to a question: form a committee with people from both sides-I am sure that you will get cooperation from our side of the parliamentto look at what has been proposed so that the objectives of both achieving efficiencies in the way this place operates and eliminating duplication are accomplished at the same time as not having a negative impact on the way in which members and senators can perform their rightful, elected duties to the people of Australia. If you can achieve that tripartite objective, then you have done well. We will give you full support on that, but we want that consultation. The member for Aston (Mr Nugent) can give you a bit of advice if you call him in. He has been involved in this. He is about to give you some advice when I sit down. I welcome that contribution as well. It is important that we do not lose sight of the paramount importance of this chamber. The member for Watson said that it is the most important chamber of all parliaments in Australia. He is dead right-it is. We have a duty and you, Mr Speaker, have a duty as the head of this chamber and as the head of your department to ensure that that supremacy, that paramount nature of this parliament, is upheld at every opportunity. We want further consultation. It is our right as members of parliament to have that further consultation, and we hope it occurs.",24
23,Mr NUGENT,ADMINISTRATION,"I would like to say to the previous speaker that, given the testimonial he afforded me during his comments, I am sure he will accept my statement that I had no prior knowledge that this was coming up this morning. I came out of a committee meeting, went back to my office, looked up at the television screen and said to myself words to the effect of, 'What on earth is that all about?' I listened a bit then came down. I do have a significant interest in this particular matter for the sorts of reasons that were alluded to. However, I do have to correct one thing in particular that the previous speaker mentioned: I do not think, when I became chair of that committee three or four or five years ago, that I was appointed by the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), who was then the Speaker. The committee was set up under his tutelage and, certainly, it was set up with a majority of non-government members. I think I was actually nominated by the then opposition; the opposition whip may have had something to do with that particular activity. But I was chair of that committee. It had a majority of non-government members, it deliberated for some length of time and it made certain recommendations in terms of mergers of some of the departments. It had a specifically limited brief, which was not as broad as the proposals that I understand you are bringing into the House now. Nevertheless, it certainly came out with a majority recommendation that there should be mergers. There was a minority report from three senators: two from the coalition and one from the Democrats. Subsequently, the matter stalled on its way through, as we have already heard. It seemed to me that, as we went through the assessment of merging the departments, there were a great number of benefits to be achieved through such a merger. At that time we were looking paiticularly at merging the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff-Hansard. We were not looking at the Joint House Department at that stage, although options had been looked at previously. It seemed to me there were considerable advantages in what we were going to do. We identified some specific dollar savings and, at that time, we got an assurance from the then government that those savings would be ploughed back into the parliament for further development of services for senators and members. That, of course, was a major attraction about the process. In terms of supporting the principle of and rationalisation or mergers, such as your statement has put before the chamber today, there are a couple of things that need to be said. Obviously, the statement you have provided us with is fairly broad and I will await with great interest the details of how you intend to achieve the objectives you have laid before us. But it seems to me that, in looking at what you are proposing to do, there is a very important question of balance. Historically, the Senate has been the chamber that has jealously guarded its rights, its entitlements and so on. I am sure that I do not need to remind you but, for the record, I will say that I think it is important that the House of Representatives makes sure that, in any new arrangement, it is appropriately structured and supported in any joint arrangement. This is the chamber where governments are formed and this is the chamber the Prime Minister comes from. This chamber needs to ensure that it is adequately and properly supported in every sense of the word. That is something that you will have a heavy responsibility for in terms of the plans that will be brought forward. I am interested to see, Mr Speaker, that you are suggesting the merger of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Library-and, for the benefit of those in the gallery, the Library is not just a collection of books: it is also a major research service which, in many ways, is a more important function than just the collection of booksand the Joint House Department, which looks after all of the housekeeping and maintenance of the building. The practicalities of merging those and putting them under the control of the two chamber departments, the Senate and the House of Representatives, will present some unique challenges. I await with great interest the clear ingenuity that will obviously be needed to achieve success in that because you are talking about common services being split in some shape or form to provide separate services to senators and to members of the House of Representatives. Whilst I do not see too many problems in terms of the mechanics of splitting some elements, such as the reporting staff and maybe the library, when it comes to matters of security, building maintenance and so on there will be a necessity for some standardisation between the two chambers, probably more in terms of taking away things that the Senate might hold unto itself. It will be an interesting set of negotiatime tions. Having said that, I think it is important that we do, from time to time, look at new structures. The structure for this parliament has been in place for many years and there is no doubt in my mind, from the previous exercise that I conducted as the chair of the committee that looked at merging some of those departments, that there are overwhelming reasons to rationalise, merge and restructure some of the departments in this building. A lot of those savings can be made purely and simply by doing away with some of the duplication of functions between departments, by streamlining administration and by not having to get duplicate sets of advice, duplicate sets of information and duplicate sets of consultants to advise different departments on different things. There is a lot of streamlining that will go on which will not only make dollar savings, which is obviously important in the current climate, but will also make efficiency savings and will help the chambers run more effectively. So, in principle, Mr Speaker, I am a great supporter of what you are trying to do. I echo the comments of the previous speaker that both he and the member for Watson, as former occupants of your chair, tried to tread this route. They are to be commended for that; but they were unsuccessful. If you have found a way of going down that route more successfully, that is to your credit. I look forward to the details of the plan. I would just like to make the point on which I think the previous speaker and I-and I am sure most members of this chamberwould have common ground. Although dollar savings are important and although efficiencies are important the paramount thing that you-and I am sure that you are aware of this-and those responsible for implementing the detail of such a plan need to bear in mind is ultimately the service of the members. These days we all understand that being a member of this chamber is a very hard, professional, full-time job. Increasingly, because of the demands and the public scrutiny, and because of the frequent calls on your in a whole range of areas, you do need comprehensive support in this place. It is important that the quality and quantity of that support for members is not diminished in any way although, obviously, savings and efficiencies can be made. I conclude, Mr Speaker, by saying that I commend your initiative. I wish you luck in steering the matter through. I know that all members of this chamber would wish to be informed and hopefully participate in some of the further detail. I await the detail with interest and I look forward to the parliament making a major step forward when it is able to achieve efficiencies and rationalisations of this nature.",25
24,Mr MCMULLAN,ADMINISTRATION,"This statement raises a large number of questions, many of which I would like to have the opportunity to traverse today but the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has requested, not unreasonably, that I constrain my remarks and I will therefore not traverse any of the matters raised so extensively by my colleagues the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I want to raise essentially new matters having had a few concerns, particularly in my capacity as the member for Canberra. Having had the opportunity to serve both in the Senate and here I can see some of these issues perhaps from a different perspective from some of my colleagues. What concerns me is that while from before I came to the parliament, certainly from the day I arrived, I thought the five-department structure was absurd, on the face of it, Mr Speaker, I have to say that you seem to have come up with an equally absurd proposal-but I hope when the detail emerges that does not prove to be the case. I am sure you have thought it through and there will be some indication of how what looks on the face of it to be not an adequate alternative will develop to be so. I merely endorse the remarks made by my colleagues about the need for a fuller explanation and an opportunity for consultation. One of the two phrases in the statement that caught my attention and surprised me was the phrase 'we have decided' rather than 'we are putting forward a proposition that' or 'we would like the House and the Senate to consider the following proposal'. But that has been adequately traversed by others. The other phrase is 'make significant savings'. I have been here for nine years and I have been in public political life for 20 years; and I know what that code means. It means that the over 1,000 people who work in this building are in serious trouble. Their job security is under serious threat. That is what it means. I am concerned that you have announced here today 'we have decided' and I wonder what consultation there has been with those people who work in this building and with their representatives, the trade unions which represent them in this place. Many of these people live in my electorate and the electorates of my colleagues the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) and the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel)-and also of course the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Nairn). I am sure they would share my concern that we have here a proposition that will dramatically affect immediately not only the security, confidence and optimism but in the very short term perhaps also the jobs of a large number of Australians, not in most cases highly paid. They will go into a labour market here in the ACT in the south-east New South Wales region that is severely depressed and is correctly described by Access Economics as in recession. So I am very worried about what is proposed and its implications for those people. I am particularly concerned-and not having had the chance to speak to you, Mr Speaker, I do not want to assume thisbecause, as on the face of it the government did not know about it and the opposition did not know about it, it seems to me highly unlikely that there has been opportunity for consultation with those 1,000 people most directly affected. It is their jobs that are so politely affected by these code words 'make significant savings'. Everybody knows what it means. It is a serious intent. We do have to take care of the taxpayers' money. We cannot simply go on running duplication and having five departments doing what a smaller number can do but these are Australians with the right to have their interests considered when major changes are made that affect their capacity to earn their income and where they face the prospect, if they cannot retain their existing employment, of being thrown onto a labour market already thrust into recession by previous decisions. T have not spoken about the complex questions of the parliamentary implications of this. I feel strongly about it and I would want to participate in the discussion about it. I think the small number of us who have served in both houses can contribute something to that from an interesting perspective. But that has been discussed at length and we are unduly taking time to duplicate it. I simply wanted to add to the concerns properly raised by the three previous speakers my concern about the prospects and consequences of these changes and the process of their implementation for the over 1,000 people who work in this building.",27
25,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,I thank the honourable member for Canberra.,28
26,Mr REITH,ADMINISTRATION,"Whilst I appreciate that this is on indulgence, after discussions with the opposition I think the proposition is that I will close the debate as best I can but that there will be further discussions informally on the matter during the day. I should say that my initial reaction is to say that you have shown a firm direction for some changes to the supportive administrative arrangements for the parliament and I would think there would be a lot of support for your initiative in terms of reforms to those administrative arrangements. I think that was well put by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) when he made the point that some of these issues have been the subject of a lot of discussion over many years and in a sense you have taken the bull by the horns and come in this morning with a very clear proposed framework for reform to be undertaken. There is, of course, much merit in this particular proposition, but I confine my remarks to the most generalised sense as there have been a number of reform options developed over the years-and I speak ad lib and without an opportunity to prepare in any detail. The House of Commons, I think, went for a sort of megaservice department and two-lower house and upper house-departments, but that was a scheme that did not work. There are other Commonwealth parliaments that provide a steer as to the effectiveness of administrative arrangements, and the one that you have proposed I know from my past reading on this is certainly a viable option and would have much merit to it. Obviously that has been a factor you have taken into account in putting the proposition. I do, however, accept the point which opposition members have made that it is important to provide people with real detail as to what lies behind this proposition because there are some very genuine areas of concern which people will have. The jobs issue, of course, is very important; the service to members is important, and there are other matters that go to the balance between the houses which I suspect will also be the subject of concern-and proper concern at that. It is sometimes difficult, in looking at possible restructures, to know whether you should proceed with a planning stage and not tell people what your end objective is or whether you should tell people what your end objective is and then get the details done in a much more transparent way. You have opted for the up-front transparent setting of the goal and a process to meet that goal. By having a relatively short timetable, I presume your intention is to minimise uncertainty in the minds of those who might be affected. I think uncertainty for people, particularly when it comes to jobs, is a real problem for people, most understandably, so I think that must lie behind what you have said. I must also say, Mr Speaker, that whilst we did receive a phone call this morning at approximately 9.20 that there would be a statement from you at 9.30, I was not aware of the contents of that statement except in the broadest terms of 'something to do with administration'. The fact that it was the announcement that it is was not known to me until I had completed my official duties at Government House at a meeting of the Executive Council and walked into this parliament at a quarter past ten or thereabouts. I do think it is important that there be some consultation on this. It is obviously a matter which affects every member. Ultimately these administrative arrangements can go to matters of great constitutional import as to the balance between the houses and the independence of the houses. There will be a lot of interest in this proposal. I do not propose to say any more than that, Mr Speaker, but, to reiterate my point, I do think that reform has been the subject of a lot of discussion over the years but has not really materialised. Certainly, with the President, you have taken a very firm lead. I think that will be generally welcomed, but it will also be important to the process that there be full and thorough consultation on the way in which the matter is now proceeded with.",28
27,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,"I thank the Leader of the House and all those who have participated in this unexpectedly long debate this morning. I thank you all for your contributions. Much of what has been covered will become clearer subsequent to 18 March. But be aware that the deliberations have been ongoing now for seven or eight months; it is not driven by the ERe. Shortly after we-that is, the President and I-took up our appointments on our election subsequent to the election last year, it became imperative that the basic organisation of the parliament needed to be reviewed. That has been an ongoing process. It has been deliberated on from within the parliament and without the parliament, and we have certainly taken cognisance of what has happened in the parliaments of Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand, among others. So this is, as acknowledged I think by the member for Cunningham and the member for Watson, perhaps the first shot in what will be an ongoing process. As further information comes to hand, there will be ample opportunity for consultation, not only amongst the members and senators themselves, but at all levels of the parliament. I thank you for your contributions. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 March, on motion by Mr Moore: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Crean moved by way of an amended amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House (1) rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill; and (2) calls on the Government to keep the ships bounty in place until the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement comes into force, recognising that arrangements entered into by Australian shipbuilders prior to the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement coming into force should be subject to the same transitional benefits as allowed for overseas shipbuilders under the agreement"".",29
28,Mr SA WFORD,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"As far as manufacturing industry is concerned in this country, this is a government without a skerrick of vision and a government without any commitment whatsoever to manufacturing industry. This is a government that sets no positive outcomes for manufacturing industry. Really it is pretty appalling when you sum up the government's total lack of empathy for and response to manufacturing industry. The whole trinity is actually missing. There is no rationale, there is no process, and there are no positive outcomes. The government has gone missing, the minister has gone missing and, particularly, the backbench has gone missing. This is a government that has dumped on manufacturing industry and simply walked away from their responsibilities. What greater evidence could you submit to support those propositions than the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996? This is a government made up of the same mind-set as the Fraser government which squandered opportunities for economic and employment growth from 1976 to 1983. This is a government that has learned precious little from the history of the past 50 years. A simple examination of any DECD country from the 1950s tells us that the gap between gross national product and employment is pretty much on a par. But today there is a huge gap, when you look at the graphs, between GNP and the levels of employment. Albeit brief, any analysis of the last 50 years clearly shows following trends in industry. Firstly, capital investment in real terms has quadrupled. Secondly, energy consumption has tripled and manufacturing output has tripled. But the real catch is that employment has only grown by one-third. The developed world has created a chronic and endemic employment problem of around 10 per cent and growing, whatever governments do with their figures. Current economic orthodoxies will not solve the problem. Rather, they entrench unemployment at the unacceptable present levels. Traditional industries such as textiles and iron, steel and metals processing are all declining in employment, whilst electronics, telecommunications, information technology and biotechnology are growing, but not to the extent to take up the labour surplus. We know the microelectronic industry has spawned whole new industries, but it has also, in a very frightening way, reduced the need for labour throughout the world. Throughout the industrialised world we are substituting capital, energy and increased output for human labour which is in surplus. Traditional economic growth is no longer accompanied by a commensurate increase in the number of jobs. When it comes to the manufacturing industry, this government is simply not a player. It cannot cut the mustard; it is just not in the game. This government has forced the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to opt out of manufacturing industry. This government has forced the minister to basically wash his hands of, and walk away from, manufacturing industry. It is much worse than that. As the shadow minister for has often pointed out in this House, it not just the axing of the bounties contained in this legislation which betrays the manufacturers of this country. There are also cuts in research and development, significant scaling back of the DIFF scheme, huge cuts to the export market development grants scheme, cuts to Austrade and cuts to AusIndustry. All up, that is about a $4 billion belt around the ears for manufacturing industry over the next four years. That cut of around $4 billion by way of industry support the over four years is in the Howard government's first budget. No wonder the manufacturers in this country are a little shell-shocked and under siege from this government. These decisions are driven by an ideological frenzy that fiscal consolidation will solve this nation's problems. It will not. Of course it will not. What will happen will be a loss of economic growth, a loss of jobs and a loss of exports. The signals are very clear. The quarry mentality is back. Value added, manufacturing producing jobs earning dollars from exports cannot get a look in. When the coalition was last in government the number of manufacturing jobs in Australia dropped by eight per cent in one year. This happened in their last year in government. Now it will happen in the first four years, their first years in government. In the past the coalition did not understand manufacturing industry, and they do not understand it now. By contrast, under Labor, manufacturing industry exports grew by a whopping 405 per cent. The No.1 idea of the new government's policy for business and manufacturing is that the government should get out of the way. The government want no role in business or manufacturing and they appointed a can-do nothing minister to achieve exactly that. The cabinet has frozen out this minister so that he is so perfunctory that his brain seems to be in deep freeze mode. The government wants to eliminate what it calls 'business welfare'. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has stood up in this parliament and called those manufacturers who have claimed the R&D tax concession 'tax rorters' on more than one occasion. In fact, he seems to take special pleasure in the tax rorters claim. Research and development is cut. A survey of 125 large and medium sized companies revealed that, as a direct result of the decision to cut R&D tax concessions, 34 per cent of companies were considering moving their R&D operations offshore, 57 per cent would reduce their research and development, and many more will now import the technology rather than conduct their own research and development. What a recipe for disaster. This bill axes four industry bounties despite promises to the contrary during the election campaign. It terminates the ships, books, machine tools and robotics bounties. A couple of months ago I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) whether he would refer to his cabinet unemployment committee the impact of the abolition of the book bounty on companies like Griffin Press in Adelaide, where 140 fulland part-time workers were given redundancy notices. It has to be said that he basically avoided giving a real answer in stating that the decisions cannot be disaggregated. The book and publishing industry were operating on the understanding that the bounty would continue until the end of 1997. In fact, contracts, which in this industry operate from periods of up to five years, were entered into on that basis. This government has compromised the ability of this industry to make sensible business decisions. Printing and publishing firms estimate that around 50 per cent of the 2,600 jobs in the industry could be at risk and lost. This is an industry that the book bounty encouraged to increase exports by over 200 per cent. Its premature abolition threatens export earnings, 1,300 jobs and 1,300 families. Opportunities for young Australians are diminished and, basically, it is just a kick in the teeth to printing and the publishing industry. The abolition of the ships bounty just defies common sense. The government wants to cut the five per cent support for Australian shipbuilders of vessels, nearly all of which are exported. In the eight years since Labor introduced the bounty, the Australian shipbuilding industry has grown dramatically. It is a world leader in high-speed catamaran production. Production is up by 200 per cent. Exports are up by 150 per cent. Employment is up by 50 per cent. You would have thought that that is a very good recipe for growth, progress and jobs. But the government's response is to give it a belt around the ears. At five per cent support, Australia could more than compete with Norway, with a subsidy of 13.2 per cent, with Denmark, at 13 per cent, and with Italy, up to 25 per cent. But they cannot compete at zero per cent. Has the government taken into account the fact that the so-called OECD agreement to end shipbuilding subsidies by the end of 1998 will not go ahead now because the USA will not sign up to it? Consistency certainly is no hallmark of this government. The government continued to support the ships capital grants scheme by funding $23 million to help companies like Shell and BHP import ships made in Holland, but it will not help Australian shipbuilders. For a saving of a measly $9 million to the budget, the abolition of the ships bounty cost one company $225 million in lost contracts. The company suffers. The employees suffer. The nation suffers. In addition to the abolition of the book and shipbuilding bounties, the government has terminated the machine tools and robotics bounties and will abolish the computer bounty on 1 July next year. That the computer bounty abolition is to be delayed raises some very interesting possibilities. Is it not the case that the minister has considerable interest in companies that claim the computer bounty? But the impact from this legislation is far greater than books, shipbuilding, machine tools, robotics and computers. It sends a chilling reminder to manufacturing industry, the steel industry-and we are setting up a the steel committee-the car industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the plastics industry, the automotive supplier industry, and you could go on and on, that this government simply does not seem to give a damn about them. It is going to hang them out to dry and simply let the market rip. The signals are clear from this legislation that not only will existing manufacturing industry be affected-the ones that improved exports by over 400 per cent under Labor and which secured economic and employment growth directly assisting the battling families this government so fraudulently purports to represent-but it has been a complete vacuum, an empty void, as to what the future holds for industry policy. Where is the government providing leadership to the future enhancement of job growth? Take a simple move to solar energy: that would create jobs. The production of solar collectors for space and water heating includes glass or plastic for the covers, copper, aluminium and steel for the frames and absorber plates, and fibreglass, rigid foam or the wool stockpile for the insulation. All of these are established industries, many working below capacity. The occupations include sheet metal workers, carpenters, plumbers, pipe fitters and construction workers, many working in regional areas. Simply raising the goal of the current five to six per cent of homes with solar heating to 25 per cent-and this has been done in a study by the Australia New Zealand Solar Society-would create 25,000 jobs nationwide, without importing anything. Solar potential in this country remains largely unfulfilled. Incentives are required not only for research and development but also for the manufacturing and marketing on a large scale to make it cost efficient. This country has the potential to be the world leader in and a major exporter of manufactured solar thermal technology. Take another area, weatherisation-energy efficient housing. For every $1 million spent in that area, you get 80 jobs. Again, Australia has the potential to be a world leader. What about public infrastructure? In this country you just want to pull your hair out at the idiocy of transport policies from state and federal governments over the last 30 or 40 years. A German study shows that, when you spend $1 billion on road construction, you create around 10,000 to 14,000 jobs. But if you spent that same $1 billion on heavy rail, you get 22,000 jobs-and we are talking about permanent jobs. If you spend it on light rail, you get 23,000 jobs for the same expenditure-around double the jobs you would get for anything on road construction. Every year in Australia the cost-'subsidy' is. more correct-for road transport is well in excess of $10 billion. In fact, I think it is more like double that. That is $5 billion we spend on the actual road building and maintenance and $5 billion on the result of road trauma, and goodness knows how much on compensation claims and associated legal costs. Little thought appears to be given to the size of this subsidy for road transport. A country rail line loses $20 million or $30 million and everybody goes feral in this country, but they never apply the same rules to the building of roads. Subsidies for light and heavy rail, as we all know, are not so kindly treated. That does not make sense. It is dumb. It is stupid. A balance is required between all forms of transport. Unlike road building, which imports the road making and the road maintenance equipment and the majority of vehicles that travel upon roads, investment development in heavy and light rail could be 100 per cent Australianmaterials, design, manufactured, marketed, exported. We live in an area of the world where many cities in South-East Asia have enormous urban transport problems. Enormous potential exists for the export of cost efficient urban transport systems in our region. I think the Hong Kong light rail system was planned and marketed in Melbourne. It is not only Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide; it is Taipei, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, et cetera. The fundamental role of any economy is to provide jobs. That is the role of government, and governments around the world are just running away from that responsibility. They replace public good with private good. They replace moral good with a principle of user pays. The second principle is that there be a fair distribution of income among its citizens. For that to occur, governments need to lead. They need to be proactive. They need not to opt out of their responsibilities because they do not have the guts to raise the necessary revenue to meet the expectations of citizens. There is a belief around the Western world that corporations and business will deliver full employment. What absolute rot! How can people think so stupidly? It is the role of government that will look after families. Why would a corporation-a big business or a small business-take on the responsibility of the citizens of a country? That is just absolute nonsense. Why would they? Of course, they would not. They do not have the long-term responsibility for stability in families that governments have. Governments-this government and governments in other parts of the developed worldare moving away at a rate of knots from the commitments and the social contracts that governments should have with battling workers. This legislation is yet another example of the abandonment of public good and the moral contract governments should have with their citizens. It is interesting to note that the leaders government and the leaders of industry around the world in the 1950s and 1960s went through school in the 1930s and the Depression. Many of these people, highly skilled people, waited sometimes three or four years before they got a job. They went through the Second World War, the Korean War and the Cold War, but they believed in the responsibility and were acutely aware of unemployment. Today, the leaders of government, our own generation, and the leaders of business have come from an era of full employment due to the efforts of that previous generation. The sensitivity and the edge for jobs is simply not here. It is something we need to rediscover. It is something that this government should rediscover. If it does rediscover this, then government may have the courage to lead. We might then have ministers on the front bench over there who have the courage to lead. If the government cannot do that and if governments around the world cannot follow their own advice and do not get out of the way, electorates in this country and many other countries in the developed world will very quickly change government in the next 10 years, because the expectations of their citizens are high. So they should be. If governments walk away from their responsibilities, as shown in the Bounty Amendment Bill 1996, they will act at the ballot box far more quickly than people imagine.",29
29,Mr OCONNOR,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Corio) (11.09 a.m.)The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 now before the House gives effect to yet another broken promise made by the Howard government before the 1996 election. It joins the long list of broken promises made to Australian industry at that election. This legislation violates the mandate that was given to the Howard government at that election. In the first Howard government budget we have seen the withdrawal of over $3.9 billion in industry assistance over a four-year period. That is in violation of the explicit commitments made to Australian industry in the leadup to that election. For example, the governof ment gave an express and explicit commitment to maintain the research and development taxation concession to Australian industry at 150 per cent. In its budget it announced that it had slashed it to 125 per cent. It gave an express commitment to maintain export incentive programs, and in the budget they slashed them mercilessly. With regard to the bounty schemes relating to books, computers, machine tools and robots, and ships, which are the subject of this legislation, the promises given to manufacturers in these industries have been broken as well. What makes the ahead of schedule termination of the bounty schemes significant is simply the specific nature of the impact of the budget decision-specific in the sense that the impact is on easily identifiable industries and the manufacturing firms and on regional communities. When the government slashed the R&D concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent the impact of that decision was felt by many firms in manufacturing industry. A similar impact has occurred as a result of the reduction in expenditure on export assistance schemes. In the case of the bounty schemes which are the subject of this legislation, the damage wrought by the government decision is localised, identifiable and substantial. While the amendments in this bill represent some marginal improvement on the original measures that were announced in the budget, the opposition regards them as regressive; and we will oppose them. With regard to the government's backdown on the books bounty, we consider that it has not gone far enough with the amendment it is proposing in this legislation. The opposition is of the view that the government should have restored the original expiry date of 31 December 1997 put in place by Labor when it was in government-an expiry date the coalition signed up to before the 1996 election. With regard to the ships bounty, the governof ment backdown extends it six months beyond the 30 June 1996 expiry date put in place by Labor. However, the measures which the government has announced are quite inadequate in meeting the needs of shipbuilders in this country and they have responded to the government's initiative by labelling the government's measures the Clayton's bounty and a failure. The opposition will oppose this government amendment because of its failure to adequately link the bounty to an GECD agreement to eliminate shipbuilding subsidies. The GECD agreement is due to commence in July 1997 but has yet to be ratified by signatory countries. The weakness in what the government is proposing is that it does not provide a sufficient guarantee to industry that the government will extend the bounty if the GECD agreement is not ratified by that date. The opposition's amendment in contrast would ensure the continuation of the ships bounty until the GECD agreement comes into force. This will establish a more secure investment climate for the industry in which it can negotiate its further contracts and get into the exporting ring in a bigger way. This is not the only weakness of the government's bill. The other major weakness relates to the phase-in period. There is an inherent advantage to overseas shipbuilders under the terms of the GECD agreement when compared to what the government is proposing in this legislation with Ian shipbuilders. Under the GECD agreement, shipbuilders can still claim a subsidy up to three years after the agreement commences, provided the contract was signed before that date. Under the government's legislation, the 'bounty can only be claimed for ships completed by the end of 1997. The advantage to overseas shipbuilders is patently obvious. The amendments that the opposition is proposing align Australia's arrangements squarely with the GECD. This at least gives Australian producers the same tilt at industry assistance as overseas shipbuilders. The shipbuilding industry in Australia has left us all in no doubt as to their assessment the government's about-face in this legislation. They still regard the government's measures as a Clayton's shipbuilding bounty, as I mentioned before. I refer the House to a press release issued by the Australian Shipbuilders Association on 12 February 1997. In that press release they explicitly state that this is a Clayton's shipbuilding bounty and that the government's failure to address the bounty issue correctly heralds job cuts and more export losses. At a time when the national economy is struggling and we need extra jobs in manufacturing industry, and at a time when the balance of payments needs exports to bring that deficit down, here we have a deliberate measure being proposed by the government which will, on the advice of the shipbuilders of this nation and other manufacturers who receive the bounty, lead to a decrease in employment opportunities across those industries, particularly in regional areas, and will lead to a decline in exports. This is what the Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association, Mr John Rothwell, had to say: The Australian shipbuilding industry is no better off than it was prior to the Federal Government's announcement to extend the shipbuilding bounty, and substantial stand-downs will be experienced in the near future. Further on he said: While the industry was initially very excited and relieved by the announcement, it has proved to be nothing more than a disappointing teaser, and in reality of no value at all. We remain hugely regard to Australdisadvantaged. This is an industry which employs over 13,000 Australians directly or indirectly and last year earned in excess of half a billion dollars in export earnings. Here we have Mr Rothwell saying that what the government has announced is purely a tease. We have an industry minister who is a big tease. That is about all he can deliver. He does not deliver measures of substance and industry assistance measures of substance; he merely teases the industry while it struggles to compete with heavily subsidised overseas manufacturers in the shipbuilding area. I think it is pertinent at this point to ask why the government is proposing these amendments in its legislation at all. Really, they are simply a humiliating backdown for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), a minister who is regarded across the length and breadth of manufacturing industry in Australia as both hopeless and hapless. But, of course, the government has changed its view on the measures that it announced in the 1996 budget because of the pressure that we have applied to it here on the floor of this House and out across the regions of Australia. I pay tribute to manufacturers in the industries that are affected by these measures and to the regional communities in which those firms are located for their substantial lobbying efforts on behalf of their workers and their families and their regional communities, because it has been that combination of pressure from the opposition, from regional communities and from industries themselves that has brought this pathetic change-if you can call it thatto the government's proposals. I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies, that the industry minister has gone away and argued the toss before the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and come back with a few concessions to industry. But they do not go far enough. And the only measures and the only amendments that will really address the industry concerns are the ones that have been put on the floor of the House by the opposition. Of course, the government could have saved itself a whole lot of trouble in this particular area, with this legislation, simply by sticking to its election promises. It gave specific commitments to manufacturers in the shipbuilding industry, in the computer industry, in the machine tools and robots industry and in the book printing industry. They were very specific commitments, and those commitments simply said that the government, when and if it came to power, would continue the arrangements that Labor had implemented when it was in power. The Prime Minister also said that those promises were predicated on the basis that, even if there was a deterioration-in the deficit, or even if their worse fears were realised, the bottom line in all of this was that the Prime Minister would keep his promises to the Australian people. Well, he didn't. He didn't keep them to the shipbuilders of this nation or the book printers of this nation. He certainly didn't keep them to the regional communities who are now going to be affected by this exercise in industry assistance stupidity, and certainly not to the workers and their families who are employed in those particular industries. At least we have extracted some concessions out of the government, as a response to the pressure that Labor brought to bear both in this House and out in regional communities. In the context of this debate, I am very pleased to make some comment on the remarks of the Treasurer yesterday when he arrogantly strutted this House claiming that no-one really knew what Labor stood for. This arrogant Treasurer is very much out of touch with what is happening in regional Australia. In Tasmania, they know what Labor stands for in regard to industry policy and the shipbuilding industry in particular. In Western Australia, the shipbuilders know exactly where Labor stands in regard to this element of industry policy. In Maryborough, Victoria-I acknowledge the presence in the House of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who knows the midlands area and that town very well; he should know the devastating impact that the government measures will have on that particular community-they know very well what Labor stands for in regard to the assistance given to the printing industry in particular. We on this side of the House are very perplexed about what this arrogant Treasurer really stands for himself. We know that, as a founding member of the H.R. Nicholls Society, he had very strong views on the course of industrial relations reform, as he calls it-I call it a regressive series of actions with regard to industrial relations-and two, three, four or five years ago we were left in no doubt as to what the Treasurer's views were on industrial relations in this country. The Howard government has brought down its so called industrial relations reforms. The H.R. Nicholls Society has come out in the last week and said that it is a betrayal and a sellout. When asked in this House yesterday whether the Treasurer concurred with the views of this society that he established, all he could say was no-an arrogant no to a very substantial question which was asking the Treasurer where he stood on measures that affect the livelihoods of workers in regional industry. We on this side of the House have very great concerns about the competence of this arrogant Treasurer. The Treasurer is the only economist or chief economist in the Western world that can claim a four per cent growth rate, a two per cent inflation rate, single digit interest rates, low levels of industrial disputathe tion and burgeoning levels of exports and job growth, left to him by the previous Labor government, as an economic mess. We have a real problem in this country when the chief economic officer regards a four per cent growth rate and a two per cent inflation rate as an economic mess. The impact of the government's budgetary measures in the bounty legislation will be felt acutely in the regions of Australia-especially in Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria. Last year when this measure was announced, I travelled to Maryborough in Victoria-a regional town which relies very heavily for its employment on the printing industry. I talked with industry leaders, community leaders and companies such as MCPherson's which are going to be affected by the withdrawal of the book bounty and the withdrawal of other industry assistance measures that the government is emasculating in its budget. They expressed a total lack of confidence in the industry minister and also in the direction of the government's industry policy. There is one thing that came through in the discussions that I had with those community leaders and particularly with those companies; that is, they require certainty in their investment environment. They made very specific investment decisions and plans on the back of the book bounty and on the back of industry assistance measures that were guaranteed to them by the previous Labor government; and they were given an express commitment by the coalition that those measures would be continued if a coalition government were elected in the 1996 election, regardless of the budgetary circumstance. This twister of a Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong-who goes around this country trying to persuade people that there is such a thing as a core and a noncore promise-violated the mandate that he was given, in the measures that are contained in this legislation before the House. Those people had some very harsh things to say about the industry minister. It is a simple fact that we have a lame duck occupying one of the most significant portfolios in this country. There is no-one on either side of House who can objectively look at the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct and come to any conclusion other than that the industry minister should have been sacked. The only thing that saved him was the fact that two minor heads rolled before the Prime Minister got to consider his particular position and his violation of the ministerial codes of conduct. The Prime Minister's failure to do what he should have done has sent shock waves reverberating throughout regional Australia, because they have lost confidence in this industry minister and they have lost confidence in the industry policy of the government. It is an industry policy that is full of inconsistencies and is in tatters within one year of this government's life. The one thing that has really led to a drop in confidence in the regions has been the downright betrayal of the regions in the measures that were announced in the budget. These measures include the $150 million that was withdrawn from the regional development program; the $620 million that was dragged out of road funding programs; the $1.8 billion that was dragged out of labour market programs; and the cuts to the number of university places which gave regional workers and their children a chance to get a better education-these are the measures that have sapped the confidence of people in regional areas. They have been severely compounded by the measures that are contained in this legislation. I reiterate once again that the industry minister ought to be sacked. (Time expired)",33
30,Mr REID,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to participate in this debate on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, because I represent Maryborough in central Victoria, which has the highest concentration of printing industries and probably book printers in the whole of Australia. I have represented and have been proud to represent that area since 1976, both in state politics and in federal politics since coming here in 1990. I am pleased to respond to some of the claims being made by members of the opposition. It is remarkable how short their memories are. I can recall that in response to an Industry Commission report in 1992 the opposition, which were then in government, introduced a bill into this House which was going to abolish the book bounty. It was only the serious and strong representations and amendments moved by the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who was at the time the coalition industry spokesman, and me that convinced the government they were heading in the wrong direction at that time. It is all very well for the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) to come into this place and attack me on my track record. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that my track record in the Maryborough area in defence of these industries has been extremely strong. After receiving representations from the Australian Print Group and MCPhersons Book Printer, which are two substantial industries in that area, I have once again opened up discussions with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), and he has given me an undertaking that he will look at the tariff on inputs. I want to refer to this aspect because it is an important part of the debate. A submission that I had from the Australian Publishers Association indicated that the abolition of the bounty would leave the book printing industry in a position of negative assistance unless the tariff on imported paper was removed in parallel. That is what I was referring to when I said I have opened up discussions with the minister, and he has indicated that he will look at a tariff on the inputs into the manufacturing process. I want to refer to the majority report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. It recommended: ... the Government should amend the tariff regime to address any anomalies resulting from termination of the Bounties, in particular the situation where imported inputs are dutiable but the corresponding imported final goods are duty free. The minority report agreed with this finding. I have made representations to the minister on this matter and the minister has indicated that he will look at that situation. The member for Batman, a comparative newcomer to this House, has easily forgotten the situation that was in place in 1992 after the industry committee report was brought down when his party, which were in government, were going to remove the book bounty. He has simply forgotten all about that. That is removed from his memory-very conveniently, I might add. I can assure the printing industries and also the residents and employees in the city of Maryborough that they have my support on this. In fact, they had my strong support late last year when the government decided to change the termination period of the book bounty. I recall the speech by the minister, who relied on the draft Industry Commission report on book printing in August 1996 which recommended the abolition of the bounty when the current scheme was due to expire on 31 December 1997. The budget legislation speeding up the process of the abolition of the scheme on budget night has been varied with the termination of the bounty now scheduled for 30 June 1997. I had extensive discussions with the minister at the time and I know that he took note of those and that action was taken. For the member for Batman to come in and conveniently forget all about what his party were going to do in government really leaves one in a state of amazement. It seems to be a campaign of the member for Batman to attack both me and the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). He is vigorously going around trying to pick up anything. I want to remind him of what his party did, when in government, to the motor industry. The motor industry in Australia lost 25,000 jobs under the Labor Party government. But I want to strictly stick to the area of the book bounties, because it is extremely important for my area. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am very keenly aware of it and have been since the build-up of the book industry in the Maryborough area. I might add that my term in state politics probably led to the most major change in industrial expansion in the city of Maryborough that ever occurred. I was able to convince the Hon. Dick Hamer, the then Premier, that Maryborough needed natural gas. During my time as a state member there, the whole city of Maryborough was reticulated with natural gas, and that led to the expansion of industry and employment opportunities in the Maryborough area. There was a substantial growth in industry during that period. In fact, both of the firms I have mentioned-Australian Print Group and MCPhersons Book Printers-have expanded as a result of the availability of natural gas and all the other infrastructure support that is available in the city of Maryborough. They have also been able to attract Nestle, the big sweets and confectionary manufacturer, as a result of natural gas being reticulated through that whole district. I take you back once again to the comments by the member for Batman in this debate and his allegation that I was not supporting the city of Maryborough. I certainly am. In fact, the member for Barker and I, during the debate following the Ie report in 1992, played a major role in overturning the ALP's direction of removing all of these bounties. I find it quite staggering that members from the Labor Party have now conveniently forgotten all about that. The member for Batman also made a number of other allegations about me. One of them was that: There was a commitment to the city of Bendigo prior to the last election which meant a further investment in the form of construction of a new art gallery with additional jobs of benefit to the local community. I want to make one comment on that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The person who made that commitment of $2 million was none other  Keating. He did not deliver on the promise, nor did he put it into the budget estimates. It is very convenient for the member for Batman to be selective about his quotes. He is saying that I, as the member for Bendigo, have gone missing on the question of future book bounties and support for key jobs in the town of Maryborough and his electorate. I can assure you that that is not so. I have been very active on this issue. I have received representations from the Australian Publishers Association. I have made representations to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the minister has agreed to look at the situation of tariffs on any inputs into the book printing industry. I thank the House for the opportunity to respond to those scurrilous allegations.",37
31,Mr HOLDING,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"-I want to approach the issue before the House in a somewhat different way from those of my colleagues, because I think the arguments have gone back and forth. I want to start on the basis that I think there would be a general consensus in this parliament, on all sides, that the biggest single problem facing our community is the problem of unemployment and how we solve it. I do not think we solve it by having a work for the dole scheme, whatever merits or demerits that may have, but we can advance the situation by having a coherent, well thought through policy on industrial development. That means that we look to the development of our manufacturing industry. It is the role of government to consider how it can enhance the existing structures, how it can develop policy which enables the environment in which we live to advance industries in any particular area. It does not really help the argument to get into the sort of exchange, which tends to happen often in this House, where one member says, 'Look what you did. We're going to do the same thing, but we hope we will be able to solve the problem.' If one looks for the reasons for this proposal and where it emanated from, it obviously did not emanate from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and I do not think it emanated from any of the policy considerations or discussions that took place in the government party meeting. I suspect that where it emanated from was precisely where it emanated from when we were in officeout of Treasury. Part of the problem that the Labor government faced, and I think this government faces, is that Treasury has produced, over a period of time, a group of advisers and senior officers who are committed to the concepts of economic rationalism. The problem with this government is that they, equally, adopt the same ideology. This is the most ideologically driven government that I have seen in all my time in two parliaments. I have some sympathy for the honourable member for Bendigo because the best that he can do is line up with his party to vote for this legislation which will create a problem for an industry in an area that is important to him. The best he can then do is say, 'I'm having discussions with the minister to see whether we can use another device to limit the damage to these industries.' Frankly, with all respect to the honourable member, I do not think that is good enough because the government is facing the same sort of dilemma that people on this side of the House faced when we were in government when in fact a Treasury driven economic imperative does not reach out and look at the problems that confront people in manufacturing industry. If we want to increase employment in this country, if we want to get rid of the spectre of unemployment, then we have to have a coherent economic policy which is directed towards strengthening our manufacturing bases and improving them. I take just one area of Australia which is particularly relevant to my own electorate: development of the shipbuilding industry in Australia is no accident. The contract to build the frigates went to a set of consortiums operating out of Melbourne. Adelaide has produced the technology and the capacity to build the submarine. Cairns is producing the hydrographic ship, and catamarans are produced in Tasmania. Mr Stephen Smith-And Western Australia.",38
32,Mr HOLDING,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Western Australia. That was not an accident. It was based on the capacity of those who had the responsibility for running quite large enterprises and their initiatives. But there was government backup and a considered policy. Where is the considered policy here? Where is the considered policy that emerges from Treasury? It says, 'We've been looking at the budget in global.' Let us adopt a policy of reducing bounty exports. Has there been any thought emanating as to the impact that that is going to have-not merely upon an emerging and well-based manufacturing industry? I am not just talking about ships; I am talking also about the printing industry. Has there been any discussion about the ramifications before the government puts this policy in place? What will it mean in terms of jobs in this industry throughout Australia? Who is in a position to advise the government? The people who are in the best position to advise the government are the people in the industry. What do they say? They say that it will lead to further unemployment and a reduced level of manufacturing capacity. Ultimately, it means that Australian industries in this area, in a competitive world, are competing against other nations which have developed skills in these areas over the years and have provided considerable bounties, not merely to attain a technological level of expertise but because they see it is critical to the development of those industries. and to their economic base. What is happening in this country is that, although we are agreed as individuals in this parliament that the greatest social problem the facing this community is the problem of unemployment, we adopt a policy which every member in his heart knows will reduce employment in a key sector of industry. We are going to lend ourselves to the export of jobs to overseas competitors which are maintaining bounties. Does that make economic sense? I suppose it could be argued by the economic rationalists, 'Well, at the end of the day, it'll all be all right.' But they are all right. The people who give this advice to Treasurers-irrespective of governments, because governments in our democratic system come and go-on the basis of their economic theories have never had the responsibility of running a manufacturing industry, never had the problem that confronts people who are operating those industries in Maryborough in my electorate and in electorates all around Australia and never had the difficulty that confronts this parliament as we have a Treasurer (Mr Costello) who shares their economic philosophy. It is an economic philosophy which, in Great Britain, has divided their society, has produced a permanent underclass and produced levels of unemployment and levels of poverty. The government of Great Britain is now facing a massive defeat in the election because the people of Britain will vote against this very system. Do we have to get to a stage in Australia where these sorts of lunatic policies are going to produce that level of social disharmony, that level of social misery, and where an esteemed colleague says, 'Look, I've got to put my hands up for this, but I'm having a bit of a talk to the minister and he will have a look at it'? Does this colleague think, deep in his heart, that when the minister has a look at it he is going to be able to withstand the pressure of those people who are driving these policies in Treasury? I wish him good luck. What this House needs from this government, if it is to keep faith with the electorate in terms of its electoral promises, is an ing and considered, well thought through policy for the manufacturing industries and other areas of economic activity in Australia which are designed to increase unemployment. I believe that there is nobody in this House who believes that, if this legislation goes through in this form, there will not be people losing their jobs, there will not be increasing levels of unemployment-unless the government can find some other way of dealing with it. It seems to me that it is a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. The Labor government made mistakes in these areas. If we have not learned from the mistakes that we made in the footwear, textile and clothing industries in Australia, we have not learned anything. This government is heading down the same course and it will get the same result. This is ill considered, ill thought out Treasury driven legislation. Isn't a coherent, long-term concept of where we are taking our manufacturing industry and of how we can enhance employment opportunities not only the moral imperative of the government but also the economic imperative? I know that the Treasurer is getting some fairly colourful abuse from an organisation which he founded-the H.R. Nicholls Society. It is all right for the Hugh Morgans of the world-born with a silver spoon in his mouth, never had to face the prospect of unemployment and ushered into daddy's position as head of a major corporation. I do not say that in any sense of personal antagonism: he was very fortunate. But there are lots of people in this society who are not so fortunate. There are lots of kids in my electorate whose father is unemployed or their mother cannot get work and who are forced to live on the dole and suffer all the social consequences that that brings with it-the social tensions and the dysfunctional relati<?nships. I will be voting against this legislation not simply because of my party's position but because it not only involves a serious breach of an electoral promise but more importantly is evidence of the fact that we have not learned from past mistakes. There is nothing ongo- wrong with the government saying, 'Labor has made these mistakes in one industry and we are not going to make it in another.' No government ever gets it 100 per cent right. It is time, given the commitment of this House and the commitment of individual parliamentarians, to deal at a serious level with solving the problems of unemployment in Australia. It is time to look seriously at what is occurring in the many areas of manufacturing which are the core base for future employment and the maintenance of existing employment before we go down the path of saying, 'We are really very good because we are going to adopt the doctrine of economic rationalism and the whole world is our marketplace,' when other competitors like throughout the world, including the United States and many European nations, are not going down the same track. It is a lonely place to be when you confront decent, hard working Australians working in these industries and have to say, 'Oh well, bad luck, although we know that you are likely to lose your job, hopefully we will be talking to another minister and it will not be quite so bad.' That is not an answer. If we are serious about unemployment, and if the government is serious-and I believe most of its members are-about unemployaffected-the ment, we would be adopting policies which puter strengthen our manufacturing base throughout this nation and we would not get ourselves mtothe position which has happened so often where, because of some current economic policy, we finish up exporting jobs. government ought to have a second look this legislation. If it has any commitment its objective of increasing employment, it ought to withdraw it.",39
33,Mr MCCLELLAND,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"On several occasions in recent weeks the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has taken upon himself to brand us on this side of the House as the forelock tugging Labor. debate whether that is appropriate parliamentary language or not. In any event, it has come from the mouth of the Prime Minister, so it is there. I suppose that expression sarily implies that we have forelocks. That more than I can say for the government this issue. They are completely lacking in necessary anatomy to take up the issues on behalf of Australian industry. They are literalEuropean ly completely neutered when it comes to industry policy. As the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has just said, they are obsessed with the so-called free market-they almost hold it up as a religious icon. Their one and only philosophy is that, if you get ro-economic settings right, this divine intervention of the free market is going to come and fix every thing up, as if the free market can bestow miracles. Unfortunately, it will not happen, it does not happen like that and it is not happening that in the rest of the world. While ever our government has this view, we are letting our side down and we are very much letting our industry down. As the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in his speech on this matter said, this legislation will mean a fall in exports, a fall in jobs, a rise in the balance of payments deficit and a rise in the budget deficit. The situation is particularly severe in Western Australia and Tasmania, but in effect it affects all Australians because of the much broader implications across all the industries publishing industry, the comindustry, the tool and robotics industries as well as the shipbuilding industries. Dealing first with the shipbuilding industry, it was reported this week that Austal in Western Australia will dismiss 20 employees The next week directly as a result of the at government's decision. So, like the Red to Baron chocking up kills on the side of his plane, the government can clock up 20 there immediately. Austal has indicated that 100 more employees will go in the next few weeks directly as a result of the government's it decision. Wavemaster in Western Australia has also indicated that 100 employees will go One can in the next few weeks. The facts of the matter are that our European competitors are providing assistance at somewhere between nine and 25 per cent, and necescurrent measures through the OECD to reis move or reduce the assistance provided to on shipbuilding in those countries are being the blocked-substantially as a result 0f United States pressure. But, whatever the reason, the competitors are going to be put in the box seat for at least another 18 months and more likely for two years. The question becomes whether our industry can survive. Unfortunately, the feedback is that it probably cannot survive by staying in Australia. The government is being reckless in the extreme the broad macand irresponsible. It is not as if the shipbuilding industry has got flabby and inefficient under the assistance of the bounty scheme-quite the contrary. Since 1990, its production has increased by 40 per cent. It is now earning well over $500 million a year, and it is confidently predicted that it will be an industry earning in excess of $1 billion per annum by the year 2000. Almost all of that is in exports. Almost all of that is coming off our balance of payments deficit. But, rather than me condemning the government in a partisan sense, as one speaker before me said, they really should look at industry experts. In the Financial Review of 24 January, Mr Clifford-one of those involved in the shipbuilding industry-was quoted as saying: Our industry cannot survive against European competition unless we get some support. In the Australian of 29 November 1996, a Liberal colleague, Mr Court, the Premier of Western Australia was quoted as saying: . . . removal of the 5 per cent bounty would do severe damage to the 'incredibly successful' shipbuilding industry. It is noted in that article that several shipbuilders have already warned that they would be forced to move offshore in order to survive. That certainly has to be an inevitability. It is worth having regard to the comments of an academic-Dr Mark Beeson, research fellow at the Murdoch University Asia Research Centre-because they are an objective analysis in a non-political setting. In an article in the Australian of 20 December 1996, he said: It might be expected that an industry that looked like generating $1 billion in export sales by of the century, and which already directly provides nearly 3000 highly paid manufacturing jobs, might be the subject of a good deal of attention and assistance. Not so-he points outThe light weight aluminium-based fast ferry industry that has produced this remarkable export and job creation performance is to be left to its own devices. As he points out-and consistent with what the member for Melbourne Ports said-these industries did not just happen because of some process of divine intervention or spontaneous production. There was a lot of planning and a lot of strategy that went in-assisted, in many instances, by a partnership between government and industry. As Dr Mark Beeson said: . .. successful industries don't just happen. Without a supportive policy environment that encourages particular forms of strategically important activity, the danger is that such industries may happen somewhere else. That is not only a danger but an actuality. Our competitors realise that. They are well and truly backing their own industries, and they are getting manufacturing jobs. We are letting ours wither on the vine. Indeed, this is worse than allowing them to wither on the vine; it is direct sabotage and vandalism of very successful, highly sophisticated industries conveying very sophisticated skills on to our work force-the flow-on in technologies spreads right throughout industry. To risk losing that, as this government is doing, is nothing short of an outrage. In terms of the government's actions, it is all very well for us in a partisan sense to say, 'They do not understand what they are doing' , but that has also been said by Mr Robert Clifford from Incat in Tasmania. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 August 1996, he was quoted as saying: I don't believe the Liberal government understands the economics of the industry. They just don't understand the importanc,? of the bounty to us. That has got to be the case. For them to act as though they have, they simply have not done the necessary research; they have acted the end from a blinkered state. Anyone who cannot see more than one perspective of mind has to be regarded as mentally retarded in that sense. This government's obsessive adherence to this demigod or religious icon-the market force-has, literally, mentally retarded them so they cannot receive the views of industry. Regrettably, we have a government which is mentally retarded because of its ideological straitjacket and our industry is suffering. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) referred yesterday to an article in the Financial Review which reported comments by the ASA chairman, Mr John Rothwell. He pointed out to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) that the government's display of beneficence-the extension of the bounty by six months to the end of the year in response to not only Labor pressure but, it has got to be said, pressure from Senator Harradine-is meaningless. As Mr Rothwell says: Minister, it takes 12 months to build a vessel of the car ferry size, which are the majority of exported ferries from Australia. What this means is that presently no shipbuilder can enter into a contract to build a ship with the aid of the bounty, as it will not be possible to complete the ship by the end of this calendar year. I recall the member for Fremantle described how two contracts had been lost because the industry in her state cannot forward plan its contracts because of the removal of the bounty and the time it is going to take to construct the vessels. That is short-sightedness, ignorance and incompetence. - peakers before me in the debate have pointed out that it is poor government in tetins of creativity. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) said it is an obsession with short-term debt cutting at the expense of long-term investment. Not only that, they are removing revenue which far exceeds the amount they are paying out in terms of the bounty. That is shown very much in research provided by the Australian Publishers Association with respect to the book bounty. Similar facts exist with respect to the ship bounty where we have received from PA YE tax revenue and payroll tax revenue in the order of $62 million from the ship bounty at a cost of $24 million. So we are well and truly ahead. With respect to the book bounty, the Australian Publishers Association has quantified the decline in PAYE taxation revenue at $9,634,000, a decline in payroll tax revenue at $2,733,000 and increases in unemployment benefits of over $21 million, at a total cost to the government in excess of $33 million, far exceeding the amount the government pays by way of this bounty. The removal of the books bounty six months ahead of time is going to mean the loss of some 1,500 jobs. That is unquestioned. With respect to the seat of Bendigo, Prentice-Hall has for the first time in nine years published a textbook offshore. That is the start of things to come. They were previously doing all that publication in Australia-and a very respected publisher it has become. In terms of the effect on the balance of trade that the loss of the book bounty is going to have, Merino publishers in Brisbane is another example. Merino publishers has obtained contracts to provide to Californian schools all Latino-American textbooks, there being a very big Latino population in California. That state has a population of some 28 million, almost one and a half times that of Australia. The loss of that export opportunity is obvious. In addition, our book bounty has enabled us to be import replacing. Imported books have gone down since 1991 from $400 million to $300 million-and that trend is continuing. As I have pointed out, in terms of the budget deficit we stand to lose more than we will save. Again, there is an obsession with this free market concept. That just is not going to happen. In the case of the book bounty we were actually winning the war against international competition as the Australian Financial Review pointed out on 28 February: The value of Australian book printing in 1995-96 was $270 million, compared with $180 million in South-East Asia. There are very few industries where we are succeeding over our competitors: publishing has been one of them. Again, to cut the bounty off at this time is reckless in the extreme. In terms of the computer bounty, it is already having an effect. The company Netcomm, which is almost a household name-I know on my kids' computer we have a Netcomm modem-is ceasing its production of modems in Australia. That, in this day and age when so many people are connecting to the Internet, is a real tragedy. There is no other description for it. In terms of the computer industry it must be said that trade barriers are coming down, at least in the Asian region. But as a former Labor minister said in November 1995: The computer bounty plays an important role in facilitating investment and value added production in Australia, including the manufacture of essential hardware fundamental to the information age and it is clear that a healthy and broad based hardware manufacturing capability underpins innovative software and services development. There is a rapid trade growing in software and services development and the Asian market, as its economies are improving, presents real opportunities for Australia. The government is turning its back on that opportunity and, again, vandalising another section of Australian industry. In terms of the machine industry-tools and robotics-again the government is short sighted in the extreme. Obviously, if we are going to compete with our Asian competitors, we must do so from the point of view of not technological comparisons but technological superiority. Unless we have that, we will be forced to compete on the lower wages regime. If we want to maintain our standard of living and preserve our wage rates, the only way we can do so is by having the technological sophistication. This move to take away the bounty from the development of our tools and robotics industry is short-sighted. Before it was electsmall ed, the government promised to create 250,000 jobs in manufacturing. You cannot do that unless you build factories; you cannot build factories unless you equip them with tools and technology. Tooling is therefore essential if we want to develop sophisticated tools to equip our factories and if we want to develop the sophisticated robotics technology such as has been at the heart of progress in our car industry. As much as possible we want to tool our factories with these sophistiThis cated pieces of machinery. Unless we do so, it will mean either that our factories do not have those tools or this technology or that they import it from overseas. Again this will have a dramatic effect on our balance of payments. This government has not appreciated that it is all very well being symbolic. It is all well to tell mainstream Australians who are sitting 'comfortably and relaxed' in their living rooms that you are looking after their interests, but if you are not in fact looking after their interests one thing is for sure: will not be too long before Australians see through the bulldust. They do not want to be patronised; they want to see results, they want to see runs on the board. They want to see our manufacturing industries not only matching but beating our competitors. They want to see jobs, and they want to see jobs in sophisticated manufacturing industries. They want the government to have a decent and sustained revenue base from ongoing taxation receipts, not an ongoing liability to pay unemployment benefits. As I have said, this government is short sighted. They are mentally retarded because of their own ideology. They are completely lacking in any courage. Indeed, they stand to be condemned for what they are doing to the Australian economy. (Time expired)",41
34,Mr WILTON,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Like the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), I am somewhat saddened to rise to speak against the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, as it serves as yet another stark and harsh example of one of the many popular and highly successful programs that the previous Labor government established to support Australia's and medium size businesses which this government is best perhaps described as foolishly dismantling. It also serves as another stark example of the Howard government's duplicitous and misguided treatment of Australia's small business sector. The Minister for Small Business and Con reading speech made quite clear the driving force behind this bill. In the first lines of his speech he stated: bill amends four bounty acts to achieve savings announced by the government in the 199697 budget. A little further on in that same speech he said: The government has decided to terminate the schemes ahead of their scheduled dates . . . because of the overriding objective to eliminate the budget deficit. very I am sure that government members, along with Treasury officials, have a well-known dislike of schemes such as industry bounties which do not accord or fit neatly with their dry economic rationalist view of leaving the it market to its own devices and hang the consequences. This bill is clearly not being driven by any real desire of the government or the minister to establish, as the member for Barton quite rightly contended, viable and long-tenn growth in Australian industry. We are not dealing with this bill because the government in any sense of the word believes that it is part of a broader strategy which may build upon the effective refonns already well under way and entrenched by the former Labor government. However, I do believe that the bill that we are debating here today and the underlying issues involved do indeed go to the heart of the difference between the Labor opposition and the coalition government in both their philosophy and approach to economic policy, and specifically to industry policy. This bill terminates the books bounty, the ships bounty and the machine tools and robots bounty with effect from 20 August last year and, as we have heard other speakers submit, it terminates the computer bounty with effect from I July 1997. Those of us on this side of the House will be opposing this bill on a number of grounds, including its deleterious effects on specific regions of Australia which have become home to these particular industries, the fact that bill represents yet another broken promise by the government and because, last but not least, it is simply poor policy enacted in the shabbiest and most duplicitous of ways. I will go to some detail in regard to each of these bounties. Turning to the books bounty, Australia's printing and publishing companies and their workers have made significant gains in productivity refonn and improvements in competitiveness throughout the course of the last decade. It is unfair and, indeed, unjust to attack in this way an industry that is making such profound progress halfway through its restructuring program merely to satisfy the government's short-term desire to balance the books. As the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) contended, this simply involves a short-tenn desire to cut debt at the expense of long-tenn investment. Indeed, our industries need some measure of certainty. This is an underpinning requirement for confidence before long-tenn investment can be generated. In the case of the books bounty, printing and publishing finns have been operating for some time now on the clear and unequivocal understanding that the measure would be in place at least until the end of 1997. But the government's decision to prematurely end the bounty as of budget day last year makes it very difficult, and perhaps even impossible, for some finns in this industry to make long term investment decisions with any degree of confidence whatsoever. Even the Industry Commission, in its August draft report on the printing industry, recommended that the bounty be allowed to run through to 1997. Of course, the books bounty has had a significant impact on the international competitiveness of both the printing and publishing industries. The export of books, for example, has increased by some 200 per cent over the past 12 years. At a time when the government and economic analysts are calling for measures to deal with the level of Australia's foreign debt, the decimation of the book industry will have a disastrous effect on Australia's current account. According to the Printing Industries Association trade consultant, Mr Ronald Fisher, this surveys by the Printing Industries Association indicate that up to 50 per cent of book production in Australia would be lost to overseas printers with the tennination of this bounty. This would see a loss of book exports up to a value of $40 million to $50 million per annum and an increase in imports of up to $80 million per annum, an adverse impact on Australia's balance of payments to the tune of some $120 million. The ending of the bounty will cut short this growth and significantly reduce employment in the industry. Of course, in the' printing industry, job losses of up to 1,500 have been predicted, with a particularly severe impact upon regional centres such as Maryborough in Victoria, notwithstanding the best efforts of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). He has, I am sure, spoken long and hard in defence of industries within his own electorate, but that certainly has not been enough to stop companies like Prentice-Hall publishing a book offshore for the first time. The numbers of those in general working in the book and related industries will be cut by almost one-third. I tum briefly to the issue of the ships bounty. We have seen over the last decade the growth of what might best be described as an innovative and export oriented Australian industry in the construction of fast ships and ferries. With the assistance of the ships bounty, companies like Austal Ships in Fremantle and Incat in Launceston have grown from nothing to become major exporters in both the European and Asian markets. The member for Barton in his submission to the House quoted the manager of Incat in Launceston as saying that the government does not know what it is doing in this regard. Maybe he would have a better idea of what the government should be doing had any representative from the government taken the opportunity to visit him during the Liberal Party's national conference in Hobart in the latter half of last year. The abolition of the bounty in this bill will mean that this industry, which has so much potential, will not be able to compete with our international competitors who have subsidies of anywhere between nine per cent and 50 per cent. The Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, in his letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) urging him to reconsider his decision in regard to this particular bounty put the case very clearly and, I believe, very cogently. Mr Court states in his letter: It is inconceivable that this huge export dollar earning industry can successfully survive when competing against subsidies such as those of Norway at 13.2%; Denmark between 8% and 13% and Italy between 15% and 50%. Mr Court goes on to say: Of great importance is the fact that the shipbuilding industry is not promoting hand outs. It can successfully compete in the international market on quality and expertise, but not if it is disadvantaged to the tune of 9% of the contract price. It is only asking that the present rate of 5% be retained until other OECD countries eliminate their subsidies. Prime Minister, I urge you to reverse your government's decision to terminate this five per cent bounty until all other worldwide bounties are removed. It would be a tragedy to destroy what might best be described as the star of Australian manufacturing industries when a small amount of subsidies will ultimately be an extremely good investment for Australia in the long haul. As Mr Court also attested in his letter, the beneficial impact of the ships bounty is clearly significant. Since the bounty's inception, production in the industry has grown by some 200 per cent, exports have grown by 150 per cent and employment levels have grown by 50 per cent. I am sure Mr Court would share similar concerns about the computer bounty, given that there is the genesis of an effective and efficient west coast based computer industry being generated in the Perth area. It was the Labor government who, in 1995, had legislated to extend the operation of this computer bounty right through until the end of the year 2000. During the election campaign, the coalition had matched this commitment. However, in the budget, adding to its ever growing list of broken promises, the government has abolished the bounty from 1 July 1997. Having recently taken part in the debate on the child care amendment legislation, where once again the opposition is in the unusual position of trying to keep one of the government's election promises not to means test child-care benefits, I am not greatly surprised to find another situation where the government is trying to worm its waY' out of one of its election promises. The Industry Commission, in its 1995 report on the computer hardware and software industry, found that firms used bounty moneys effectively, that in the absence of the bounty they may invest less or undertake less R&D and that, for some firms, investment, R&D, exporting and employment would cease without bounty assistance. Although the IC report recommended that the bounty should lapse, this was predicated on the continuation of schemes like the 150 per cent R&D tax concession, the export market development grants scheme and the AusIndustry initiatives, all of which have been cut and slashed by this government. The bounty has been one of a number of measures which have assisted the growth of Australian information industries. Along with partnerships for the development program, the computer bounty has seen information industry exports treble in the last five years.  the Australian Information Industry Association, described the government's decision to hasten the phasing out of the computer bounty as having 'knocked one leg from under the chair of the information technology industry'. I am sure that Mr Upton would have similar sentiments had he been actively involved in the machine tools and robots industry because since the mid-1980s that industry has not become internationally competitive. It has shown an encouraging increase in both production and exports. , For example, in the last three years, Austtalian production of bountiable machine tools tip' mcreased from around $95 million to $-bllflion"" when exports have doubled over theÂ·l-e-riod. The Industry Commission, in its draft report on the machine tools and robots industry ,recently recommended that the bounty be retained until its legislated expiry date of 30 June 1997. In scrapping the bounty in the budget, the government has once again shown that it is happy to commission reports and then equally content simply to ignore them. I would like to tum briefly to some comments I made earlier when I spoke of the fundamentally defining nature of this bill and the broader issue of industry policy. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has moved the following amendment to this bill: ... the House (1) rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill; ... The former Labor government had a proud record of working hand in hand with industry because we both believed and accepted that there was a strategic role for government to play in working with the private sector to develop our industry potential for the benefit of us all. That role is not about picking winners. It is not a heavy-handed approach. We believed then, and still believe now, that the government has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the best economic conditions exist in which our businesses can flourish through building a strong and enduring base from which they can branch out into export markets. The MTIA has stated the need for the government to produce an environment for business in Australia which includes a culture which values innovation and success in the global marketplace. Whether through providing high quality infrastructure in transport and communication, through establishing an industrial relations system which encourages both harmony and productivity rather than conflict and division or through simply recognising that the Australian firms have a competitive advantage over their international rivals through their access to and use of technology and innovation, government has an obligation to ensure that the conditions that are necessary for a healthy and growing economy are set in place. This is central to the beliefs of those of us in the Labor Party. That is why we are here in this nation's parliament. Of course, the Liberal Party and those opposite have a diametrically opposed view to the one I have just espoused. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, who is in the chamber this afternoon, knows perfectly well what is at the heart of this bill because in his own words he said 'these measures will help the government to meet the challenge of reducing the budget deficit'. That is what is driving this decision, nothing more and nothing less-and that is the basis for the coalition's approach to industry policy. It is the primacy of the fiscal bottom line. The government's economic policy and philosophy goes no further than the simple and discredited view that the only role for government in the economy is to get out of it, to leave it alone, to let the market prevail. It believes in cutting spending to the bare minimum, privati sing everything and leaving the market to fend for itself. This view is not shared by industry. We have ample evidence of this in their responses to each of the government's proposed changes to measures which support industry. The previous Labor government had a fine record in the development and implementation of sector specific industry policy, and the current government and Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism could learn much from this example. It was the approach through the Button car plan and other similar sectoral industry plans which saw that Labor government achieve real results in reforming and modernising Australia's industry, yet by contrast the coalition's approach is piecemeal and antagonistic. I fear that there is no ample evidence to suggest that the government has no interest in a cooperati ve and strategic approach to industry policy, as it has shown through the crass nature of the measures contained in this bill. The evidence suggests that the government simply has no interest in industry policy or in Australian industry at all. Industry in this country is calling out for a statement of vision. It has not been forthcoming, and it has not been forthcoming because this coalition government has an obsession with short-term debt cost cutting at the expense of long-term investment.

35,Mr MOORE,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"In summing up the debate on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, I welcome the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) back this morning. Mr Crean-I enjoy working with you.",48
36,Mr MOORE,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Your presence makes my day. We have heard a considerable amount in this debate about how essential these various bounties are to the survival of the firms and sectors that use them. The government has, on a number of occasions, acknowledged the role bounty assistance has played in the development of shipbuilding, books, computer manufacturing and machine tools and robot industries. The fact remains that the actual rates assistance have fallen significantly over years as a result of policies implemented by the previous Labor government. For example, book bounties have fallen from 30 per cent in 1983 to 4.5 per cent from 1 January 1997. The machine tools and robots bounty has fallen from 40 per cent in 1988 to five per cent on 1 July 1996. The industries that utilise the four bounties covered by this bill have been able to adjust. This has been acknowledged by the member for Hotham and by a number of independent reviews. The Industry Commission book bounty review noted, for example, that production of bountiable books had increased over 50 per cent in real terms since 1992 and at a time when the bounty rate was falling. The various reviews of bounties have also found the assistance measures have effectively run their course and should not be extended. Nevertheless, the government has recognised that circumstances do exist which warrant some alteration to the provisions of the existing bill to put in more generous transitional arrangements. For this reason, I will be moving in the consideration in detail stage several amendments to the bill which extend the termination dates for the shipbuilding and book bounties. In conclusion, the government believes that the future of different industry sectors does not lie in debate about the possible long-term retention of low level bounty assistance. Rather the priority is to put in place a more comprehensive framework or strategy for industry that reflects the need to establish an appropriate environment for investment, access to overseas markets and effective business assistance programs. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Crean's amendment) stand part of the question. The bells having been rung Mr Lee-- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

40,Mr MOORE,PAIRS,"I move government amendment No.1: (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 4 to 17), omit the item, substitute: 1 Subsection 4(1) (definition of bounty period) Omit ""31 December 1997"", substitute ""31 June 1997"". This amendment and those to be moved as government amendments Nos 2 and 3 give effect to my joint announcement with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 16 December 1996 with respect to the books bounty. These amendments defer the termination date for the books bounty, extending the government's previously announced termination date of 20 August by 10 months. This will better take account of contracts already in place at the time of the August 1996 budget announcement, while preserving a small contribution to the process of fiscal consolidation in 1997-98. I commend the amendments to the House and table the supplementary explanatory memorandum.",49
41,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"The opposition supports the first of these amendtrading ments, the amendment before the House at moment, which in effect deletes the subsection of the Bounty (Books) Act which wound up the books bounty on budget night. We support totally the deletion of this provision from the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. The effect of its deletion will be to restore books bounty in its entirety. That is the position that we want supported in this House. However, I would remind the House that the Minister for Industry, Science ism (Mr Moore) has a further amendment which will restore the books bounty period until 30 June 1997-six months short of the original position. The original position was that the books bounty would remain until 31 December 1997. The first amendment that the government has brought forward is a backto down, but it is only a partial backdown. As result of the campaign that we in opposition ran in the regions-we convinced those in the communities to pursue the campaign-we victory have seen a partial backdown, but the partial backdown does not go far enough. No-one can deny the significant impact that the books bounty has had on the growth of the industry. The industry has increased book exports by 200 per cent over the past years. These are not assistance measures protect industries, they are measures that the playing field. The countries with whom our book publishers must compete all these bounties and other arrangements in place. The level playing field does The reason these bounties were inserted by the Labor government was to enable these industries, which should be world competiis tive, to compete in the marketplace, but they cannot do so because other countries have got measures in place that support their industries. The purpose of the books bounty was to get our book publishers into the game. It is true that under Labor the books bounty would run out by the end of this year but we had undertaken to conduct an inquiry into what should occur post 31 December 1997 . We would have required the Productivity Commission to have regard to two important things in its deliberations: first, the pace of change of our partners; and, second, the impact of the the decision on regions and their jobs. We sought to get the government to accept these amendments when they introduced the Productivity Commission legislation in the last sitting fortnight, but they opposed them. They have no commitment to understanding the what our trading partners are doing. They are expecting our participants in industry to unilaterally disarm and expose themselves to the rest of the world without any support, without any assistance, and to flourish in that and Tourenvironment. It does not happen. We are saying, Minister, that you should not only put this amendment forward but also desist from the further amendments you will be moving. The first amendment will reinstate the books bounty and will enable the inquiry proceed to decide where we go after 31 a December this year, but your next amendment will curtail that. It will end the bounty six months down the track. We have had a partial but we want a total victory. We will be persisting with that view in this House.",50
42,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PAIRS,"I am pleased to be associated with this amendment to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. It is clear from the lack its of attendance today and the lack of support 12 for the Minister for Industry, Science and to Tourism (Mr Moore) that he is pursuing an level amendment to what is, on balance, a fairly successful scheme. He is not supported today have because the members of his backbench, especially those in regional Australia, know not exist. that they are the real losers. What are the real savings? We are talking about savings in the order of $4 million. That not big bickies according to the current members of the government. Until they were forced to back down because of the results of the polling conducted by Andrew Robb, they were prepared to move the Speaker's chair at a cost of $500,000. That $4 million is not big bickies in the mind of the minister for industry-after all, in terms of his lifestyle, it is not even worth a big drink. That is what he is on the record as being concerned about. It goes to a question of the impact of these proposed changes on regional Australia. Yesterday afternoon, in the debate concerning this all-important bill, I raised the question of the impact on regional Australia. It goes to a question of a fairly fundamental issue-jobs. I find it strange that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), for example, is not here this afternoon speaking in support of the amendment moved by the shadow spokesperson for industry. If anyone ought to be on his feet at the moment, rather than cowering in the corridors of Parliament House, it is the member for Bendigo. He ought to be in here this afternoon standing up for the town of Maryborough. In case the member for Bendigo does not know, Maryborough is in his electorate-it is not in Queensland, it is actually near the town of Bendigo. Twenty-five per cent of the work force in Maryborough depends on the book industry through two key employers. Worse still, it is an area of high unemployment. It is an area that demands government assistance. It is an area that is prepared to stand on its own two feet, provided the government has a well thought out industry policy which creates opportunities for that town. Twenty-five per cent of that townwhich covers quite a considerable number of families-depends on the bounty system. As I said, the people of that town are prepared to stand up and be counted. They are prepared to deliver. All they are asking for is a helping hand in accordance with the original proposal with respect to this bill. Instead, they will suffer as a result of the initiatives of the minister for industry. They will suffer a full frontal attack on the welfare and livelihood of that town. One-quarter of the local work force is dependent on this bill. Two big printing firms-the Australian Print Group and MCPherson's Printing Group-are central to that local economy. That might not mean much to the minister for industry, because I dare say he has not got shares in those two companies, but it means a lot to the livelihood of that town. The government ought to embrace this amendment. It is not big bickies, it is not even a big drink in the mind of the minister for industry-it is $4 million. However, in terms of that town it is big bickies-25 per cent of the work force. I can understand why the minister for industry is feeling the pinch this afternoon. They might not be game to come here, stand up and speak about the importance of this bill, but out on the back bench they are vitally concerned. If I were the member for Bendigo I would be concerned about an unemployment rate of 10.5 per cent. I would be concerned about the potential job losses from the impact of ripping away additional assistance for a very short period in a town of high youth unemployment, a town that needs government assistance, an area that is already suffering from high unemployment, an area that is crying out for a reasonable industry policy approach. On balance, it is about time the government took up what was a fairly objective criticism by the former chief executive officer of the Metal Trades Industry Association. Everything is not a cost, it is an investment-it is about investment in industry and investment in regional Australia. Embrace the amendment, look to the future, and support regional Australia where it requires assistance. Support industries that have proven themselves capable of growing on the export front and, in so doing, create additional jobs. Do not run away from your responsibilities, face up to them. Embrace the amendment before us, support regional Australia, and vote for jobs in regional Australia.",50
43,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I rise again to speak in the debate on this bill, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, because this issue is important for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to understand, and it is important for his backbench to understand too, if only they were here. I noticed in the debate on the second reading that the only speaker they have had in this debate today was the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). He was forced to get up in the debate because of the prodding of him by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). Mr Moore--Batman!",51
44,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,I am catching the David Kemp disease. I say sorry to my very good friendMr Martin Ferguson-You don't doctor the figures so you haven't got that disease yet.,52
45,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Absolutely right. The member for Bendigo could last only 10 minutes on this debate and part of that was talking about the art gallery in Bendigo. What has that got to do with the books bounty? I suppose there will be fewer books on art in the library because they will not be published in Australia. But that was the member for Bendigo's contribution. The member for Bendigo happens to have Maryborough in his electorate and he was claiming some credit for getting some gas reticulation into the city. Do you know what industry is the biggest employer of people in Maryborough? Of an employment base of 2,400 employees in Maryborough, 600 of them are employed in the book publishing industry, an industry that was not there before the books bounty commenced. One quarter of the town's work force is employed in the book publishing industry. We heard the member for Bendigo say how he had made representations on thisMr Martin Ferguson-He wrote a letter!",52
46,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I tell you what, he only wrote the representations and had the meeting because he was embarrassed into it. Do you know what he did after he got the representations? He went to New York for four weeks. The only thing he was doing in terms of books in New York was getting an up-to-date copy of the New York Review of Books. This is the member for Bendigo representing the so-called industry in his electorate. What a pathetic effort! Where is he now? Where is he now in this debate demonstrating what he is prepared to do from here? The fact of the matter is that it was only because Labor took this issue up that we have got some progress in restitution of the bounty. If the member for Bendigo is serious about representing his constituency, he will be in here supporting our position because our position is to support full restitution of the bounty and then to have an inquiry. Let the member for Bendigo understand that he is voting against jobs in Maryborough today. He is voting against jobs in his electorate. He is betraying his electorate. He is betraying them because he is not prepared to stand up in this chamber, stand up to you, stand up to that ideologically driven front bench, and stand up to the Treasurer. Minister, we know that you want to stand up to the Treasurer (Mr Costello). You relish the fact that you can beat him in these little debates from time to time because we know you do not like Victorians. You are a Queenslander in the Liberal Party and you do not like Victorians. He does not like them. He is on record as saying he does not like the Victorians, so any time he can beat the Victorians, he loves it. Here is your chance to do the Treasurer. You get two hits at once, you get jobs in Maryborough for your friend in Bendigo and you also do your Treasurer. Why won't you stand up for Australian industry? Why won't you support jobs? Why won't the member for Bendigo come into this House and support the people of Maryborough? The fact of the matter is he is running scared. He is not prepared to stick up for the people of Maryborough and they will remember that at the time of the next election. Let me say to you, Minister, what the industry has said about your decision. MCGraw-Hill, one of the largest book publishers in this country, said that there is no doubt that substantial damage has already been done since the budget announcement of 20 August. They go on to thank the Labor Party for the support they got from us in having this decision partially reversed. But what you need to do is to fully reverse it because what you have done is to cause damage which can only be repaired if you enable the industry to get back to a position in which it can have full opportunity to plan, to invest, to get the jobs back in this industry in a way that continues to trend. The real problem for you, Minister, is this. You have a target of 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing but you are introducing policies that will see jobs disappear. They have already started to disappear and they will disappear because you are dismantling programs that saw the growth of jobs in the manufacturing industry. One quarter of the work force of Maryborough is at risk here. (Time expired)",52
47,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PAIRS,"Here is a real chance for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to draw the line. We read in the paper from time to time about his so-called industry policy . We also read in the paper from time to time about his desire to stand side by side with industry to make sure that not only are they capable of growing on the export front, but also capable of increasing job opportunities in Australia. But the problem is that every time there has been a fight in cabinet to date he has thrown the towel in. He has only been forced to make some concessions as a result of a huge community campaign where the impact has been too high for the government to suffer with respect to their potential electoral prospects. That is why, for example, some changes have already occurred with the bounty legislation. I take the view that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is not associated, in his heart, with the anti-jobs group that is running the cabinet at the moment. He does not want to be associated with people such as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) who have no concerns for mainstream Australia. Under it all, he accepts the need for an industry policy. That is what he keeps telling all the industry groups about. That is why he keeps giving them, under the lap, a campaign strategy to take on the Treasurer and his cohorts in cabinet, the anti-jobs group that dominates cabinet at the moment. We are lucky. Some of the opposition have been able to get hold of that strategy about where the pressure points are and who you have to pressure to achieve a change in government policy to protect industry and to protect jobs. I am saying to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism today, 'Look my friend, look my mate, we are with you,' but you have to have a bit of Dutch courage. Maybe we ought to have this debate after lunch, then you can come back in here reinforced with a desire to fight on-to go for the jugular, to stand up for Australian jobs, to stand up for industry and to stand up for Maryborough because you need a helping hand. I think you want to win, but in some ways you have adopted the view, 'I am in my last term of parliament. I have proven that I can be a minister again.' With all due respects to the minister, it is not just about the perks and lurks of a ministerial officer; it is really about delivering out there for mainstream Australia. What they are concerned about-I am sure their polling is showing this-is a sense of security with respect to jobs and their ability to look after their families. The minister has to take a stand. He has lost all the fights to date on industry policy. What happened to the tax incentive for research and development? Lost that fight. What happened to the export market development grants scheme or the development import finance facility? Threw the towel in again. Stand up and be counted. Support our amendment on the books bounty. Do something about jobs in regional Australia. Do something about our young people. Say to the member for Bendigo, 'Look, don't hide in the comer any longer. Come in here, exercise a bit of courage and put your hand up.' Cross the floor and vote for your local community; cross the floor and vote for the security of the 25 per cent of jobs that exist in Maryborough; cross the floor and vote for companies which have a proven track record of being able to deliver the goods, deliver exports and deliver jobs. That is what it is about. Don't be part of the anti-jobs group that is dominating cabinet at the moment. It is not in your heart. You know better. Embrace the amendment. Adopt a bit of Dutch courage. If you want, we will delay the debate until after lunch so that you can come in here reinforced with the desire to fight. The coalition's abolition of the books bounty six months ahead of its expiry date is wrong. It potentially means 15,000 job losses with a particularly severe impact on regional centres. In all seriousness, this is an amen 0ment that ought to be seriously considered. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism knows it in his own heart. Stand with us. Vote for regional Australia. Vote for jobs and vote for industry that has a future.",53
48,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"We have already indicated that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), if he has a conscience at all and if he has the interests of his constituThat ency at heart, should be voting with us on this Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. But there is another that should be voting with us, Minister: the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). The problem is that jobs have been lost in South Australia as a result of this ridiculous decision of the government to axe the books bounty. Three hundred jobs have been lost at Griffin Press as a result of the decision you took on budget night. It is not just us expressing concern about the ideological drive that is taking you forward in this way, your inability to win an argument in cabinet. You really support us. That is why you are out there having meetings with the textile industry, telling them, cannot win an argument in cabinet. Cabinet is full of dries. I am the only wet amongst those dries.' He goes along to these meetings and says these things: 'I will tell you what to do. We will get a campaign running. I will help you in this campaign because we have really got to do these fellows in Treasury. We have really got to do these ideologues, because I am on your side.' But the trouble is that he cannot stand up to the people in cabinet. He cannot win an argument in cabinet so he has to resort to cloak and dagger stuff to try to get support for his positions. Three hundred jobs lost in Griffin Press in Adelaide, and what did the member for Kingston have to say about it? Very interesting if you read the Advertiser of today, which says with regard to the member for Kingston: The Member for Kingston, Ms Sue Jeanes, yesterday urged the Government to be more critical of the advice it received in preparing its second Budget. She said cuts to industry assistance in last year's Budget had already hurt the State ... and any further cuts could destroy the local economy. ""Economic rationalism is becoming our nation's newest form of cancer,"" she said. But she said the Government's focus on fixing the economy needed to be balanced by a commitment to spending money on jobs and industry-"" ... governments have a very legitimate role to play in supporting industries, and we haven't focused on our manufacturing sector enough. is under today's date. That is the member for Kingston. That is another one of your backbenchers who is not in this chamber today. She is prepared to go to the press and get a headline but she is not prepared to vote for South Australia in this chamber. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) will not stand up for the workers in Maryborough and now the member for Kingston wants to get a story in the paper expressing concern but will not support the policies that will help the people in her state. That is why I say that they are hypocritical. They know that what the Labor party is pursuing on these issues is correct. They know that they should be supporting our 'I amendments. They are hoping that pressure can be kept on this government to reverse its decision even further, but they have not got the courage to vote with us in this chamber. They are the people that claim that they vote for and represent constituencies but they are hidebound by the rigidity of their position and not allowed to vote as they really believe that they should. The fact of the matter is that industry policy under this government is in chaos. It is in chaos because the member is incapable of articulating a vision. In fact, listening to him on a lot of things, I think he is incapable of articulating anything. But he is certainly incapable of articulating a vision for manufacturing industry. Not only has he been condemned by every industry group in this country, but he has now got lO of the top chief executive officers of the country condemning the lack of vision and the lack of support for industry. The fact of the matter is that this decision today that he is putting forward is another nail in the coffin for one of Australia's successful manufacturing industries. It is a nail in the coffin for regional development; it is a nail in the coffin for jobs in Maryborough, in Geelong, in Adelaide-and you do not care. The problem is that you have made a commitment to getting jobs but you are introducing policies that will see them disappear. The Labor Party will oppose the amendment that you are putting forward, Minister, because it is the wrong decision. It breaks promises, it is unsoundly based and, most of all, it is anti-regions and it is anti-jobs. It will not support the manufacturing industry in this country which has grown so significantly because of the policies that Labor had in place. We oppose the amendments and call on those on the other side who say they share a belief in this view to join us in so opposing. (Time expired) Item 1 omitted.",54
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question now is that the item proposed to be inserted be inserted.,55
50,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"This is the most important part of this amendment because it reduces the period for this bounty back six months. For the paltry sum of $4 million, this government is going to place in jeopardy many jobs in the printing industry and the fact is that there has been no argument put in this debate. No argument has been put by the minister in this consideration in detail stage about any rationale for not keeping the bounty until 31 December 1997. There has been no attempt by the minister to give any full explanation of why that is so. He relies on the joint press release he made with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) but that has no explanation of why the bounty period is to be reduced by six months. Here we have an argument in this chamber over bringing the expiration of the bounty back from 31 December to 30 June 1997. As my colleagues, the members for Hotham (Mr Crean) and Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), have indicated, what the minister has to understand is the regional consequences of the decision that his government is involved in. We have acknowledged that perhaps these are decisions that do not rest easy with him, perhaps these are decisions for which he argued a different case and lost but the simple fact is that on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill-the original bill-the only basis for it was as part of the budgetary strategy of the government for fiscal consolidation. I see the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) in the chamber. Perhaps he has been flushed out by the efforts of the honourable members for Hotham and Batman but perhaps he will take this opportunity to tell us how he is going to defend the workers of Maryborough. It is important in this debate that a member like the member from Bendigo comes before us to defend those workers from Maryborough that are likely to lose their jobs. The thing that we wish to see is the response from the minister on this point. He sat there, babbling away, interjecting, not putting any concrete case to justify either the original decision or the ensuing backflip. Why is the six-month period so important? Obviously it is only important because of the budget bottom line and the $4 million that it is likely to save in the budget. That is just not good enough for the people of Maryborough where the printing industry employs something like 25 per cent of the township's employment force. They need answers from the government about the alternatives. What are the alternatives? Simply put, the overall macro settings that they rely upon have not eventuated into jobs. What the Australian community is looking for is Australian jobs. This is an argument about Australian jobs. What we need to see from the minister today is some indication of what it is that he is arguing in cabinet against those cabinet ministers who are from the dry faction of his party and are very much anti-job. What the minister needs to understand is that these policy matters are complicated. In the Australian Financial Review of Friday, the Australian Publishers Association put a proposition. The Australian Publishers Association's proposition was based on the fact that the cost to the budget of the government's policy is likely to be $28.6 million over 12 months based on the lower tax revenue and the higher unemployment. Unfortunately, that association's solution is to ask that the tariff on imported paper should be removed at the same time that this bounty is decreased. Which state would be most affected if this tariff was removed? Which state would be the most affected? Tasmania. So, in juggling the regions we are going to trade one region off against another. This is the whole problem. When the Productivity Commission legislation was before us and the opposition said that the Productivity Commission should take into seat. account the regional aspects of policy ideas, the Minister denied that that should be part the Productivity Commission's considerations. The survival of the regions is dependent on this. (Time expired)",55
51,Mr REID,PAIRS,"I want respond to the sheer hypocrisy that was exhibited by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and by the member for Batman Martin Ferguson). They have very short memories. Tell us what happened during the Whitlam years when the then Labor government cut tariffs by a massive amount in textile, clothing and footwear arena destroyed thousands of jobs. Tell us about the 25,000 jobs that have been lost in the motor industry as a result of the activities of Labor government. I want to draw the House's attention to the legislation that was introduced in 1992 by ALP. The Australian Labor Party, when in government, introduced a bill into following an Industry Commission report in 1992, to abolish all book bounties. The member for Hotham was probably involved with the ACTU at that time, as was the member for Batman. Neither of them spoke out rolled over and allowed that bill to come forward. No-one on the government's side at that time spoke out on behalf of Maryborough. However, the member for Bendigo and the member for Barker spoke out and we got the government to back off and make a change to that legislation. They accepted amendments. I am amazed by the sheer this hypocrisy of the members for Batman and Hotham on this particular issue. They are tariff cutters. Where were they in 1992? They were with the ACTU rolling overMr Crean-I was here in 1992. Don't you remember?",56
52,Mr REID,PAIRS,"No, I do not. You probably did nothing here. Mr Crean-I got to the front bench and you haven't, you goose!",56
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Hotham, resume your",56
54,Mr REID,PAIRS,It is quite obvious that the two of members concerned have had a massive loss of memory since 1992. The member for Hotham has just admitted that he was here in the chamber supporting that legislation introduced by his party to abolish the bounties into 1992. He was a member here. He was supporting the legislation. I did not notice him crossing the floor in 1992. Where were you? (Mr You were not crossing the floor.,56
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! We are dealing with an amendment before the House. the Members addressing the amendment should and keep their remarks to that amendment.,56
56,Mr REID,PAIRS,"I am endeavouring to, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am being provoked by the the interjections made by the member for Hotham who openly admitted that he was present when the Labor government introduced a bill in 1992 and he supported it. That the bill was to abolish the bounties. I put that before the House because he admitted in the this House, House that he was here.",56
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Hotham, on a point of order.",56
58,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,It is true that I supported lots of bills in 1992. Which bill are you specificalat the time. They ly referring to?,56
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There is no point of order.,56
60,Mr REID,PAIRS,The minister at the table has been very helpful on this particular issue. I have made representations to him about the our Maryborough industries and the effect that bill might have on them. The minister has given an undertaking that he will have a look the at the situation in regard to the tariff on inputs. I accept that commitment from the minister.,56
61,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PAIRS,"I am pleased that the member for unemployment-I should say the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid)-has found his way into the chamber! The member for Bendigo has just returned from viewing the art galleries of New York, and yet he has walked away from a promise given to the electorate of Bendigo prior to the last election to construct an art gallery in Bendigo. The people of Bendigo cannot go to New York to look at art galleries. The art gallery that was promised to them by the member for Bendigo is still in never-never land. The real question is: will the member for Bendigo vote against this bill? Will the member for Bendigo stand up for local jobs? If he does not vote against this bill the simple message to the electorate of Bendigo will be that the member for Bendigo is guilty of destroying local jobs. That is what it is about. It is about whether or not he is prepared to stand up for his electorate. It is about whether or not he is prepared to stand up for local jobs. It is about whether or not he is prepared to stand up for the town of Maryborough. I know he wishes that the town of Maryborough were in Queensland, but it is in his electorate. For the member for Bendigo-and I know he likes to occupy the chair-it was not a great issue moving the Speaker's chair from Old Parliament House to this House at a cost of $500,000. I put it to him that to vote with us will effectively mean that an additional $4 million this financial year will be allocated giving assistance, especially to jobs, in regional Australia. I believe that the member for Bendigo ought to stand with us. I am more concerned with jobs in Maryborough than jobs offshore in Indonesia or the Philippines. That is what we are really talking about. Are we going to have jobs in Maryborough, Bendigo, Ballarat, Townsville, Cairns and Dubbo, or are we going to give jobs to Indonesia and the Philippines? That is what you are voting for today. That is what you will be guilty of if you vote with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). What the member for Bendigo has got to think about is whether to vote for jobs for Australians or for jobs offshore. There is only one way he should vote. He should vote against the government. He should cross the floor and stand side by side with the electors of Bendigo. It is important, not just because of the jobs that are part and parcel of the town of Maryborough and the book industry, but the real problem the government has to consider is the multiplier effect that those jobs create in the local region. Jobs in those towns are more important than jobs in Indonesia or the Philippines. The book bounty has a multiplier effect in the economy in the order of 13 times the initial outlay. It is not a cost, it is an investment-13 times the return for the initial outlay. Even the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism would consider that a pretty good investment! We know he is not a bad investment manager. Maybe he ought to think about investing in these plants. I am sure that would give him a bigger return than some of the blind activities he is now conducting in the share market through some of his mates. Unemployment of the order of 10.5 per cent in Bendigo is intolerable. The member for Bendigo ought to stand up and be counted. He ought to be the voice of the town of Maryborough. He ought to be prepared to stand up and say that youth unemployment is a major problem in his electorate. He ought to be prepared to say that he is concerned about the chronic loss of jobs in his electorate. He ought to walk down View Street and to say, 'I am going to fight,' rather than write yet another letter. I understand he has just about run out of stamps. He writes a lot of letters, but he cannot put up his hand when it comes to voting. I am prepared to vote for an additional stamp allowance so that he can write a few more letters, but on this occasion he should put his hand up and vote with his feet rather than run away from his responsibilities! It is all about voting with your feet and standing up for your electorate, not writing letters. The member for Bendigo should be voting for the art gallery in View Street, Bendigo. He should be voting for the book bounty so there are jobs in Maryborough. He should be voting to reduce unemployment, which is over 10 per cent in his electorate at the moment. He should be voting for regional Australia. He should be voting for families. He should not be running away from his responsibilities, as he has consistently done since he was elected to this parliament in 1990.",57
62,Mr REID,PAIRS,"I welcome the opportunity to respond to the challenge from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). As a member of the ACTU, the member for Batman was running away at 100 miles an hour when the Whitlam government was abolishing tariffs, and he was remarkably silent on the book bounty when the book bounty legislation came before this House in 1992. There was not one word on behalf of the workers whom he was supposed to represent. When you think back to that 1992 legislation as a result of the Industry Commission report, it was not worth one word in their defence. It is all very well for the member for Batman to raise a whole range of other issues. He raised the Bendigo art gallery. The only person who promised $2 million to the gallery  the time. And what did he do? Did he provide a dollar? Not one lousy dollar did the former Prime Minister provide. Nor did he put it in  made this promise, he was actually the Prime Minister and in control of the Treasury. I want to get back to the bill because the allegation from the member for Batman is that the book bounty should be retained. I put a proposition to the minister and the minister has agreed to look at it. That is more constructive than the ALP has been. The proposal I put to the minister was put to me by the Australian Publishers Association who believe that there should be a correction on the other side of the ledger that would be related to the tariff on inputs into the industry. The minister has given an undertaking that he will look at that situation and I will be anxiously looking towards what outcomes that provides. I can assure the House that this is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the Labor Party. After all of their years of cutting tariffs one after the other while supposedly looking after the employees in various industries, just remember that 25,000 jobs were lost in the motor industry during that time. And now you come out and try and make some capital out of this. The minister has taken note of the comments I have made on tariffs on inputs. I will be monitoring that situation on behalf of two very important industries in my electorate.",58
63,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) writes the letters. He is the new Alastair Cooke, Letters from America-not letters from Bendigo, letters to the minister from New York. When the member for Batman was talking about View Street, he got out the old New York street directory because he had been so used to traipsing around there getting used to his new lifestyle that he had forgotten about Maryborough. Let me just come to some of the issues that the member for Bendigo has raised. He talks about the loss of memory and about the fact that I, in this House, supported a resolution to abolish the books bounty. I think that this is what he was inferring, although he never quite stated it because he did not know what he was talking about. In 1992, the Labor government did propose the abolition of the books bounty. But it did not do it and do you know why? The member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) and the member for Hotham were in there saying, 'Don't do it,' and it was not done. That is why the book bounty exists. I say to the member for Bendigo that if the book bounty had been abolished, why would we be up dealing with it today? The only people seeking to abolish it are the Liberals, aided and abetted by the member for Bendigo. The question of the art gallery in Bendigo is really getting under the guard of the member for Bendigo. You try to say that the former Prime Minister promised the $2 million. He did, but so did you. You went to the press and said, 'We need to be able to match this promise.' You promised them $2 million. Do you know what? He then got the Treasurer (Mr Costello) out, and the Treasurer said, 'We are not going to give you that $2 million but we will fund a feasibility study and we will give you $100,000.' This is the Alan Bond solution. This is payment of 5c in the dollar. That is your treatment of the electorate of Bendigo. That is your approach. You promised them $2 million, and you gave them $100,000. You are a disgrace. You are a disgrace to the electorate of Bendigo, because you will not stand up for them. I make this further point. You talked about what Labor did in 1975 and did under the tariff plans that Labor introduced for textiles and clothing. None of the companies that we visited the other day-Empire Rubber, Stafford Ellinson, ADA-would have been in existence had it not been for Labor's automotive and textile plans. You go and talk to them. Your problem is that it is a bit expensive to make the long distance phone call from New York, and they will not pick it up, in your case. You are irrelevant because you cannot do anything for Bendigo. You cannot deliver the art gallery. You cannot deliver jobs in Maryborough. You cannot support the ongoing plans for the automotive industry. Go and talk to the component facturers. Go and talk to BTR-who run Empire Rubber, in case you did not know. Go and talk to Stafford Ellinson. Go and talk to the Australian defence establishments who have introduced state-of-the art clothing, have invested in technology and in the future, and who have actually made a commitment the region based on the certainty that our tariff plans produced. We understood importance of reducing tariffs to make internationally competitive but we also stood the importance of getting companies into overseas markets. In other words, our market is too small Australia. The market that we have got to participate in is the global market, but cannot do that by dismantling tariffs unilaterourable ally and giving no support to get into exports. That is what our approach on industry policy is. That is what you have dismantled, and is what the books bounty has dismantled. That is why jobs are threatened in Maryborough. That is why, unless you back our positiontion the majority position-in terms of cars, the jobs at Empire Rubber will be threatened; that is why, if you go down the same crazy route in terms of textiles and clothing, Stafford Ellinson and ADA will be under threat. I ask you, as the member for Bendigo, when are you going to stand up for your constituency? Are you in retirement now? I can see you jumping to your feet. Why did you only take 10 minutes? I have still got a bit more time, and I will have some more. Why did you go to New York when this issue was on? Why did you desert the constituency, and why will you not cross the floor on this amendment? If you have got any commitment to Bendigo, you will vote with us. If you do not, you are only going to betray them.",58
64,Mr REID,PAIRS,"I welcome the opportunity to respond further to the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who has finally got to the nub of the issue. He has now openly admitted in this House that the ALP government introduced legislation to abolish the book bounty in 1992. Mr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented. I did not say that. Get him to go and parts manucheck the record.",59
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There is no point of order.,59
66,Mr REID,PAIRS,"Finally, the member for Hotwho ham has admitted that the ALP introduced legislation to abolish it, and now he claims to that he and a number of other members worked hard behind the scenes. I can tell the the House that the member for Barker (Mr us MCLachlan) and I constructed some amendunderments, and those amendments were forced onto the government. The attitude of the present government has always been that the in former Prime Minister did not worry about buying local products; he bought Italian suits you and French clocks. I wonder where the honmember for Hotham purchases his suits. I am proud to say that I purchase my suits in my own electorate made at Stafford that Ellinson, and I am proud to wear them. I am also pleased that the honourable member for Hotham made his further allegaabout some relationship to Alan Bond. I am not quite sure what that was but perhaps and that might be the same Alan Bond that was out with the former Prime Minister for lunch in Perth? Is it the same proposition as WA Inc. with Brian Burke and David Parker? Look at what the Australian Labor Party did wi h the State Bank of Victoria and Pyramid in Victoria. It is no good the member for Hotham raising those sorts of allegations in a debate about the future of the book printing industry in Australia. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Deputy Speakdebate-I er, I rise on a point of order. We are debating the issue of the book bounty and its relevance to Bendigo. I think you should draw that the attention of the member for Bendigo. want to know his view on the question of undermining the book bounty and its impact on Bendigo.",59
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I ask all members in the debate to make sure that they address the question, which is a rather narrow amendment to the bounty bill.",60
68,Mr REID,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speakister er. I welcome your intervention there. It is very fine for members on the other side of the chamber to have memory lapses about the role that they played in putting forward legislation to abolish the book bounty in industry 1992. Do not worry, the people of Maryborto ough still remember that legislation and people in the book industry remember that legislation. The legislation was introduced the Australian Labor Party to totally remove the book bounty. It is no good members opposite moving away from that position because it is all on the record. They can it as much as they like. In this instance, minister has given an undertaking that he look at the tariff on inputs into the book manufacturing industry. Look at the record of the Australian Labor Party on cutting tariffs and the damage that that has done to the motor car industry. The member for Hotham raised the issue of Australian defence apparel. I have been there many times and I can assure you that they doing an excellent job. Where was the ber for Hotham when they were establishing themselves in that area? He was nowhere to be seen. Mr Crean-We supported them fully, you great goose.",60
69,Mr REID,PAIRS,"He says they supported them but I am afraid the facts do not bear that out, nor do the facts-{Time expired)",60
70,Mr BEDDALL,PAIRS,"Rankin) (1.48 p.m.)When I saw this Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill debate listed on the monitorobviously, it was not meant to be a very long recalled being invited, as the minister in 1992, by that prominent local citizen from the electorate of Bendigo, Joe to Helper, to go down and talk to people about We the book bounty. When we went and talked to the people about the book bounty, we saw that the proposal that was before the government at the time would damage local industry. As the minister, I came back and talked to the portfolio minister, John Button, about the proposal and the bounty remained. We had effective local representation going to the minister and the minister seeing the merits of the argument. Now here we are; another minhas a proposition to knock over the book all bounty. He should listen to the local people and not knock off this very important bounty. Bounties are important in the way that we build. our local industries. The bookbinding is important in Australia, particularly regional Australia, and I know my colthe league the member for Bendigo is a very dutiful chairman of the House of Representaby tives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and I am his deputy chair. We work closely together on these issues. As the chairman of the House of deny Representatives Standing Committee on the Industry, Science and Technology, he probwill ably has more knowledge than the minister does. What the minister should do is listen to the chairman. The minister should take note of this and give a commitment that he will retain the book bounty, then the member for Bendigo can go back to his electorate and tell them that he has succeeded on their behalf.",60
71,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"The are honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) memhas revealed his Reid plan for the book industry which sounds faintly familiar. It is exactly the case being put by the Australian Publishers Association I suspect. I am amused at the Australian Financial Review report of last Friday because it concludes: Government officials reacted cautiously to the submission yesterday. The coalition is considering the implications of its budget decision to abolish the book bounty without any changes to tariffs on imported paper. If that is the case, this debate gives the minister at the table the opportunity to tell the House, and to tell the industry, how long this consideration will take. But the report in the Australian Financial Review goes on further where it says:",60
72,The APA,PAIRS," that is the Australian Publishers Associationis understood to have support from key coalition backbenchers, several of whom have big printing factories in their regional electorates. I do not know whether it is over flattering to the honourable member for Bendigo to be described as a key coalition backbencher. Perhaps he is not a key coalition backbencher and there are others within the ranks that are supporting the position, but the point is that we have the opportunity in this debate for Minister Moore to tell the House what consideration he has given to this proposition. I remind the minister that the report in the Australian Financial Review, in its brief analysis of the proposition being put by the APA, says that the basis of that submission is that the tariffs on imported paper should be removed. I remind the minister that the report goes on to say that the impact of that will be job losses in Tasmania. The overall effect of the bill that we have before us is to drive Australian jobs offshore; to drive the jobs of those in Maryborough that are working in the print industry offshore to our neighbours in the Asian region. The proposal now being put as a solution to save the jobs of those in Maryborough is to deny the jobs of those in Tasmania. Perhaps there is some forgetfulness in the people that are proposing this, like the honourable member for Bendigo, in that they need to be reminded that, whilst Tasmania might be overseas, Tasmanians' jobs are Australian jobs. We have people like the honourable member for Bendigo who represents a regional centre in Victoria. We have the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) who has an interest in the important regional centre of Geelong. I hope that their submissions to government take into account the effects of the policies of this government on the regions. As the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) indicated, when the proposal was made earlier by a Labor government to remove the book bounty it was consideration of the impact on regional Australia that led to the decision not to go forward with the removal of the bounty. This government seems incapable of understanding that the directions of their policies have to take into account the impact of those policies at the regional level. If one looks at the month to month unemployment figures-and this debate is about jobs, Australian jobs, keeping them in Australia not driving them overseas-the government needs to take into account the regional impacts. We have somebody here from the National Party prattling on about opportunism. There is no opportunism in my position. My interest is the jobs of Australians. That is the paramount consideration. The issue before us in this consideration in detail stage is to ensure that the book bounty continues through to 31 December of this year. At no stage in this debate has there been any justification for removing the bounty after the end of June, because the only justification is the saving of $4 million to the budget bottom line, totally ignoring the impact on employment, especially in regional Australia. (Time expired)",61
73,Mr REID,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) made the point that in 1992, when the legislation introduced by the Labor Party government was before the House, members of the Labor Party visited regional areas of Australia-and, in fact, they did visit me. They carne to Bendigo and Maryborough, as I understand it, but as soon as they came back they tried to force the legislation through the House. They still had the same line after that visit. They still tried to force that legislation through this House. They took absolutely no notice of people in the regional areas of Australia. I am pleased to see that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is coming into the House, because he probably would be aware of the spirited debate at that time. The Labor Party had legislation before the House to abolish all book bounties. There is no escaping that fact. Members of the party went to the central Victorian area, had discusWhy sions and then came back with an even harder line on abolishing book bounties. It was the work of the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and the member for Bendigo that led to those amendments. It was probably because the then government was getting a tremendous amount of opposition at that time because of what was happening in the regional areas of Australia. They did not do it of their own accord. They came into this chamber with an even harder line than they had had. It is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) to speak as they have on this particular issue. In particuMinister lar, the member for Hotham was one of the driving forces behind the original legislation. He was on the front-bench. In other words, he was part of the decision making process supporting what the then government was doing in introducing that legislation which was going to abolish all book bounties. Where was the member for Hotham then? At that time he was a minister-he has admitted that he was a frontbencher-and he was part of the decision making process. Why was he not standing up against the legislation then? He was not supporting the regional areas of Australia then. We are seeing the hypocrisy of both the member for Hotham and the member for Batman who, although he now sits on the front-bench, at that time was involved with the ACTU, and he totally rolled over. He rolled over on this issue. He was not out there defending his workers at that time, and he is in serious bother on this issue. It is sheer hypocrisy for those members to object to it now when they supported the proposal put by the ALP in 1992 to totally abolish the book bounty at that time.",61
74,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I want to know where the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) is. We have dragged the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) in because he sold out his electorate. The member for Kingston is on record as saying, 'The coalition has got no industry policy.' What it has done in dismantling industry programs is economic suicide. is she not in this chamber defending the members of her electorate? The fact of the matter is that the government is into cant and hypocrisy. They want to get headlines in the newspapers, but they will not vote for their electorates when the opportunity arises.",62

He is attending the first ministerial meeting of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation, and tomorrow travels to the Middle East to promote Australian exports of goods and services. In his absence, questions normally directed to him will be answered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). NA Economy Mr GARETH EV ANS-My question is to the Treasurer. How does the Treasurer explain the fact that, as today's national accounts show, the economy during this government's first nine months in office was growing at the rate of just two per cent per annum as compared with the five per cent that we achieved in our last year of office? Does he accept that if he is to meet his budget forecast of 3.5 per cent growth for this financial year the economy is going to have to grow for the remaining six months of this year at the whopping rate of 6.5 per cent? Even if growth is now picking up, as we all sincerely hope it is, do you seriously expect anyone to believe that you are capable of now meeting your budget forecast? If you cannot meet your budget growth forecast, aren't you looking at an even larger black hole for this year than the crater that you had to own up to in your midyear review?",62

78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Would the former ACTO Presidents please stop cutting across the deputy leader's question. Show him some respect, please. He has asked the question. You may not be interested, but some of us are. Mr Crean interjecting",63
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Look, the former ACTO Presidents are not running this show. Neither of you is the deputy leader. Show some respect for the bloke that is. Growth in the December quarter of 0.5 per cent and 3.1 per cent for the year shows that the economy is growing. The 0.5 per cent for the December quarter was totally in line with expectations. Put together with other indicators which have been developing over recent months, it shows a firm footing for the future year. I think the deputy leader asked about his government's record in relation to growth. One of the things I recall the Labor Party boasting about was the record number of positive quarters of growth. You might be interested to know that the figures released today showed a revision to zero growth in the March 1995 quarter. The long, so-called interrupted run that we were always told about has just been revised out of existence. Indeed, the March 1996 quarter was revised downwards from 2.1 per cent to 1.6 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asks why we would see things slowing over the course of 1996. Most people who follow these things closely would know that probably the principal reason for that was the way in which monetary policy was tightened at the end of 1994. It was a deliberate decision by the Labor Party to tighten fiscal policy at the end of 1994 in order to slow growth. The Labor Party was successful in that policy. It was not without its good side, a good side that the Leader of the Opposition likes to refer to. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Treasurer is simply not addressing the key point of the question which was the implications of these figures for the budget outturn for this year and the question of a further black hole. On the subject of relevance, I ask him to turn his mind to that core element of the question.",63
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order is out of order. I invite the Treasurer to conclude.,63
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Of course it is out of order. You asked me about slowing growth in 1996. Mr Gareth Evans-And the implications for your outturn.,63
82,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't know why you don't go and have a chat to the member for Gellibrand and ask him. As he said at the time, in 1994, he wanted to tighten monetary policy to slow down growth. I was going on to say that it was not without its good points because, as the Leader of the Opposition said, it was designed to keep inflation low. It was not without its good points. I am agreeing with the Leader of the Opposition. Where there is a disagreement between you and him, he is invariably right. And that says more about you than it does about him. Investment Projects",63
83,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Recognising that economic development will lead to further job creation, what is the government doing to facilitate an increase in major investment projects in Australia? In particular, what initial steps is the government taking to ensure major national projects are not held up by unnecessary departmental delays?",63
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Since coming to office, the government has followed a coordinated strategy to encourage major investment projects in this country. We have followed policies which have created fiscal and monetary settings which give confidence, encouragement and hope to major investors in Australia. We have set about the process of reducing the cost of doing business in this country. We have passed, after some obstruction from the Labor Party and, initially, from others in the Senate, the Workplace Relations Act, the provisions of which are progressively coming into operation. They provide a far better, a more beckoning and a more benign climate for major projects in this country. The provisions of that act are far more likely to encourage people to invest in this country than did the old industrial relations regime which the new Workplace Relations Act has replaced. We have also set about reforming elements of infrastructure in this country in electricity, gas, water and telecommunications. We have strongly promoted the national competition policy and, of course, we have foreshadowed essential reforms in the area of waterfront and shipping. Some of those reforms have occurred already and others will be tackled during the course of this year. Importantly so far as regional Australia is concerned, we have acted to create certainty of access in some of the resource industries. We have begun and successfully concluded the negotiation of an agreement in the Gippsland area so far as forests are concerned, we are grappling with the difficulties thrown up by the High Court decision in the Wik case, and we have set about rationalising Commonwealth-state responsibilities in environmental policy in order to reduce compliance costs. It is very encouraging to note that business investment in this country has grown by no less than 20 per cent during the past year. As foreshadowed in my statement to parliament at the end of last year, I have established a part-time consultancy position in my office for somebody who will act as a facilitator of major projects. I am delighted to confirm that Mr Bob Mansfield will fill that position. Mr Mansfield is a former Managing Director of Optus, a former Chief Executive with the Fairfax organisation, and he recently carried out a review of the functions and the charter of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He will serve as a part-time consultant attached to my office on the basis of established conditions which have applied to part-time consultants employed by former Prime Ministers. It is anticipated that he will devote, on average, two to three days a week to his new task. His appointment will be for an initial period of 12 months, with scope for extensions if that is the mutual desire of myself and Mr Mansfield. His major task will be to bring about the speedy approval of major nation-building investment proposals which conform with government policy. For the first time, the federal government of this country will have at the elbow of the Prime Minister somebody with strong business experience with a specific brief to cut through the red tape which so often holds up, delays, frustrates and, in the process, destroys jobs that can be created by the coming into being of major investment projects. Our commitment to improve the climate of operation for small business in this country is undoubted and undiminished. There is also a very major role in the future of Australia's economy for the development of major projects attracting large levels of investment, both domestically and from overseas. We need a heightened, more concentrated effort to sweep away the obstruction, the bureaucratic delay, the red tape, the unnecessary obfuscation which is often involved in the process of government approval and determination. I believe Mr Mansfield's appointment will strike a very strong blow in that direction. NA",63
85,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Lord Chadlington and a delegation of parliamentarians from the Republic of France. A very warm welcome to you all and may you enjoy your stay with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Nuclear Waste Reprocessing",64
86,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. I refer to reports that the government is giving serious consideration to the establishment of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Is it not a fact that this would expose thousands of suburban residents of Sutherland Shire who live in the vicinity of Lucas Heights to serious risk arising from the transport of nuclear material through their suburb and to risk from the massive amounts of radioactive waste that would be generated by the plant? Minister, for the sake of these people and our environment, will you now categorically rule out the construction of a reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights?",64
87,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice the shadow minister has taken his lead from a front page story in today's Sydney Morning Herald which reports only what I have been saying for several weeks. There is nothing new, no variation whatever, in the Sydney Morning Herald. If I were uncharitable, I would say the Herald was playing catch-up, as a number of news organisations, as I say, for several weeks have been reporting the government position on this, to the point where the Age had the front page story almost in the same terms three weeks ago. So you are well behind the ball. This is a Labor inheritance. For 13 years you did nothing, so much so that the Sydney Morning Herald, which you are fond of quoting, on 22 August 1994, in a feature article by Leigh Dayton had a headline 'Lack of Policy puts Radioactive Hot Rods on Road to Madness.' The first line of that article says: Australia's policy on the disposal of radioactive waste is definitely not a shambles. Far worse-it doesn't even exist. For 13 years you did absolutely nothing to the point now where 1,600 spent fuel rods will reach the point of storage exhaustion next year and the government must take action. As I said to you to the same type of question, to all intents and purposes the exact question you asked on 28 February, the government has a number of options available to it. It has not decided on one of those options. The question of sites does not arise because we have not decided on the Synroc technology option. Why wouldn't we consider the Synroc technology option? You spent $40 million over the last 13 years developing it up. And what? We spend $40 million of taxpayers' funds and suddenly we are not meant to consider it as an option in the best interests of the Australian community to dispose of this problem of spent fuel rods. Get real! Mr MARTYN EV ANS- Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. To elucidate that answer, will the minister now rule out the option of Lucas Heights?",65
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That was part of the first part of the question. It is technically within the guidelines. I call the minister to address the question.,65
89,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will repeat what I said in the answer and that is simply that the question of sites does not arise because we have not settled on one option over another. National Accounts,65
90,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the outcome of the national accounts released today and what they indicate about Australia's economic prospects in the coming year for Australia and its regions like the region I represent in Gippsland?,65
91,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,65
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before calling the Treasurer, I remind all members that there is too much general discussion in the chamber.",65
93,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. Today, the national accounts showed a 0.5 per cent growth for the December quarter and 3.1 per cent over the course of the year. I note that there were substantial revisions to each of the preceding quarters, including the last quarter of September, although it was the March 1996 quarter that was substantially revised downwards. One of the principal detractions from growth in the December quarter was around one per cent, as a result of strong imports. As I said in the House yesterday, the strong imports were not altogether a bad thing, coming as they did from intermediate and capital goods. What they do, in relation to imports of intermediate goods, which in the quarter increased by 7.7 per cent and capital goods of 4.5 per cent, is to lay down the basis for good investment and good growth over the future year. Taken with more up-to-date indicators, including a very strong rebound in retail trade of 2.7 per cent in January and leading indicators in the housing sector, which show building approvals rising-as I referred to in the House yesterday-what this shows is strengthening growth throughout 1997, low inflation, high business investment, good capital imports and the opportunity, with lower interest rates cutting in over the course of this year, for growth to strengthen throughout the course of 1997-98. Since March 1996, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported 160,000 new jobs in Australia and, on an adjusted basis, there could in fact be up to 200,000 jobs created over the period. The member for MCMillan also asked about the implications for the regions of Australia. In relation to his area, the regions of Australissues is, he would know that it has been this government's stand in relation to forest and forestry agreement which has given wonderful job opportunities which were denied by our predecessor governments down in his area. He would also know that, over the course of this year, this government will put in place the most exciting environmental development Australia has ever seen--opposed by the Labor Party, I regret to say-and put in place by a government that is concerned about the environment; a $1 billion environmental trust to rebuild the environment of Australia. It is something that this government, I believe, and this Prime Minister, if I may say so, will be able to look back on in decades to come and say that the government in 1996 had the courage to put this trust together-one of the most long-sighted environmental developments that we have ever seen in this country and, I regret to say, opposed by the Labor Party root and branch at every step that we took to put in place this environmental trust. That will be of enormous benefit, I believe, to the regions of Australia as we go about rebuilding the infrastructure, as we go about revegetating Australia and as we go about cleaning up the rivers. The member for MCMillan, I believe, will be proud that his electorate has been treated so well by a visionary initiative of this government which will grow and prosper for decades to come. Double Orphan Pension",65
94,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs representing the Minister for Social Security. Given that people who are called on to care for orphaned children have vastly different levels of income, does the minister consider the current rate for the double orphan pension of $37.50 per fortnight adequate?",66
95,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will have a look at the points that are raised by the honourable member and refer them to the Minister for Social Security for elaboration. Particular issues in relation to the adequacy of benefits are reviewed in the budget context. The government is not dealing with those sorts of in a public context at the moment. Airports: Sale Process,66
96,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of recent media speculation in relation to the sales process for Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane airports? Minister, what stage has the sale process reached and what is the next stage?",66
97,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. There have been a number of recent media reports in respect of the sale process for the long-term leases of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports. I am pleased to say that we have received a total of 18 individual, strong, competitive and high quality bids from nine consortia. Each of those bids has been thoroughly reviewed by the asset sales team, which includes BZW-the government's advisers-against a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria based on the government's stated sales and ongoing privatisation objectives. The long-term lease of airports will maximise efficient airport operations and it will facilitate future airport development on a commercial basis. The evaluation criteria for the bids included the price, ownership diversity, contribution to regional development, airport management capacity, airport development plans, awareness of environmental issues and consideration of the interests of the stakeholders of these airports, including the customers and local and state governments. Following that extensive and exhaustive evaluation process, the government, as flagged as an option in the tender documentation issued to the bidders, has decided to leave 13 individual bids, from six of the bidding consortia, on the table for the next stage of the process. Revised bids from the short-listed bidders for one or more of the airports are to be submitted by mid-April following access to due diligence information and meetings with the government sales team. Completion for each airport is expected to be undertaken in sequence. The sequence will be determined after receipt of the revised bids. I acknowledge the contribution in this process made by the opposition, particularly by the former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition, who actually commenced this process. We all know that he was a strong supporter of privatisation when he was the Minister for Finance. I am not so sure that new Labor shares the same support that the Leader of the Opposition formerly gave. I noted that the honourable member for Melbourne in a recent speech to CEDA made it very clear that he had a different view from what old Labor's view on privatisation was. I sincerely hope that his view does not come through in the end. I am confident, however, that over the next few months we will draw the sale of the first phase airports to a very successful conclusion in the interests of the people of Australia. High Court",66
98,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. Yesterday in discussing a replacement for the Chief Justice of the High Court, who will retire next year, the Deputy Prime Minister said, 'I'm looking, as one involved, for a capital 'C'. conservative person.' Attorney, as the person responsible for the appointment, will you stand up to the Deputy Prime Minister and insist on an appointment based solely on merit? Further, will you give an absolute assurance to the House that potential appointees will not be required to face a political examination or be asked by you or any of your colleagues regarding their attitude to any matter which may come before the court? Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting",67
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Batman!,67
100,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question of the appointment of the Chief Justice of Australia is one I think all members on both sides of the House would regard as very important. What we want to do in seeking a replacement for the current Chief Justice when he retires is to make sure that we get the best person for the job-a person who is eminent, has the appropriate expertise to do the job and can provide leadership both to the High Court and to the Australian judiciary generally. Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting",67
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Batman.,67
102,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Commonwealth legislation obliges the federal Attorney-General to consult with state and territory Attorneys General. Under Labor, at times that consultation was a somewhat perfunctory performance.",67

104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison will cease interjecting.,67
105,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I propose that the consultation on any appointment to the High Court in which I am involved should be of the widest possible kind, and the decision will be taken by the cabinet with a capital 'C'. Parliamentarians' Entitlements",67
106,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the minister inform the House what steps he has taken to tighten accountability in the use of parliamentarians' entitlements?,67
107,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In December last year, before all this current focus on entitlements, I requested my department to review the reporting systems with the aim of eliminating any deficiencies. I think all in this place would agree that what we need is better information to help both members and senators manage their entitlements and to enable us to detect any problems in the use of entitlements. So the department is about to engage a consultant to assist with this priority task. Most of the work has been done. I have also asked my department to consult with the parliamentary departments which pay the travel allowance entitlements of senators and members on the feasibility of instituting facilities to crosscheck claims against records of official travel held by the department. In addition, I have invited KPMG, which under Ken Baxter is reviewing the DAS structure, to include in its review the administration of entitlements by the department and to make recommendations for further enhancing accountability procedures. Once we get these procedures in place, we will have a much better system of knowing exactly what is going on. I take some objection to the fact that at moment we seem to be burdened with having to do all this. It is a bit like the big black hole: the allegations that are being made in the Senate at the moment basically happened under the former administration and now we are being left with the situation of having to clean it up. Let me just say that we are going to clean it up and we are not going to give any comfort to those who are found to have undertaken any impropriety in the use of their entitlements. I also say this: we will not do so at the expense of natural justice. It is all right for members of the opposition to sit over there and make these comments, but the reality is that these allegations happened when you were in government and you did absolutely nothing about it. We have had a Leader of the Opposition who has got on television nightly and made the claims that he is all about natural justice. But we get daily doses of muck-up in this place and unsubstantiated allegations-and we are expected to cop this. In the meantime, this place is being denigrated and each and every member of this place is being denigrated. As I said yesterday, most people in this place are absolutely honest. What are you trying to do to this institution? My appeal to the Leader of the Opposition would be to at last try to show some leadership, let natural justice run its course and let us get rid of this as fast as we possibly can. Mr Tanner-What about your bucket on Swan? What about what you said about Wayne Swan? You can throw it around like anybody else.",67
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Melbourne.,68
109,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because of the carry-on that is going on over there, I would like to respond to what the Treasurer said yesterday. He said that he did not know what the ALP stood for: by the way you are carrying on and by what is happening upstairs, 'ALP' obviously stands for allegations, lynchings and persecutions.",68
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order and it goes to relevance, Mr Speaker. The man who was up there moralising was slinging the rubbish at Wayne Swan in this place at the beginning of last year. He has absolutely no credibility at all.",68

115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor. Legal Aid,68
116,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Attorney-General. Is the Attorney aware that thousands of mainstream Australians are demonstrating today against the government's destruction of our legal aid system? Does the Attorney recall telling the House yesterday that the Queensland government will enter into an agency agreement to deliver Commonwealth legal aid in that state, which, the Attorney added, 'is exactly what we were seeking'? Isn't it a fact that, on 10 January this year, the Attorney wrote to all state and territory Attorneys-General advising that his preference was to continue the present cooperative agreements in a revised form, as the government now proposes to do with the ACT? Isn't the legal aid system now in chaos because of the Attorney's inconsistent statements and his inability to win an argument in cabinet?",68
117,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are two things wrong with legal aid. One is that the Labor government allowed the system to drift for 10 years under out-of-date agreements. The other arose out of the budget deficit black hole, which required cutting of programs like legal aid. The honourable member for Banks has, I know, a genuine interest in legal aid, but I am surprised he does not have a greater interest in Aboriginal legal aid, about which he has not asked any questions at all. Let me deal first with the question relating to Queensland. Queensland announced yesterday, completely consistent with what we have been seeking, that they will have a system under which they will be accountable for state funding provided for state matters, which enables us to join with them in a cooperative delivery of legal aid services in Queensland on the basis that the Commonwealth is accountable for funding for Commonwealth legal matters. That is exactly what we set out to achieve. We have maintained the present cooperative arrangement in Queensland by having a onestop shop. A one-stop shop provides the service. All the Commonwealth money is spent through the one service and all the state money is spent through the one service. We are having negotiations with a number of jurisdictions and we have reached broad agreement with two of them. We are progressing negotiations on a daily basis. For the member for Banks to suggest the system is therefore in chaos or crisis I think suggests that his motives are not consistent with the interests of legal aid clients. Let's behind getting the system working in a way that enables governments to account to legal aid clients. Let's reform the system so that the old-fashioned delivery service that went for some 10 years under Labor is removed and so that we have an efficient system whereby the legal aid dollar is spread and we don't have a system under which 70 per cent of funding for referrals goes to only 20 per cent of cases. Human Cloning",69
118,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of the announcement by President Clinton that the US government will not be approving funds for research involving human cloning experimentation? Can the minister confirm that human cloning experimentation is currently not permissible in Australia under National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines? Will the government ensure that these guidelines remain in place?,69
119,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been very substantial interest in newspapers and magazines over recent weeks in this issue after the announcement that, at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, a sheep had been successfully cloned. Cloning is nothing new. It was first achieved in 1952 in tadpoles. But what is new is that it has been successful in higher animals. Two days ago it was announced at the Oregon Primate Research Centre in the United States that a monkey had been successfully cloned and it was on the basis of this that President Clinton announced overnight that federal funding would not be available for research into human cloning. He was responding to a situation that exists in the United States. The situation in Australia is different, as I will outline in a moment. Of course, the problem for society is that the technology of cloning and its experimentation are progressing at a much faster rate than that at which society can contemplate the scientific, social or ethical implications of such experiments. It has been given more urgency because the cloning of a primate is get something very significant as it is the species most close to the human race genetically. It is very difficult to contemplate what the long term prospects might be. The situation in Australia basically has three points to it. The first is that, under NHMRC guidelines, human experimentation with the aim of producing two or more genetically identical offspring, which is in fact cloning, is prohibited. The NHMRC has the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a subcommittee which has published ethical guidelines on assisted reproductive technology. These were tabled in parliament in November last year. The NHMRC is of the view that such experimentation is unethical. It would not be funded under the National Health and Medical Research Council. The other great body of funding in Australia is the Australian Research Council and they take note of the NHMRC guidelines. The NHMRC also has a statement on human experimentation. Supplementary note 7 has been issued to that. It prohibits gene therapy that has the potential to change the genetic material that can be passed on from one generation to another. Human cloning is governed by state law. The Commonwealth does not have the right to legislate in this area. In Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria it is illegal. However, in the other states and territories what is not covered by the NHMRC or the Australian Research Council would almost certainly be found to be unethical through either hospital or other research institute guidelines. I can assure honourable members that the government is of the view that experimentation on human cloning is beyond the bounds of what are acceptable guidelines. The National Health and Medical Research Council is aware of our view. NA",69
120,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we now have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Argentine Republic. On behalf of the parliament and the people of Australia a very warm welcome to you. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Sugar Industry",70
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that Australia's Uruguay Round obligation for sugar is a tariff of $70 per tonne by the year 2000? Is it not the case that the current tariff, abolished by the government yesterday at $55 per tonnean effective 13 per cent-is comfortably within that obligation? Is it not the case that the sugar tariff on many of our export destinations is massively higher than that? For example, the US is at 100 per cent, Thailand is at 104 per cent and the European Union is at 170 per cent. How does the government's establishment of a zero sugar tariff for Australia stand with the Prime Minister's statement to the parliament last year that the government would take into account what other countries are doing or, as the Australian Financial Review put it, 'PM says we won't go it alone on tariff cuts'? Why has the government given our trading partners something for nothing on sugar?",70
122,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,70
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is going to respond this question.,70
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is not only an opportunist when it comes to attacking other members of parliament-he leaves it to his bullyboys in the Senate to do it-but he is also a monumental opportunist when it comes to the question of industry policy. If he bothered to examine the structure of the sugar industry he would know that the future of the sugar industry in Australia lies in developing a strong export focus. What the government has done is give the Australian industry a hope of winning a strong export market, and the Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that the package that I brought down yesterday offers greater hope of expanding the exports of Australian industry. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he is going to win any credibility amongst the people who for 13 years his government systematically ignored by some kind of opportunistic and theoretical backflip on tariff policy, he is treating the Australian people with the kind of arrogance and indifference that he displayed when he was in government. By doing it, he is doing absolutely nothing to retrieve his electoral fortunes. What we have done is to give the Australian sugar industry the guarantee of single desk selling. It is a decision that was recommended by the inquiry. It has been endorsed by the Queensland government and welcomed by the Queensland industry. I believe the subsidy measures that we have put in place will be warmly welcomed by the New South Wales section of the industry. I would say to those involved in the industry that if you hope and a future it is to be found in exports and if you want that hope and future do not look in the direction of the Australian Labor Party. Small Business",70
125,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. On behalf of the 6,000 small businesses in my electorate of Wannon as well as those right across Australia, I ask: given that the Labor opposition is talking down the prospects for the economy and, in particular, those for small business, can the minister give us the true state of play with the future of small business and, in particular, the outlook for the coming 12 months?  member for Wannon for his question and for his deep interest in the affairs of small business particularly. It is interesting that the Labor Party seem to be taking such delight in trying to talk down the prospects for small business-basically trying to suppress any good news. So the last couple of weeks would have been a disaster for them. The ABS statistics on building approvals released yesterday say that over the 12 months there has been a 22.5 per cent improvement. In fact, for the month of January it was lOA per cent. For the building industry and the pull through trades that will have a significant effect. I will keep going. Let us look at retail trades. Retail trade figures are showing, seasonally adjusted, a 2.7 per cent improvement. These figures, in accordance with what the Treasurer is saying, build on the improving trend that we are starting to see come through. The Labor Party do not like it. Motormouth over there does not like it one little bit. He does not like it that for 13 years they tried to destroy small business but in the last 12 months we have done one heck of a lot to tum it around. After 13 years of trying to wipe out small business, what is their policy now? What is the policy of new Labor with regard to small business? It is interesting. New Labor had a want Labor review as part of their platform. New Labor reviewed the party platform. On the basis that old Labor tried for 13 years to destroy small business, you would think that new Labor would want to try to do something for small business. New Labor has 15 themes. Mr Costello-What about the ACTU?  is any theme or any policy on small business. Prime MinisterMr Costello-Have any of them ever consistently worked in small business?  worked in small business. In fact, they are about trying to destroy small business. Look, Mr Speaker, the reports that have come out in recent times have built on the industry reports. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants' survey found that small business had positive outcomes; the Yellow Pages survey found that two-thirds expect sales and profits to improve and 57 per cent expected the results of interest rates to improve their business. Let us look at what the ACCI response said, because this is current stuff. The latest survey results show not only is confidence improving but so are actual outcomes. But they went further: The expectation data shows that the current improvementsMr Crean interjecting don't like small business, give us a chance to do something for it. We are at least recognising the value of small business. But you don't like this quote from the ACCI: The data shows expectations of an even better performance in the quarter to come for general business conditions, sales, exports, profits and improved investment. Mr Speaker, we have in fact put in place initiatives to improve small business.",71

127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I issue a general warning and I will take positive action.  business, do you? You don't have any policies for small business. You couldn't wipe them out in 13 years. You have no policies in place. New Labor doesn't even recognise small business. We in fact have the policies in place and have taken the tough decision to set the course for small business. They have every right to be confident for the coming 12 months. Very shortly, in the coming weeks, they will be further impressed with the deregulation task force report to be released by the Prime Minister. Meat Exports",72
128,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It concerns advice the minister has received from the US administration that company inspected meat will not be given access to US markets. In a recent article in the Canberra Times the minister stated that company only trials would begin soon at a number of export meat establishments and, as he said, using qualified company inspectors supervised by a government veterinarian. Given this entirely predictable response from the US, why didn't the minister do his homework first before boasting about proposed reforms to the meat inspection system? And when will the government release a progress report on the project 2 trials?",72
129,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted to be able to inform him that he is wrong, that we have had no such official advice from the United States whatsoever. While I am on the matter of meat inspection, I might note that the leaderMr O'Keefe interjecting",72
130,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Look, we have had extensive talks with them in recent times. No final communique has been conveyed to us. We are continuing to negotiate, and that is all there is to it. So the basis of your question is wrong. The Leader of the Opposition was parading himself around regional Australia last weekend trying to win great kudos with the people whose support he lost at the last election. I am not sure what new Labor believes in. They once believed in regional forest agreements, until we started to implement them. Now they do not, even though they deliver a good outcome for jobs in regional Australia and their union mates are saying that matters. If they are ever to be re-elected, they need to actually recognise that we need jobs in regional Australia. Then we have them on sugar. Of course, they are painting it as a debate over tariffs, but they have forgotten that it was the outcome of a competition review. They were the people who put the competition policy in place in Australia, but they want to walk away from that now. In addition to that, he was up there being opportunistic in the electorates of Page andMr O'Keefe-Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker, under section 145 on relevance? It was a question about meat. If you can't answer it, say.you can't answer it.",72
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,72
132,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have answered it. But I want to come to the very point of meat inspection reform where we have done a great deal ofMr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: if the minister has admitted that he has answered it, I ask you to invite him to sit down because he has completed his answer.",72
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister was concluding his answer.,72
134,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He was out there talking about meat inspection. It is their allies who are trying to stop us getting on with the job of reforming meat inspection in this country.

135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Corio. The minister is aware of the conventions of the House.,73
136,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They don't like it. They are aligned with the political movement, the union movement, that is trying to persuade American consumers not to buy our product. That is great loyalty to this country's export performance, great loyalty to all the people who work in the meat industry! But the Leader of the Opposition was out there in Page and Richmond last weekend saying, 'Isn't it a shame that we can't get with the job of reforming inspection and, since we can't, the government ought to pay for meat inspection again' - but also saying, 'Oh, by the way, it was us who made the industry pay.' He had to admit it was they who made industry pay. In government they would not reform the service so that it was cost effective with everybody else; in opposiber tion they are trying to ensure that we can't. You have no record of credibility in this matter at all.",73

Mr Griffin-Here comes the Klingon.",73

141,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for her question. I know how committed she is to the development of small business in her electorate. As the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs just said so eloquently, small business is the backbone of the economy in this country and is where we expect many of the new jobs will be coming through. The government is committed to establishing an environment within which small business can flourish, and of course that lies at the heart of our repeal of Labor's on unfair dismissals law and the action we are taking to get rid of red tape. I am pleased to inform the House that Senator Vanstone announced yesterday that the government is providing $840,000 for tw.o new business development centres, or bUSIness incubators, one of which will be in the electorate of Canning. I know that the memis delighted about that. That follows the announcement late last year of eight new business incubators. Business incubators help to create jobs by providing fledgling businesses with a-fordable rents, with access to shared serVIces and equipment and access to professional independent and practical support. Of course, the business incubator has great support at the local level and could not succeed without strong community support. This sort of initiative once again shows the great gulf between the government and the opposition.",73
142,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is not relevant for him to make a statement about business incubators and then talk about the gulf.

151,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. He started off by being completely irrelevant by claiming that there had been nothing done on business incubators before. Now he seeks to broaden this particular answer with an argument about what he thinks is our front-bench. There is a certain point to relevance. He was given a very specific question by the member for Canning and he is way off it.",74
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I call the minister and remind him of the thrust of the question.,74
153,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The thrust of the question is what the government is doing to expand opportunities for communities to get together behind small business. That is the great contrast, of course, between us and you. What is simply happening on your side of the House is",74
154,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. One of our people on this side of the House has been put out during the course of the day for disorderly conduct, and that is because he was in breach of the standing orders, and I accept that fact, as we all do. But the minister is also in breach of the standing orders. He had a very specific question. Every time you try to draw attention to the fact that he does not stick with it, he goes precisely in defiance of your position.",74
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. The minister has been encouraged to address the question. I remind him of his responsibilities.,74
156,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is very committed to putting in place policies which will help small business, because we have policies to deal with this. The trouble is that you are simply scratching around, trying to scramble up some policies which you have not got",74
157,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. He is defying your quite explicit instructions, Mr Speaker, to bring himself this govern- within the ambit of it.",74
158,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I am listening to the minister's answer very carefully.,74
159,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is clearly very concerned over a few bad eggs sitting behind him there on the front bench.,74
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, address the question.",74
161,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,74
162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left!,74
163,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The trouble is that the former government ignored the needs of small business. They scrambled around for policies which did not work. What they scratched together in fact strangled small business through the unfair dismissals legislation and through the red tape that they engulfed small business in. What is happening on the other side of the House is that we have the member for Hotham, one of the bad eggs behind the Leader of the Opposition, who has been couped up for far too long, now trying to break outMr Crean-Oh, come on, Mr Speaker.",74
164,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has concluded his remarks. Bougainville,74
165,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, does article 11 (2) of the 1989 treaty on development cooperation between Australia and Papua New Guinea allow either party to terminate the treaty subject to a six-month notification of intention to do so? Given the attitude of Sir Julius Chan, is the government prepared to serve conditional notice of Australia's intention to terminate the treaty in the event of foreign mercenaries being employed in the war on Bougainville or retained for any other purpose? Would Australia's position in this matter not be strengthened if the six-month clock was set running without further delay?",74
166,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. He knows the answer to the first part of it because I told him the answer last night at a committee meeting.,75
167,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, tell the House.",75
168,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell the House. Article 11 (2) of the aid treaty with Papua New Guinea stipulates that that agreement can be terminated with six months notice. In terms of the government's response to events in Papua New Guinea and, in particular, the employment of mercenaries in Papua New Guinea, I think at this delicate time it is important that we keep our options open and continue to work quietly behind the scenes. The honourable member and all members of the House would appreciate that this is an extremely delicate and an extremely difficult situation. There are times when public statements can be extremely unhelpful, and I do not choose to make any further remarks about the matter at this time. Sporting Services and Expertise: Export Potential",75
169,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Can the minister advise the House of steps being undertaken to promote the export of Australian sporting services and expertise to developing nations in the Asia region? What is the potential for such exports?",75
170,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for his question. It is certainly on a very important issue. I am glad to report to the House that the government has taken a number of initiatives aimed at increa-ing Australia's profile and also the potential for expanding sports exports in the Asian region particularly. This might relate to technology, sports expertise and education. Recently we established the Sports Export Advisory Council, which is chaired by the Managing Director of Ford Motor Co. of Australia, Mr David Morgan, who is assisted by a range of sports experts around this country. They are charged with the task of providing linkages between business and sport and will report to the Minister for Trade and me. Also, the Australian Sports Commission, for which I am responsible, has some 15 bilateral arrangements with countries in our region in relation to the development of sport contacts. At the Atlanta Olympics, the government took a number of initiatives. We were proactive in developing contacts with a range of nations and sports ministers, and I developed a liaison with many of them, and we are developing those contacts particularly with South Africa and Malaysia. But also through the Sport and Recreation Ministers Council, the governments all agreed-that is, all states and the Commonwealth-on a cooperative approach to the federal and state levels in attracting interest in the use of sports facilities for visiting teams for the 2000 games. You will be aware that I have released a directory of sports facilities and training venues, which I think has been made available to every member in the House. I certainly know the member for Cowper, Mr Nehl, an eminent rower and sculler in his own right",75
171,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Which sort?,75
172,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I mean the rowing sort of sculler. He has been assiduous in promoting the international stadium in Coffs Harbour and he, like many members, recognises the potential for pursuing those opportunities. There is obviously a range of opportunities for teams to be involved here but also for governments and members to pursue that. Those who are not aware should know that the Australian Institute of Sport has, with the College of Sports Education, of which it is a partner, developed educational services, and that information will be distributed widely throughout South-East Asia. Late last year, I did release a detailed report prepared by Price Waterhouse and Maxwell and Druce International about the expanding opportunities in our region, in South-East Asia, for the development of this industry. The interesting figure is that it is estimated that there is some $600 million worth of sports exports to Australia in a variety of forms, to which I refer, up to the year 2000. This is a growing industry in its own right. It provides an immense number of jobs for Australians, and I certainly commend the report to members. Also late last year, I announced the appointment of Kevan Gosper, who is a member of the International Olympic Committee, to be a special representative and adviser to the government for export development of Australian sport. Likewise, he will report to Mr Morgan's committee and also to the National Office of Sport and Recreation Policy, for which I am responsible. Finally, and in conclusion, can I indicate also that one of the examples of the achievements that we have been able to see from our sportspeople is in the recent result in the cricket match in South Africa. Four of the members of that team-Glenn MCGRATH, Shane Warne, Greg Blewett, who got 214 runs, by the way, and Michael Bevan-were all graduates of the Australian Institute of Sport Cricket Academy in Adelaide. That is the sort of example that can go to showing the rest of the world what we can achieve and help further this industry to expand. Australian Defence Force: Airfields",75
173,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister confirm that Defence is conducting a review of the location of ADF airfields as a result of the government's decision to consider Holsworthy as a site for Sydney's second airport? Is it not the case that, if Holsworthy is selected, this will require the relocation of substantial army elements with flow-on effects to other Defence bases, including aircraft movements at Richmond and Bankstown? What is the likely cost of these changes? In view of these costs and the impossibility of clearing Holsworthy of unexploded ordnance, have you urged the minister for transport to abandon this costly and foolish proposal?",76
174,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer to the question is that, until such time as the EIS report comes through, there is absolutely no point in answering the 21 questions that he tried to put on the box. Mr Bevis-Why have you got a review? Is the department reviewing it?",76
175,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! You have asked your question. Mr Bevis-Well, he should answer it.",76
176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Defence Industry,76
177,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Is the minister aware of the cooperative ventures that were announced by a number of international defence companies with Australian firms in the past few weeks? How will these and other initiatives contribute to the government's aim to create jobs and ensure a viable and sustainable defence industry? What is the government doing to encourage such cooperation?",76
178,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question. Very simply, we were left a situation when we took office: the previous government had not developed a sustainable defence industrythat means an industry where firms can afford to lose a contract from the Department of Defence and still stay in business. Accordingly, we are working to develop a policy whereby foreign firms doing business here comply with five principles that require them to invest in both facilities and Australian personnel in particular. In the last few weeks at the Avalon Air Show, there were announced three very significant projects which will result in new jobs being developed and that sustainable industry being developed. The first announcement was the TransfieldLockheed Martin joint venture program, which will be based in Melbourne, which will result in 1,000 jobs being created in the next four years. It also means that they will be using their advanced systems engineering, integration and software development capabilities and technologies not only in Australia but also in South-East Asia. They will also be using their expertise in civilian projects and meeting the guidelines. The first contract they will be taking over is the JORN contract where the last government allowed 80 per cent of the money to be paid for 20 per cent of the work. We will now get it back on track. The second announcement was made by MCDonnell Douglas, which has chosen Aerospace Technologies of Australia to produce trailing edge flaps for the FA18 ElF Super Hornet. The first order will be worth $200 million to Australia. Indeed, it is a worldwide opportunity and more jobs will flow from it. The third announcementMr Bevis-Page 2.",76
179,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is on page 2 because there are three announcements. The third announcement relates to British Aerospace. They announced that they have doubled their exports in the past 12 months and in the next 12 months they expect to double them again. The important and significant point that comes up from British Aerospace, which is based largely in South Australia, is that defence industry is worth three per cent of South Australia's state domestic product and is just as important as the wine industry is to that state. They employ 1,800 people and their determination to comply with the five principles this government has laid down means that there are more job opportunities and more exports coming into this country. Basically, the principles that have been laid down and the willingness of firms like Raytheon and Hughes, which are all looking to do better and have more investment in this country which will produce more jobs, is all in pursuance of creating a sustainable industry, to maintain a self-reliant Defence Force, but, importantly, to create new jobs for Australians. . Mr Bevis-The minister was clearly quotmg from documents. In accordance with standing orders, I request that they be tabled.",77
180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invite the minister to table that document or is she quoting from confidential notes? Mrs Bishop-They are my private copious notes. Shark Bay World Heritage Area,77
181,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment. Now that the Minister for the Environment has acknowledged that he is aware of the granting of the licence for oil and gas exploration involving the construction of 100 kilometres of seismic lines and two exploration wells in the Shark Bay world heritage area, what does the government propose to do to ensure world heritage values are protected and-to quote the minister'that the Commonwealth's conservation responsibilities are met', or will this be another example of the government sacrificing world heritage values on the altar of multiple use?",77
182,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am advised by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, that on 29 November last year the WA Department of Minerals and Energy did grant an exploration permit to several companiesMoondance, Tap Oil and Omega Oil-to investigate part of Shark Bay for petroleum. They also advise that it is expected that about 100 kilometres of seismic surveys are planned for 1998 and two exploration wells for 1999 and 2000.",77
183,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is old hat.,77
184,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is important to get the facts on the record, shadow minister. Dr Lawrence interjecting",77
185,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Fremantle has asked her question. Mr W ARWICK SMITH-Their proposal to grant an exploration permit was not referred to the Commonwealth. No approval is required under Commonwealth legislation. It is understood by the department that they became aware of the permits in late January and Senator Hill's office was not informed until yesterday. Shark Bay is a world heritage area. It is recognised for its outstanding conservation values. Several rare and endangered species are present in Shark Bay. Senator Hill is advised that the exploration permit only provides a form of tenure over the area in question. It is also advised that no exploration or mining activity may occur unless an environmental clearance is obtained from the WA environment ministers. The department has been asked by Senator Hill to provide advice on the likely environmental impacts associated with the proposed activities and in particular on the compatibilicountries, ty of such activities with the world heritage values of Shark Bay. If it is proposed that activities are not consistent with the protection of the world heritage values, then the Commonwealth will not support such activities being carried out. Greenhouse Gas Emissions",77
186,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does Australia support the EU proposals for a IS per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 201O? What steps is the government taking to ensure Australia's economic and environmental interests are protected in climate change negotiations?,78
187,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kingston for her question. I know she is very concerned about environmental issues and I know she is also concerned about jobs, including for the people of Kingston and the people of Adelaide and South Australia. The government has received advice of the European Union's negotiating target proposal for all OECD countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent compared to the 1990 levels by 2010. The EU intends to submit this proposal to the negotiations currently taking place in Bonn. The House may be aware that the Australian government is arguing for what is described as a differentiation proposal in these climate change negotiations. That is to ensure that there is an equitable sharing of the burden amongst all of the so-called annexe 1 countries, which are in effect the OECD countries. There is no reason why this country should be asked to bear a disproportionate burden in addressing the climate change issue. The European Union proposal contains a differentiation proposal itself. It contains differentiation for individual EU member states but excludes this possibility for the OECD countries. So there are different targets for individual member states-for example, Portugal's target allows emissions in 2010 to increase by 40 per cent, Greece's target is to increase by 30 per cent, Spain's by 17 per cent and so on. Australia, along with other non-EU OECD is being asked to accept a uniform flat rate reduction of 15 per cent, and that is clearly not going to be acceptable. It is inconsistent for the EU to deny others what they are using as a key element of their own efforts to address climate change. The fact is that a 15 per cent reduction target by 2010 is unrealistic. As we see it, it is little more than a negotiating tactic at this stage by the European Union. It also has to be said that the European Union proposal is frankly unworkable because it does not provide a sound framework for long-term cooperative action to address the climate change issue.",78
188,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Photocopiers",78
189,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, are you aware of the difficulties being encountered by many members in this place in accessing a working photocopier? As you would know, backbench members do not have photocopying facilities in their parliamentary offices and rely entirely on the photocopiers throughout the building. Could you ascertain the age of these copiers, the number of copies they have produced and the considerable amount of time these photocopiers are inoperable? My staff and I on many occasions have been forced to walk up and down two flights of stairs to find a working photocopier. For the majority of this parliamentary year, the second floor photocopier in the vicinity of my office-which, I have reliably been informed, has produced almost three-quarters of a million copies-has been inoperable. Mr Speaker, I seek your support on this concern.",78
190,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. Members are generally aware that we do have some problems with the age and the operating performance of existing photocopiers. I understand that, in the area that you have brought to my attention, there is a photocopier being replaced this day. Strenuous efforts are being taken to redeploy existing assets, and we have a very significant replacement program, hopefully within our budgetary capacity, for later this year. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",79
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I present the Auditor General's audit report No. 27 for 1996-97 entitled Performance audit: Army presence in the north: Department of Defence. Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That: (l) this House authorises the publication of the Auditor-General's audit report No. 27 of 97; and (2) the report be printed.,79
192,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I present a paper on the following subject, being a petition which is not in accordance with the standing and sessional orders of the House: Opposition to closure of Medicare offices, particularly regional offices in Queensland member for Hinkler-50 petitioners. NA Nuclear Waste Reprocessing",79
193,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The consequences for the people of the electorate of H-ghes arising from the Government's proposal to - uIld a nuclear waste reprocessing plant at Lucas HeIghts. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",79
194,Mr MARTYN EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is good to see some support from members opposite. When I first heard this proposal for a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) advance the proposition in an interview on the Face to Face program on Channel Seven some 10 days ago, I at first assumed it was not a real proposal. I assumed, in my good natured way, that the minister had just been reading some press releases, some scientific reports that had come across his desk or perhaps the recent ANSTO annual report and this topic had stuck in his mind and it had just come out as a slip of the tongue during the interview. But then I remembered that this minister has form on this topic. He has prior convictions when it comes to nuclear energy. This 1996- is the same minister who in 1993-although he was in opposition back then-proposed nuclear power facilities right across Australia. This is the nuclear powered minister who PAPERS wanted to support a nuclear industry III Australia.",79
195,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,79
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The level of conversation in the chamber is far too high. Please be courteous from the to the honourable gentleman.,79
197,Mr MARTYN EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course this minister, as the then opposition spokesman, was forced to withdraw this proposal in January 1994. In an interview of the day, he went on the record saying that he no longer felt this was an economically viable proposition. Indeed, he rejected the hypothetical proposition which he had been advancing for the electorate. He went on to say: And wethat is, the coalition partiesbelieve that nuclear enrichment and nuclear powered electricity are alien concepts to Australians and they're economically unfeasible. Indeed they are alien concepts, as is the concept of nuclear fuel enrichment plants in Australia. This minister has form in this area. This is an alien concept. It was an alien concept in 1994 and it is an alien concept in 1997. What are we referring to when we talk about nuclear fuel reprocessing? Most members are familiar with nuclear power plants. They are familiar with the very safe operation of the Lucas Heights facility over the last 40 years. But most people are not so familiar with nuclear fuel reprocessing. You have to wait some 30 years for the spent fuel rods to cool sufficiently for them to be reprocessed. They are then treated with concentrated nitric acid, forming a very hot liquid and some gaseous components as well. This hot, thermally active and radioactive liquid is then separated into its respective components. Those components are uranium and waste material which is still very radioactive and in liquid form, and there is the potential for a small amount of plutonium to come from this process as well. That plutonium is very significant, and I think honourable members should keep sight of that as we proceed through this discussion. One thing nuclear fuel reprocessing does not do is that it does not reduce the level of radioactivity of the material concerned. At the end ?f the pr-c.ess, you still have very substantIal quantItIes of radioactive material, although you have it in separate components. Instead of a mixture of nuclear fuel, you now have the uranium, the plutonium and the liquid waste separated out. You do not have any less radioactivity, but you do have a massive increase in the volume of this material. We are now required to deal with massive amounts of liquid radioactive waste, and this is what the minister proposes to locate at Lucas Heights in the middle of suburban Sydney. Minister, this is not a vision for science; this is more an illusion which is going to become a nightmare for the people of Sutherland Shire. In the past.' the reasons one might propose for reprocessmg have been threefold. First for the military there was obviously the purPose of extracting the plutonium. I think this is an issue which will come back to haunt this minister.",79
198,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Leave her alone, Wilson. You're suborning a member of parliament. Give her protection, Mr Deputy Speaker.",80
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Banks, you will need protection in a moment if you do not keep quiet.",80
200,Mr MARTYN EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This government has joined with the previous government in moving towards the Canberra Commission proposition which will ensure that Australia takes a very strong stand in this world against nuclear proliferation. That is one of the most serious objectives which the previous government had in dealing with the Canberra Commission and on the international stage. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has picked this topic up and continued to proceed with Australia's favourable outlook in that regard. What will our friends in the Western world say when we are in possession of plutonium? How does that leave our non-proliferation treaty obligations when, as a result of the minister's reprocessing ambitions, we have significant quantities of plutonium? How will we deal with those quantities-something that we do not want to have to deal with? Secondly, there used to be economic reasons for reprocessing. It used to be necessary - o extract the uranium from the reprocessing m order to have uranium to feed back into the nuclear fuel cycle. Uranium, of course is now quite plentiful. Australia is not short of urani.um, if it wishes to supply its reactor, and th-t IS no longer a necessary objective. The third reason is that it does in some small way facilitate disposal because you have separate components with which to deal rather than a homogenous group. But taken in totality in 1997, this is not an adequate reason to proceed with the reprocessing of nuclear fuel in this country. .Natura-ly, if the minister was to proceed with a pilot level plant, it would be a very expensive proposition. Japan is proceeding with one at the moment which will come onstream some time after 2000. This is a pilot plant for reprocessing fast reactor fuel in Japan. It will cost them something of the order of $1.5 billion. It will be a six-storey building with a two-storey basement, and it is still just a pilot plant. So precisely what is proposed for the Lucas Heights region here? Something of the same order? I sincerely hope not. Nuclear reprocessing is an option in England. The British government has established a number of very major reprocessing facilities in Dounreay and Sellafield that have been in operation for some time. There is a very strong view in the nuclear industry that the only reason those plants are continued, maintained and indeed expanded is because Britain and France-its colleague country in this regard-have already made substantial investments in the nuclear fuel cycle, and they have significant plants which need to be maintained. That is why they are in that business. Other countries, like Germany, which has recently abandoned a proposal to get involved with reprocessing, and the United States, which does not reprocess fuel, have rightly moved away from this technology and towards storage. That ought to be Australia's option, not the option of reprocessing fuel for our very modest nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights on Australian soil. As an alternative to a pilot plant, the minister may have in mind-and given his past enthusiasm for the nuclear industryimporting waste from other countries. Indeed, he has commented on this as being part of the fast growing Asian nuclear region. He may want to attack some of his theories in the nuclear club by having Australia be part of this arrangement and import nuclear waste. 1 think the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) would need to ask what the hidden agenda is behind the government's plans for an airport at Holsworthy. Is one of those agendas the importation of nuclear fuel through that airport? I sincerely hope not, - cause that would expose us to even greater nsks than the minister's bizarre proposal already does. If you want to see exactly what this kind of reprocessing plant can leave you with after a few years of operation, you can do no worse that look at the United States. One of the main reasons they have now moved away from this technology-if you look at Hanford-is the massive amounts of liquid waste which they have had to deal with and the enormous environmental degradation which that has produced on that site. The United States now has a super-fund to clean up these kinds of areas. The cost of that is massive to the US economy; the damage to the local environment is enormous; and the technology is far from useful for that country, which is why they have moved away from it. Minister, you have some very hard decisions to make in this area. These decisions have come up on your watch. I know that is tough but that is the reality of politics. You wanted to get into government. Now you are in, you will have to take some of these hard decisions, make some of the hard plans and put in the work that is required to ensure Australia has some sound policies in the future. This reactor is now nearly 40 years old. It is not quite as old as he or I, but the reality is that I suspect the reactor is in not quite such good condition as either of us. The reality is that we need to plan for the future. Minister, instead of coming up with this kind of distracting proposal which focuses public attention on an entirely absurd proposal to reprocess waste at Lucas Heights, why don't you focus public attention instead on the real questions? Australia needs to address the issue of the future of the Lucas Heights reactor and the future of the Lucas Heights site, because the Nuclear Safety Bureau has very clearly said they will not continue to recertify this plant much beyond 2003. ANSTO itself says that it is essential we start making decisions at about now. The reality is that the minister should be putting the effort into determining the future of that site and not into proposing strange new ways of getting ANSTO into the world nuclear club. That is a technology looking for a solution, instead of a reasoned plan for the future of Australia's nuclear industry focused on that research reactor. This is where you need some serious vision. We do have an issue about the storage of the fuel rods from Lucas Heights. They continue to mount up. Governments for the last 38 years have known that they would, and the reality is that that has to be dealt as and when the problem arises. We have now reached a point where that needs further serious consideration. The previous government sent one shipload back for reprocessing, and that will return to Australia in some 25 to 30 years in reprocessed form. The significance is that that site is now reaching a point where in the next two or three years, or sooner, you will need some serious answers to those questions. Not only will you have to look at the issue of the future of the plant, but also whether Australia needs another research reactor and, if it does, whether that should be at Lucas Heights or at some alternative site. Those are the kinds of questions to which the people of Australia, particularly the people of Sutherland Shire, are demanding answers to. They are not looking for new ways of getting us further and deeper into the nuclear cycle or of creating further and deeper environmental problems in that region. They are looking, instead, for long-term answers and serious work to be done on this topic. You must also face the reality that Synroc has had substantial investment in it over the years. I understand that. But if we are going to use a reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights merely as a demonstration technique for Synroc, then I think that is a very wasteful extravagance in terms of federal funding. It is a very dangerous proposition for the people of that area and it is not a suitable way to ensure the continuation of that technology. Normally, I would be the first to join with the minister in support of Australian industry and Australian science through the commitment of government resources. It is unfortunate that his government has not displayed the same commitment to industry when it reduced the research and development grants, when it abolished syndication, when it pulled back funding from ANSTO, AIMS and CSIRO and when it has sought to wipe out industry policy in general, as well as some of that scientific collaboration in research. Normally, I would come out and support the minister if he was proposing to invest federal funds in the development of a technology. But this is not the way to further the with development of the Synroc technology. You cannot use the people of Sutherland Shire and Lucas Heights as pawns in a game which is merely for the development of a technology. I support the furtherance of that technology, if it is possible. We have a long-term investment in it-governments of both political colours have that. It deserves a degree of bipartisan support, as does ANSTO in its general activities. That is something you have always had and will have from us on this side of the House. But this is not the kind of proposal which is deserving of bipartisan support. This moves right outside of that area when it puts the citizens of that district at risk. ANSTO have a very strong record of safety. They have a first-class record of research in the past, and it is very contemptuous of them to put their reputation at risk by this kind of proposal. You do them a great disservice by injuring their public reputation and their position of public trust and confidence in this way. There was no need to involve them in this kind of proposition. It is not a solution you need to propose in order to deal with the nuclear fuel rods from Lucas Heights. Most governments in the world are coming to the conclusion that dry storage is the way to go in the medium-term future for these kinds of fuel rods. There is no reason why that could not continue in the way that it has. Indeed, the Senate last year, in an all-party report, recommended this kind of method of storage for Australia. It certainly did not recommend-and I am sure that its members would disagree with you now-the reprocessing option for Lucas Heights. This is not a good new industry for Australia, Minister. Focus your attention on the good science which is coming out of Australian industry, on the good science which is coming out of our national science agencies like CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS and the universities. Do not expose them to this kind of nuclear 'cowboyry'. Certainly, do not put the people of Hughes and Sutherland Shire at risk through the environmental degradation which this proposal would implement. Guarantee them today that you will not proceed with this. For the sake of those people, for the sake of those families and for the sake of the future of that area, give the guarantee which for the. last two weeks you have failed and refused to give in this House and outside of this House. Give them the assurance which they and we seek from you today-that you will abandon this absurd proposal for a reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights in Sydney now.",80
201,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) must have woken up this morning, seen that Sydney Morning Herald front page story and thought all of his Christmases had come at once. That story had nothing new to reveal, no extra information and no interpretation beyond what I have been saying for several weeks and what most other news organisations in this country have been reporting for several weeks. Let us deal with that first and foremost. There is nothing new in the story in the Sydney Morning Herald. It correctly reports that the government is examining the options available to it for the disposal of the 1,600 spent fuel rods at Lucas Heights. I have been grievously misrepresented by the member when he concluded in his address-leaving aside a number of misrepresentations during his address-by saying that we have decided on a reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights. That is completely wrong. Despite the member for Bonython understandably rejoicing in the event of today and in the attention that it has brought him and the issue, he has three major problems-and he did not overcome any of the problems during his address. The first is that the Party did nothing in government for 13 years to address this problem. We have inherited this. We have come to government, and the advice from ANSTO is that next year the storage facilities at Lucas Heights will be exhausted. The spent fuel rods have to be dealt with. They have to be reprocessed. So you have no credibility. This is opportunism of the worse kind. It is politics at its most base. Instead of seeking a reasoned, sensible and calm debate on this issue, the Labor Party seizes on a front page story dramatically presented with a headline, photos and sketches but which reveals nothing new or different. They come in here and turn up the temperature. During his whole address, the member threw around words like 'nuclear power', 'nuclear fuel enrichment' and 'nuclear proliferation', instead of addressing the one issue-that is, how do we dispose of the spent fuel which is an unavoidable by-product of the research reactor? The second problem is that the Labor Party spent, in round figures, $40 million in research into Synroc technology. If I understand them correctly, we are now not entitled to consider that as an option. You tell the Australian taxpayers, firstly, that you spent $40 million over 13 years on a technology that you were never going to use in governmentand which never sees the funding, by the way-and, secondly, that we are not entitled to consider it as an option. You tell them that you have wasted $40 million. You will not. Of course we are entitled to consider the Synroc technologies. You would have done in government, I suspect. But from your remarks now, I am not so certain. What has happened to the $40 million? It has just been wasted? It has been worthless technology? Of course we have to consider it. Thirdly, you have no policy yourself on how to dispose of these 1,600 spent fuel rods. I listened very carefully to every word, particularly to see whether or not you would finish up with a declaration of how you would dispose of the 1,600 spent fuel rods. The member for Bonython failed to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. So what credibility do you Labor have? With what seriousness should we regard your protestations on behalf of the people of Hughes, for whom we have real interest because we want to dispose of the spent fuel rods? It is a ludicrous MPI and, quite frankly, a waste of this parliament's time. The government has said that we can send the spent fuel rods back to the United Kingdom for reprocessing. Do you want that? Should they go back to Dounreay, Scotland? No answer. They can go back to the United States for reprocessing. Do you want that? Should they go back to the United States? No answer. Or we can process them domestically. We will consider them, looking at all of the environment, social and economic considerations. How do we deal with an opposition that can inflame what can be, at times, a sensitive community issue if people in responsible positions do not handle it properly, yet still fail to tell us what they would do with the problem they gave us after total inaction over 13 years? Do not take my word for it. You have been quoting the Sydney Morning Herald. I refer you again, as I did in question time, to a report by Leigh Dayton on 22 August 1994. Did she cane the then Labor government! She said: Australia's policy on the disposal of radioactive waste is definitely not a shambles. Far worse-it doesn't even exit. The article goes through your cowardly inaction on this issue. Even though it was drawn to your attention in the media in August 1994, the Labor Party did nothing until it lost government in March 1996. Twenty months later you still had done nothing. The shadow minister puts up this idea that we can leave them there. Correct me if I am wrong, please take a personal explanation, but to the best of my understanding, you said, 'Leave them in dry storage.' But they are corroding. We cannot leave them indefinitely. That is the opposition we have to deal with. How do we take you seriously? You have no credibility, you put up no alternative and the storage is exhausted in 1998. The government does have to take a decision. You were gracious enough to say there are hard decisions; you were not so gracious as to give us any indication of what those decisions should be. So you are scaremongering. I expect it from the extremist groups and the Democrats on these types of issues most of the time, but not from the Labor Party opposition. I would have expected a lot more. You can exaggerate, you can hype up and terrify people if you really want to on this issue. The fact is that you have a responsibility, particularly as much of this problem is of your making, to assist the government to solve it, or else, if not supporting the final decision that we make, to put up your own alternative. Until then, quite frankly, I-and I do not see how anyone in the community would-cannot take you seriously. You had the gall to lecture me about the need to respect and support ANSTO. The member for Bonython should know that the government has a very strong commitment to ANSTO. We recognise that the spent fuel represents an unavoidable by-product of the HIFAR research reactor which is used to produce almost all of Australia's nuclear medicines. Some 260,000 Australians benefit from the radioisotopes every year. As a major national scientific facility, the reactor also plays an important part in education and research outside of ANSTO with 7,000 hours of research time provided to universities in both Australia and New Zealand on an annual basis. It is one of the world's largest sources of irradiated silicon used in advanced computer chip production. HIFAR is also used to analyse more than 33,000 samples each year for the minerals and oil exploration industries in Australia. The government is very supportive of this essential facility. In medical, environmental, industrial and research terms, ANSTO serves the nation extremely well. It does not deserve the adverse publicity which the opposition and the minor parties are now visiting upon it. The hypocrisy of anyone, including the member for Bonython, to accuse me or the government of letting down ANSTO is astounding. It is they, the opposition, who are stirring up community feelings on this issue. We will fully, properly and responsibly consider all of the factors that go to make up the different options available to the government for this unavoidable problem. It is not going to go away. Nobody at ANSTO is going to be fooled by this phoney, mealy-mouthed defence on their part. It is the member for Bonython who should be ashamed and embarrassed to show his face anywhere near the Lucas Heights site. We have full support for ANSTO and what it does. It plays a crucial role in Australia for both health and manufacturing terms. So many thousands of Australians owe their lives to the research carried out at ANSTO. Remember that ANSTO is Australia's only producer of radioisotopes which are used in treating and detecting illnesses which include cancer, thyroid disease, heart disease and others. There are over 100 nuclear medicine departments in Australia performing an estimated 300,000 diagnostic tests and 4,000 treatments annually with a combined value approaching $200 million. In an average year, more than 250,000 Australians-I mentioned 260,000 Australians earlier on-will have a nuclear medicine procedure and, on average, one in every two Australians can now expect one in their lifetime. These and other non-invasive procedures have replaced the need for much exploratory surgery to assess a patient's condition, signifithe cantly reducing discomfort and cost to patients. Use of these tests also reduces the length of hospital stays. Sales of ANSTO's radio pharmaceuticals to the Australian market now exceed $11 million annually. Some $700,000 of ANSTO's radio pharmaceuticals are also exported to South-East Asia, where the market is estimated to be $25 million and growing at more than 10 per cent annually. Mr Martyn Evans-No-one is opposing that.",83
202,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No-one is opposing it, the member for Bonython interjects, yet he will not tell us what his party or the government would or should do in regard to the spent fuel. What should you do? Mr Martyn Evans-That's why you're the minister.",85
203,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is why you ignored it for 13 years. The reply is, That's why you're the minister.' We most certainly will be making a decision. We are not going to avoid our responsibility for 13 years, like you did, but oppositions still have to have policies. You are out there scaring the community. You are out there inflaming community fears. You tell them what you would do. Mr Leo MCLeay-You've frightened the wits out of them.",85
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Watson is not in his place, and will keep quiet.",85
205,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Bonython is policy-free on all the issues. He has the temerity to sit there and say, 'It's your decision.' Of course it is our decision. We will make it. That is why I have always been open and honest and set out the options available to the government. Now we want to know what his policy is, especially how the opposition are going to tell Australian taxpayers that they have spent $40 million over 13 years and the Synroc technology is going to be junked. For any opposition frontbencher to taunt the government by saying, 'You're the government, you're the minister, that's what you get paid for, make decision,' and not have any alternative is hypocritical and cowardly. We will make the decision-make no mistake about that. Events will be forced on us. The storage facilities are exhausted next year, so we will make the decision in the next few months. But you tell us what your policy is. We have to go into all of the detail, make all of the calculations and take into account so many different factors. I am not asking that of you; I am just asking for a one-line policy from you. I will not require you to prepare a Fightback of 600 pages, with all of the supporting documentation, but you just tell us what your bottom line is. What is the member for Bonython's one-sentence destination for the 1,600 spent fuel rods? Until then, you have no place in this debate and you ought to be condemned for the way you are stirring it up for your own purposes. ANSTO of course uses the radioisotopes in a variety of ways to boost productivity, from checking gas and oil pipelines to the development of newer high-tech materials. In the environmental field, by using radioisotopes, we can trace sewage from ocean outfalls or small leaks from complex systems, such as power stations and heat exchanges. HIFAR is used, as I say, to analyse more than 33,000 samples each year for the minerals and oil exploration industries in Australia. So it is a major scientific facility. It plays a very important part in education and research out of ANSTO. For all these reasons, the government will support the institution. We will solve the problem that we have inherited from Labor and, notwithstanding some of the worse kinds of opportunist politics imaginable by the opposition, we will win the confidence of the local and, indeed, the more widespread community. (Extension of time granted) I will not need long, but I just want to reinforce a couple of points. What did the Labor Party do over 13 years? What were their decisions? None. Instead, it seems that they put their head in the sand and thought the spent fuel rods would go away naturally. The Labor Party refused to make any decision regarding the spent fuel rods. Worse still, they continued to fund, at the rate of millions of dollars a year, the Synroc technology, seemingly-from what the shadow minister now tells us-without any intention of ever using it, without any intention of capitalising on that research which extended from 1980, but most of the money was spent during Labor's 13 years. Even now, they will not tell us what their policy is. On all those grounds, the Labor Party and the shadow minister are revealed for what they really are. They are just cheap political opportunists who stand condemned for the way they are stirring up local feeling with total disregard to people's natural feelings on this issue. The way they throw around the nuclear spectre, next we will be hearing from the shadow minister the imagery of Chernobyl or Three Mile Island. This, instead, is one of the options available to the government, which is reasonably and responsibly considering them before reaching a final decision. For those members who have just come in, let me remind them of a priceless, memorable interjection, never to be forgotten, by the member for Bonython. When I asked him whether he would send the spent fuel rods to Dounreay in the United Kingdom for reprocessing I received no answer. When I asked him whether he would send them to the United States for reprocessing I received no answer. When I asked him whether he would reprocess them domestically I received no answer. His only reply was, 'You're the government, you're the minister, you make the decision.' We will make the decision-a decision they avoided studiously at great expense to Australians for 13 years. But you tell us what your policy is. Just tell us in one sentence the destination: United Kingdom, United States or Australia. That is all you have to tell us. Until then, you have no credibility and, until then, you are revealed for the political opportunist you really are.",85
206,Mr MCCLELLAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barton) (3.51 p.m.)One may well ask what this government is doing to my friend the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). First, they are giving her an airport. Now they are throwing in a nuclear reprocessing plant. When are they going to throw in a quarantine station or a hospital for contagious diseases, just to take another 20 per cent off the property values of residents in her electorate? The development of such a reprocessing plant is going to have a dramatic effect on not only the residents of Sutherland but also all those in the surrounding areas, including my electorate of Barton and the surrounding electorates of Banks, Watson, Throsby and Werriwa because they would be the routes that all this nuclear material would be shipped and transported through in order to get to Lucas Heights. It is an issue that very much affects that entire region of Sydney. Indeed, the issue affects Australia. The minister has asked, 'Why have you spent all this money on developing the Synroc technology?' The fact of the matter is that that technology is extremely valuable and is to be used overseas in other reprocessing plants that already exist. But because that investment is being made in that technology, you do not have to dive headlong into the water-indeed, contaminated water--of developing your own nuclear facility at the grubby, literally poisonous end of the nuclear cycle. The minister said that we were being emotive when we used terms such as 'nuclear power' and 'nuclear fuel'. I do not know what the subject matter of the debate is if it is not about the by-products of nuclear power and nuclear fuel. Let us talk about radioactive contamination and the effects of radiation as indicated in No time to waste, a report of April 1996. It says: The long teml health effects of radiation exposure are manifested by mutation of cells, increased aging capacity of the body, and increased incidence of leukemia, birth defects and cancer. The government asks, 'What are we going to do?' What they are doing is pre-empting research and investigation which was under way during the period of the Labor government. One was an investigation into the future of Lucas Heights-my strong view is that it should have no future; it is right now smack bang in a very beautiful residential area-and the second was to identify a site for the future disposal of waste, including an investigation into the characteristics of that site. This government is proposing to dive headlong into the contaminated pool of this reprocessing plant without first of all investitine gating those issues. In other words, they trying to inject life into the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights by giving it another purpose rather than investigating whether its current purpose should be continued-a very live and sensitive issue in the entire region. The minister-with respect, he has fallen victim to the Yes, Minister men; perhaps with experience he will be able to detect where they are coming from-has said that the Sydney Morning Herald is only reporting what he has been saying for the last few weeks. Today's Sydney Morning Herald Officials envisage using Australia's experimental ""Synroc"" technology for immobilising nuclear waste, thereby demonstrating its first commercial use to the burgeoning nuclear power industry in the Asia-Pacific region. After reprocessing, the waste would be buried somewhere in Outback Australia. If that is not saying that the conduit to outback Australia is coming through a reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights, I do not know what is. They are diving into the Asia-Pacific nuclear processing technology area without Australians deciding whether it is an industry that they want at all. I think that if there were a referendum, Australians would say, 'Stay right out of this one,' just as Europe, Germany and the United States are doing. Without a mandate whatsoever, they are diving straight into this technology-a commercial enterprise for the whole Asia-Pacific regionwhich collects all their waste and reprocesses it. That waste is going to come in from ships and presumably it will come in through Port Botany, through my electorate and through surrounding electorates. Even if it is not going to bring in supplies from overseas, a reprocessing plant most certainly is going to collect waste from areas all around Australia, such as hospitals and irradiation plants that we used to use for irradiating carpets and food and so forth. In mass quantities, to one big bulk store, it will be coming through all the electorates in that area of Sydney. The government has already demonstrated that it is not prepared to consult with local residents. In March of last year there was the disgraceful incident when the government shipped out spent fuel rods to Dounreay through my electorate of Barton in a clandesoperation between midnight and 2 a.m. are without telling people in the electorates. Recently, a British ship was carrying Japanese nuclear waste around our shores and the government did not tell the Australian public that that was occurring. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) is reported as saying that it was a security risk for the route to be public knowledge because of the potential for terrorism to sink the ship. That is precisely the response I got from ANSTO to the March shipment issue. ANSTO considers itself above the law because its nuclear said: science is so sensitive. But in the meantime the residents of all our electorates have to bend over and cop it. They do not have any input whatsoever into what is happening. It is a circumstance where there has been no identification of accountability and no assumption of risk. For instance, who was responsible in that Dounreay shipmentwas it ANSTO, the truck driver or the police who were supervising in case of an accident or some terrorist attack? Who would the residents have sued if it had occurred? I point out to the government that you cannot buy insurance for a nuclear disaster. Mercantile Mutual, for example, says that loss, damage or liability as a result of the use, existence or escape of nuclear weapons material or ionising radiation from, or contamination by radioactivity from, :my nuclear fuel or nuclear waste from the combustion of nuclear fuel is excluded from their policy. Homes and residents in all our areas are not insured against damage from nuclear material and trucks are going to be coming past them day and night. In the April 1996 report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste, entitled No Time To Waste, there is this comment about the compliance with the transport code in respect of the transportation of waste: ... the [Transport] Code requirements are often followed simply because of the unavailability of appropriate transport containers, or the lack of understanding of the Code or both. With the code unworkable, nuclear fuel from all over Australia coming through our electorates into Lucas Heights and ANSTO exempted from state law, our residents are again supposed to cop it. Their kids are sleeping at night, and they do not know if there is a truck carrying contaminated material is going past their front yards. That is an outrageous and unnecessary situation. The minister did not have to go anywhere near this area. He could have left it at examining what is going to happen with Lucas Heights and the feasibility of other sites for the disposal of waste. Instead, he has preempted all the inquiries that were taking place, saying: 'Let us dive into this new economic opportunity' - that is, contaminating Australia. The government is to be condemned for causing the fear that it has. (Time expired)",86
207,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I looked at this MPI proposal and thought: 'This is most extraordinary.' It talks about the consequences of a proposal. If any of the honourable members opposite had bothered to listen to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) at question time, they would have realised what a terrible MPI this was and withdrawn it on the spot. The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) has made a complete fool of himself, and so has his mate the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), who had to follow on after having heard the minister make it very clear in his answer to a question at question time that the government has not made any decision. It could not be any clearer than that. I feel sorry for the poor members of the Labor Party who have had to get up and put this MPI. Obviously, the Labor Party were desperate to find something to put up here. They thought about the poor old member for Bonython and thought: 'He hasn't really had much', and he put this one up because he could not think of much else. It is very sad. But it reflects the judgment that the Australnot Ian people made just over 12 months ago when they put the Labor Party over there because they realised that they were no longer fit for government. That is doubly or trebly true of the former member for Hughes-I will come back to that, because that really was the consequence of what had happened. Thank God, he is no longer here, because of some of the damage he did. If you want to look at what can be damaging for the Australian community and for the people of Hughes in particular, have a look at what the former member was trying to do to this country. Not only is this a sadly misguided MPI but it is also-because of the way the arguments have been presented to the chamber todayone of the most irresponsible in a long time. It is most unfortunate. It does nothing for the credibility of the opposition and very little for the credibility of this chamber to have people coming in here and making such utterly irresponsible and misleading statements. Mrs Bailey-Scaremongering.",88
208,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is scaremongering, as my good friend and colleague over there says. The opposition are clearly desperate to find something to put to this chamber and have come up with this. What is even worse is that, with these utterly misleading statements, they have been playing on the fears of good, decent, ordinary people in Sydney and they have been insulting people, trying to assume that they are ignorant of what all this stands for and of all the fine things that ANSTO has done. My good colleague the member for Gippsland and minister for science has already outlined what a fantastic job ANSTO has done. I might add they were doing that while the Labor Party was in power, too. I did not hear the Labor Party complaining at the time about all the good things that were done by ANSTO for the health of Australians. The way the Labor Party has behaved is quite extraordinary, and I would be far more concerned for the people of Australia and for the people Hughes about having a recycled member for Hughes in the form of Mr Tickner. Look at the damaging consequences of what he did. Look at the Hindmarsh Island fiasco and think. what a reincarnation of the Keating government would mean. We would have the former member for Hughes back. It would be a disaster. The budget deficit would come back. Interest rates would go up. We would see all the woes that the people of Australia thought they had got rid of when, in March last year, they decided that they had to get rid not only of the then member for Hughes but also--Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This debate is about the nuclear reprocessing plant the government wants to put in the electorate of Hughes. It not about interest rates or anything like that, although house prices may go down if this gets built.",88
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)The honourable member for Wannon will address the matter of the discussion of the matter of public importance.,89
210,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I reiterate: if we look at the terms of the matter for public importance, we realise that it is a complete furphy-as the minister pointed out-so we have to talk about other things related to this motion: that is, the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) and the former member for Hughes. The minister, in his complete demolition of this matter, made some very salient points about the Labor Party's problems. He made three points very clearly and enunciated them in a way that all honourable members opposite should have listened to. Firstly and most importantly, he pointed out that Labor had 13 years to look at the problem of what to do with the nuclear fuel rods, and they did nothing-except spend $40 million thinking about what they might do. They never actually did anything. That is the first point, and all honourable members opposite ought to be reminded of that, particularly those who were not here during the debate earlier. The second point he made clearly was that the $40 million was spent on developing Synroc. Then the member for Bonython said, 'That's okay, but we are not allowed to use it in Australia.' We will develop it, but that is for someone else-not in my backyard. It has got to be in another country. We do not care where, as long as it is not in Australia. The opposition, having failed to learn from 13 years in government, has. no policy today. There was absolutely nothing put forward in the debate today to tell us what we might do. So all we get is this scaremongering and, frankly, I think it is damned irresponsible the way the Labor Party put all this up. It ought to be made very clear to those people who live in Sydney that the Labor Party have done nothing but go out and try to run a scaremongering campaign-and insult is people's intelligence by making all sorts of outrageous claims. I would have thought the way the member for Barton approached thisMr Leo MCLeay-My point of order is on standing order 85, which provides: . .. a Member, who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his or her own arguments, or of the arguments used by other Members in debatethe chairmay direct the Member to discontinue his or her speech. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if the member for Wannon continues to rehearse what he has said and what the minister has said you might draw his attention to standing order 85.",89
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Wannon will continue.,90
212,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your support. As I was saying, the presentation by the member for Barton was one of the most irresponsible we have heard in this place for a long time. He got up and made a very misleading speech, full of half-truths, when he said, 'Well, there might be the introduction of a quarantine station; there might be a hospital for infectious es.' Then he said, 'Synroc has to go overseas'-the same sort of thing. Then he started on the problems of radiation. He even referred to some place called 'Nuclear Heights' - I do not know where it is. He was getting carried away with what he was putting forward. Then we got onto terrorists, trying to bring in all the fearmongering he possibly could, not once having listened to what the minister had said in the answer to his question in the first place. I really think the Labor Party come to this debate in a very poor way. They put forward a proposition today that does not even stand up. The smartest thing they could have done was withdraw it before it even got listed for debate. Having listened to what the minister had already said, it was quite clear they had made a dreadful mistake; and now they are coming along, still trying to create fear. Having already been made to look like fools over this whole thing, they then turned around trying to run this fearmongering and deceptive sort of debate, trying to create fear amongst all those people who live in Sydney and totally misleading them. 1 suggest that this is a very poor effort and the chamber deserves better than they have heard today.",90

Firstly, this bill, in conjunction with the Australian Animal Health Council (Live-Stock Industries) Funding Amendment Bill 1997, will establish a statutory levy to fund the dairy industry's contribution to the Australian paid Animal Health Council Ltd. Secondly, this bill will double the maximum research levy rate specified in the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986.

Its mission is to ensure that Australia's animal health service system is capable of maintainin ing acceptable national animal health standfor ards which meet both consumer needs and market requirements in domestic and internavalue tional markets. AAHC is jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth, state governments, the Northern Territory government and the peak representative bodies of Australia's livestock industries, including the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. To date, the dairy industry's contribution to AAHC has been met from surplus moneys paid to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation upon cessation of the exotic animal disease program adjourned. and supplemented by a payment from the Australian Dairy Corporation.

The levy would be imposed in the same manner as other dairy industry levies, that is, on the milk fat and protein content of an individual producer's milk supply. The need to increase the maximum research levy rate has arisen because the current operational research levy rate, which partially funds the activities of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation, is very close to the legislated maximum rate. The present situation provides very little scope for further increases and may significantly curtail the ability of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation to respond to the needs of the industry in the near future. I would point out that a doubling of the maximum research levy will not automatically lead to a rise in the actual research levy rate by producers. Rather, it will provide scope for the dairy industry to seek government approval for an increase in the actual levy rate, as the need arises. The increase in the maximum research levy rate has the full support of the Australian Dairy Industry The dairy industry has enjoyed significant growth in recent years, with milk production 1996-97 expected to pass nine billion litres the first time on record. Around half of this production will be exported with the of exports expected to be about $1.8 billion. These amendments will enhance the capacity of the dairy industry to undertake animal health and research and development activities which, in tum, will contribute to further industry growth and improved competitiveness in domestic and international markets. I commend the bill to honourable members and hand over the explanatory memoranda. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) NA COUNCIL (LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRIES) FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1997",91
222,Mr ANDERSON,AUSTRALIAN ANIMAL HEALTH,"I That the bill be now read a second time. This bill complements the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Amendment Bill 1997 in that it provides for funds raised through the collection of the Australian Animal Health Council Ie y to be paid to the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd. This bill will allow the dairy industry to meet its funding obligations to the council. I commend the bill to honourable members, and hand up the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. NA (No.1) 1997  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (4.19 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Tariff Act) to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. Under item 2 of the schedule to the Tariff Act, 'spirituous beverages' are subject to duties of excise, which are calculated at a dollar amount per litre of alcohol in each beverage. The term was introduced into the Tariff Act in 1985 with the intention of making excisable any beverage that contained a spirit. Since that time, all such beverages have been treated as excisable regardless of their alcohol content, including beverages whose alcohol content ranges from five per cent to nine per cent, for example, the rum and cola mixer drinks. In November 1994 Carlton and United Breweries, CUB, commenced the manufacture of the product known as 'Subzero Alcoholic Soda' which had an alcohol content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service, the ACS, considered 'Subzero' excisable under subitem 2(H) of the schedule to the Tariff Act as a spirituous beverage. CUB appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT. On 7 June 1996 the AAT determined that the production of 'Subzero', with such a low alcohol content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and was therefore not excisable under subitem 2(H). The decision was based on what the AA T considered is commonly regarded as the definition of 'spirit' in the community, which is a strong alcoholic liquor usually containing not less than 37 per cent alcohol by volume. The ACS is appealing this decision to the Federal Court. Since the AAT decision, CUB has ceased manufacturing 'Subzero' using alcohol derived by distillation. However, there are several other companies-UDA, Remy Australia, Swift and Moore and Angove-who manufacture beverages of low alcohol content which are based on, for example, brandy or whisky. The ACS has continued to impose excise duty under subitem 2(H) on these beverages as they are considered by the ACS to be spirituous beverages. The payments of excise duty by these other manufacturers are being made under deposit in accordance with section 154 of the Excise Act 1901 on the basis that, since the AA T 'Subzero' decision, these manufacturers allege that these beverages are no longer excisable. Prior to this decision, there was no dispute with manufacturers of the low alcohol beverages using distilled alcohol as to their excisability nor to their proper classification to subitem 2(H) of the schedule to the Tariff Act. In order to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, it is proposed to amend the Tariff Act to: (i) delete all references to 'spirituous beverages' in the schedule and item 2 (item 1 of schedule 1 refers); and (ii) clarify that excise liability is imposed upon all beverages which contain distilled alcohol (new subitem 2(H), item 2 of schedule 1 refers). The combination of these amendments will remove any connotation as to the strength that an alcoholic beverage must be before it will be excisable. All such beverages will continue to be excisable regardless of their alcohol content and the excise duty will be calculated according to the alcohol content of the beverages. It is also proposed that the amendments will take effect on and from 3 February 1996. The effect of the retrospective commencement date of the amendments will be to extinguish all rights of appeal to the AAT in relation to the excisability of low alcohol beverages and all rights to refunds of excise duty in respect of such beverages. The commencement of the amendments on this date is considered justifiable on the following grounds: (a) As previously referred to, the intention of the term 'spirituous beverages' was to make excisable any beverage that contained a spirit and there had never been any dispute as to this intention prior to the 'Subzero' case. It is considered that the amendments are not altering the law with respect to alcoholic beverages as it stood at the time of the 'Subzero' decision but are merely clarifying what was the status quo. It is therefore considered appropriate that the amendments commence on 3 February 1996 to remove the technical loophole which was uncovered in the Tariff Act by that decision which this amending legislation is now removing. (b) The commencement of the amendments on 3 February 1996 would not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages. The excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers, under deposit, and the 3 February 1996 commencement would protect the government against all claims for recovery of this duty. If the amendments do not commence on 3 February 1996, however, the government might be liable to pay $12.6 million in refunds of excise duty if the Federal Court confirms the AAT decision in favour of CUB. Given that the products manufactured by these companies have been sold duty paid, such a favourable decision to the companies would represent a windfall gain to them, with little chance that it would be returned to the consumers of the product. The proposed amendments, including their financial impact, are outlined in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Tbeopbanous) adjourned. NA NA (REGISTRA TION CHARGES) BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with a request for an amendment. Ordered that the requested amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendment(1) Clause 5, page 3 (lines 6 to 8), omit subclause (4), substitute: (4) When working out the enrolments for a course for a year: (a) for a course of at least 26 weeks duration-each student who is enrolled in the course at any time during the year counts as one enrolment; and (b) for a course of less than 26 weeks duration-each student who is enrolled in the course at any time during the year counts as 0.5 of an enrolment.",91
223,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (4.26 p.m.)-I move: That the requested amendment be made. This legislation is an important part of quality assurance in a very important developing Australian industry. Our export education industry is now, on some measures, bigger than the wheat industry. It is a $1.9 billion a year industry. It attracts over 50,000 students every year to our country. As one distinguished academic said to me graphically but inelegantly the other day, 'Every overseas student on our campus is $100,000 on the hoof for Australia.' Mr Latham interjecting",93
224,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"It was graphic and descriptive. This legislation is an important part of the quality assurance process. It is a continuation of the scheme that was introduced by the former government as a result of the unfortunate fact that 15,000 or so overseas students had to be bailed out by the taxpayers after their ELICOS colleges had gone under. The original legislation counted every student equally for the purposes of the registration charge. This amendment specifies that students doing courses 26 weeks or less will only count for half that value for the purposes of the registration charges. It acknowledges the large number of students doing short courses. I suppose the amendment means that the scheme can be rendered analogous to the purchase of motor car insurance: we are not only providing a discount for fleet buyers but also, in a sense, providing a discount for low mileage. The problem with the original piece of legislation was brought to the attention of the government by the industry associations, by the opposition, by the Australian Democrats and by the Greens. As a result, this amendment has gone through the Senate and it has now come before the House. May I say that the process by which this was achieved in the Senate is an example of how a responsible upper house can improve legislation. I commend the amendment to the House.",93
225,Dr THEOPHANOUS,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"On behalf of the opposition I wish to say that we are pleased that this amendment has been made. We are not very happy with the general process which was put into place about overseas students, but this does recognise a very important distinction and makes the burden much easier to bear for those students, of which there are very many, who are coming in for short courses. It is a very positive sign that the government has recognised that this amendment was needed and is going to assist in further ing the participation of overseas students in Australia. This is obviously a very important area and, indeed, a very important industry. We commend the amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative.

226,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Just to assist the House, it is the intention of the opposition to raise matters at schedule 1, part I; schedule 3; schedule 4; and schedule 5. I have no opposition to handling schedules 2, 6, 7 and 8 as a whole and allowing those to pass without debate, unless the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has matters that he wishes to raise in schedules 2, 6, 7 and 8. They can be taken without opposition. I can also indicate that the Labor Party has no opposition to the government amendments that I understand the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) will be moving, so that might assist the House in processing the bill.",94
227,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have no problem with schedules 2, 6, 7 and 8 either. I assume we are going to deal with the rest of the bill in numerical order. Schedule I, item 1.",94
228,Mr LATHAM,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"As I foreshadowed in the second reading debate, boostthe Labor Party is opposed to the moving forward of a limitation on special depreciation on trading ships from the year 2002 to 1997. The shadow minister for transport indicated last year that the Labor Party was opposed to the way in which this government was attempting to put Australian shipowners at a disadvantage and attempting to encourage the entry of flags of inconvenience to Australia. There were measures debated in the parliament and the public arena through the course of 1996 that dealt with those matters. We regard this provision at item 1 of schedule 1, an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as a backdoor way of achieving the things that the government could not achieve last year. It is opposed by the Labor Party and we will be voting accordingly.",94
229,Mr TANNER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (4.35 p.m.)Further to the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I would just like to add with respect to the abolition of the accelerated depreciation provisions regarding Australian ships that this is part of a broader attack on Australia's maritime industry by this government and it is particularly inappropriate when you consider the availability of accelerated depreciation for a range of other equipment, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors. There are two key points that I would like to make in this debate on this issue. The first is that, almost without exception, the countries that Australia competes with in the maritime industry support their industries in some form or other with provisions such as accelerated depreciation, tax rebates for their seafarers and other initiatives. This is widespread throughout the world. It is not a level playing field. The situation in this industry is that virtually all of the players substantially subsidise their shipping industries. Australia has little hope of being able to be a significant player in the maritime industry without such supports. The former government put these supports in place, and not at huge cost-significant contributions but not at enormous cost to the budget-and without those supports the Australian shipping industry is likely to dwindle fairly rapidly into virtually nothing. It is something that suits ideological orientation of this government, which essentially sees transport as nothing more than a cost, that it is a cost to miners and farmers and that it is not an industry of importance in its own right. Yet; in areas like aviation and the maritime industry, transport delivers substantial export dollars, improves our balance of payments situation and, of course, provides skilled and well-paid jobs for Australians. If this provision is passed by this parliament, it will ensure the further export of Australian jobs and the further incursion of flags of convenience shipping into Australia with all of the threats that that imposes, particularly to our marine environment, and it will ensure that we have a reduction in our overall trading situation. Australia is the fifth biggest maritime nation on earth. In terms of volume carried per kilometre, Australia is the fifth largest market for shipping in the world. A situation where something like 97 per cent of that market is filled by foreign shipping is something that I do not think should be allowed to continue, yet this government clearly wants to see it at 100 per cent. The second point that I would make with respect to this provision is that, when you actually look at the various accelerated depreciation provisions that are available in other sectors, the hypocrisy of the government's position becomes very apparent. When you look at things like bulldozers, cropdusters, tractors, a whole range of agricultural equipment-and I am sure the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) knows this only too well because of his background-you see that accelerated depreciation of 20 per cent, which is what the former shipping provision was, up to as high as 40 per cent for things like cropdusters is almost universal across a wide range of high cost major capital equipment in agricultural and pastoral industries. One of the things this proposal exposes is that this government does not mind subsidies and does not mind a bit of assistance here and there provided it is to their mates. When it is the for industries that they do not approve of, when it is for industries that they are ideologically opposed to, they then say, 'No, you cannot have any assistance,' even when there is a strong case for it because of the nature of the international marketplace where there is widespread assistance amongst our competitors. This is a very stark contrast: a government that is prepared to have accelerated depreciation for the industries where it draws a lot of its political support from but for those where it does not see itself as politically favouredeven though they are just as important to Australia's overall economic position-it says, 'No, we will get rid of that support. We do not want to have anything to do with it.' The Australian community, the Australian maritime industry, the Australian shipbuilding industry and the various industries associated with the provision of maritime services will be the losers. It will not just be the Maritime Union of Australia and the seafarers, which the government hates. It will not just be those people and their jobs that are affected. There will be a range of flow-on effects as a result of the attacks on the maritime industry, of which this abolition of accelerated depreciation is but one part. Those flow-on effects will spread right through a variety of industries and a variety of economic opportunities and will ultimately have a negative impact on our balance of payments.",95
230,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.40 p.m.)-I have just a few comments to make on this taxation legislation. The previous speaker for the opposition, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), indicated that we are not supportive of people in the maritime industry. Of course we are. We came into government and we made an election commitment to wind up the ships capital grants scheme. Eligibility for tax concessions under section 57 AM of the act is linked to the operation of the SCG Act. There is a need for competition in every industry in Australia, including the shipping industry. We believe that the measures which the government has undertaken here and in other areas of government administration are appropriate. Therefore, we support schedule 1, item 1 as it stands.

231,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"I have one brief observation on schedule 3 which is probably appropriate for me to make now. It is of a general nature and I touched on it in my speech on the second reading. I want to make again a short comment about the technical amendment to division 13A. Division 13A concerns the determination of the market value of shares involved in this amendment. There has been some concern around the place-amongst professionals anyway-that the changes will force many taxpayers to retrospectively alter the methods of calculation they currently use to value these shares. That will involve, where it comes about, a considerable amount of inconvenience but, more importantly, will impose compliance costs on those taxpayers which might have been possible to avoid had the amendments been more sympathetically drafted. Items 1 to 7 agreed to. Schedule 3, item 8.",97
232,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"As I outlined in the second reading debate, the Labor Party is opposed to this particular provision. We see no sense or rationale for reducing the invitation threshold for employee share schemes from 75 per cent to 66 per cent. This might be seen as a change of a NOES small proportion, but it is still a significant proportion. To move to a situation where, hypothetically, one-third of employees could be excluded from the share offer is, I believe, a step in the wrong direction. We have had no clear explanation as yet from the government as to why it is proposing in item 8 of schedule 3 the move from 75 per cent to 66 per cent. The government should explain to the House the rationale that the government and the cabinet are advancing. PAIRS We believe these share schemes should be as broad based and as inclusive as possible. Moving from 75 per cent to 66 per cent is a step in the opposite direction, and for that reason it is opposed by the Australian Labor Party.",97
233,Mr MILES,NOES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.56 p.m.)-We believe those changes make the employee share schemes more viable, and there was industry interest in doing so.",97
234,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"Werriwa) (4.56 p.m.)Could I just ask the extent of consultation the government has had with employee associations. It is all right to say that the captains of industry regard this as more viable. They undoubtedly will be in the invitation, whether it is 66 per cent or 75 per cent. We are talking about employees; we are talking about the work force; we are talking about trade unionists in many cases. I would like to hear from the government as to whether or not their consultation went beyond the captains of industry and actually got to the shop floor to consult with the average working Australians who will be affected by this change.

235,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"The Labor Party has no opposition from its readof the ing of the amendments, but we would have thought it was respectful to the House to have some explanation of them by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). It is not too often by a decent Westminster standard that legislative amendments are moved and then the mover sits down. Normally, there is some explanation. I do not know if the advisers, who are looking anxious, provided the relevant notes, but at least they should be recited to the House. I would invite the parliamentary secretary to do so. Can the House of Representatives have some explanation of the government's reasons for these amendments on issues that have invited an enormous amount of public controversy, not least of all from the Australian Society of CPAs, which has been very critical of the government's proposed rollover relief for capital gains tax? If these amendments are the answer to those criticisms, then in terms of public accountability and, most importantly, accountability to the chamber, the government should have some explanation of what it is doing. Have you something to say?",99
236,Mr MILES,NOES,Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.00 p.m.)-We did cover some of the issues which the opposition spokesman raised in the Main Committee this morning. If you want to go through the details in regard to comments about the Australian Society of Certified Practising AccountantsMr Latham-There are 25 amendments.,100
237,Mr MILES,NOES,"I understand that. Obviously, we could go through in detail what those amendments are all about. Obviously, there is a range of issues that are involved in the details of those 25 amendments. Quite frankly, I think most of the details are pretty obvious. We want to ensure that this legislation is moved through the House reasonably rapidly. There are many technical amendments which are important in this area, and we just want to move on with the legislation.",100
238,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"Whilst we are dealing with schedules 4 and 5 together and the government's amendments to them, I will try to break up my remarks a little to give the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) an opportunity, if he wishes to take it, to respond to some concerns I have with the detail. They are not only my concerns, I might add; they are also those expressed by the Taxation Institute of Australia and the Corporate Taxpayers Association. They have told me that they do not accept the view, when talking about schedule 4, major underlining interests, that the concept of backdating from the date of an unusual trade has always been part of the framework of section 160ZZS or its administration. I did touch on that in my speech in the second reading debate and I referred to an income tax ruling by the commissioner. I have already made that point, but I do not think, in summing up the second reading debate, that it was addressed. The parliamentary secretary may be able to comment on that. Furthermore, the two bodies to which I have already referred are not of a mind to accept that it is appropriate for schedule 4 to specify dates by which underlying ownership analysis should be completed to impose substantial sanction where this does not otherwise occur. They are also very toey about the reservation being provided at the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation to override the one per cent notional shareholder test. Furthermore, they make the point more than adequately that the definitions of abnormal trading are excessively broad. I might go into that in a little detail, depending on the way this debate goes. The TIA and the Corporate Taxpayers Association support the use of 'reasonable approximation' testing as at a date proximate to 20 September 1985 and similar flexibility, in their view, should be allowed in respect of subsequent testing dates. Still on schedule 4, perhaps I could refer to the transitional provisions as speIt out in section 160ZZSA. These appear to be circular to say the least. Section 160ZZSA(1)(b) seems to exclude the new regime whenever section 160ZZS(1) has been attracted prior to 20 January 1997. But subsequent provisions appear to proceed on a contrary assumption. For example, section 160ZZSC(4) presupposes that the new regime may apply in cases where a prior public ruling imposed a requirement to test and that the test would have been failed prior to 20 January 1997. The intention appears to have been to exclude the new regime only in cases where there has already been an adverse determination under section 160ZZS and that the taxpayers involved have conceded that it applies. In all other cases, it would appear that it is intended that matters can be dealt with and, if necessary, determined independently by the commissioner under sections 160ZZSC(3) and 160ZZSC(4). The new regime imposes a positive obligation to 'make a determination by an examination of its records showing whether majority underlying interests' were relevantly held. (Extension of time granted) The drafting presupposes that the determination will yield either a yes or no answer. The reality may well be that such matters remain unclear, notwithstanding all the diligence that can be reasonably required and expected within the period allowed. In those cases, the company may be unable to make any determination. That might be through lack of information or merely uncertainty concerning the effect of the provision. In short, it is inappropriate to assume in such cases that the company should make an adverse determination. The failure to make a determination leads to not inconsequential outcomes for the taxpayer. The purpose or effect of requiring by examination of its records is worthy of some further consideration and clarification. For example, is the intention that the basis for determination be limited to an examination of corporate records and, if so, when? That sort of limitation may well be inappropriate. Is the intention that there be no right or obligation to go beyond records? I would like to quote direct from written information I have from the Taxation Institute of Australia. They say: Where the company fails duly to make a determination within the time allowed, the test is effectively deemed to have been failed at the commencement of the test period. The penalties or consequences which flow from this will often be inappropriate. Thus (for example) if a company fails to make a determination as at 20 January 1997, it is deemed to have acquired the asset on 20 September 1985 for a consideration equal to the market value on that date. That would be entirely inappropriate if the failure arises because the company is unable to make the determination, or fails to do so because it is not aware of an abnormal trading triggering event. It would also lead to entirely inappropriate results if, for example, the test had clearly been satisfied up to December 1985 (and had appreciated in value to that time) but it was unclear whether or not it was satisfied thereafter. The risk of such an outcome could be worse than any risk of application of Sec. 160ZZS(1 ). It is also not in accord the principle espoused in the Budget Papers which was that the amendments would defer the date at which assets lose their pre-CGT status from the date when the majority underlying ownership changed to the time when the test of underlying ownership is required to be conducted. The institute goes on: The determination must be made within the 'prescribed period' which is defined as a period generally of 6 months duration. This period may well prove to be insufficient and unworkable. Where an adverse determination is made at 20 January 1997, the consequences may depend on whether or not the entity was 'required before 20 January 1997 under a ruling' to apply the tests under Sec. 160ZZS ... (3) and (4). Presumably the rulings to which this refers are IT253""O and IT2361. In cases where such rulings required that a test be made, Subsec.(4) should make it clear that the 'abnormal trading' or other events triggering the need to test supply the determination time. The institute goes on to demonstrate that the definitions of 'abnormal trading' have the very real potential to operate in circumstances which rulings 2530 and 2361 would not have been regarded as requiring that the test be made and, as a consequence, it may give rise to considerable uncertainty. (Time expired)",100
239,Mr MILES,NOES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.12 p.m.)-Some of the issues which the previous speaker was referring to are obviously issues which require judgment and really go to some political judgment issues. Some of the others which the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has raised I am very happy to seek advice on from the Treasurer (Mr Costello). On two things which he raised in regard to the Corporate Taxpayers Association and the Tax Institute of Australia, the government does not agree that there is no change in policy to the old section 160ZZS. In regard to the definition of 'abnormal trade', we believe that the CTA issue there is too narrow. Of course, that is a judgment which has to be made in these matters.",101
240,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). I am not sure whether he is aware of the detail of the TIA's concern, but the definition of 'abnormal with trading' does bear looking at. I do not think it is just a matter for judgment; I think it is a matter of equity and perhaps even of this element of the legislation operating as intended. The definition of 'abnormal trading', as proposed, might lead to it being contended that the only trading which can qualify as normal trading is trading which occurs on a stock exchange and then only if the volume is within a very narrow range. Should that be the case, the allotment of shares, however small, might be regarded as requiring that a test be made. That gets to the point, which the parliamentary secretary, I am sure, will be interested in, that allotments under employee share plans-also referred to in another schedule in this legislation-or dividend reinvestment plans might trigger these provisions. Allotment of shares, on the basis that it was abnormal, or that they might trigger the provision that it was abnormal, or on the basis that involves five per cent of the shares-although it does not alter the underlying interests at all-is part of the problem. The width of the definitions for abnormal trading, read in conjunction with the consequences of failure to make a determination, make further inappropriate results quite likely. The determination, in fact, might not be made because the company is simply unaware of facts subsequently contended to constitute abnormal trade. That is where you get into problems, once again, with giving the commissioner discretion. The interplay-I noted the assurance of the parliamentary secretary and for which I am grateful-of ITs 2530 and 2361 is presently constituted. The end result is that a failure to make a determination results in a failure of the tests under 160ZZS. I see that that may not be in the mind of the parliamentary secretary and, therefore, the government and is a matter of concern. I do not know if the parliamentary secretary wants to answer that or if I could go on to something slightly relevant, but in the same vein. Mr Miles-Keep going.",101
241,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"Where the capital shareholding is less than one per cent, at the end of the day, section 160ZZSQ reserves to the Commissioner of Taxation a discretion to disregard subdivisions providing special rules for holdings of less than one per cent. That strikes me as being totally inappropriate in light of the history-some of which I have touched on-referring to the commissioner's rulings under present legislation. The special rules for holdings of less than one per cent are intended to provide the basis on which the rules are saved from being unworkable. They also provide the major criteria on which the new regime can be said to assist -.;, rporates. This section, 160ZZSQ, effectively empowers the commissioner to withdraw these features while leaving in place the 'various aspects of the legislation which have the effect of making changes in policy applied to the section which are adverse to taxpayers. The TIA says, in this context, that the provisions obviate the need to trace through complying superannuation funds. It would be preferable if these provisions were excluded to foreign superannuation funds and not noncomplying funds. (Extension of time granted) This will conclude my remarks under schedule 4, unless the parliamentary secretary in response raises something worthy of further comment. The need for rulings in respect of which such rulings are necessary if the new regime is to have prospects of operating fairly are of interest. For example, there are a number of provisions which provided for the exercise of discretions on the part of the commissionersome of which I have referred to-and I would refer the parliamentary secretary to sections 160ZZSA3B, 160ZZSC(2) and 160ZZSD(2) in addition to 160ZZSQ. It was previously understood by the TIA that rulings would be made available in relation to the exercise of various discretions as long ago as last December. That understanding was arrived at last December. They seem to be under the impression that the rulings would specifically address matters such as the used dates reasonably approximate to 20 September 1985 and application of the old regime recognising a safe harbour where past events are not captured by the new rules. They and I urge that drafts of these rulings be made available for comment as a matter of priority and preferably while the legislation is still before the parliament, albeit the Senate.",102
242,Mr MILES,NOES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.20 p.m.)-There are just a couple of things that I want to raise. First of all, in regard to the one per cent, I think even the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) indicated that the commissioner has discretion in that area. I will just make that comment again that there is discretion by the commissioner in that area. In regard to the rulings, rulings cannot be made until the legislation is actually passed. The government is undertaking consultation in regard to that matter at this present time. Mr Rocher-Draft rulings can be made available to the professionals.",102
243,Mr MILES,NOES,My understanding is that rulings cannot be made in this regard-it is the advice I have-until the act is actually passed. We are undertaking consultations in this area at this present time.,102
244,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"The taxation commissioner can do what he likes and prepare draft rulings for discussion. There is no impediment to his doing that. Certainly, there can be no final rulings until the legislation is passed or there would have to be exceptional circumstances. Why not make the draft rulings available, as I interjected? This institute was led to believe that they would be made available pretty soon after the legislation was introduced into the House.",103
245,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"In capital my second reading contribution to the Taxsay ation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), I raised the concerns of the Australian Society CPAs about the capital gains tax rollover relie- provisions. The Parliamentary Secretary (Cab1Oet) to the Prime Minister, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), mentioned that he had addressed some of those concerns in his summing up speech in the Main Committee. I was not able to be in the Main Committee at the time; I took the view, joined by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), that this debate was best conducted in the House. operators However, the member for Braddon has been kind enough to show me a written version of some of the things that he said in the Main Committee. One matter that I would now raise with him is the question of relief quantity in dollar terms. The main point made by the Australian Society of CPAs is that they believe they have been 'hoodwinked' - that is their word n.ot mine-and they regard these relief proviSlOns as a sham. To quote their spokesperson, Mr Hayes: 'In real terms it offers little.' The government has budgeted, as stated in entrepreneurs the explanatory memorandum, for full year costs and concessions of the order of $200 from million to $215 million per annum. I would ask the p-rliamentary secretary to clarify, for the benefIt of the parliament as well as the smal.l - usiness sector throughout the country, speCIfIcally these concerns of the Australian Soci-ty of CPAs: is the government still - onfident that the full relief cost provided for 10 schedules 4 and 5 amounts to $215 million per annum? If not, what revision g.overnment provide to the quantity of concesSIon that the parliament is now examining? r.wr ROCHER (Curtin) (5.24 p.m.)-I am gomg on to the capital rollover stuff. Do you want to answer that now or would you like me to keep going? Mr Miles-Keep going.",103
246,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I hope you do not mind us making these informal arrangements. It is easier. My interest in schedule 5 arises out of the length and complexity of the bill. There are 26 pages dealing with the small business gains tax rollover concession. I would that the complexity has in very considerable measure subverted the government's of policy intentions in this area. The major reason for the length and compl-xity of the legislation seems to be a perceIved need to quarantine goodwill from the other assets of a taxpayer's business-in tum, to prevent small businesses from rolling over a capital gain from the disposal of goodwill into a non-goodwill replacement asset. This seems to be because there is a fear that might try to convert a capital gainfor example, a building development-and shift it into a business with excess goodwill and then claim the partial goodwill exemption for that goodwill. If someone sets out to do that, the general anti-avoidance provisions of part 4A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 would undoubtedly apply. This is an example of how the provisions have been made unduly complex by the inclusion of unnecessary words. The Taxation Institute of Australia on this matter, had this to say: ., The problem is that the Bill now leaves the genuine with no effective rollover relief. For example. someone who has built up a business nothing. so that the assets of the business will be predominantly goodwill. and who wants to attempt to tum around a moribund business where the goodwill may be worth very little. will be locked out of the concession. It is unfortunate that with the introduction of the new rollover provision. the opportunity was not taken to align it and the partial goodwill exemption provision. What policy reason can there be for the different thresholds and differing rules about can the associated businesses. Further, there are a number of conditions limiting the value of proposed rollover to businesses which will ultimately discourage business from seeking to make use of it. Why, for example, must current and prior year losses be first offset? Why indeed. That is not a general requirement for other rollover provisions, and its reason for inclusion in these provisions is obscure to say the least.",103
247,Mr MILES,NOES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.27 p.m.)-I would like to respond to the Australian Society of CPA's comment about being hoodwinked. I think that comment came out on Tuesday, 4 March of this week in an article which responded to the fine print of the so-called CGT rollover relief. Mark Abernethy says: Central to Mr Hayes' concern is the exclusionary nature of the CGT relief. On the surface, the relief seeI?ed open to sole traders, partnerships, companIes and trusts. But a closer reading of the bill showed the majority of Australia's more substantial small businesses would not be eligible. Our response to that is that the provisions that apply are regardless of the structure used to run a small business. For a sole trader in a partnership, the rollover relief is available at the individual level. For a company, the rollover relief is available at the company level. For a trust, the rollover relief is available at the trustee level. This treatment merely reflects the government's announcement that rollover relief will apply to a direct interest in an asset. With regard to partnerships, if one partner buys out another partner in a twoperson partnership, the selling partner can get the rollover relief if the partner buys a new business, either as a partner in a new partnership or as a sole trader.",104
248,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"-The point that has been doubted by the Society of CPAs on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) is whether the government is standing by its $215 million costing. This was also doubted, in very effective terms, by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his second reading contribution earlier in the debate. If the government is standing by that amountif that is the costing and the amount of relief to be provided--can it also provide a guarantee to the House in terms of the integrity of the tax system? It is my understanding that Treasury officials have advised the government of their concerns about the way in which some of these provisions might be open to abuse and - ax minim-sation. I believe it is always very Important In a debate looking at a new form of tax concession to consider the flip side-a flip side that the average working PAYE taxpayer is always concerned about; that is, that the corporate sector in Australia is not bein- opened up for the possibility of shonky practIce and that the government is standing as guardian of the integrity of the tax system. That is a very important guarantee for the government to provide in this debate, particularly when a number of parliamentarians have been made aware of concerns expressed within the bureaucracy. I would ask the parliamentary secretary if he could clarify those two matters. Does the government stand by the $215 million costing after the amendments that have been carried earlier and the public critique that has been offered by a number of organisations? And, if it is standing by the $215 million, does it also offer a guarantee to the House in terms of the integrity of the Australian taxation system?",104
249,Mr MILES,NOES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.31 p.m.)-This is a massive boost of $200 million or so to small businesses in Australia. Obviously, we do believe there is integrity in the taxation system. In those sorts of areas governments down through the years have experienced difficulties which were not foreseen at the time. But we have looked at that and we stand by the integrity of the system. Amendments agreed to. Schedules, as amended, agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to.

251,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"This is a continuation of my speech before I was so conveniently interrupted by emergence of question time today. I am pleased to see, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, that you are in the chair because, before the question time break, ,!,e actually had the effect of inducing you Into the House. What do we see here now when we are debating the bounties legislation, which is going to see jobs lost in all sorts regions around the country? Not one government backbencher in the place; not one. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr .Moore), who is at the table, is pointing to hImself. He has to be here. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) reckons he has had the - ffect of changing your decision, but where IS the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes)? She has not come in in all of this debate. The member for Bendigo is prepared to come into this chamber and at least stand up for w.hat he thinks he has done-not very e-fectIvely-but the member for Kingston is stIll not here. Let me remind the House of what she said. Yesterday she urged the government to be more critical of the advice it received i- preparing its second budget and that cuts to Industry assistance in last year's budget had already hurt the state. That, indeed they have. This is one of those cuts. This is - cut to the book bounty. It has cost 300 Jobs-and the minister laughs at it-at Griffin Press al(;me. bec--se of their inability to plan - d theIr InabIlIty to deal with a secure Investment environment because this government unilaterally cut the bounty from under their feet. The fact is-and it is important because you are in the chair, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - that these issues of cutting the bounty were always attempted and put up to us by Treasury. But as a government we resisted them. There were attempts to reduce these measures in the so called interests of the level playing fieldwhich does not exist. We all want to get there but we are not there now. What we have is a government proposing unilateral disarmament flying in the face of what is happening in threst of the world and expecting our industry to be able to cope. The simple reality is that these firms could compete with overseas countries if those overseas countries did not have support and assistance. That is the truth. They are world competitive. But what they cannot do is compete and get into markets that are restricted to them in those countries. I can remember the circumstances in relation to book publishing where people in this country would lament every time they picked up a new publication which said 'Printed in of Singapore' - printed somewhere else, printed everywhere except Australia. Australians are some of the most avid readers in the world yet we .coul.d not get a book publishing Industry In thIS country until Labor introduced a plan for the book industry. It did so by - u.ppo- through research and development InItIatIves as well as the book bounty-the bounty to level the playing field, the R&D to get them to invest in state-of-the-art technology. But these are programs that this government has come in and slashed, regardless of the consequences. It believes it has got to pursue the budget bottom line rather than consider the consequences. It has established a Productivity Commission, but it will not give it legislative teeth to have regard to the impact on regional economies or to have regard to what our trading partners are doing when it comes to their level of assistance and support. We say that has to change. The member for Bendigo, who is in the chair, has recognised it has to change. It is just that he is impotent in getting that change. He says he has taken representations to the minister. If you have taken representations and been successful to date, as you claim, Mr Deputy Speaker, take some more submissions-because the industry is telling you. If you go and visit Maryborough, they will tell you they want this decision restored, that they want it to the end of next year-and Labor supports the extra six months. But it is also entitled to an inquiry that regard to what is happening in the rest of the world, that has regard to how an industry can continue to position itself. If there is any commitment to regional development, to the people of Maryborough and the people of Adelaide who depend on this industry for jobs, support our amendment. I call on the member for Bendigo, when he is out of the chair, and the member for Kingston to come in and vote with us. (Time expired)",105
252,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"In addressing the bounty legislation this afternoon I am fearful that tomorrow's press in Bendigo will basically have a front page story going to the failure of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) to vote for local electorate jobs. I am really concerned about this because it is an important issue to have the front page of the local papers in Bendigo tomorrow with a banner across the front 'Reid votes against Bendigo electorate jobs'. That is what it is really about: will the member for Bendigo vote for local jobs or will he walk away from his responsibilities? The proposition that we are in support of is very simple: the government proposes that the book bounty be abolished from 1 July rather than 20 August. So far as we are concerned, that is six months short of the original expiry date established by the Australian Labor Party. That expiry date was established in consultation with local industry in places such as Maryborough, South Australia and Queensland. It is about saying to those local employers, 'If you are prepared to give it a go, then we are prepared to give you a go.' We are basically saying that we are prepared to provide the necessary assistance to ensure that you are capable of growing on the export front and as part and parcel of that export growth, capable of providing additional jobs in areas of high need. It is not just places such as Bendigo that we are talking about. We are also talking about Queensland. Let us have a look at some of the high unemployment levels that currently exist in Queensland. I know the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is not too interested in these facts. As at January 1997 what was unemployment in the northhas west of Queensland? It was 10.6 per cent. In the Rockhampton area it was 11.6 per cent and in Far North Queensland around Cairns it was 8.9 per cent-all above the national average. That is why I put it to the House that it is wrong to abolish these industry bounties, especially for the state of Queensland, the minister's home state. The abolition of these industry bounties will take Australia in the opposite direction from what is needed for its development at the moment. I suggest that, if this legislation is passed, Queensland businesses-and it will be on the head of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourismwill lose nearly $7 million. ",106
253,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I know it might be a joke to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, better known on the other side of the House as the bagman. We are talking about a loss of $7 million to the state of Queensland for businesses of all sizes, including small businesses. ",106
254,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"The minister for small business might think it is a joke, he might think job growth is a joke, but I think it is about time that the minister for small business, rather than interjecting, faced up to the fact that he is an abject failure with respect to his performance to date. He has not done a thing to try to create an environment for investment and jobs growth in Australia. In Queensland we are talking about a loss of $7 million a year in assistance from the federal government. Do you know what it means for businesses in Queensland? Some 251 Queensland businesses benefited from the industry bounty scheme in the last financial year, not an insignificant number when you are talking about high unemployment-such as in Rockhampton-of the order of 11.6 per cent. These are secondary industries that are needed to further develop that state. They are needed to broaden its industrial base. They are needed in places such as Townsville, Cairns and Rockhampton. I am waiting to see how the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), how the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and how the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) vote on this amendment. They have a lot to say locally, but when they get to Canberra it is almost as if they have their feet tied together when it comes to standing up for their local electorates. They go missing in action. That is what it is about: they are not prepared to stand and fight for a decent industry policy that assists in creating job opportunities in their local regions. They are the big losers-not only with respect to the bounty legislation but they have already lost on the closure of the CES offices; and they have lost as a result of the increase in HECS payments and with respect to changes in Telstra and the loss of local jobs in the service centres. So I think it is about time they said that enough is enough. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has to be stood up and told the hard facts of life-that, as far as we are concerned, jobs are the order of the day.

255,Mr MOORE,PAIRS,"by leave-I move government amendments Nos 2 and 3: (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 24), omit ""21 May 1997"", substitute"" 1 October 1997"". (3) Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (line 32), omit ""21 May 1997"", substitute ""1 October 1997"". These amendments are consequent on the government's decision to extend the termination date of the book bounty. The amendments introduce an absolute end date of 30 September 1997 for book bounty claims, 90 days after the end of the bounty period proposed in the previous amendment. This will ensure that the administration of the scheme is wound up quickly and that the majority of payments for eligible productions are made as soon as possible after the end of the period of the eligible production. I commend the amendments to the House.",107
256,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"It is true that these are consequential amendments. They are consequential on the government betraying the book publishing industry in this country by abolishing a bounty for them, by being forced to reverse that decision, but to only partially proceed down the reversal route. We are saying that the book bounty should be extended by another six months. This government has just voted against that and there are people who should have voted on this side, like the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), who still is not in this chamber, who still will not come in and defend her actions. She still will not come in and tell us why she is prepared to go to the Adelaide Advertiser and complain about the cuts to industry programs but will not come into this chamber and stand up for the people of Kingston. We also have the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who is still in the chair. He can at least claim that he abstained on the last vote because he was protected by the chair.",108
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! You are casting a reflection on the role that I play in the chamber.,108
258,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I withdraw the reflection. I simply make the point that you were missing in action in New York last year when it was time for standing up for the book publishing industry. We would hope that you would actually exercise a vote in favour of the people of Maryborough in your electorate, a quarter of the work force of which town depends on this book bounty. It is an industry that did not exist before Labor introduced the book bounty, an industry where, if you ever wanted to read a book in this country, you opened the first page and found that it was printed in some overseas country. The fact of the matter is this was an uncompetitive country and it could not get into the game because all the other countries were supporting their book publishing industry. Labor introduced a two-pronged attack: it said, 'Invest in the technology and we'll give you tax deductions for it.' As a government they have wiped out the tax deductions despite the fact they went to the last election promising to keep them. Broken promise, bad policy-two bad hits. But then we also had the book bounty, which we were always being told we had to get rid of. The member for Bendigo made reference to this earlier-that Labor trotted out a plan to get rid of the book bounty itself. It is true that the bureaucrats put that forward, but we opposed it. It did not come and it did not get passed. If it had have been passed, why would we be debating the issue today? So for you to come in and say that we voted down the books bounty. back in 1993 is just plain wrong because, if it were true, we would not be debating this issue now. Let us understand that the only people who put book publishing on the map in this country were Labor: Labor through the books bounty, Labor through industry support. Labor has seen the growth of this industry, an industry which has seen a doubling of exports in the space of time in which it has been in place, an industry which previously saw non-existent jobs growth. There has been 200 per cent export growth over the past 12 years that this plan has been in place under Labor, and it has taken them six months to abolish it, despite the fact they told no-one during the election campaign they would do it. I would have liked to have seen Deputy Speaker Reid out campaigning in Maryborough saying, 'Have we got a plan for you when we get into government. We are going to get rid of the books bounty, which is going to wipe out a quarter of the work force in Maryborough.' That would have been a great campaign! But he did not say that, of course; he said quite the opposite. He said, 'We're going to keep it,' and then he comes along and is part of the decision to abolish it. It is a disgrace. We have the member for Kingston shedding crocodile tears in today's Adelaide Advertiser saying, 'Cuts to industry assistance in last year's budget already hurt the state,' but will she be in the House today? She has not attended except to vote, and then she voted the wrong way. She is inconsistent the posi,tion she talks about in the press and inconsistent in representing her constituents in this chamber. The facts of the matter are that Labor is the only party that has been prepared to support the book publishing industry in this country and it is the coalition which has come along as the new vandals-wreck the industry, wreck regions and put them at the mercy of the international marketplace where there is no such thing as a level playing field.",108
259,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Is it not amazing to hear the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) speak about promises? You see, there was an election prior to the last one where the Liberal Party and the coalition went to the people with a brand newMr Crean-Have you ever read a book?",109
260,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Go and check my time at Perth Modem School, which would never have let you in. I got there by winning a scholarship, so do not worry about that, you dope. Mr Crean-I am deeply offended and I ask him to withdraw.",109
261,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,I would because I can think of worse things he is.,109
262,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member would help the House if he directed his remarks through the chair. Mr Crean-Did you? Has he withdrawn, Mr Deputy Speaker?",109
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Yes. Mr Crean-I did not hear him say that.,109
264,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I withdrew, now you sit down. The reality is that promises were made-and supported by the shadow minister at the table in the election prior to the last one-that there would be no new taxes, but that it was the dreadful coalition that was going to restructure taxation to give the book industry, to give the motor car industry and to give everybody else a tax regime that at that time would have, for instance, taken $700 or $800 out of the manufactured cost of a motor car. They stood up and said, 'You don't need anything of that and, what's more, we will give you l-a-w tax cuts without imposing any additional taxation at all.' What did you do? You came to office, you cancelled the l-a-w tax cuts and you imposed 6c a litre on distillate fuels and you tell us about decentralisation. What is the worse tax you can put on decentralisation? Fuel tax. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, and it relates to relevance. For the purposes of the member for O'Connor, this is a debate about the books bounty. He has not yet once mentioned books or the impact of this decision and you should get him to speak to the issue.",109
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"There is no point of order. I have been listening closely to the member for O'Connor. This has been a far ranging contribution, as the member for Hotham and the member for Batman know, but I do invite the member for O'Connor to return to the text of the bill.",109
266,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"At the very point of interruption, I was making the point about decentralised industry. I kept hearing the shadow minister carrying on about your decentralised electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the electorate of Kingston in South Australia, which is quite distant from all the major markets of Melbourne and Sydney. Quite clearly, book producers and book printers have to transport large quantities of paper to their premises and, of course, redistribute those books and they use road transport. The first thing that the Keating government did was put a special tax on that transport. The man is so dull that he does not think transport affects the efficiency of industries throughout Australia. He is winding his finger around saying it does not matter. The problem is that I think you believe that transport has no effect on Australian industry. It has been said by some of your colleagues on occasions that it represents about one dollar in every seven that Australians are obliged to spend. You put a substantial tax on it after the election where you promised no tax increases at all. Do not come in here with your arguments about consistency. I used to say of the Democrats that you cannot buy them, you can only rent them by the hour. That is the statement that I am going to use about you people in future because the Democrats might be socialists, but at least they have become consistent. Mr Crean-On a point of order: the member is required to address all of his remarks through the chair. I would ask you to draw his attention to that standing order and ask him to comply with it.",109
267,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I am delighted to do so. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the members of the Labor Party are best described these days as having so much integrity that you cannot buy them, you can only rent them by the hour. An hour is probably longer than anyone of your current policies would survive. You are outrageous in that regard. The book industry would be much better off without your fuel tax. It would be a lot better off without your $10,000 million interest charge that appeared in the budget and which would allow all sorts of financial assistance to be given in all sorts of areas. That is impossible as the government of today is obliged to address the $80,000 million of additional debt that you added to the budget bottom line. (Time expired) Amendments agreed to. Items, as amended, agreed to. Items 4 and 5-by leave-taken together.",110
268,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I thought we were actually going to get something of an explanation from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), but as always he is quick to cut the programs and never explain. We now have the computer bounty. The coalition government made a core promise during the election to retain the computer bounty. This promise was clearly made because it was something that the Labor Party committed to do and committed to keep running until the year 2000. What did they do in their first budget? They broke that promise comprehensively. Now this is one of the areas that has not yet seen a reversal of form. This area plus the machine tools and robots areas have not got any relief or respite yet. Books and ships have, but not enough, and computers and machine tools and robots have not. Where, might we ask, is the consistency in that position? Do you know what the consistency is, Mr Deputy Speaker? There has been a more effective lobbying campaign run to date by the shipbuilders and book publishers in this country than there has been by the computer and machine tools and robots industries. We will still keep pursuing their interests because certainty has been taken from them. Understand that you have a computer industry in this country which has invested massively in research and development, massively in exports, massively in production and we have seen huge growth in all of those areas of activity. For example, in the last five years exports of information technology related products have trebled in this country. That has occurred because there was a certain regime introduced by Labor-a regime that was built around the partnerships for development program and included the computer bounty and the R&D concessions. Under the partnerships for development program there was a requirement for firms entering into the program to commit to levels of growth in production, R&D and exports. All of those targets and commitments have been met until now. Why will they not be met now? Because the government deceived this industry during the last election by promising to retain the bounty. It wiped it OUt-3V2 years in one fell swoop. It also reduced the tax deductibility from 150 per cent to 125 per cent with the minister saying, 'You should be thankful because it could have gone to 100 per cent.' His defence was, 'I have really saved you because the cuts could have been worse.' This level of growth would not have occurred had it not been for the plan and the certainty introduced by Labor. The simple fact of the matter is that the manufacturing industry has grown in this country. We have seen huge growth in the exports of certain key industries-the information technology industry being amongst them-but it only happened because there was a plan behind those industries. What does the industry itself have to say about the government's decision? Mr Neville Roach, the Managing Director of Fujitsu, wrote to us saying: Both the present government and its predecessor supported the extension of the computer bounty as recently as 1995. This bipartisan support only came after a long and exhaustive period of consultation between the industry and government. Both recognised that the bounty is not a subsidy but rather compensation to local manufacturers for additional component cost and they result from other decisions that the government had taken. This was addressing market failure. This was recognising that, if the industry was to grow, it had to have this market failure addressed. The minister is on record as saying that he recognises the need to intervene where there is market failure. Well, he recognises the need to intervene, but he has cut away the intervention. Some intervention! You recognise the problem, but you are not prepared to address the cure. It is no wonder you have had criticism from this industry. We believe this is also an area that has to be reversed. The government has to return to the commitment they made during the election and support the local information technology industry. We will be persisting with this measure to get that reversal. (Extension of time granted) What we have got is the circumstance in which there is no commitment from the minister to support an industry, though it was his promise, his policy. He went to the last election saying it. No doubt he went to his le-der and said, 'This is a vital area to secure because there are lots of employees in the manufacturing sector in computers, and we've got to keep them onside. We don't want to frighten anyone during the election campaign.' The minister went and sold the promise. He put it out in public terms in a document and said, 'We will keep the computer bounty.' Do you deny that, Minister? I know you will not get up and speak in this debate, because your position is indefensible. Mr Moore interjecting",110
269,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"The minister says he relies on Keating. This is the person who said, 'We're going to lift standards.' This is the person who said, 'We're going to do it differently to Labor.' I tell you what: the commitments we made in terms of industry support were honoured. That is the reason why the manufacturing industry in this country had started to grow and had started to contribute. The minister might be interested in looking at today's national accounts figures because they address the question of production over a the last quarter. The manufacturing sector has seen a 2.6 per cent reduction in outputs. That has occurred because of the policies that you put in place as a result of the budget. There is no point saying to the industry, as the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would have us believe, that you have got interest rates down or you have done these other things if in fact you are putting them out of the game. There is no way they will stay in it. If you are undermining these industries by stripping away the mechanisms by which their exports have grown, then what you are doing is really denying this country the opportunity for significant, huge advances. The fact of the matter is that the minister has made a commitment. The only target the government has set, I might add, is a target of 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing. But every time the minister has been asked in this place to tell us what his strategy is to get there, he has not done it. He has not even asked his department to produce a strategy for it. How are you going to achieve it when, in one quarter alone, you have had a decline in manufacturing production by a massive 2.6 per cent? You come into this place and claim that everything is doing well in terms of the national accounts and that growth is on course, but growth is going down and manufacturing production has gone into the negative. Mr Moore--It has gone up.",111
270,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"It has not gone up. Have a look at the figures yourself, if you are capable of interpreting them. Manufacturing production has gone down by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter. It is no coincidence that that reduction has occurred against the backdrop of the massive cuts to industry programs. It is no wonder the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) is telling you through today's Adelaide Advertiser that the cuts to industry assistance in last year's budget have already hurt her state. They have not only hurt that state; they have hurt the nation-and they have hurt it to the tune of a reduction in manufacturing production. How are you going to get jobs if you have got reductions in production in the manufacturing sector? I ask you that. Where do you think these jobs are going to come from? Unless you have the supportive framework and the certainty that encourages industries to invest and to make the commitment to continue to get into those overseas markets, it simply will not materialise. I believe we have a minister in this chamber who is incapable of getting a message through and incapable of winning an argument in his cabinet. He has fallen for the view that he has to deliver budget cuts at any cost, but the costs are horrendous. They are costs to jobs, they are costs to regions and they are costs to exports. Why would you get rid of a program that saw an increase in exports and an increase in jobs? I thought the priority of this government was twofold-to correct the current account deficit and to increase job opportunities. Here you have a program that did both of those things, and they have axed it-but it is not the only area which has been axed. This is another massive betrayal of Australia's manufacturing industry. This is a government that pretends to have the interests of industry at heart but will do nothing for them. This is a government that has been condemned by those same industry groups. (Time expired)",112
271,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PAIRS,"I, like the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), am concerned about what we regard as a blatant decision by the present government to break what I thought was a fairly fundamental promise made by the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) prior to the election just on 12 months ago. I refer to the fact that, during the election campaign-and I am sure the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) was consulted; after all, he is the Prime Minister's number cruncher-the coalition matched Labor's commitment to retain the computer bounty to the end of the year 2000. I think that was a fairly important commitment. It was made in good faith, and industry took that commitment on board-as did a lot of workers and their families who depended on that commitment for the purposes of their job security and their ability in the end to look after their families. I know the Prime Minister likes to talk from time to time about the question of security-security at work, security at home, security in the community at large. But the problem is that, since the election, the Prime Minister has decided that your word is not your bond. That is what he has decided. With respect to the computer bounty and their undertaking that it shall prevail until the year 2000, your word is no longer your bond. What does the government say is the justification to achieve so-called savings? As the minister said in his second reading speech, the savings are to be achieved through the termination of the computer bounty with effect from 1 July this year. He then goes on to suggest that these bounty schemes have run their course. I suggest to the House that these bounty schemes have not run their course. I will tell you why: the level of unemployment in Australia suggests that they have not run their course. The problem for the government-and it is walking away from its responsibilities-is that not only is unemployment a major problem at the moment, but it is especially a huge problem in regional Australia and is especially a huge problem for the long-term unemployed. In that context, there is a role for government to involve itself in assisting industry; there is a role for government to involve itself in regional Australia; and there is a role for government to involve itself in trying to push and prod industry. The government needs to encourage industry to invest and to create decent job opportunities-real job opportunities-not half-baked suggestions or proposals as brought forward by the Prime Minister just on a week and a half ago with respect to the work for the dole scheme. If there are any real concerns about these issues, I refer the House to the fact that, in seasonally adjusted terms, the numbers of long-term unemployed rose from 229,500 in December to 232,700 in January. The minister wants the House to accept that the schemes have run their course. I do not accept that the schemes have run their course when you have 232,700 people in Australia who are long term unemployed. It is interesting that there are hoW 30,100 more long-term unemployed Australians than in May 1996 when the Howard government began cutting decent labour market programs, induding Skillshare, throughout the length and breadth of Australia. These schemes have not run their course. Australian industry expects support. The bounty scheme that prevailed in the computer industry encouraged industry to make investments, because a company's ability to make investments depends on a sense of stability and security. It is on that basis that companies are prepared to make mediumto long-term investment decisions. The coalition had a clear commitment prior to the federal election that the computer bounty scheme would exist through to 2000 and on the basis of that commitment they made decisions. They were prepared to put their money up-front for the purposes of investing in Australia, for the purposes 0; securing export growth and for the purposes of securing for a large number of Australian families a sense of job security. I think it is high time that the minister stood up to the Prime Minister and said in no uncertain terms, 'Where I come from in Queensland, the Liberal Party way is to honour your word. Your word is your bond. A commitment to the Australian electorate to make sure that this scheme existed through to 2000 should prevail. We should not break our word. We should ensure that industry continues to have a sense of security and on that basis they can continue to plan their investment opportunities for the future.'

Motion (by Dr Wooldridge) proposed: That the requested amendments be not made.",112
272,Mr LEE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I will try to make this as brief as possible. These are opposition amendments. Basically, these amendments simply seek to provide for automatic indexation of the income thresholds at which the private health insurance tax rebate cuts out. Reading through the Senate Hansard, there was a bit of confusion about whether our amendments were going to index the value of the tax rebate or whether they would index the income threshold at which the rebates cut out. Everyone who has studied this knows that it is about how we index the income limits. That is why the proposed index is average weekly earnings. I will not dwell average weekly earnings for the immediately preceding calendar year average weekly earnings for calendar year 1996 on that, but that is the point that these amendments go to. I have two questions, Minister, that I will go through very quickly. One was that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services and Parliamentary Secretary for the Attorney-General (Senator Ellison) in the Senate said that one of the reasons the amendments could not be accepted was that there is no provision for them in the forward estimates. I would have expected that the forward estimates are based on a certain number of people having private insurance. I thought in the past we had spoken about a figure of 35.5 per cent. Given that there are now only 33.2 per cent of people who have private health insurance, I would have thought there is a bit of fat in the forward estimates. Unless there is a sudden jump in the number of people with private health insurance on 1 July, there will be a bit of fat in those forward estimates which would allow, perhaps, the funding of this automatic indexation. If I am wrong, I am happy to tap the mat on that. Perhaps we can deal with that question first.",115
273,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.41 p.m.)My understanding is that we are dealing with the best figures we have so far, in the December quarter. We cannot really predict what will happen by the two quarters hence. There is no fat that I am aware of. I am informed that the cost over four years of doing this would be $73 million. While I can see the merit in doing it, what we have attempted to do is simply implement what we promised before the election. Honestly, if I had another $73 million, I would probably be spending it on another area of need in health. I feel we have more than acquitted our undertaking to the Australian community by implementing what we propose to do. I note in passing that similar indexation arrangements were not promised in the Labor Party's election proposal. To the best of my knowledge, there is no fat and I do not have the capacity to make that without offsetting It 1D the rest of my portfolio-$73 million over four years is a substantial amount to offset.",115
274,Mr LEE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"A brief debating point first, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the minister believes that an extra $73 million could be better spent in other areas of the portfolio rather than in providing tax breaks for private health insurance, I am wonder whether he is willing to now accept the opposition's point that perhaps the whole $1.7 billion could have been better spent in paying for extra operations in public and private hospitals or in other areas of private health care. I do not think I will persuade him on that point, but I thought he left me an opening on that. Finally, concerning the second question I spoke about before, at various times we have been trying to find out what the government's intentions are about the thresholds. I think we have been told that, if at some future time the government wanted to increase these income thresholds, it could do so by introducing legislation and amending the act. At one point I think we were told incorrectly in the Senate that this could be done by regulation, but my understanding is that it will require an amendment to the act and so we would be seeking to know from the minister whether the government is planning to change the thresholds. That is a crucial point. Are you planning to change the thresholds that apply to this Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996?",116
275,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.44 p.m.)On the debating point, without carrying it too far, the whole of the $1.7 billion is being spent to implement a core election promise, and we keep our promises. There are no plans to increase the thresholds at this stage. It does not mean we would not do it; it means that we really have, only in the most early stages, started considering the 1997-98 budget. I do not say at a future date we will not do it but, like Medicare levy thresholds under the previous government, they were not indexed but they were increased from time to time as a policy decision. We have no plans to do that at the moment. That does not mean we will not do it at some stage in the future.",116
276,Mr LEE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"The opposition will not force the House to a division on this issue. We had a division when the matter was previously considered by the House. For the record, I once again reaffirm the opposition's support for these amendments and therefore our opposition to the minister's motion that the matters be rejected.

Motion (by Dr Wooldridge) proposed: That the requested amendments be not made.",116
277,Mr LEE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"We are disappointed. We thought we might have been able to persuade the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to accept our very reasonable proposals on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 as well. Once again, this seeks to index the income limits at which the Medicare levy cuts in if people do not have private health insurance. We believe that it is only fair that this income limit be maintained in real terms. The minister might remember that, in the debate on these matters previously, I did express concern that at the next budget the government might bring in a proposal to lower the threshold, perhaps from $100,000 for a family down to $80,000 and, in the following budget, down to $60,000. That is why we are seeking to introduce this automatic indexation, so the real value is maintained in real terms. That is the debating point. I have one question on this issue. It is the same one that we put before. Given those concerns, is the government planning to change those income thresholds for the Medicare levy?",117
278,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.48 p.m.)We cannot accept these amendments. Again, the effect, as I am informed, would be a net of $35 million over the last two financial years of the four-year forward estimates. Of course there would be nothing in 1997-98 as a base year and we are not able, at short notice, to determine what it would be in I 998-99-but probably very little. I accept the shadow minister's comment that, yes, we could bring in a proposal at the next budget, but of course that would be subject to legislation. It would be something that we would have to debate in this House and in the other place and it would have to be passed by the parliament. Any concept of trying to sneak something through or have something happen without scrutiny would be impossible. Were we to do that, that would be something that the House and the Senate would have to consider and make a decision on. I would just comment that the limit here is a family income of $100,000, which is a very large family income-probably for the shadow minister as well as myself. That would apply to only about 1.5 to 2 per cent of the people I represent in the seat of Chisholm. This is something that does not affect a lot people. Any change that we were to make on this would have to be made as part of the next budget. I obviously cannot rule things in or out of the next budget, except to say that if we were to consider such a thing we would be fairly unwise to consider it before we had even passed this piece of legislation.",118
279,Mr LEE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I do not want to labour this. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) does seem to be leaving open the possibility of reducing the threshold in the next budget. I suppose any minister can say anything is possible, but I would be keen to know if the that government is planning any changes at the moment.",118
280,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.50 p.m.)Having been in government himself, I hope the shadow minister has some sympathy for me. I am afraid that it is not possible to rule things in and out sequentially of what might be in the budget, except to say that, were we to consider that, there is no way we could do it other than through legislation and through due consideration in this place.",118
281,Mr LEE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I hope I am not misunderstanding the minister, but he seems to be leaving open the clear possibility that this threshold is reduced in the budget. If that is the case, then obviously he is giving me the opportunity to make sure that the Australian people know that that is a clear possibility come the May budget. If the government has no plans to change the thresholds, then I will accept that assurance.",118
282,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.51 p.m.)This is the final attempt. I am simply doing what the previous government themselves did for 13 years and not rule budget speculation in or out. It only fuels speculation and makes it harder for me, if I do not draw the line at all suggestions, not to rule certain things in or out. I am afraid that I cannot do it. That is what the opposition, when in government, for 13 years followed themselves. I am doing nothing different.",118
283,Mr LEE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"In the Senate, Senator Ellison, the Parliamentary of Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, did actually use those words in considering a number of amendments to the opposition's amendments. Senator Neal asked whether he could guarantee that the government would not be lowering the thresholds. At 6.26 p.m - on my understanding of the debate-he said that 'the government has no plans to do that'. The Hansard continued: Senator Neal-I actually missed that response.",118
284,Senator ELLISON,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,You asked whether the government intended to reduce the threshold. I said that the government has no plans to do that. Senator Neal-Does that mean that you are prepared to give an undertaking that they will not?,119
285,Senator ELLISON,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I think I have answered the question as well as I can. So on two occasions Senator Ellison said that the government had no plans to lower the thresholds. Given that the minister has very skilfully avoided saying that in the House, I would be grateful if he would repeat the assurance that Senator Ellison gave the Senate-and if he will not, why not?",119
286,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.53 p.m.)In the spirit of the courtesy that the opposition is showing in facilitating the passage of these pieces of legislation, I am really going to make this my last contribution. I congratulate Senator Ellison on being a new parliamentary secretary, and when he has been around a little bit longer he will learn how to answer the question. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (PRIV ATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES) BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendment(1) Schedule 3, page 14 (lines 2 to 12), omit the Schedule. Motion (by Dr Wooldridge) proposed: That the amendment be disagreed to.",119
287,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Again, I will be very brief, to assist the House. This measure seeks to increase the amount of money which people will need to expend on medical products and services before they become eligible for a taxation rebate. It seeks to increase the limit from $1,000 to $1,500. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Ellison) in the other place, in respect of the $100 rebate, said, 'What you are looking at there is not a great deal of money.' For some people it is a significant sum of money. I know that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) at the table has spoken on many occasions about elderly people and their families who have to pay for incontinence products, and a family which is spending significant amounts of money on incontinence products might be the very people who are going to be hit by this change in the threshold. I once more forlornly hope that the minister might be persuaded by our attempts to get the government to reconsider its decision to raise this threshold.",119
288,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.56 p.m.)I hear the shadow minister's concern, but I make the point that this is a rebate that the opposition when in government made a good number of changes to. The threshold of $1,000 has been unchanged since 1985-86, so it has been in place for 12 years. I do not think it unreasonable, given its 12-year history of not being changed, that it now be reviewed. I make the point that this is an area of revenue forgone that is increasing very rapidly. It is doing so largely on the basis of hospital costs and not on disability aids; as far as we can tell, although there is no disaggregated data. The incentives that we are giving for private health insurance will be of very substantial benefit to just the sort of people who are using this. So I am afraid that we are not able to agree to the opposition's amendment.",119
289,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Just for the record, the opposition will not be forcing the House to a division on this matter, but we do remain opposed to what the government is attempting to do here. We will simply oppose the government's motion on the voices.",119
290,Dr NELSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) ought to also understand that most of the people who have been benefiting from this threshold level of $1,000 are in fact high income people who have been paying cash for episodes of private hospital care rather than the low income people to which he referred. It is also consistent with the rest of the package in that, effectively, it is increasing the penalties, if you like, for high income people, to get them back into private health insurance.",120
291,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I say to my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) that in his electorate that might be the case, but on the Central Coast of New South Wales a large number of people who need to use the incontinence products that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has spoken about on many occasions do benefit from this change and they will be hit by this increase in the threshold. It might be different in Bradfield, but I am sure that in Chisholm and on the Central Coast there are lots of people who unfortunately will be a bit worse off as a result of this. Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Dr Wooldridge) agreed to: That Mr Cadman and Mr MCArthur and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate.",120
292,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (7.00 p.m.)On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate, I present the reasons, which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsThe Senate has made an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 1997 which removes the provisions which increase the medical expenses rebate threshold as announced by the Government in the Budget. The House does not accept the Senate's amendment for the following reasons: the increase in the threshold is an integral part of the Government's package to boost Australia's declining levd of participation in private health insurance, a package that includes incentives for lower income earners who have private health insurance and an incentive on higher income earners to take out private health insurance; and the $1000 threshold has not been increased since it was introduced in 1985-86. Motion (by Dr Wooldridge) proposed: That the committee's reasons be adopted.",120
293,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Despite being impressed with the speed with which the committee has acted, we are not persuaded by their reasoning. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Consideration in Detail .Schedule 1, items 6 to 9-by leave-taken together. Consideration resumed.",120
294,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"This schedule relates to the machine tools and robotics bounty, which has been described by the Metal Trades Industry Association as fundamental to the whole manufacturing sector, in that it supplies enabling technologies to most other sectors and is an important source of innovation and skills. As they point out, the decision made in last year's budget to terminate the machine tools and robotics bounty will result in the cessation of an extremely successful industry program. The bounty has been instrumental in the growth of a high-technology export oriented industry. It has provided cash flow, and the MTIA say that over the past 10 years the machine tools and robotics industry has produced an export growth rate of 20 per cent per annum. The year before it generated $117 million in sales and $80 million in exports, and it paid $12 million in tax. This year, the MTIA predicts that export sales are likely to be closer to $130 million. By comparison, the cost of the bounty to the government or the taxpayer was only $2 million in 1995-96. As the MTIA points out, cessation of the bounty will see an immediate reduction in the rate of growth of exports, and they describe that outcome as perverse. And indeed it is. It is counterproductive, because you have a decision taken on the grounds that its objective was eliminating the budget deficit, but you have a reduction in the rate of growth of exports happening here and that will have precisely the opposite effect. The MTIA also point out that the burden of the cutbacks in government spending borne by the machine tools and robotics industry is disproportionate. Not only has this industry had to bear the abolition of the bounty, is what this schedule is all about, but over past six months this industry has had to the burden of cuts to research and developfrom ment programs-both the tax concession and the discretionary grants-imposition of a three per cent duty on industry inputs under the tariff concession system, substantial dismanand tling of export facilitation programs such the export market development grants scheme and abolition of the development import finance facility, the DIFF. As the MTIA up, these new arrangements mean that now Australian producers are not operating level playing field but on one that is straight toward our competitors' goals where you have machine tools coming into the country duty free while Australian producers importing components are paying a three per (Time expired) cent duty. That is an extraordinary outcome. In the face of the reversal <.>f the budget decisions to abolish the ships bounty and book bounty, termination of this bounty represents a further slap in the face. This is a matter of particular concern to me because of its importance to manufacturing industry in the Wills electorate. By way of example, as I have mentioned previously, Farley Cutting Systems is a company based in Glenroy. It commenced business back in 1983. Its mission statement is to be a leading world supplier of systems for cutting metals and similar materials. It has achieved success both domestically and in penetrating markets abroad with the sale of cutting chines into specifically targeted sectors, such as shipbuilding and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industries. At last count, it had 300 machine installations in more than 20 countries around the world, a staff of 75 people, turnover in excess of $12 million, with exports accounting for approximately 75 per cent of sales. It is actively involved in ongoing research and development activities-including activities with a range of external partners-and is implementing various manufacturing improvement programs to enhance competitiveness. That is a terrific achievement, but underpinning it all is the kind of support Farley Cutting Systems got from this bounty. In which 1995-96, they received $325,000 from the the machine tool bounty, $100,000 from export bear market development grants and $900,000 the tax concession for research and development. They have been able to claim assistance under the export market development grants from 1984 right through to 1991, they used that sort of assistance to get as into new export markets in Malaysia, China and India. What we have here is abolition of support under the export market development sum grants and abolition of the research from research and development. But the thing on a which has really knocked this company tilted around is cancellation of the bounty$300,000 straight off the bottom line. For that reason, because of the impact this provision has on Farley, I urge the House to oppose it.",120
295,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I was actually deferring to the member for Kingston the (Ms Jeanes) because I finally do see her in the chamber, other than for voting purposesMr Moore--Read the newspaper article again.",121
296,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I might just read the newspaper article again, if I have time. This is another example of the betrayal by this government of manufacturing industry. The machine tools and robotics bounty has seen huge growth in this industry sector. Since the flat mid-1980s the Australian machine tools industry has become increasingly internationally competitive. For example, in the last mathree years we have seen Australian production of bountiable machine tools increase from $95 million to $144 million, with exports more than doubling over the same period. These are not dud programs, these actually work; yet you cut them out-you cut the very base out from under them. Is it any wonder that manufacturing has declined today in the national accounts? There are a few more members of the government backbench here now-it is good to see that we are having some effect in getting them in-and if they read the national accounts figures today, the ones the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was crowing about in this chamber before, they will see that those figures show that production in manufacturing industry in the last quarter has declined by 2.6 per cent. Congratulations on overseeing the demise of the manufacturing sector in this country, Minister! Is it any wonder that the member for Kingston is forced to go into her local newspaper today and condemn the cuts that her government has introduced? She is on the record as saying that cuts to industry assistance in last year's budget have already hurt the state. I say to the member, given that she is now in the chamber-she has been embarrassed into coming into this place-'If you believe it, vote with us because we are the only people who are prepared to back these industries.' You are prepared to cut loose the automotive industry and the textiles industry. You have already done it with computers. You have done it with the book publishing industry which has seen 300 jobs go in your electorate in theMs Jeanes-It's 10k's out of my electorate.",121
297,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Oh, it's out of your electorate. So, because it isn't in your electorate, doesn't matter. You still want to get the headline, but you don't want to give any commitment to them. Ms Jeanes interjecting",122
298,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,The member for Kingston!,122
299,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"She's getting me going here, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is outrageous.",122
300,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,It is so unusual too!,122
301,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"But I do say that, if the member is criticising in the press her own government for the cuts to industry programs, she should at least then come into the House and do something about reversing them. What you have to understand is that, because of the successful campaign that Labor has run, we have reversed decisions on the books and we have done it also in relation to the ships. What we are saying is that, if you have reversed decisions in relation to two of the bounties, why not in the other two, particularly given you made election commitments to honour them? The simple fact is that this is an industry that is providing vital input and state-of-theart technology to the shipbuilding industry, to the automotive industry and to the textile industry. This is the equipment that laser cuts-a state-of-the-art world leading technology developed in Australia. Why? Because we supported R&D when we were in government. Because we recognised that, if we are going to help them export their product, they have to be assisted in overcoming the barriers to entry that exist with their trading partners, we were prepared to put a package in place to support these industries. The record speaks for itself. We have doubled exports. What we have is a real commitment to jobs and balance of payments correction. I say to the members on the backbench oppositeMr Hardgrave-Down, down, down!",122
302,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"It is not down, it is up. These are increases in exports. Why don't you go and visit some of these factories? Mr Deputy Speaker, these people who interject in this House know nothing about this industry. None of them would have been there. Go and it ask these industries where they were before this bounty came in and where they have come to; and where they will be as a result of your scrapping of this bounty. The simple reality is that this is an industry where we can carve out a niche market opportunity. It is an industry vital to the shipbuilding industry, the textile industry and the automotive industry. All of those industries are being hit directly. This industry is being hit directly as well, but indirectly it will collapse in on itself. (Time expired)",122
303,Mr ADAMS,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"The amendments deal with a matter which is very important to the robotic and machine tooling industries in Australia which needed a bounty to give them the opportunity to grow and get into the world market so they could compete against those in other countries who were also getting advantage and opportunity from their own governments. We have allowed our companies, by using these bounties, to achieve that goal. We have allowed them to grow and to get access into the world markets. This was a deliberate policy of the previous Labor government. This new government has come in and has cut the bounty without really thinking about or working through what sort of impact it would have. The government did not know what impact it would have. It was trying to reach that bottom line on its budget. In doing that, it has slashed away at everything. The consequences of its slashing away at everything have been the cuts in these bounties from shipbuilding to the bookbinding industry to the robotic and machine tools industry. That comes back and reflects directly onto jobs in Australia. In many respects it reflects onto regional Australia and regional jobs which are going. It is a great disappointment that the government has not even given consideration to accepting some of these amendments from our side. The government needs to become a little bit mature in the way it deals with industry policy and to take up something I believe it should take up. It has played around the edges of the shipbuilding industry bounty. It really did not do anything to try to get over its electoral problems as a result of the bad press, so it came up with a changed mechanism which really did nothing for the industry. It has gone down the same track in the bookbinding industry with the bookbinding bounty. So it has not achieved anything. It will not look at the amendments, which I believe are reasonable. It is just doing away with jobs in our country, not encouraging our industry in any way and therefore it shows itself up as the bad government that it is and it shows itself to have bad policy direction relation to industry policy. Industry policy reflects straight back to the job situation and jobs policy reflects straight back to family policy. I do not think that this government has even thought about that. It has not thought through how one thing links to another in the overall workings of the economy. This government has failed in its industry policy and, in relation to these cuts in the bounties, it has been bad for regional Australia and for working people in Australia. I will be supporting the amendment as put.",123
304,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the honourable member for Scullin, I know that he needs no reminder that this motion is dealing with items 6 to 9 and that therefore his remarks should be limited and restricted to the subject of the question.",123
305,Mr JENKINS,BOUNTY LEGISLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I will try to ensure that I am speaking about items 6 to 9, which hopefully are about the machine tools and robots industry-because that is what we should be speaking about at this stage. Throughout this debate what the opposition has been seeking from the minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), is some clear direction about where he sees industry policy going, under the government. There can be no clearer example than this decision with respect to the bounty on machine tools and robots where, by the actions of this bill and these clauses, the bounty will be ceasing 10 months earlier. It ceases on the night of the budget but was supposed to run through to 30 June 1997. Indeed, when the Industry Commission last looked at this industry it recommended that the scheme cease when it was due to end on 30 June 1977. This is something that the industry had been able to factor in. But just for the sake of the fiscal consolidation that the government has claimed was required we see that this bounty has been terminated. This is a very successful industry, and I wish to mention one particular company in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Mentioned in debate earlier, it is Farley Cutting Systems in the suburb of Glenroy, which was in in the electorate of Scullin when I was first elected to this place but was later redistributed out. When I had some contact and dealings with this company in the late 1980s, it had commenced only four or five years earlier. It is a truly Australian success story. clere is a business that literally somebody's garage. Slowly but surely, the company has been able to build its business up to where it is successfully selling its cutting machines not only to the European market but the Asian market. It has not only relied upon its expertise in putting in place the electronic controllers that control its cutters but also it has been able to be innovative in the way that it exported its product. One of the things it realised was that if it designed its cutting tools in a certain way they would fit into containers that could be airfreighted and that because of its relationship to Tullamarine airport this was an efficient way of sending its goods through to the European market. It was a company that early on saw that it had a great advantage if it had its own sale representatives in the markets. Indeed, in evidence before the Senate committee, Mr Farley, the principal of the company, talked about how it had been able to increase its business in Singapore. Four years ago it had sold something like $400,000 worth of the stuff-that is the way he talks about it. But now after placing somebody in Singapore that amount had increased to $3 million worth of orders. Simply put, what this industry needs is the confidence that it has the support of the government. Today, a media release from the MTIA has the headline 'Machine Tools and Robots Industry Receives Unfair Treatment'. They believe that they have been singled out, because along with the computer industry they have suffered the full effect of the announcement on budget night. This press release goes on to indicate that the bounty plus other forms of government assistance should be taken into account in the way in which this industry is able to operate in the international market. I quote from the press release: The new arrangements under the TCSthat is, tariff concession systemmean that now Australian producers are not operating in a level playing field but one that is tilted straight toward our competitors' goals. Imports of machine tools are coming into the country duty free while Australian producers importing components started in are paying a 3 per cent duty. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has to address these problems, because they jeopardise Australian jobs by sending those jobs offshore. On behalf of the people who work for companies like Farley, I ask the minister at this consideration in detail stage of this bill to rise to his feet and tell Australian industry how he is going to give them protection, cooperation and assistance to ensure that they can embark upon their successful export schemes and import replacement that they have been able to achieve under the forms of assistance that have been available to them in the past. (Time expired) Mr CREAN CHotham) (7.22 p.m.)-On this machine tools and robots bounty issue, I am very pleased that the members for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) have referred to the examples of companies within their electorates that have been very successful as a result of being able to operate within the certain environment that Labor had created with the R&D expenditures and with the machine tools bounty. I, too, have a company in my electorate, Laser Lab. I have visited companies not only in my electorate but also in other electorates. I would suggest that, if the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) thinks this has been a backward going industry, he should go and visit these companies to see what they do. At times I cannot believe the ignorance which people on the other side of this parliament display. They claim to be the party of business, but they have no idea at all of how these programs that have supported industry have created jobs and exports. The fact of the matter is that we have seen huge growth in manufactured exports over the last decade. There was the report the other day that indicated that manufacturing was now 31 per cent of our export income. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures says that there is a possibility of manufacturing exports being the single biggest component-in other words, more than 50 per cent-by the year 2010 if we have an industry strategy. That is the same group that says your government has deserted them, the same group that says that there is no vision for industry and the same group that has condemned the $3.9 billion in cuts in the last budget that has seen manufacturing industries slump in this country. If there is any doubt about the slump, have a look at today's national accounts figures. They show what the impact of the $3.9 billion cut has been. Manufacturing output in the December quarter-one quarter alone-fell by a massive 2.6 per cent. Today the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was trying to claim credit for growth of three per cent over a year and 0.5 per cent in a quarter, but he is presiding over an economy that has seen manufacturing output slump by 2.6 per cent. Can't you see the danger signals? The member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) sees the danger signals. She is prepared to go out publicly in the newspaper in Adelaide and condemn the government for its cuts to industry-to say that these cuts have really hurt South Australia. They have not only hurt South Australia; they have hurt the nation. If she really believes that they have hurt them, why doesn't she put some pressure on her government to reverse these decisions? Why doesn't she get to the minister at the table, Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore)? He has been got to by the book publishing industry and the ship industry because he has had those industries reverse themselves. It is the computers, machine tools and robotics industries that still require significant assistance. He will not give it to them. He goes to the election saying that they are entitled to it, but he will not give it to them. The other thing that is most disturbing, I must say, about the machine tools and robots bounty is that the Industry Commission, in its draft report on machine tools and robotics, recently recommended that the bounty be retained. What we have is a government that commissions a report and ignores it. I just hope that they show the same approach in ignoring what they have recommended for cars and what we know they will recommend for the TCF industry. This is a government that is not prepared to take account of the realities, is not prepared to reward success, is not prepared to encourage the growth of our manufacturing sector, is not prepared to get behind regional development and is not prepared to support programs that get jobs-jobs for Australiansand correct the balance of payments. The key measure in all of this is export growth and jobs growth. The two most important criteria that you set your standards by--correction of the current account and employment growth-and you wipe a program that achieves it. Do you understand the stupidity of that program? What I am saying to the backbench of this party is: get real in understanding the impact. Get into the ear of the minister, because he will not support the role the Treasurer-(Time expired)",123
306,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to stand this evening with the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). I think she was right, as reported in the Adelaide Advertiser today, when she said, very clearly, that the coalition was badly advised. I agree that she needs to stand up and be counted. She got the headline in Adelaide today. The question is whether she will get the headline in Adelaide tomorrow for voting the with the opposition-for voting with respect to concern about jobs and the need for certainty in industry. I take note of the fact that the member for Kingston is concerned. She has questioned the quality of the Howard government's economic advice and attacked economic rationalism as a cancer on the nation. That reminds me of the type of speech that the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) would make. He is also concerned, as is the member for Kingston, with the lack of decent economic advice that has been given to the Howard government. The member for Kingston went on to say that she urged the government to be more critical of the advice it received in preparing its second budget. She understands the damage that the decisions of the current government has imposed on Australian industry. She understands that decisions such as the decision to bring forward the date on which the robot bounty will cease to operate is wrong. The Howard government is going the wrong way if it is concerned about the needs of industry and about a degree of security and certainty required in industry on the basis of which investment decisions should be made. Even the Industry Commission itself recommended retaining the bounty until its legislated expiry date of 30 June 1997. We are proposing an amendment to ensure that we give the Industry Commission's recommendation an opportunity of being put in place. I suggest to the House that bounties established under the Labor government were aimed at encouraging investment in industry, aimed at encouraging investment in local manufacturing and aimed at trying to facilitate job growth and exports. More importantly, they have achieved their desired results. That is why, because of those ill-informed decisions of the last budget, the member for Kingston is correctly reported in the Adelaide Advertiser today as being concerned about the wrong economic direction that the Howard government is taking and about the impost of economic rationalism. It is a cancer on the nation, it is a cancer on the government, and it is time that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) stood up, stood beside people such as the member for Scullin and the member for Kingston and forced this government to review its decision. I believe, as do many in the House this evening, that this is not about savings; this about investment in Australia's future. The bounties have continued to deliver with respect to the future of Australia. We should leave them in place to ensure that companies which made investment decisions on the basis of this legislative framework are able to retain the full benefits that they were promised before the last election. Consideration interrupted. NA",125
307,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question. That the House do now adjourn. Legal Aid",126
308,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (7.30 p.m.)I rise tonight to raise the issue of legal aid cuts. I spoke at a rally in Marrickville against these cuts some two weeks ago that was attended by many members of the community and by the Marrickville Legal Centre. Today, most importantly, I lodged a petition with 6,817 signatures to be presented to this House, calling on the government to restore funding. Today there were demonstrations right around this nation. Approximately 2,000 people gathered in Queens Square in Sydney to express their anger and there were similar gatherings in every capital city in this country. This is not an issue that is going to go away. The slashing of the legal aid budget has significant ramifications for our system of law and the opportunity of every citizen to be equal before the law in this country. Speakers at the rallies today included Patrick Fair, the President of the Law Society of New South Wales, David Bennett, the President of the New South Wales Bar Association, Nora Maguire, President of the Combined Pensioners Association, Harry Herbert of the Uniting Church, Angela Chan from the Ethnic Communities Council, Maurie 0' Sullivan, the President of the PSA, and Meredith Burgmann from the New South Wales parliament. I think the diverse backgrounds of these speakers shows the depth of the opposition to these cuts. These cuts represent an attack on the right is to fair trial and due process. The capacity of individuals to launch an action against others is also threatened. The cuts to legal aid in New South Wales of over $lO million represent a significant proportion out of the $33 million to be cut nationally because legal aid is not in the form of a tied Commonwealth grant. This is a cynical attempt by the Commonwealth to rewrite over two decades of legal funding policy. We are now being accustomed to this sort of revisionism, and it is traditionally disadvantaged groups that will suffer most, as they always do, when cutbacks occur in the public sector. Legal aid staff and community legal centre staff are already overworked and have been for as long as I can remember. I am not a lawyer, but I do know that our legal system is far from classless already. When you cut legal aid, you put at risk the rights of all people who rely on those services-the elderly, children, women, the disabled, indigenous people. The Howard government talk about battlers, but do they really know what it is like to not have the money or access to the expertise that could either help them defend a trumped up charge or prosecute an unscrupulous company? The fact is that they do not. Without adequate legal aid funding, the rights of people to defend or prosecute a criminal or civil matter will not only be jeopardised but, in many cases, eliminated. As a case in point, the victory by retirement home tenants last year in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against massive increases in their weekly rental licence fees may not have even got to court, let alone resulted in an overturning of that unscrupulous action. On a more basic level, what about the rights of women who seek community legal centre advice about an abusive spouse or partner? Cut out those community legal centres and you cut out this vital lifeline for victims of abuse. As recently as two weeks ago, we saw the New South Wales state government having to step in and fund a criminal retrial following a hung jury. These are expensive trials and the state government simply cannot step in wherever there is a funding shortfall. The other side of the coin is that we may be jeopardising the physical safety of the community by not being able to fund these retrials. Already we have seen a number of cutslegal aid in victim compensation matters and legal aid for committals, and caps have been placed on the funding of criminal and family law matters. So you either do not get help or you get help until the money runs out. That is no way to run a legal system in this country in 1997. This is a measure which is essentially about taking away the legal rights of ordinary citizens, and I say to those opposite, particularly those from non-urban areas, that this will have a devastating impact on regional areas in Australia. Approximately 110,000 advices of representation in New South Wales are the outside of Sydney. The sort of person in these regional areas who normally seeks representation, who goes through this system, quite often is a woman with children. These cuts are unconscionable and should be opposed. (Time expired) Member for Hotham Automotive Industry",126
309,Ms JEANES,ADJOURNMENT,"It seems that my comments in the House on Monday got the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) more than just a little bit excited earlier today. I would have to say it got me a little bit excited when I heard that he had accused me of talking up my view on the future of the automotive industry at home in Adelaide but not here in Canberra. It also got me a little bit excited when I heard that he wanted me to defend the workers at Griffin Press when he was grizzling in this House about the book bounty. I am always happy to defend workers, but Griffin Press is at least 10 kilometres out of my electorate, so the member for Hotham offers the House just another example of his ignorance on South Australian matters. I would like to expand upon the views that I expressed in this House and that were later reported in the Advertiser after I spoke here on Monday, the very place where he apparently accuses me of not standing up for the industry. The doctrine of economic rationalism commenced its pervasion of the Canberra bureaucracy under the previous Labor government, a government of which the member for Hotham was a minister for some six years, I understand. The member for Hotham entered this parliament in 1990. A year later, Michael Pussey warned that economic rationalists had 'invaded' the bureaucracy by exposing the extent of the spread of their doctrine through Canberra in his book entitled Economic Rationalism in Canberra. I would like to say just a few words about the economic performance of the previous Labor government, particularly in relation to the automotive industry. The current debate, as everyone knows, has centred on the issue of tariff reduction. The Labor Party in government reduced tariffs in the car industry from 57.5 per cent in 1984 and committed it to a target of zero per cent in 201 O-and they called the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) 'Captain Zero'. Now they have suddenly become the saviours of the automotive industry by proposing a slow down in the rate of reduction by announcing that they have adopted Ian Webber's position. Thank you very much, but we on this side of the House do not need their help. We will support the industry as we believe fit, by working with the industry. I would like to offer you a bit of advice, seeing that you have adopted Mr Webber's position as your policy. I suggest that you approach Mr Webber and offer him the job as your industry spokesperson. He might give us real opposition on this matter backed up by real arguments, not opportunistically adopted ones. The member for Hotham was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in a government that spent billions of taxpayers' dollars on labour market programs that did not create the jobs to put the people they were training into. They spent $800 million on some programs that had a success rates costing up to an astonishing $140,000 per job obtained. The programs were so expensive that the Labor government had to flog off their crown jewels, like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, in order to pay for them when they should have been retiring their debt in order to reduce the strain on interest rates which was one of the many factors that they let kill off the small businesses that could not afford to employ the people they were churning through the member for Hotham's training programs. What the member for Hotham and perhaps another member or two on the other side do not like very much is the fact that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member for  (Mr MCArthur) and many other members on this side of the House, including myself, are sticking up for our constituents who work in the automotive industry. We are expressing views in support of our car industries, and those opposite do not like it. We are actively participating in the debate to do our best to ensure that the automotive industry in this country not only remains viable but continues to grow through its increasing export activity on the international markets. You would have to be blind not to notice that there are a range of views expressed on this side of the House. Naturally, I believe that my view is the correct one and the one that will ensure the future growth of the industry. Any member who has anything to do with the automotive industry in their electorate who did not get up in this place and outside to promote their vision for the future of the industry would be derelict in their duty if they sat quietly and let the debate go by. I therefore welcome and enjoy the views expressed by the member for Corangamite. Those on the other side of the House can continue with their attempts to seek political mileage out of the range of views that government members legitimately hold, but your attempts at opportunism will fail because we can see through your thinly veiled efforts. The member for Hotham' s attempts to pick up on our language, to get members like myself to support his amendments when his government had 13 years to address the problems that we are now having to fix, are just a little bit too transparent. You are going to have to do a lot better. I stand by my comments that the doctrine of economic rationalism has too much influence throughout the bureaucracy, and those opposite let it happen. What the people on the other side really do not like is the fact, as I pointed out to the House on Monday, that the one thing that the Industry Commission's draft report has achieved is the pulling together of a very diverse group of peoplepeople like a number of my South Australian colleagues and myself; the South Australian and Victorian Premiers; your traditional supporters, who see that we are genuine in our efforts to save their jobs; the car industry workers and their union representatives; the car companies and component companies. That leaves no place for those opposite, and they do not like it. So stop playing around with the jobs of my automotive industry workers. They will not thank you when your opportunism explodes in their faces. (Time expired) Philippines",127
310,Mr SERCOMBE,ADJOURNMENT,"The 12th of June is the National Independence Day for the Republic of the Philippines and 12 June 1998 will mark the centenary of national independence for the Philippines. The circumstances surrounding that declaration of independence were that for a number of years the Filipinos rebelled against Spanish colonial rule and on 12 June 1898 they declared national independence. They did this at the time of a war that was being fought between Spain, the colonial country, and the United States. In July 1898, after Filipino independence had been declared, United States forces arrived in the Philippines and Spanish forces surrendered to American forces. There was considerable Filipino resistance to that situation. Nonetheless, the Philippines was ruled until 1946, with a period of Japanese occupation, by the United States. Nonetheless, Filipinos regard 12 June as their National Independence Day. Australia has a strong bilateral relationship with the Philippines. If one looks at some of the indicators, one can see that in 1995-96 merchandise exports from Australia to the Philippines were worth $1.1 billion, which represented a growth of nearly 30 per cent on the previous year. That compares to merchandise imports from the Philippines of only $0.3 billion. Australia has an overwhelming trade advantage. The Philippines is the fourth highest country, coming after PNG, China and Indonesia, in terms of development assistance. There are a range of security arrangements associated with our relationship. There are also in excess of 120,000 people in the Filipino community in Australia. Very notably, they assume Australian citizenship at a very high rate. Next year provides a very real opportunity for Australia to take forward its bilateral relationship with the Philippines in meaningful ways. The Philippines government has established the National Centennial Commission, which is planning a great year to showcase Philippine'S culture, society, technology and economic development. The event will be attended by participants from around the world. One of the key features of the event will be a centennial exhibition which will run from December 1997 to August 1998 at the Clark special economic zone, which is a 60-hectare site. This presents an ideal opportunity, in my view, for the Australian government to significantly take forward Australia's bilateral relationship with Philippines. The Philippine authorities are extending invitations to countries around the world. One of the features at the exhibition is described in their document as follows: Global Island ... Philippines and the World: 1898 and Beyond ... participants will address the past, present and future relations of the Philippines with other countries. A thematic approach shall be adopted for this island where friends of the Philippines with close historical and special ties with the country, which have been invited to cooperate to honour the centennial in concrete ways ... There are obviously a range of demands on Australian foreign policy in promoting bilateral relationships, but the Philippines, as I have indicated, is a very significant trading partner. Large numbers of former Filipinos make their homes in Australia. They have very real and strong connections with Australia. There are opportunities for considerably taking forward our two-way economic relations. In that respect, it is a bit disappointing that the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), in his recent report on trade outlook to this parliament, did not significantly address opportunities and issues with respect to the Philippines. I simply put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade the outstanding opportunity that the centennial year, 1998, presents and suggest that they instruct their officials as a matter of urgency to ensure that Australia is very much present at that event and very much takes the opportunity of contributing to a closer bilateral relationship. Watson, Private Jacinta",129
311,Mr HARDGRAVE,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I would like to raise a serious matter and, as a consequence of this speech, praise not condemn, enhance not detract, the reputation of members of the Australian Defence Force. I would like to address the matter of the death in September 1994 of Private Jacinta Watson at the Greenbank Rifle Range just outside my electorate. Jacinta was a proud member of the ADF reserve and was in her early 20s at the time of her death. She was robbed of her true potential contribution to our country by the accidental discharge of a weapon at Greenbank. Since then, her parents have wanted justice and answers. I want to refer especially to a letter dated 10 June 1996 which was sent by Jacinta's mother, Mrs Genia Otuszewski, to the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General John Sanderson. It took General Sanderson four months to reply to the letter from my constituent, Mrs Otuszewski. The reply came on 8 October 1996. I contend that this is a very poor and insensitive treatment of a family-to think that it took four months for the Chief the General Staff to respond to some legitimate concerns expressed by the family in that letter. Many people have suggested to me that the Department of Defence often employs a standard operating procedure in matters involving the death of personnel-to essentially string out the paperwork until the established three-year statutory limit has expired. This claim was certainly evidenced by the Senate committee in their inquiry into the Nomad tragedy. They recommended a five-year statutory period in their findings. General Sanderson outlined in his letter of 8 October a number of reasons for not disciplining the particular army personnel involved, Sergeant R.C. Thorpe. Quite frankly, so many of the reasons seem inadequate to me. A board of inquiry was originally convened following the death of Jacinta Watson. It recommended disciplinary action against Sergeant Thorpe at the time, but .that particuards lar recommendation was suspended because charges of a similar nature were laid by the Queensland police against Sergeant Thorpe. He was charged with unlawful killing and the unlawful wounding of another soldier, Corporal Michael James Gardiner. Defence, according to General Sanderson, were going to charge Thorpe in two possible ways-under section 36(2) of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, which is 'dangerous behaviour causing death by recklessly handling a weapon'; or under section 36(3), which is 'dangerous behaviour, causing death by negligently handling a weapon'. But those charges were never laid. On 4 June 1996, the Queensland Supreme Court found Sergeant Thorpe not guilty of the civil charges. General Sanderson claims section 144 of the Defence Force Discipline Act precludes: . . . trying a member with an offence which is substantially the same as a civil offence of which a person has been acquitted in a civil court. General Sanderson claims his judgment is that certainly would have been the case in the matter involving Jacinta Watson's death so he decided against pursuing any action against of Sergeant Thorpe. General Sanderson's letter said: My decision aside, I am also aware that Sgt Thorpe is carrying a huge burden which he must live with for the rest of his life. That is certainly true, but I do not think anybody in this place would deny that the family of Jacinta Watson-and, for that matter, all members of the ADF-will carry a tremendous burden out of this unfortunate accident which resulted in her death. Mr Speaker, I am well aware of your distinguished career within the Defence Force, but my contention is this: the reputation of the entire Australian defence forces can suffer from this sort of decision. It seems to me that the person who was in charge when someone was killed and another was hurt should be disciplined in some way-perhaps as a token gesture, but there should be some discipline. Disciplinary action would demonstrate to all service personnel and to the Australian community that the ADF enforces the high standexpected of it. Rank carries responsibility, and even ordinary members of the ADF often carry far greater responsibilities than the general Australian community. Accordingly, such responsibilities justify the exacting of strong and certain penalties if standards are not met. The parents of people who have been killed in the too many accidents involving ADF personnel in recent years are well motivated in their pursuit of answers to their questions. They are understandably proud of their children's involvement in the ADF and they bear no grudge against the Commonwealth; rather, they just want their fears put to rest. time. General Sanderson's slow response to Jacinta Watson's mother certainly did not help the cause. I submit that it is certainly time for the army in particular to take greater care and to move to analyse the common causes in these various incidents-for example, the training and the attitude of personnel involved-to apply these findings to prevent further incidents, as well as define and impose appropriate penalties. If the Defence Force Discipline Act is inadequate, let us amend it. (Time expired) Car Tariffs",129
312,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this adjournment debate to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, on his statement last week that the coalition government should introduce a freeze on automotive tariffs at 15 per cent until the year 2005 with a further review in 2003. Mr Beazley urged the government to take a bipartisan approach so that car makers faced more certainty in their long-term investposition ment decisions. I believe a tariff freeze clearly has widespread support from some coalition backbenchers-and I certainly think the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) would be included in that-and from the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen. Mr Olsen is quoted as saying that the Australian industry was hamstrung by the lack of economies of scale at home and the fact that the international trade playing field was not level. I refer to the car manufacturers themselves. Toyota Australia told the Productivity Commission: None of the four local car makers would survive if the Industry Commission's major recommendations were implemented. Our own Australian icon, Holden, told the Industry Commission in Adelaide: . . . its international parent would not have approved the project to build the Vectra mid-sized car alongside the Holden Commodore for 1998 if the Commission's interim recommendation to cut tariffs on imports to 5% by 2004 had been known at the Mr Thomas of Holden said: ... the move to cut tariffs to 5% could lift to 23,000 the number of jobs lost in the car industry over the period from 1992 to 2004, equal to about 50 per cent of the 46,000 people directly employed by the sector earlier this decade. The car and automotive component sector is vital to the Australian economy and no doubt tariff cuts would threaten fresh investment and jeopardise thousands of jobs throughout Australia. In New South Wales, where I know manufacturing industry is struggling, the car component industry employs thousands of workers. The helpful proposals by Kim Beazley need to be repeated over and over again, and I will do that with pleasure this evening: first, a freeze on tariffs on motor vehicles, original equipment and replacement components at 15 per cent to at least 2005-while maintaining our commitments under APEC; second, the establishment of transparent measures by which the progress of our trading partners in reducing their tariff and non-tariff barriers can be judged; third, a review of the industry's in 2003 to determine the assistance needed beyond 2005; fourth, continuing the export facilitation scheme, modified as necessary to be consistent with our World Trade Organisation obligations; fifth, continuation of the duty-free allowance to support domestic market value-added products; and, sixth, provision of measures which ensure a more supportive industrial research and development environment. In close proximity to my electorate, a number of car component plants-such as BTR, TRW and Astra-currently provide hundreds of blue-collar jobs. As a former trade union official, I serviced manufacturing industry and the car component industry over a long period of time. I have been shocked to see the number of jobs lost in these industries due to economic rationalist policies. I might say that many of these policies were vigorously opposed by the trade union movement. But it is not only people from my side of politics who are alarmed by the Productivity Commission's draft report recommending that tariffs be lowered. Mr Allan Handberg, the national Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, was quoted in the Financial Review as saying: The draft report offered no positive encouragement for global manufacturers to maintain their investment in Australia. He went on further to say: A withdrawal of capital by car makers would send a negative message that would have disastrous implications for all foreign investment in Australia. Mr Handberg also slated the report for its lack of plans for industry, saying that it did not indicate what shape it would be in after the recommendations took effect. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that the idea that Australia would lose a car manufacturing industry is quite unthinkable; yet if he does not support the approach taken by Kim Beazley, that is exactly what could happen. (Time expired) Private Health Insurance",131
313,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In little over a week, the Federal Council of the Australian Medical Association will meet to consider a recommendation from one of its key committees that, if adopted, could ultimately destroy the egalitarian principles upon which private health insurance has been built. After almost a century of tireless support for health insurance, the AMA's Health Economics Committee is recommending to its governing body that Australians be advised against maintaining it. Not known for making irrational or ill-considered policies, the AMA would be well advised to well and truly think this one through. Higher income Australians probably could afford to go without private health insurance and simply pay cash at the hospital door. Paul Keating and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) are two notable examples who admit to such practices. However, what about those 850,000 contributors over the age of 65, the half a million people earning less than $20,000 a year or the one miIIion families surviving on annual incomes below $40,000? I do not know how long they would survive without access to some kind of insurance pool. Whilst it is easy to suggest that, as 40 per cent of private hospital episodes are now day procedures which cost approximately $2,000 to $2,500 each, who could responsibly suggest a battler go without effective cover for several years whilst they save the money? If the financially fit drop their health cover, they abandon those with mental illness, with intractable disease or with meagre resources to the collapse of a system that provides their only hope of affordable and timely access to quality care. I think people should be under no misapprehension that, if private health insurance collapses or if low income people cannot afford to buy it, private hospitals in the private hospital sector would continue to flourish-with the exception of those in regional and certain rural areas-but the market to which they will be appealing will be those who are of higher incomes and who can afford to pay cash. At the moment there is also a very untapped but lucrative market in South-East Asia for people who would be prepared to come here-and in fact are in increasing numbers-and pay cash for hospital care. The AMA's seemingly radical considerations reflect its opposition to proposals by the health insurers that have been put to the Productivity Commission for the establishment of what is described as US-style managed care programs. These programs have been described by Hillary Clinton as 'an assault on the doctor-patient relationship'. Insurers would control both the quantity and quality of care delivered through the ownership of hospitals and the contracting of doctors. I would advise the AMA Federal Council, when it considers this matter in just over a week, to wait for the Productivity Commission's report on changes to the regulatory environment in which health insurance operates and the government's response to it before abandoning its social obligations to the poor and the weak. Important as the government's private health insurance rebates may be, of more significance are the regulations that currently shackle the private health insurance industry. If the AMA adopts a position of advising people to drop their private health insurance and subsequent regulatory amendments are adopted by the government, do they then turn 180 degrees? Do we find that some of the most vulnerable people in this countryfrequently elderly people, quite a number of whom have been ringing my electorate office recently about this issue-are then told by the AMA in a few months time: 'We retract our earlier advice and now suggest that you take up private health insurance?' What of the confusion amongst those with chronic illness? Would a person quit their private health insurance on the advice of the AMA-whose advice frequently is taken by the community-and then subsequently sought to take it up again, and if they then suffered a serious illness and found that they suffered misadventure on a public hospital waiting list, would the AMA and its officers be held liable for the sort of advice which they had given? Whilst I understand the basis of the recommendations that are coming from the AMA's Health Economics Committee and the frustration that underlines it, I think the Federal Council of the AMA as a group would be well advised to wait for the government's response to the Productivity Commission report-the regulatory environment is very much in need of reform-and consider the social obligations that it has to the vulnerable people in Australia. House adjourned at 8 p.m. NA The following notices were given:  That this House: (1) applauds the efforts of those Australian Defence Force Personnel who served in Australia's peacekeeping operations; (2) congratulates Major Carol Vaughan-Evans, Lieutenant Thomas Tilbrook, Warrant Officer Rodrick Scott and Corporal Andrew Miller on their receipt of the first gallantry medals since the Vietnam War for their distinguished service in Rwanda, particularly during the massacre of civilian refugees at Kibeho in April 1995; (3) expresses the thanks and pride of all Australians for their efforts; and (4) regrets that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel felt it was too costly and impractical to receive in person the Parliament's congratulations, gratitude and recognition of their distinguished service and apologise for the Minister's slight of these gallant soldiers.

It is interesting that we again revisit capital time and, going back in history, when we were campaigned with a simple slogan-that, as sure were to re-elect a Labor government As a consequence that was denied vociferously history records we got a capital gains tax. effect that it would have on, particularly, small that capital gains should be as taxable as any you like, to a wealth tax which says that people wealth assessed on an annual basis All of it is very negative to the accumulation Australian society. One is that everybody should are wealthy they assist the poor.

Any suggestion that purchaser is silly. If someone can afford a concerned. I am not at all concerned with the that level of income and they can afford to pay In fact, I hold the view, personally, which such household expenditure can be tax deductible. with two members, husband and wife, with growing our economy, they have then got to duties while someone else remains unemployed household duties and sharing in the income The incentive to do that would arise from saying going out each day to earn a living and contribute someone in your household.

But I will not continue on that away from this legislation. The reality of capital gains tax as I saw and expends say $50,000 to buy a small business. and extremely long hours and they build it up is not going to grow any more. They have ambition they offer it for sale for $100,000 with the and starting the cycle all over again. That it is government's responsibility to encourage and past capital gains tax regime? They have to sell a business for $100,000. They have probably have to pay commission on the sale. Then, for $150,000, the state authorities put out their we add a capital gains tax. In simple arithmetic those three costs consume built into the enterprise by hard work. It is silly to sell the first business because in fact happening and the losers have been the real and all sorts of other people and, of course, stamp duties which have got to the point of a capital gains tax. I would like Suddenly we find that the idea that you are capital gain has been very negative to the revenue. it has discouraged people from going on and expand their business activities and have this addresses that problem. It could not be more situation and you wish to reinvest in another paying capital gains tax. You are given two years generous. To the great credit of the government, election, they have wiped out the like-business component. I campaigned very strongly against that committee that was looking at it. There are shift from, say, a news agency to another business. farmers wishing to move out of the farming their back has given out or things of that business, say, a newsagency or a caravan reality is that they might have inherited the suited to the farming business for whatever another. They should be able to move into different $5 million turnover limit that is applicable. I congratulate the government on taking this process but I think, in the end, that may not turnover in businesses resulting from this arrangement in for a bit of a bonanza. There are a lot participate in this new arrangement and change MAIN COMMITTEE 2085 particular subject. It has strayed a little bit it in business was as follows: somebody goes out It is run down and they work extremely hard to a point where it has reached its capacity. It to go on to bigger and better things and intention of buying another business for $150,000 is good for the economy. It is good for them and them. But what is the outcome under the present made a $50,000 capital gain. They are going sold it through a real estate agent so they of course, when they go to buy the new business hand for stamp duty. To add to their concerns the whole $50,000 of profit that they have and of course there is an absolute disincentive you are back to square one. That is what has been estate agents who could not turn businesses over the state authorities with their rather iniquitous the ridiculous. They, again, are very much like to address that issue in a moment. taxing people on this sort of hidden profit of People have not been using it. Furthermore, doing what is best for society. That is trying to incentive to grow. This legislation specifically simple. It simply says that if you are in that business, then you have the right to do so without to make that decision, which I think is very notwithstanding their policy position pre the by correspondence with our Treasurer and the thousands of reasons that people would want to More particularly, in my electorate, we find industry sometimes because of physical injurynature-and they are seeking to invest in another park or something like that. And why' not? The family farm and found that they were not even reason and that they would be more skilled in types of business within, of course, the step. They could stand to lose revenue in the be the case. I think there will be additional and I think the real estate industry is of people just waiting for 1 July to be able to from one business to another. We will see NA 2086 some quite significant activity which will benefit in their stamp duties. Taxes will be earned who will be the beneficiaries of this arrangement. Nevertheless, it is also worth addressing at to business. I have been in business for all I was still at school. I went out painting actually used to employ my school mates associated. I could give them as much in a a week, over the Christmas period. But the reality is that a business, strangely intents and purposes, is a piece of paper that profits of a business are either the partners work out why we therefore tax business. We constantly that nasty old BHP-that employs we should be cutting them down to size. In so they can invest and create more jobs and 800,000 or 900,000 unemployed we have in this country. Of course we should tax them the minute transfer it to another entity or want to transfer of course, that is the great opportunity imputation. There is some reference to imputation Keating had the choice with imputation. He passed the franking credits on to the shareholder he could have taxed the dividends. And, of by way of withholding tax. The difference would have been that anybody would not have paid tax on that investment to do just that. It could have international judgments that they had this opportunity to operate their investments here, be it in petrochemical facilities, in particular, that Australia is wide I welcome reading in today's paper how properly, are going to bring our solar salt by way of a petrochemical plant. We export job and that sounds silly to me. But, again, any you do not pay tax' seems to me to have a government revenues would lose eventually earnings, a reduction in dole payments and the from economic development. It is an issue As you would be aware, I have advocated for of Australia-people from its own ranks-for committee and studied our national tax system, government but as a parliament.

We read in the papers millions of Australians-made a big profit and fact, we should be leaving them with the profit more economic activity and maybe pick up the they pay money out to their shareholders or it out of the country. But that is the point. And, that Treasurer Keating missed when he went for in this particular legislation. Treasurer could have taxed the company, as he did, and or he need not have taxed the company and course, he could have quite properly taxed them who was prepared to reinvest in their business and there would have been a massive incentive implications-people in other countries making in this environment in Australia and bring plants or any of the other secondary processing open to considering its natural resources base. in Western Australia proper investors, quite production and our huge gas production together them both to somebody else to do that particular incentive that says to business, 'If you reinvest lot of merit.

From the by David Pearce and Andrew Stoeckel I will quote Australian context over a longer period of some industry has had a long history of debate. It is of two things. One is the uncertain legality of some has been 'solved' by negotiation-the so-called Howe in March this year.

In the budget there was a four per cent billion. About 77 per cent of that went to $35 million increase in financial assistance The point I want to highlight here is that wealth government for the withdrawal Organisations. These organisations were funded and then they were expected to go on their resources. There was a sum of $150 million to go in administration and 50 per cent to projects.
