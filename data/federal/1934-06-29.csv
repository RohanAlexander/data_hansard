1,Mr R GREEN,EXCHANGE WITH EASTERN,"All the exchange on bunking business between Australia and countries in the East at present has to pass through London. Will the Assistant Treasurer impress upon the Commonwealth Bank the advisability of establishing a clearing house at some strategic point - for example, Singapore - in which the whole of the exchange business may be transacted and the necessary adjustments be made, thus shortcircuiting tliu period involved in having the inntiur arranged through London?",11
2,Mr CASEY,EXCHANGE WITH EASTERN,"So far as I know, there, are no direct, banking facilities between Australia and the Far East which would make possible a clearing house arrange munt such as the honourable member suggests. I shall, however, discuss the matter with the Commonwealth Bank Board and obtain from them a more complete reply to his question. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.

HARRISON - In view of the forthcoming exchange of warships, and with the object of establishing uniformity of procedure and the maintenance of harmony between the officers and men of the '.Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy, will tlw Minister for Trade and Customs consider the question of granting relief from excise and/or customs duties on tobacco, spirits and other commodities consumed by the Royal Australian Navy?",11
3,Mr WHITE,EXCHANGE WITH EASTERN,"This matter has been raised from time to time, and it has been found that the granting of such a concession presents undoubted difficulties. The Government has recently given consideration to the question, and is hopeful of being able to police the concession, if granted. NA UNITED COUNTRY PARTY.",11

Is he able to make an arrangement with the Belgian Government for the restoration of the market for beef which Australia previously held in that country, and to secure the continuance of the entry of Australian barley into Belgium?",12
7,Mr WHITE,UNITED AUSTRALIA PABTY AND,"-Belgiu m made of Australia certain requests that were not confined to concessions regarding beef, barley and glass. By a commercial arrangement an undertaking was given that within six months Australia would endeavor to come to a trade agreement with Belgium. In the matter of arranging: trade agreements with different countries, many difficulties confront the Government. Strong efforts were made to come to a favourable trade agreement with Belgium, but it was found impossible to reach finality within the period allotted. Belgium has now made a new arrangement for the extension by two months of the period allowed^ and during that time the negotiations will Droceed. It is hoped that, an agreement will be arrived at. Meanwhile, there is no ban upon the entry of Australian barley into Belgium, but the embargo upon beef still exists. NA",12
8,Mr WATSON,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,Is the Minister for Commerce aware that a number of people have questioned the validity of the Dairy Produce Act passed by this Parliament last year ? Will the honourable gentleman take steps to avert possible serious developments?,12
9,Mr STEWART,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,The most effective way in which the position can be clarified is for some of those who challenge the validity of the act to make an application for a judicial interpretation. TOBACCO CROP.,12
10,Mr THOMPSON,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,"In view of the statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs to a deputation of tobaccober growers in Melbourne last week-tha the manufacturers would purchase probably 4,000,000 lb. of tobacco this year*-wil l the honourable gentleman arrange for the purchase yf the tobacco which for the last two years has heen held by many tobacco-growers throughout Australia, particularly in no --them New South Wales?",12
11,Mr WHITE,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,"As I stated last night, the crop this year is expected to be a very small one, the estimate being only 2,500,000 lb. As the principal manufacturing company has undertaken to purchase all the higher grades and 'he ordinary usings of the darker grades, it follows that a proportion of the usable leaf carried over from previous years will be absorbed, because the ordinary usings of Australian leaf are in the vicinity of 4,000,000 lb. As the honourable member is well aware, some of the tobacco that is carried over from year to year is not usable. Therefore, it can hardly be expected that the whole of the carry-over can be bought.",12
12,Mr THOMPSON,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,"In view )f the fact that the bulk of the tobacco now held in Australia is nearly two years old, and that the growers have not had any intimation from the manufacturers as to whether that old tobacco will be bought, will the Minister for Trade and Customs suggest to the manufacturers that they should meet, in conference, representatives of the Australian Tobacco-growers Association with a view to a definite proportion of that two-year-old tobacco ACT. being bought forthwith?",12
13,Mr WHITE,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,"It must be obvious to the honourable member, from a recent re.port, that there is quite a lot of tobacco even in the district which he represents which is not usable. I am sur* that the manufacturers will be prepared to meet a deputation of the growers, but I do not see bow the Government comes into that question at all. I am unable to say whether the manufacturers would readily meet the growers, but I have no doubt that they would do so.",12

17,Mr SCULLIN,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,"How can any assurance be given, seeing that there is to be a prior election?",13
18,Mr WHITE,VALIDITY OF DAIRY PRODUCE,"For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), as well as of the honourable member for (Mr Casey) saidAngas (Mr Gabb), I may say that three or four months ago the announcement where was made of the intention, of the Governpartment, ment to introduce a bill for the conas tinuance of the bounty.

20,Mr FORDE,PRODUCTION OF POWER,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the statement of the manager of the Vicamount torian Wheat-growers Corporation, Mr. C.

22,Mr ROSEVEAR,PRODUCTION OF POWER,"In reply to a question respecting retrospective pension payments yesterday, the Assistant Treasurer We have been able to arrange that in cases the delay is attributable to the dea retrospective pension shall be paid from the pay day after the day on which, had there been no delay, the pension would have been payable. That statement appears to be very indefinite, and I ask the Assistant Treasurer for exactly what is meant by it?",13
23,Mr CASEY,PRODUCTION OF POWER,"If the honourable member is reading from the proof copy visit of Hansard, I shall be obliged to say that I said either at the time of my reply, or at least twice subsequently "" any considerable delay."" think that the statement is self explanatory, and I do not think that I could add to it anything that would clarify it further. There is a normal time, which is generally recognized, that must elapse between the application for and the granting of a pension. If the time is unduly protracted, and the delay is attributable to the department, then, instead of giving two fortnights' pension, which up to now has been the maximum of retrospective payment, the pension will be dated back to the first pay after the day on which, had there the been no undue departmental delay, the pension would normally have been paid. The first payment will include also two NA MESSENGERS IN BRISBANE.",13
24,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"In view of number of applications for positions of telegraph messengers in Brisbane, and the temporary character of the present appointments, is it the intention of the Government to hold an examination for the position of telegraph messengers? If so, when will the examination take place ?",13
25,Mr ABCHDAL EPARKHILL,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I shall obtain the information which the honourable member desires as to the exact date of the examination, if any, and acquaint him later of its nature. I cannot speak offhand in respect of the details of postal administration. MAIZ E INDUSTRY. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM.^-Will the Prime Minister include maize in the terms of the ^inquiry which he has promised with reference to wheat?",14
26,Mr LYONS,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I have not undertaken to carry out any inquiry. I merely promised the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), that I would give consideration to the matter, and I shall do that also in connection with maize. INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS. .",14
27,Mr JAMES,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Is the Treasurer aware that parents of children who have reached the age of sixteen years, and are unemployed, are not entitled to claim a deduction of £50 under the income tax law despite the fact that the maintenance of those children is a much heavier burden upon the taxpayers than was the case when they were under sixteen years of age? Will the Treasurer give consideration to an amendment of the act so a3 to allow a deduction in respect of the unemployed dependants of taxpayers?",14
28,Mr LYONS,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"There must be some limitation in regard to the age of the dependants, otherwise there would be chaos in the administration of the law. I cannot see how that limitation can be avoided, because if the age of dependants were raised, we should still be confronted with anomalies of the kind referred to by the honourable member.",14
29,Mr JAMES,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"In the case of unemployed dependants, the deduction should continue.",14
30,Mr LYONS,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I am afraid that it is impossible to accede to the honourable member's request, because, if granted, the whole administration of the taxation law would be entirely upset. I should like to be able to agree to the suggestion, but I do not think that it is practicable. NORTHERN TERRITORY. TENNANT'S CSEEK GOLDFIELD-LAN D LAW.",14
31,Mr NELSON,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Will the Minister for .the Interior state whether the Government intends to assist the miners of Tennant's Creek gold-field by the provision of a battery, as is done by every State in the Commonwealth? If so, will he facilitate the erection of the hattery, so that some hundreds of men may be able to make a living? Will he further make provision in the Estimates for the granting of assistance to miners and prospectors to enable them to develop their mines? Also, will he make arrangements to advance to miners one-fourth of the value of the gold content of the stone that they raise, such advance to be made on assay?  has been made by the Government to deal with any of the matters raised by the honourable member. I shall, however, see that consideration is given to his representations.",14
32,Mr NELSON,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Has the Minister yet decided to lay on the table of the Library, the report of Dr Woolnough, dealing with his recent inspection of the Tennant's Greek gold-field, and also the report of the committee or commission which some time ago investigated the administration of the land law of the Northern Territory?  to go into that matter, but I think that the report referred to will be laid on the table in the Library this morning. BRITISH MIGRANTS.",14
33,Mr WARD,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Has the attention of the Assistant Treasurer been directed to the following statement which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 7th June iast:VICTORIAN SETTLERS. 225 ACCEPT COMPENSATION. QUESTIONS IN COMMONS. London, Juno 5. In the House of Commons today, the Secretary for the Dominions (Mr J. H . Thomas) informed Mr R. H . Turton (Con.) that 225 of the Victorian settlers had accepted compensation. He said that he would be glad to inquire into any cases where there might be delay, partly due to the necessity of making adjustments. It was fair to say that, while there were many cases of great hardship, others had tried to exploit the situation. He had already urged the acceleration of arrangements of those wishing to return to England. Sir Robert. Hamilton (Lib.): Are you aware that the claims of creditors led to one settler going to prison and to another becoming destitute? Mr Thomas: I will inquire, if the names are furnished. Compensation has been provided with the object of enabling the settlers to obtain a fresh Btart there. Sir Robert Hamilton : Is anything being done to enable them to start afresh in Britain ? Mr Thomas replied that he would make personal investigations wherever possible. I ask the Assistant Treasurer whether that statement is accurate, and if he is prepared to make a statement showing the allocation of the money that was voted by this Parliament to provide compensation for these settlers?",14
34,Mr CASEY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I have not seen the reference, but in any event the responsibility for the allocation of the money is on the Government of Victoria. The whole responsibility of the Commonwealth Government was, practically speaking, to advance to the State Government of Victoria the sum of £100,000, and the matter was then arbitrated as to where the responsibility lay for the finding of the money. The arbitrator found against the .State of Victoria so that that State is responsible for finding and allocating the money, and the only responsibility of the Commonwealth is to advance the money temporarily to the State of Victoria.",15
35,Mr WARD,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"When this Parliament was considering the allocation of certain moneys for the assistance of British migrants settled in Victoria, the Assistant Treasurer and other members of the Government stated in reply to criticism on the part of members of our party that the money which was then being voted would be used for the purpose, not of satisfying creditors, but of directly assisting these unfortunate settlers. I desire to know what authority the Assistant Treasurer had for making that statement and whether he is now prepared to admit that the contention of the members of our party, that the money would be used to satisfy creditors, was correct?",15
36,Mr CASEY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I do not remember taking part in the particular debate in any way; in fact I am quite certain that I did not do so. The terms on which this Parliament was asked to find temporarily the sum of £100,000 were clearly set forth in the bill. The subsequent arrangement as to how the money should be expended was to be the responsibility of Victoria. Now as the result of arbitration, the final responsibility is wholly on Victoria, and it is a matter, therefore, which does not concern this Parliament. DATE OF GENERALELECTION .",15
37,Mr GANDER,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Yesterday in reply to my question regarding the date of the general election, the Prime Minister said that he would get in touch with the Governor General, and I should like to know whether he has yet done so?",15
38,Mr LYONS,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,We are not hurrying so rapidly towards a general election as to have made it necessary for me to see the Governor General since the honourable member's question was asked. CUSTOMS BILL .,15
39,Mr GREGORY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"For the last two years there has appeared on the notice paper a Customs Bill providing for two very important amendments, one dealing with the power of the Commonwealth to impose embargoes, and the other dealing with the period during which a tariff, introduced by resolution, may legally be continued. Will the Prime Minister, if 2)ossible, push this bill through this chamber during this session?",15
40,Mr LYONS,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,I think that if honourable members will assist the Government to facilitate the business of the House,15
41,Mr GREGORY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,Why is the Government keeping it back ?,15
42,Mr LYONS,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,That insinuation is entirely unworthy of the honourable member. I was proceeding to say that I hoped to give the House an opportunity to discuss the bill today. COUNTRY PRESS DICTAPHONES .,15
43,Mr JAMES,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,In view of the imposition on the 1st February last of an additional tax upon the country press for the „ use of dictaphones; will the Postmaster General inform the House as to the amount of additional revenue received? Will he also state whether he considers that the six monthly payments in advance for the use of these dictaphones is a fair imposition ?,15
44,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH," This is a long-standing matter, having been before two previous Postmasters General. When I came into office I endeavoured to straighten it out on the basis of equity to the users of dictaphones and to the general public. Subsequently, I arrived at a basis which was fair to the department and to the user of the dictaphone. Although it involved an increase in the trunk line rates for the use of dictaphones, it has generally been accepted. In some instances additional dictaphones have been installed, and in other instances tele-printers have been substituted. I frankly admit that in .some cases the dictaphones have been taken out altogether. The position is perfectly fair. The payment in advance is in accordance with the policy prevailing in respect of the payment of telephone rates by private users, and I see no reason why it should be altered in the interests of one section of the community. COCKATOO ISLAND DOOKYAED. COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES.",16
45,Mr BOSEYEAR,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Has the Minister for the Interior given any consideration to the matters which I raised last night in respect of compensation payments to men who were injured when the Commonwealth was in control of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard ? If he has not already done so, will he treat the matter as urgent in view of the fact that these men have, for the last eight months, not received any compensation payment because of the Department of the Interior and the Attorney-General's Department not having decided the legal aspects of the matter ?  member asked his question yesterday, I was, unfortunately, absent from the chamber, but I subsequently told him that I would attend to the matter. I have asked the secretary of the department to look into it, and to procure the information for the honourable member. CUSTOMS TABIFF (NEW ZEALAND PREFERENCE) 1934. Motion (by Mr WHITE ) agreed to - : Tliat he have leave to bring in a bill for an aet to amend the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 1933. Bill brought up and read a first time. SECOND READING .",16
46,Mr WHITE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.1] - by leave^I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to provide machinery to enable the Government to comply with certain provisions contained in article 9 of the trade agreement concluded with New Zealand last year. The agreement itself was approved and ratified by Parliament in November last. Article 9 provides that where the rate of duty on particular New Zealand goods entering Australia is higher than the rate of duty on the like Australian goods entering New Zealand the New Zealand Government may request the Commonwealth Government to admit like New Zealand goods into Australia at the rate of duty payable on the like Australian goods entering New Zealand. If the Commonwealth Government fails to comply with the request within three months, the New Zealand Government is free to impose on the particular Australian goods a duty not greater than that imposed in Australia on the same goods from New Zealand. The provision is a reciprocal one. While Parliament has been in recess, three applications have been received from the New Zealand Government requesting the Commonwealth to concede to New Zealand the equivalent of the New Zealand rate on knitted or lock-stitched piece goods of silk or artificial silk, unmounted wireless receiving sets, and dry batteries and dry cells. New Zealand accords free entry to Australia for all these goods, and there is a substantial and growing export trade from Australia in each item.",16
47,Mr FORDE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"How will the provisions of this bill affect, say, 'butter ?",16
48,Mr WHITE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"The New Zealand Government may make a request, but there is no obligation upon the Commonwealth Government to agree to it. I quote the following figures to show how our trade with New Zealand has increased:VALTJE OF ExronTS TO NEW ZEALAND. 1930. 1032. £ £ Knitted or lock-stitched piece goods of silk and artificial silk .. 498 35,717 Wireless broadcast receiving sets .. 5,343 37,114 Dry batteries and dry cells .. 40,090 34,807 In those items we hare not imported a pound's worth from New Zealand^ Our total export trade with New Zealand in -1930-31 was valued at £2,978,118, and our imports from New Zealand were valued at £980,838. For the three-year period, 1930-33, our total exports to New Zealand were valued at £8,352,203, and our imports from New Zealand were valued at £3,072,562. It is the same story whether we consider primary or secondary production. The Australian rates of duty as applied to New Zealand goods of the three classes I have mentioned are high, and practically preclude the New Zealand goods from the Australian market. There is little doubt that if New Zealand applied the Australian rates it would result in loss of the New'Zealand market for these goods. With Parliament in recess, and in the absence of the necessary enabling machinery, it has not been practicable to meet the earliest of the New Zealand requests within the time provided in the agreement. Our inability to meet the first New Zealand request within the time limit has been explained to the Dominion Government with which arrangements have been made to meet the position. The general provision proposed under this amendment is necessary to enable any future requests, from New Zealand to be met within the prescribed three months, and to obviate similar difficulties in the future. In its absence, and where it is desired to meet similar New Zealand requests, action can only be taken by the introduction into the House of Representatives of individual tariff resolutions. Circumstances will arise in which it will not be possible to introduce a resolution within the time the article allows. The consequences might easily be very serious f.oy Australia's trade with New Zealand. It is perhaps desirable to explain that the provisions of the article are not applicable throughout the entire range of the Australian tariff. The agreement contains two schedules,- applying respectively to New Zealand goods and Australian goods, in which are enumerated various classes of goods and the rates of duty applying thereto. Goods other than those enumerated in the schedules are subject to the British preferential tariff of Australia or New Zealand, as the case may be. The article applies only to the goods which are not enumerated in the schedules to the agreement and which are subject in general terms to the rates of duty for the time being in force under the respective British preferential tariffs. The proposed amendment does not alter the original agreement. Its purpose, as I have said, is to provide the means to carry certain of the provisions of the original agreement into effect. The proposed amendment - merely sets up the machinery whereby Australia can accord to New Zealand the same rates of duty as New Zealand accords to Australia whenever the New Zealand Government so requests. The provision of the necessary machinery is a matter of urgency. the I , therefore, ask honourable members to give this hill a speedy passage. New Zealand is a very large buyer of Australian secondary products, whereas - exports of manufactured goods from New Zealand to Australia are practically negligible. Failure to meet the New Zealand request would mean a severe loss to Australia.",16
49,Mr FORDE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Capricornia) [11.8] The members of the Opposition supported the trade agreement between New Zealand and Australia when it was submitted to Parliament last year, because they believed that it would foster amicable trade relations between the two dominions. We also thought that there was a great possibility of our developing an export trade with New Zealand, particularly in manufactured goods. I said when I spoke on that measure that we were disappointed that the negotiations for the lifting of the New Zealand embargo on the importation of Australian citrus fruits to New Zealand had not been successful.",17
50,Mr WHITE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,Thos e negotiations are still continuing.,17
51,Mr FORDE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I am sorry that they have occupied such a long time for it is of national importance to our citrusgrowers that they should have a reliable market for their products. The New Zealand prohibition has deprived them of what was previously a lucrative market for £150,000 worth of their surplus production. A meeting of the Federated Fruit-growers Conference held in Sydney yesterday resolved to urge the Federal Government to continue its endeavours to regain the New Zealand eitrus market for Australia, even though it means the admission of New Zealand apples to Australia. I urge tie Minister to take this subject up with the Minister for Commerce (Mr Stewart). A very long time has elapsed since Senator MassyGreene visited New Zealand and put in train the negotiations for the lifting of the prohibition. I am glad to hear that there has been a steady improvement in the value of Australian exports to New Zealand, and particularly that the improvement has been shown in manufacfactured goods. That is what we, as protectionists, are aiming at. We desire our manufacturers to conduct their business on such an efficient basis that they will be able not only to supply the home market, but also to build up an export trade and so give employment to an additional 500,000 people in the factories of Australia. We should be able to compete with overseas manufacturers in the market of the sister dominion of New Zealand.",17
52,Mr MAXWELL,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,What about the New Zealand manufacturers ?,18
53,Mr FORDE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I assume that they are able to look after themselves. speaking as a member of the Commonmore rapidly. wealth Parliament in support of Australian manufacturing industries. There has been an increase in our exports manufactured goods not only to New Zealand, but also to the East, and it most pleasing development. This is non-contentious measure and I have very much pleasure in supporting it.",18

[11.10] - Any measure that deals with our trade relations with New Zealand involves customs duties is of greatest importance, particularly at the present time, to both our primary and secondary industries, and there is, therefore, an obligation upon the Minister to give honourable members the fullest information on the subject. We should be informed of the results of the visit of the Minister for Commerce (Mr. Stewart) to the sister dominion. The visit of Senator Massy-Greene to New Zealand did not have the results that were expected from it,"" and apparently the visit of the Minister for Commerce has also failed to achieve the desired I have no doubt the attitude of the New Zealand Government is based upon the principle of doing the best it can for its own people. Notwithstanding the interjection of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), our uppermost desire is naturally to promote the interests of our people. If a battle of wits is proceeding between New Zealand and Australia. I am quite prepared to take advantage of every opportunity to preserve the interests of this country, because at the moment, 1. am only concerned about the welfare of Australia. If this measure is designed to give practical assistance io Australian manufacturers, we also have to consider our primary producers, because both interests are worthy of our careful consideration. The Minister has pointed out that the bill deals with three specific items, namely, knitted or lockstitched piecegoods of silk or artificial silk, unmounted wireless receiving sets, batteries and dry cells; but I understand that there is in it a clause containing a general power to cover other items as well.",18
55,Mr WHITE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,That power is already in the principal act. We are now seekI am ing to implement machinery to use it,18
56,Mr BEASLEY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Apparentl y the provisions of the principal act make it of necessary for the Minister to approach Parliament on this matter, and it is now is a a question whether we should not retain a that provision without alteration.",18
57,Mr WHITE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,It is necessary to have wider power for use during parliamentary,18
58,Mr BEASLEY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"That raises the quesand tion whether such powers should be used during recesses. If the object of the bill is to assist certain of our secondary industries there should be no complaint about it ; but the Minister for Commerce should first inform honourable members of the exact position in regard to trade negotiations with the New Zealand Government, particularly as they affect the exchange of primary products. While I am anxious to ensure that everything possible is done to expand our market with New Zealand, I have no desire that anything unnecessary should be done at the expense of any section of our own end. primary producers. The time to supply information is now, so that we may have an opportunity to study, and, if necessary, criticize the Government's proposals. I am not content to await press statements issued by the Minister regarding his negotiations with New Zealand immediately before the elections.",18
59,Mr WHITE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,The recent conference at Canberra was the direct result of the visit of the Minister to New Zealand.,19
60,Mr BEASLEY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"The Minister seems to assume that because he knows everything that occurred at the conference all honourable members should be equally well informed. Conferences of that kind held under the Government's supervision are not always fully representative of the interests concerned. Large numbers of growers may be opposed to the decisions arrived at, but they will be denied an opportunity to express their opinions unless the matter is fully discussed in Parliament where their representatives may speak for them.",19
61,Mr BLACKLOW,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Franklin) [11.19]. - I appreciate the desire of the Minister to expedite the passage of this bill, but he ought, I think, to have given honourable members some further information on the matter. It is admittedly desirable to encourage trade with our sister dominion, but it behoves every one of us to look after the interests of his own section of that trade. I am concerned with the apple trade, *and with the proposal to admit New Zealand apples to Australia on more favourable terms. What is the present duty on New Zealand apples?",19
62,Mr STEWART,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,Thre e shillings central.,19
63,Mr BLACKLOW,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I understand that the New Zealand Government guarantees an f.o.b. price to the growers for all apples exported from that dominion. Therefore, a duty of 3s. a central will not prevent the New Zealand growers from shipping their apples to Australia and competing unfairly with our own Australian producers. That is a serious prospect for our growers, and I should like to hoar the Minister's opinion of it. I know that the Minister has endeavoured to secure the co-operation of the New Zealand Government regarding quotas and varieties of apples exported to Europe, but New Zealand does not seem inclined to come to an understanding. The same thing may happen in regard to the Australian market. It may be that certain varieties of apples which, under the agreement, we are not allowed to export, will be sent by New Zealand to the Australian market. We should be given some more detailed information on these points.",19
64,Mr MORDANT,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Kennedy) [11.24] The hill refers to certain schedules, but copies of those schedules have not been supplied to honourable members. During the last recess the Minister for Commerce visited New Zealand, but no report on his visit has yet been presented, nor has any statement been made regarding the result of the recent conference in Canberra of Australian and New Zealand representatives. It may be that, under this bill, New Zealand butter will be admitted to Australia in competition with Australian butter. It may also happen that New Zealand meat, butter and bacon will be admitted to the detriment of our primary producers, who surely should be entitled to their own home market. When the butter pool was first formed in Queensland, and a price fixed for butter consumed locally, supplies of butter were imported from New Zealand in an endeavour to smash the pool; and that would certainly have happened had not the Federal Government increased the duty on New Zealand butter. The Minister said that the bill would assist our secondary industries. That may be so, but we should not assist those industries at the expense of our a primary producers who have been passing through such difficult times. The other day a shipment of chilled meat which was sent to England returned the exporters about £3 a head more frhan could have been obtained for frozen beef. Immediately the overseas shipping companies increased the freight charges on chilled beef, and grabbed 30s. of the extra £3. If we lift the duty on New Zealand butter and other primary products our primary producers will soon be going along to the Government for a dole ticket.",19
65,Mr WHITE,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"We are not obliged under the agreement to reduce duties on New Zealand products, but if we do not do so the New Zealand Government may retaliate hy raising the duty on Australian products.",19

68,Mr BELL,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Darwin) [11.28] - The effect of the bill, I understand, is to enable the Commonwealth Government to give immediate effect to such trade agreements as are entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New Zealand. Certain specific items are referred to in the bill, but I understand that it may be made to apply also to other commodities which become the subject of negotiation. desire to sound a note of warning regarding trade agreements to which the Government may commit this country. While we all agree that it is desirable to foster with New Zealand trade that will be beneficial to both countries, it must be remembered that it is difficult to make such an arrangement without its being detrimental to some section of tins primary producers in one country or the other. I am afraid that, when entering into negotiations with other countries in connection with trade agreements, the Minister is not always so fully informed as he might be as to the possible effects of the proposed agreement. I do not desire to reflect upon the capacity of the Minister; he has to rely a great deal on others for information to guide him in. these negotiations. I know that certain discussions are inow proceeding, and that committees have been inquiring into the matters covered by the agreements, and have submitted recommendations. But I suggest to the Minister that the members of these committees are not sufficiently well informed to advise him. Directors of Agriculture and departmental health officers meet together and advise the Minister as to the effect of certain embargoes. after all, they know very little about the economics of the different industries affected by the imposition of these embargoes. I am sufficiently well acquainted with the personnel of these committees to know that they are versed in the technical side of the industry, but know little of the economic effect of their recommendations. On the other hand I , as a member of Parliament, know a good deal about the industries affected. When a Minister has entered into an agreement with a sister dominion the agreement is brought before the House, and the House must either accept or reject it. He can bargain. We cannot. But a bargain, to be a good one, must be beneficial to both parties.",20
69,Mr BEASLEY,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,We see only the bargain ; we have no opportunity to express an opinion on it before it is made.,20
70,Mr BELL,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"I think it is wrong that effect should be given to any agreement entered into enabling duties to be reduced or increased when Parliament is not in I session, simply by a proclamation signed by the Governor General. It would rob members of Parliament of the power to exercise their right as the responsible representatives of the people. In any case, it is desirous that interests that may be detrimenitally affected as the result of advice given to a Minister should first bp heard-.",20
71,Mr MAXWELL,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,The interested party generally makes itself heard.,20
72,Mr BELL,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Not always does it have the opportunity, and, if heard, the Minister possilbiy has made up his mind, and has carried negotiations to a point at which it would be very difficult to effect any alteration, fhis has happened many times in the past agreements, preferences have been rial agreements between the different dominions. I know that, in respect tc past in regard to these so-called preferengiven to one industry in our own country to the detriment of another, and in some cases to foreign countries at the expense of our own industries. That nearly always happens when the advice of practical men is disregarded while negotiations are proceeding. The advice of those who are well informed in these matters should be sought before the negotiations But, have proceeded so far that an alteration in the terms of the proposed agreement cannot he made.",20
73,Mr STEWART,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"Parramatta-Minister for Commerce) [11.35] - The honourable well member for Darwin (Mr Bell) has correctly stated the purpose of this bill. It is designed to avoid unconscionable delays which must result under the existing procedure. As an illustration, at the present time we are negotiating with Canada for a supplementary trade agreement. The Canadian Parliament is going into recess, probably during this month, and is not likely to meet again until after the commencement of the new year. In the meantime, no matter whether the terms of the agreement arrived at between the respective governments should be put into immediate operation, ratification has to be delayed until both parliaments meet. It can readily be seen that this must present a difficulty to the detriment of both parties to the agreement. As a good deal has been said in respect to my recent visit to New Zealand, I think it necessary to give briefly the tory of the embargoes which are at present operative between the Commonwealth and New Zealand. Some time ago, on the recommendation of the technical officers of the Commonwealth, an embargo was placed on the importation from New Zealand of apples and pears and nursery stocks because of the fear of the introduction into Australia of fire-blight. A similar embargo was placed against the importation of potatoes from New Zealand because of the prevalence of corky scab and powdery scab. New Zealand naturally resented the imposition of this embargo, claiming that we were not bona fide in our assertion that the embargoes were imposed for quarantine purposes, and it was only after the unfortunate experience of the visitation of thrips to Australia three or four _years ago, when there would have been a good market for New Zealand apples which the dominion was desirous of exploiting, that it resolved to have a complete understanding with Australia on the matter. Eighteen months ago, New Zealand imposed a counter embargo on the importation from Australia of citrus fruits. This, as indicated by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley), was a very serious blow to the citrus fruit-growers of Australia.  not a proclamation issued prohibiting the importation of onions into New Zealand ?",20
74,Mr STEWART,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"That prohibition was brought into force because the onions and other vegetables were likely to be infected with Mediterranean fruit fly. One of the objects of my visit to New Zealand was to confer with the dominion authorities on this matter. I found the position that confronted me very difficult. Unfortunately, I had to overcome the feeling in New Zealand that Australia was not "" playing the game."" As a result of my negotiations, however, a conference was arranged between the technical officers of the New Zealand Administration and our own officers, in order that the issues between the two countries could be fully discussed. That conference was held in Canberra last Monday week, and its findings have been made public, indicating that the technical officers of both administrations are now prepared to recomhismend the abolition of all embargoes, and to suggest that the necessary protection against the introduction of diseases into either country can be secured by setting up a process of certification of exnorts from both countries.",21
75,Mr BLACKLOW,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,There is an embargo existing between Victoria and Tasmania prohibiting the importation into Victoria of Tasmanian potatoes because of the prevalence of corky scab. Yet the Victorian market may be open to New Zealand potatoes.,21
76,Mr STEWART,APPOINTMEN T OF TELEGRAPH,"The embargo against the importation of Tasmanian potatoes into Victoria is imposed for the same reason that Australia shut out the New Zealand potatoes. The Victorian representatives were present at the conference in Canberra, but under instructions they did not enter into the discussion because there is at the present time litigation proceeding between Tasmania and Victoria as to the validity of the embargo on the importation of Tasmanian potatoes. The Victorian representatives sat in conference and heard the representatives of New Zealand and the States of the Commonwealth declare that it was no longer necessary to prohibit the importation of New Zealand potatoes because of the danger of the introduction of scab. We are hopeful that one of the results of the conference will be that better relations will be established between Tasmania and Victoria. The recommendations of the conference will be considered by the respective governments. The officer who represented the New Zealand Government at the conference has arrived home only during the last few hours, and we have not yet had time to consult with the Government the dominion as to its attitude towards the conclusions of the conference, but I am hopeful that very much good will accordance result to the primary aud secondary protime ducers of both dominions.

And upon amendments of the 3rd November, 1933 (vide page 4231) and .5854).",21
77,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.50] - I That the Customs Tariff (Primage Duties) resolutions introduced into the House nf Representatives on the 3rd November, 1933, and the 8th December, 1933, be incorporated in the primage duty proposals of the 4th October, 1933, as on and from the 4th November and the 8th December, 1933, respectively. This is a formal motion to enable the primage duties resolutions of the 3rd November and the 8th December, 1933, to be brought before the committee and debated in conjunction with the main primage duty proposals. 1934. Primage duties were first imposed as r Mr from the 10th July, 1930, during the regime of the last Government with the for object of producing additional revenue. Tax The rate of primage duty at that time was 2$ per cent. This rate was increased in November, 1930, to 4 per cent. In 1931, the principal rate was made 1934 10 per cent, in accordance with the Premiers plan, whilst certain raw macbines, and goods affecting the primary producer remained at for 4 per cent. Since'then many exemptions have been made, or the rate has been reduced to 4 per cent, on various goodsmainly on goods used by our primary industries. The primage duties proposals of the 4th October, 1933, provided for a new departure and reduced the primage duty on goods eligible for admission under the British preferential tariff and subject to protective duties under the cus1 toms tariff from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent. The two main reasons for this action were:-(1 ) To give effect, as far as the finances would permit, to the Tariff Board's recommendation on the protective incidence of primage duties; and (2) to carry out, as far as was possible under the then financial conditions, Australia's obligations under article 14 of the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement in respect to primage on British goods. Considerable relief, amounting to approximately £585,000, has been given by way of the reductions of primage duties which were made in connection with the budget for 1933-34. The revenue derived from primage duties represents a substantial item in the Commonwealth's receipts; in 1932-33 it amounted to over £4,500,000. Practically the whole of the imported goods directly affecting the primary industries have been either exempted from primage duty or made subject to the low rate of 4 per cent. The Government has at all times realized the necessity for removing as far a3 is reasonably possible, any burden that presses unduly upon the primary industries.",22
78,Mr BEASLEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,It believes in removing emergency taxation before anything else.,23
79,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"This is emergency taxation, and it concerns some very destitute persons about whom I have heard the honourable member speak in this chamber. It will be appreciated that the Government, since it assumed office, has gone as far as it can in providing relief from these duties, and that any future alterations will he dependent upon the state of the treasury.",23
80,Mr FORDE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Capricornia) [11.54] This motion has been brought on unexpectedly. Certainly, the Minister has given some explanation on it ; but even so, I consider that honourable members ought to be given an opportunity to go further into it. Has the Minister any objection to the debate being adjourned?",23
81,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,No ; but there is now an oportunity to consider the matter before bigger measures are brought down.,23
82,Mr FORDE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I take this opportunity to say that I am opposed to remissions of taxation being made before there baa heen a full restoration of emergency cuts in the case of invalid and old-age pensioners, public servants, and other very deserving sections of the community, who have suffered considerably, and who were promised that as soon as the finances of the Commonwealth permitted, there would be a complete restoration. This Government adopts the attitude that there should first be a restoration to taxpayers, and that invalid and old-age pensioners and public servants should be the last considered. It cannot be asserted that there has not been an improvement of the revenues of the Commonwealth. The revenues of the Commonwealth showed a decidedly upward tendency in the first year that this Government was in office. That was not due to either its administration or its legislation. The Scullin Government, by sound administration, and by prohibitive and restrictive measures which prevented the importation of goods that could not be paid for, the result of which was to turn an adverse trade balance of £30,000,000 into a favourable one of £30,000,000, enabled the present occupants of the treasury bench to return a surplus immediately. Pensioners and public servants had been assured by the representatives of all parties that the cuts which had been imposed on them would be restored to them as soon as the finances permitted, yet the first year's surplus was not devoted to that purpose. On the contrary, an additional £700,000 was taken from pensioners, while taxation was remitted in the case of the wealthy section of the community to an amount of £2,000,000. Pensioners were further reduced to the extent of £750,000, although bondholders and banks were not asked to make any additional sacrifice. In the succeeding financial year, the Government had a further surplus of approximately £5,000,000. It again remitted taxation, chiefly in the case of wealthy landholders and its in fluential taxpaying friends, to an amount Anstey, of £7,500,000, the aggregate remissions Martens, G. W. for the two years thus being £9,500,000. Admittedly, a portion of that was emergency taxation. I , however, am referring principally to the remission of federal land tax, which was not emergency spoke taxation. It had been in operation twenty years. I wish to impress upon should be taken the Minister the claims of invalid and old-age pensioners, and of public servants. They were promised that what were unmonths. questionably emergency cuts would be restored immediately the finances of the that information. Commonwealth permitted such action to be taken; yet, although there has been a considerable improvement of the finances, the concessions in their case have been niggardly. I ask the Governtions ment to make a complete restoration of those cuts in the budget that is shortly be brought down. The Labour party for is definitely pledged' to that policy.

83,Sir HENRY GULLETT,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Henty) [12.6]. - I take it that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), although he with some little force on this subfor ject, did not intend that his remarks seriously. These removals of primage have, in effect, been before this chamber for some seven",24
84,Mr FORDE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,The Minister gave us,24
85,Sir HENBYGULLETT,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The Minister made that perfectly clear, yet the members of Che Labour party are opposing this purely formal step of removing imposiof primage upon industry. These reductions are part of the whole working to fabric of the country, and have been so more than six months. The of the Opposition endeavoured to show that reductions of this kind, for instance, in primage on goods, as in other directions, have exceeded proportionately the restoration of salary, pension, and other reductions. 16 This is a very serious question. There has already been quite a substantial restoration of reductions, for example, 17 in Public Service salaries. That has been entirely overlooked by the honourable member. The intention of the GovernAXES. ment has been to make restoration in both directions, to remove the excessive depression-time taxation to some extent and simultaneously to restore, partially, some of the reductions which were made in pensions and Public Service salaries. I think that the Government has, up to date, held the balance fair l y , and I am NOES. sure will continue to do so. I am surprised at the attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because these primage charges f all heavily upon our secondary industries. They f all heavily upon the raw material required not only for secondary industry, but also for primary industry throughout this country. For instance, these charges f all upon corn sacks and a multitude of things, despite some exemptions, which are used by both primary and secondary industries. They are therefore a definite restriction upon employment. They were never a part of the protectionist system, and the Leader of the Opposition would be the first to admit that. These charges were imposed by this Government with great regret because they represented a burden upon our industrial activities and therefore uponour employment activities. Insofar as they have been lifted they have relieved and stimulated industry and increased employment, and the more these charges are lifted the more will employment be increased. Therefore the members of the Opposition, in resisting the removal of these primage charges upon industry, are hindering the restoration of employment in this country.",24
86,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Yarra) [12.10] - I cannot allow the lecture which has been given to us by the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) to pass without correcting his statements and his interpretation of the attitude of the Labour party. The honourable member said that this Government is holding the balance fairly by reducing taxation imposed under the emergency legislation proportionately with the restoration of reductions in social services and Public Service salaries. That statement is absolutely incorrect. The reductions that were made in social services under the first emergency legislation stand today in their full severity. In addition further provisions have beeu inserted in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act which have added to the severity of the original emergency reduction. The only restoration that has been made in pensions by this Government was in respect of reductions imposed by itself, which doubled the first emergency reductions provided under the original Premiers plan. This Government has reduced very substantially the taxation under the original emergency legislation without making the slightest restoration to the invalid and old-age pensioners; in fact, it has added to the impositions upon them. Therefore the very basis of the case put up by the honourable member for Henty has been knocked from under his feet. The honourable member said that the restorations made to public servants and pensioners were in proportion to the reduction of taxation.",25
87,Sir HENRY GULLETT,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I said that was the object of the Government.,25
88,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The honourable member said that it was being done progressively and that the balance was being held fairly. I say that that is absolutely incorrect, and the honourable member, if"" he knows anything about the facts, must admit that. The original reductions that were made under the Premiers plan with respect to social services stand today in the majority of cases. There have been remissions all round in taxation, even remissions in taxation that was not affected by the emergency legislation. I refer particularly to the land tax. I do not deny that my Government imposed emergency taxation with regret, but we imposed other taxation in the form of reductions with greater regret. Those impositions should be the first to be removed.",25
89,Sir HENRY GULLETT,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,The Scullin Government imposed them.,25
90,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,We imposed them and the honourable member supported them. We imposed them because we had no alternative. Now that money is available relief should be given to the poorer section of the community.,25
91,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,That section is getting relief as the result of the removal of these primage charges.,25
92,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Onl y indirectly. I am not objecting in principle to the removal of these charges, because I do not stand for the principle of the continuation of primage which was purely an emergency charge in a period of financial crisis. But impositions on the pensioners should be the first to he removed. Our attitude today is perfectly consistent with our attitude on the budget. I admit that these matters came up for consideration months ago, but it must not be forgotten that in the meantime we have had a long recess. We made our protest on these matters when the budget was introduced, and we are entitled to make a further protest now that the effort is being made to give legal effect to the vote of Parliament We have been consistent throughout. There is another aspect of the subject which should bo considered. It has been said that the reduction of the primage duties is consequent upon the ratification of the Ottawa agreement. The that honourable member for Henty had something to do with-the preparation of that agreement. Let him and other honourable gentlemen who support it review the tion adopted. happenings in the business world since that time, and point out, if they can, how Australia has benefited by the agreement.",25
93,Sir HENBY GULLETT,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,We have had a resolution. few millions a year from it.,26
94,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Mythica l millions! Our position is worse now than it was ment or debate. before we became a party to the agreement, for Britain has entered into trade agreements with foreign countries with the result that Australia's hands have been forced to such an extent that she is being asked to agree to restrictions and quotas that were never dreamed of motion by Mr WHITE before the Ottawa conference.",26
95,Sir HENKY GULLETT,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Nothin g of the kind !,26
96,The CHAIRMAN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I for ask the honourable member for Henty not to interject. A discussion of the Ottawa agreement and of the general reduction of taxation would not be in order at this amended stage. The subject of primage duties only is before the committee.,26
97,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The Minister stressed that the reduction of these duties wa3 consequent upon the carrying out of the Ottawa agreement. I reply that in over the light of our experiences since the ratification of the agreement and in view of the trade prospects ahead of us should lose no time in reviewing it. When the budget was introduced last year, and it was proposed that reductions of this kind should be made, I moved an amendment, which was deAdjustment) feated, to the effect that provision should first be made for the unemployed and the restoration of the emergency cuts in social services, salaries and wages. A prosolution mise was definitely made, in this ParliaCustoms ment by honourable members of all parties that work would he found for the ployed and the emergency cuts restored at the first opportunity. The Government has failed to give effect to that promise. We opposed these proposals the budget of last year, and now we are opposing the effort to give legal effect them and, in doing so, we are quite conobjection sistent.

99,Mr FORDE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Capricornia) [12.23] Judging by the brief explanation of this of motion by the Minister, this is a non-contentious subject. Honourable members to on this side of the committee took strong to certain provisions in the bills involved in the motion, but those subjects have been finally dealt with.

Since the 14th October, 1932, intermediate tariff has been operating, and, consequently, it has been necessary to specify certain rates for the goods question. The rates included schedule are the same as those which operated in the intermediate tariff immediately prior to the. 14th October, 1932. The bill will merely empower the Government to print something in the nature of a separate schedule which will be appended to the other. There will be no variation of the rates of duty.",28

123,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Balaclava-Minister f Trade and Customs) [2.16] - I moveThht the bill be now read a second time. This measure is designed to improve the present working of the Customs Act. I was originated in the Senate some eighteen months ago, and I ask honourable members to treat it not as a means debating the height of the tariff with respect to any particular item, or the tection afforded to any industry, but simply as an amendment of the act. full debate on the tariff items last year, and it should not be necessary to have a repetition of it on this occasion. When the bill is in committee, i i is my intention to propose certain amendments to it . The bill covers certain minor alterations and other important alterations that that have been awaiting attention for some time. The principal .alterations contemplated are three. The first is an amendment of the preferential, conditionswliich enable the value of Australian, materials to be included in the calculation of the 75 per cent, of United Kingdom origin in order that goods may qualify for preference. That relates specifically towool.",29
124,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,That will remove a very serious anomaly.,29
125,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I believe that the* House wil l unanimously approve of it . The next proposal is the substitution of prohibitions by regulations instead of by proclamation. The third amendment provides that tariff schedules shall be discussed within six months after their in troduction into the House.,29
126,Mr GREGORY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,They must be legalized?,29
127,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,They must pass in to law.,29
128,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,What would happen if they did not?,29
129,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"They would lapse. As. honourable members are aware, there have been occasions when schedules have not been ratified, and a bill* has had to be rushed through to validate them before an whether honourable members, with the rates or not. This will ensure that the consideration of schedule* will not be allowed to remain in abeyanceyear after year. That principle, I think, can generally be approved. This is essentially a committee bill, and I urge honoror able members to expedite its passage.",29
130,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Y a r r a ) [2.20] - To the first two principles, no objection can, 1 think, be taken. Certainly, the first t point ought to have been cleared up long ago. While in London as Prime Minister, I attended a meeting of manufacof turers. I was then informed by one gentleman that he could not qualify for proBritish preference because he used Australian wool in the manufacture of his A articles, as it was not regarded as a took p l a c British product.",29
131,Mr GKEGOKY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,The right honourable .gentleman amended that provision years ago.,30
132,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I believe that we - brought down an amendment, but I do not think that it was passed. The present Comptroller-General of Custom* .agreed that an anomaly existed, and the matter was placed on the stocks to be - dealt with. It was never contemplated that any British manufacturer who used Australian raw material should be prevented from qualifying for British preference. I raise no objection to the proposal 4o substitute regulations for proclamations, upon which a discussion took place - some time ago, although I apprehend - certain difficulties. I recognize that there is involved the principle of the right of Parliament to have a voice in the matter at the earliest possible moment The third proposal involves considerably more than the second. It is that - tariff schedules must pass into law within --3ix months of their having been tabled, or lapse. Under normal conditions, it might be proper to provide that the Parliament shall have an opportunity to either accept or reject a tariff - schedule within six months. I point out, however, that we are living in abnormal - times at present. All over the world, there are movements which are aimed at - the development of the industries of - different countries with a view to dealing with the unemployment problem. They --are not directed against Australia or any other country as an act of retaliation ""because of high tariffs, but they are having repercussions in every country, and Australia must be ever ready to meet whatever situation may arise. Tberefore, the greatest elasticity must be allowed to whatever administration is in power.",30
133,Mr WHITE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I propose to bring down A special bill to deal with the international - situation.,30
134,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The necessity might - suddenly arise to protect Australia against the dumping of goods produced in other countries, proof of which is not available. It is known that today one - nation is adopting extraordinary methods to place its goods in other parts of the world. I have read an address that was delivered by Major Douglas, in which ho claimed that Japan had put the Douglas credit theory into operation, but upside down. His explanation was that Japan was utilizing the national credit to subsidize the manufacture of goods with a view to capturing the markets of other countries. That explains many things that it has been difficult to understand. Manufacturers have shown me articles, the cost of the raw material used in which, they have assured me, has been as much as the articles could be sold for if labour had not to be paid for. Therefore, there must be an explanation apart from the question of cheap labour. I received a letter today from rubber workers in my constituency who recently were thrown out of work because a number of the stores are being filled with imported balloons against which it is impossible for the local article to compete. The balloons are not branded ""Made in Japan,"" but they are landed in Australia so cheaply that they can be sold at a very low figure. Serious developments might arise almost on the eve of the rising of Parliament, when it might uot be possible to have a tariff schedule passed. Parliament always has control over its own affairs. If it does not wish a schedule to lie on the table for a longer period than six months, it can decide to deal with it. I know that honourable members have in mind schedules that have been unratified for a number of years.",30
135,Mr GREGOEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Pou r years.,30
136,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"A schedule that was brought down by the Bruce-Page Government lay on the table for about twelve months during its administration, and for the whole of the period that my Government was in office. During the war period schedules lay on the table for as long as three years. I venture to affirm that had this suggested provision been in operation during the war it would have been found necessary to repeal if. If it is now agreed to, Parliament will be forced to repeal it whenever special circumstances arise. After all, the protection of Australian industry is of the greatest importance to the development and the life of this country. What is wrong with leaving it to the Parliament itself to determine when schedules shall be dealt with? This would not confer upon the Parliament any wider power than it now possesses. The only argument that can he advanced against my contention is that the House of Representatives would he able to determine of itself, without the Senate having any say, as to when schedules should be passed into law. I am most reluctant to agree to the proposal without having given the matter a good deal more consideration, and without being furnished with greater justification for it than has been advanced by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White). I have no objection to the measure being taken to that stage in committee. I ask, however, that we be given the week-end to consider the effects of this amendment, which I contend has been sprung on the House.",30
137,Mr GREGORY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Swan) [2.28] - The questions raised by this measure have been before the Parliament for many years, and I am gratified at the intention of the Government to amend the act in certain directions.

Eor more than four years taxation has been imposed upon the people without the approval of Parliament. I am satisfied that the Leader of the Opposition does not, in principle, agree with that. Parliament should approve of any taxation that is imposed. One House only has not the right to say that a section of the community shall be taxed. If the Government of the day had a majority in both Houses of Parliament it would be easy for it, should the necessity arise, to bring in special legislation to overcome any fault that may be found in this measure. The Government of the day should not be absolutely dominant and able to impose a tax upon the people without the approval of the Parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative.

140,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Darling Downs) [2.34] - I understand that the object of this provision is to substitute the word ""regulation"" for ""proclamation"" in section 112. I hope that the Minister has carefully considered the effect of this amendment upon the administration of the Customs Department in the way of elasticity. I do not think that it can be said that any serious trouble has arisen in the past. Section 112 contains certain provisions which do require action, to be taken by proclamation. He must bear in mind the need for action in emergencies.",31
141,Mr GREGORY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"That deals mostly with military matters. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - Eve n in those matters the administration should be left to executive action rather than to regulation.

SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 26th May, 1933, (vide page 1965), on motion by",32
152,Mr STEWART,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Tliat the bill he now read a second time.,33
153,Mr HOLLOWAY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Melbourne Ports) [ 2..""iJ j - The object of this bill is to bring Australia into line with other maritime countries which have signed the International Conventions relating to seagoing vessels. The first international conference on this subject endeavoured to secure uniformity among the big maritime countries in regard to methods of surveying, load line provisions, and examination of vessels generally. It was desired that all vessels should be thoroughly examined on a uniform basis in every country in order to ensure, to the greatest possible extent, the safety of persons travelling by sea, whether as passengers or as crew, and also the safety of property 'transported by sea. The Minister explained, in introducing the bill, that its purpose was to implement Australia's part as one of the signatories to the . Conventions. I am afraid, however, that if we pass the measure in its present form shall not achieve our objective. Fundamentally the basis of the Conventions is that everybody in the world engaged in seagoing operations shall be subject to uniform conditions. The Conventions are founded on the practice of the maritime section of the British Board of Trade and Lloyd's Register in Great Britain. If Australia is honestly to take its part as a signatory to the Conventions, it is under obligation to make sure that the practices of this country in regard to the matters involved are identical with those of other countries which have signed the Conventions. It is provided in the British legislation that the inspections and examinations shall be made by expert officers. The employment of engineer surveyors, ship surveyors, wireless surveyors and so on is specified in the legislation of other countries: which have implemented these Conventions; but there is no mandatory provision in this bill that the persons employed by our Navigation Department to do this work shall be thoroughly qualified in every respect. I fear, therefore, that persons may be employed who are not technically fitted to do the work. I wish not to attack the Minister or the bill, but merely to ensure that the c right thing shall be done. I can see a danger in the wideness of the terms of certain clauses of the bill. We should take all care to ensure that only thoroughly qualified persons are engaged in this important work. If we employ unqualified ' persons, other maritime countries, which are parties to the Conventions, will soon know of it and will not be willing to allow their ships to be examined by our officers. I suggest, therefore, that the language of the bill should be strengthened to provide that only qualified examiners shall be employed. Some of these Conventions have been in operation for nearly 50 years. There has, during this time, been a gradual change in the type of ships and the nature of their equipment. Other nations copied British procedure because they believed it to be the best,, and we ought to be the last to depart from it. The provisions in this bill differ altogether from those in the British act.. For instance, it is stated in the bill simply we that the ships shall be surveyed, but it is not stipulated that the persons who carry out the survey work shall bequalified to do so. I trust that the Minister will examine the matter from this angle, and : see that the men in his department possess the necessary qualifications. I am not casting any reflection on the men now engaged in the work; some of them may be qualified, while others may not have had an opportunity to pass the necessary examinations. It should be stipulated,, however, that men doing survey work should possess the qualifications laid down by Lloyds. I ask the Minister to see that the Australian act is on all fours with the British Merchant Shipping Act, which provides specifically that declarations-of survey shall he made by persons qualified to do the work. This applies to surveys of all parts of the vessel, including the engines and wireless installation.",33
154,Mr WATKINS,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Newcastle) [3.4] I also have had the case put before me by the Australian engineers. All they ask is that the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain shall be followed by this Parliament when amending the present Navigation Act in so far as it applies to the surveying of ships. Our act states that surveys shall be made by "" persons "", but does not state what qualifications those persons shall possess. The British Merchant Shipping Act in sections 2, 5, 9, 17, 46 and 53 indicates the technical - qualifications of the surveyors who are to be employed. The work of survey should not be left to unqualified persens who may have no knowledge of the intricate equipment which it is their duty to examine. Not only haa Great Britain provided for the survey of ships by qualified persons in regard to ship's engines, & c ; it has also brought its legislation Up to date by an amendment of 1932 which specifically deals with wireless installations. We are not opposing the bill as a whole, but we ask the Minister to make the alterations which have been requested. No one will be placed at a disadvantage thereby, and it will make for greater safety for those who have to go to sea. A ship's captain might be a very good authority on navigation, &c, but, as regards the safety of the ship at sea, the chief engineer occupies almost as important a position as the captain himself. We have been taught in the past to copy British legislation, and here is an excellent opportunity to put the lesson into effect. By failing to include the provision which has been asked for - we are placing ourselves .apart, from all other maritime nations of the world. 'The engineers are not seeking anything unreasonable when they ask for preference In regard to appointments for survey work.",34
155,Mr BEASLEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"West Sydney) [3.9]. - The bill now before the House provides for certain amendments recommended by international conventions, but it also affords an opportunity to the Minister *to accede to requests made to him by a deputation from the Marine Transport Council of Sydney, which waited upon him in Sydney on the 9th October, 1933. Replying to the deputation, the Minister statedThere has been no opportunity in recent years of considering general anuuidinente to these acts. Many requests for amendments have, however, been received, particularly in regard to the Navigation Act. If and when it is possible to introduce! amending bills full consideration will be given 'to the paints raised by the deputation. As the Navigation Act has yet to be amended to enable the Safety of Life at Sea Convention and the Loadline Convention to be ratified, I can see little prospect of a general amending bill being introduced in the near future.",34
156,Mr STEWART,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,It is not proposed in this Bill to re-open the whole Navigation Act; we merely propose to carry out our obligations under the Conventions.,34
157,Mr BEASLEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I take it, then, that the Minister does not propose to accede to the requests of the Marine Transport Council. It is. often very difficult to secure amendments regarding legislation which does not come prominently before a large section of the public. This bill is one that opportunity s offers for a general review of the Navigation Act, and should have been cordially welcomed. No douibt the International Conventions are important, but there is a responsibility on the Government to give effect also, in so far as is possible, to reasonable requests made by local organizations. I introduced the deputation which waited upon the Minister in October last, and, as it may be a long time before the Navigation Act is again before Parliament, I take this opportunity to put on record the requests made by the council on that occasion. They asked that section 1 should be amended by omitting the words, "" belonging to a ship registered in Australia "", and "" at any place in Australia "". Although the Navigation Act has jurisdiction only over vessels whose first port of clearance and port of destination are within the Commonwealth, it would be competent for a vessel trading on the coast, and registered oversea, to evade the provisions of section 132. That possibility is removed by the omission of the words I have quoted. If the last-mentioned words are allowed to remain, a vessel registered in Australia and observing Australian conditions, would be entitled to leave a seaman ashore at any port outside Australia, and deny liability. The omission of the words referred to would protect the seamen in this direction. It. is proposed that the words "" and medical expenses "" be inserted after the word "" agreement"" in the second line of sub-section 1 a. The reason given is that the medical expenses of the seaman are paid by the employer while he is being treated under the provisions of sub-section 1 b when left ashore a.way from his borne port. The maritime unions urge that he be treated similarly at his home port. In cases where such expenses were heavy, the major portion of the wages paid would be absorbed in this direction. A further proposal is that the word "" aud "" be substituted for the word "" or "" in the second last line. Under present circumstances, a certificate from either the Medical Inspector of Seamen, or his medical attendant, suffices. In many casus, this has had an adverse effect upon rhe seamen, as only a certificate from either of the persons I have mentioned is required, aud the employer is enabled to deny further liability. As a result of experience, it is claimed that the seaman is without adequate protection, and that, the certificate of recovery from the two medical men is essential. Provision is made for difference of opinion by the proposal that the present proviso to the sub-section be struck out, and the following substituted:Provided that, in eases where a difference of opinion arises as to the condition of the sen man, the matter shall be determined by reference to an independent specialist; able to both parties. It is further proposed that the proviso to sub-section 1 a be struck out, because it limits the payment of wages to a period governed solely by the duration of the articles of agreement. If the articles expire within one month from the date on which the seaman is left ashore, the payment does not exceed one month's wages. In all other cases, it is not to exceed three months, after which-in cases of accident, only-the seaman is brought under the Seamen's Compensation Act, which provides for a payment of 30s. a week. Ho regard is paid to the seriousness of the complaint or injury from which the seaman is suffering. If Mr Beasley. a seaman who is employed on a ship, the articles of which expire within one month from the date on which ho is left ashore at his home port, is seriously injured and incapacitated for a lengthy period, he receives only 30s. a week after the expiration of the month, whereas if he were landed away from his home port, he would receive wages, sustenance, and medical expenses up to the time of his recovery. This discrimination is not equitable, and it is respectfully urged that the anomaly should he remedied immediately. Tho next proposal is that the words "" and sustenance "" be inserted after the word ""agreement"" in sub-section lb. It is contended that, although it is usual for a. seaman, to be provided with sustenance while being treated under this sub-section, the provision should be clearly stated. The last suggestion is that paragraphs b and c of sub-section 5 be deleted. The opinion held is that the inclusion of a stated period before a claim can be made is bad in principle, and encourages the seaman to ensure that he is incapacitated for the period mentioned. The reference to the period of fourteen days has been deleted from the seamen's award. The inclusion of occupational diseases is also recommended. I have specifically referred to these suggestions and opinions in order that they may be recorded. It would appear that there is no possibility of having them considered in conjunction with the measure that is now before the House, despite the fact that the Minister for Commerce (Mr Stewart) stated in his letter to the accept- Secretary of the Maritime Council that an opportunity to deal with the act had not presented itself for many years. It is likely that a similar set of circumstances will prevail for the next few years, unless there is a change of government, at the forthcoming election. That is something to which these men will have to look forward because this is a matter in which the public generally are only indifferently interested. The Government has decided to shelve reform, and apparently leave alterations in abeyance for a considerable period-that is, of course, if they. remain in office. The maritime unions have prepared their case in a most capable manner. They supplied the Minister for Commerce with their suggestions practically twelve months ago. If the honourable gentleman has not had the time to devote to these question*, an officer of his department ought to have given attention to them. The Government has not acted rightly in having refrained from dealing with the local aspects of navigation now that the measure is before the House, but if the Minister is not prepared to make the amendments now, perhaps he may indicate his desire to take HCtion in the very near future. Such a nouncement would give some satisfaction to these men. As we are not able to take action ourselves, the best that we can do is to endeavour to encourage action on the part of those who have for the time being the necessary power and authority. As we have failed to obtain immediate action, we should like an assurance that there will"" not be very much delay in meeting the requests of the men whose whole lives are practically absorbed in the industry.",34
158,Mr STEWART,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Parramatta-Minister for Commerce) [3.22] - I am gratified at the general approval Of the purpose that underlies this measure. It would he surprising if any other attitude were adopted, because, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) has stated, the purpose of the bill is simply to bring Australia into line with the rest of the world by ratifying the obligation which it undertook in the maritime conventions of 1929 and 1930. The object of the conferences and of the conventions which followed them was simply the protection of life at sea. Fault has been found with only one phase of the proposals that are now before the House-the definition of ""surveyor."" There is no variation with respect to the requirements of the survey, but. there has been criticism of the fact that the measure does not make as specific a provision as is made by some other measures overseas. There is a reason for that, and it is not a sinister one. It is not the intention of the Commonwealth that there shall be the slightest laxity in the survey of our ships. So far from that being the case, Australia has shown the way to the rest of the world in. the matter of maritime legislation. We have not a greater number of amendments to make to our act to conform to our obligations under the conventions because to a large extent the provisions sought have been anticipated for a number of years. I am sorry that I am unable to accede to the request that has been made. It was formulated in very good temper and, .from the point of view of those who have made the representations, is not at all unreasonable. But the conditions prevailing in Australia are entirely different from pro- those obtaining in Great Britain, and thia makes necessary a greater degree of elasticity in our legislation than is needed in the corresponding legislation of Great Britain. Some of the survey work in Great Britain is undertaken by ship surveyors, who in Australia would be known as naval architects. Unfortunately, Australia has not yet reached in shipbuilding the position that would ensure the availability of this type of man for the survey of our shipping. It is because of the necessity for elasticity in our legislation that we prefer to allow the position to remain as it is provided for in the bill, and to be a little more specific in the regulations that will be issued under the act. An indication that the Board of Trade has no objection to the practice that we adopt in this regard is furnished by the fact that only recently it appointed two officers of my department to act as its representatives in Australia in the survey of certain passenger ships that voyage to international ports. One of the two officers is a nautical surveyor; yet it is against the class of work which such men undertake that most of the agitation that has been given expression today has been launched. ' The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) has complained that certain further amendments of the act have not been proposed in this measure. I am afraid that I cannot give him. a great deal of encouragement to believe that there is likely to be an immediate re-opening of the subject. Indeed, if some of the observations and the forecasts of the honourable gentleman may be taken seriously, a promise by me that the act would be further amended at an early date, would not prove very reassuring to his constituents. I am, however, prepared to give the undertaking that there is no intention whatever to limit the area of operation that is now enjoyed hy engineer surveyors. The regulations with which this bill will be implemented will retain to engineer surveyors their accustomed fields of survey, such as iron and steel hulls, machinery, engines, boilers and the like. I ask the House to pass the bill as drafted. When regulations are subsequently tabled, those who are interested will have the fullest opportunity to direct the attention of the legislature to any failure by me to redeem the undertakings that I have given.",36

160,Mr LYONS,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.31] - by leave I take this opportunity to express the great regret that the Government feels at the news of the death of Lady Northcote, the widow of the late Lord Northcote, who was Governor General of the Commouwealth from 1904 to 1908. Lady Northcote was a lady of great distinction, and both during her sojourn in Australia and in the years that have followed she endeared herself to a wide circle of Australian acquaintances and friends. Her house in London was ever open to visiting Australians, and her interest in our country remained fresh and vivid to the end. 1 know that the House will be with me when I say that her passing leaves a gap in the lives and memories of a great many people, and that we learn of it with great regret.",37
161,Mr SCULLIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Yarra) [3.32] - by leave- I desire to associate the Opposition with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). Lady Northcote played an important part with her husband when he was Governor General of Australia in the early years of federation, and a few years ago I , with my wife, had the privilege of renewing acquaintance with her in London when she kindly invited us to her home for a rest during the activities of the Imperial Conference. Unfortunately, our stay was too short to enable us to avail ourselves of the invitation. By her acts of courtesy she displayed her continued interest in the welfare of Australia. She told me on that occasion that she had never forgotten her stay in this country. She was a charming personality, and I am sure that the Australian people generally will deeply regret her death.",37
162,Mr MCNICOLL,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Werriwa) [3.35] by leave-On behalf of the members of the Country party I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). I had the privilege of knowing Lady Northcote, and I can state that she, like Lady Novar, after her return td Great Britain, was a great advocate for Australia, and a good friend to all Australians abroad. Lady Novar has, at all times, extended a warm welcome to visitors from Australia, and I know that on the walls of her house there is displayed a fine collection of Australian paintings. In her garden there is a beautiful growth of Australian trees and shrubs. Her library contains a large collection of current Australian newspapers. It has often been said that our Governors-General when they return to England are fine ambassadors for this country, and I can say truly that both Lady Novar and Lady Northcote have proved themselves to be fine ambassadresses. When Lady Northcote was in Australia she endeared herself to all Australians whom she met. In England she continued to show a lively interest in this country, and extended kindly hospitality to all Australians in London who were able to come into contact with her. The Country party combines with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) in expressing deep regret at the news of her death.",37

164,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Darling Downs) [3.40] - by leave- I feel gratified that the House has been given this opportunity to express it3 appreciation of the splendid work which Lady Northdid for Australia in her high capacity as the wife of a Governor General.

She, however, in traversed this Commonwealth carrying dignity and grace with her, symbolising the Australian ideal. Lord Northcote stands out as one of the greatest Governors-General of Australia, and his wife stands out as one who assisted to make his period of office so lustrous as it was.

165,Mr CASEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Corio-Assistant Treasurer) [3.45] - by leave- I associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), the Leader of Opposition (Mr Scullin), and other honourable gentlemen in regard to the late Lady Northcote. I had the privilege of her friendship for a good many years, and have much personal reason to regret her passing. She was, in the best sense of the word, a great lady of the old school, and representative of an era which is fast passing away. People of her type are little more than a memory to the to generation of today. I echo Prime Minister's statement that Lady Northcote's home was always open to Australians visiting London. When I arrived in London in 1924, as a rather obscure Australian civil servant, Lady Northcote was good enough to seek me out, and thereafter made my task much easier than it could otherwise have been by giving me frequent opportunities to meet at her house and at her table people prominent in both the governI mental and political l if e of Great Britain and also in the big public departments of the Old Country. Lady Northcote continued to do this for the five or years that I was in London, and through readsher kindly consideration to me, and through the contacts and friendships that I was able to make, my period of service in London was made easier and, I like think, more useful. Lady Northcote always interested in Australia, and she constantly inquired 'after the people she knew. She was also keen to inquire after arid follow the activities of our principal public institutions. I deeply regret that she has passed from among us. SUPPLYBILL (No . 1) 1934-35. Bill returned from the Senate requests. ADJOURNMENT. BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION-PETRO L COMMISSION-EAST-WES T RAILWAY : CANBERRA UNEMPLOYED-NORTHER N TERRITORY: LOSS OF SETTLERS' STORES - POSTALEQUIPMENT , HOBART. Motion (by Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [3.49] - Yesterday afternoon and again last evening I directed the attention of the the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) to the change in the bankruptcy administration of New South Wales that is to take place from next Monday, the 1st July. I wish again to emphasize that there is strong opposition in the commercial community in New South Wales to the proposed change. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the change was necessary in the interests of uniformity; but I pointed out him that the present official receiver the is working directly under the Attorney General, and must keep within the ambits of the act. The right honourable gentleman also said that a similar change was made in Queensland on the 1st July, 1933, and that there had been no opposition to it . I direct his attention to the report of the Attorney-General of June, 1933, with the object of supporting my contention that a similar change should not be inflicted upon New South Wales. t is stated in that report that in the , year 1932-33 the income from estates was £31,442, and the expenditure £30,886, leaving a profit of a little more than six £550; but a footnote to the statement No allowance made for claim of £1,164 17a. I d . made by Queensland Government for loss incurred by public curator. to The public curator had been acting for was the Commonwealth Government in this connection. The losses incurred by dealing with sequestrated estates in the way now proposed must be aggravated by the change-over that is imminent in New South Wales and Tasmania. It has been stated that no protest, has been made respecting the change-over in Tasmania. I point out that Tasmania was in the fortunate position of having had only 39 estates sequestrated in the period without August, 1932, to July, 1933. But the following notice in the Commonwealth Gazette of the 24th May, 1934, is ill u minating as indicating the expense that will be incurred in setting up this new department in Tasmania:ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Offices created - The undermentioned new ollices have been created in the Official Receiver's Section, Bankruptcy Branch, Tasmania, with limits of salary as indicated, ject to reduction in accordance with the FinanOfficial cial Emergency Act 1931-1933:-Officia l Receiver, Third Division, limits of salary of minimum £450, maximum £523; Clerk, Third Division, limits of salary of minimum £330, maximum £402; Clerk, Third Division, limits of salary of minimum £90; maximum £300; Typist, Fourth Division, Grade 2, limits of salary of minimum £234, maximum £242. Why should such great expense be i curred in order to deal with so few sequestrations? It must be realized that possibly quite a number of the 39 estates sequestrated in that State in the period to which I have referred may have redepartment. vealed no assets whatever. The income to be derived from this source in Tasbility mania cannot possibly cover the outlay in the setting up of this new Commonsystem wealth department. The same remark may be applied to New South Wales. I again draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the protests which have been made by the Sydney Chamber of merce, the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, the Retail Traders' Association, iand 'the Law Institute against this proposed change. The president the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, Mr A. Spencer Watts, wrote to the Acting Federal Attorney-General MCLachlan) on the 18th May, 1934, i the following terms:I confirm the telegram despatched to today, reading:-""Writin g today re proposed change in official receivership this State this Chamber opposes."" The council of Chamber, at. a meeting on the 16th instant, resolution, decided to enter a strong protest against the proposal of the Government appoint a salaried officer to take over work of the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy New South Wales. I trust that before any further action is taken in the matter, you will give this Chamber an opportunity of senting its case aud submitting to you very serious objections from the stand-point of the commercial community and taxpayers to the proposed change. The secretary of the Chamber of Manuwere factures of New South Wales, Mr Frank L. Edwards, wrote the following letter, [fi] dated 3ist May, 1934, to Mr C. F . W. Lloyd, the present official receiver, New South Wales:At a special meeting of the executive of the Chamber, held ou Tuesday, 29th instant, the following resolution was carried:-""That we protest to the Federal Government against the change in the system of Official Receivers in Bankruptcy in New South Wales, and against subthe proposed appointment on salary of an Receiver and staff for this State. We affirm that the trading community has every confidence that the existing system of payment by percentage is the best system and that it does not desire any change."" You are at liberty to use this resolution as you think fit. In view of the fact that these two protests have been supported by the Retail n - Traders' Association, and even by the Law Institute, I urge the Prime Minister to reconsider the whole position, and to confer with the commercial interests of Sydney before actually setting up the new Why should such a change be made? It can only mean increased liaby the Government. >and increased expense to the taxpayer. The existing of working through an official receiver operating on a percentage basis on the value of 'the work done, has been satisfactory for the last 60 or 70 years. I trust that my appeal will he favourably Comconsidered by the Government.",39
166,Dr MALONEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Melbourne) [3.56] Duty demands that I should direct public of attention to the iniquity that is being . done in Melbourne through the activity of what is known as the Royal Commis(Senator sion on Petrol. I ask how, in the circumn stances in which that commission is sitting, how even the angels of God could ensure that justice would be done to the you people of Australia. I attended a meetwhich ing of that commission recently, and this found nine legal gentlemen-mor e than by could sit around the table in the roomto watching the proceedings and fighting in the the interests of the oil combine, but I in did not see a single legal representative watching the interests of Australia. The prenine oil company representatives had the the right to cross-examine witnesses in the interest of their clients, but no one was present to cross-examine them in the interests of Australia. Those nine men led by the Attorney-General of Victoria, a man who with one hand takes honest government money for doing the work of the country, and with the other takes dirty oil combine money for fighting against his country. I used to respect the gentleman to whom I refer, but I can respect him no longer. Every consumer of petrol and oil in this country will Wonder why an Attorney-General should be allowed to take money in the form of fees from the oil combines in the circumstances in which he is doing. To luy mind it is a terrible thing. While I was in the room, the commission decided that it would continue its proceedings in camera. I suppose that this was done in order to. consider whether certain questions could be asked. I have known questions to be dodged or evaded by legal gentlemen in other connexions. I say that if a man who appears before a court of this country or a properly constituted legal tribunal refuses to answer questions which are asked in the interests of the country, he should be sent to gaol for a night to consider his position. If fuses to answer the questions in the morning, he should be sent to gaol for a week. If then he still refuses to answer the questions, he should be sent to gaol for a year. Such procedure., in my opinion, would solve all difficulties very quickly. When the commission sat in camera all the members of the general public, including myself, and also the representatives of the press, who are capable of giving publicity to the proceedings of bodv, were obliged to retire; but the nine legal luminaries remained in the room to consult with the commission. That, I consider, was infamous. I asked a well-known Melbourne magistrate how he would get on if he were obliged to dispause justice with nine barristers on one side and none on the other. He said, "" Doctor, it would be impossible."" So I think it is impossible for the people of Australia to get justice from this commission under those conditions. One of the prominent figures at the inquiry in Melbourne was Mr Erood, a man who, I believe, has been responsible for saving 'this country thousands of pounds in income taxation in connection with these combines. I have known him  who, for some time, was the representative in this House for Echuca, directed attention to this matter very many years Dr Maloney. ago, and I gave him a promise that if he brought it up in the House I would help him to fight the combine. Another gentleman who took the matter up was Mr Walter Marks, for some time the honourable member for Wentworth. On one occasion in this chamber he produced sworn declarations disclosing the methods of the oil combine to prevent the exploitation of the oil resources of Australia. He stated that when bores were down to a certain depth they were destroyed by dynamite or other means by paid emissaries of the foreign combines, with the result that those carrying out this work were discouraged from continuing. I do not say that all oil companies are linked together in this business. When Erance was in dire need, a proposal was made by interests backed by Standard Oil to buy the French Government tobacco monopoly for £200,000,000 in gold. The history of he re- many oil companies is punctuated by murders and suicides. It is impossible to say how many firms or private individuals have been ruined by these accursed business organizations. Mr. Rockefeller is now distributing largesse throughout the world. What he is doing suggests to me that, in his old age-h e is over 90 years old-h e is attempting to still the pangs of remorse by gifts to institutions in various countries. I hold this in my hand a list of men prominently associated with the combine in Australia. The first is Mr Burns. Where is he? Echo answers- "" Where ?"" Then there is Mr Darch. Where is he? Again echo answers-""Where? "" It is currently reported that not long ago he sacrificed for £15,000 a home which cost him £25,000. There are two others- Mr Bryers and Mr Comfort. Where are they? Once more echo answers- "" Wliere ?"" The information which Mr Marks gave to the House some years ago made it clear that Parliament, and not the Government alone, should deal with these combines. Honourable members should read a little of the history of Standard Oil. Many years ago, when Parliament was sitting in Melbourne, a gentleman connected with the company made a statement in South Africa to the effect that if the Australian Parliament would not let him have his way, he would buy up all the members. Evidently his opinion of their probity was not a very high one. Some months later, in Melbourne, I was introduced by the: late Mr. Randall Alcock, a well known merchant of Melbourne, to a clever and, as I thought, a courtly gentleman. I noticed that he evinced a desire to tajik about oil, so I told him at once that I had read so much about it that I hated the very word. Still he persisted and said, "" You must admit that the combine pays good wages and the people get a better article"". I told him plainly that I did not want to talk about it. Thereupon he asked, ""Well, what do you want?"" I replied, "" I ' l l eat with you and drink with you, and exchange pleasant conversation with you, but I will not talk about oil."" Theu, as he still pressed me on the subject, I said to him, "" Were you in South Africa some time ago ?"" When he informed me that be was, I asked, ""Are you connected with Standard Oil?"" He said, ""Yes"". I then said to him, "" Are you the gentleman who stated that if he could not get his way in Australia, he would buy up all the members of the Commonwealth Parliament? "" His reply was, "" I have been accused of that,"" whereupon, I said, "" Well, as far as I am concerned, I wish, the Standard Oil Company was in Hell and you with it . "" Cleverly, his answer came, ""Well, doctor, you must admit that if it were there, it would make a very fine blaze!"" At this juncture, Mr. Alcock, who had left us, returned, and said to me, ""Willie, why are you qnarrelling wdth my friend ? "" and he was man enough to say- "" The fault was entirely mine; the doctor has just told me that he would eat, drink aind talk with me, but he would not talk about o i l That man, I believe, eventually did. "" get"" two members of that Parliament; but I should add that, at the following election, they were defeated. One has since died. I hope that God will forgive him if, as was reported, he had been bought by the oil combine. I have spoken to Mr Frood, who appeared before the commission in Melbourne recently. From my knowledge of the man, there is nothing against him. I was unable to follow all the figures which he presented to the commission. I understand that he is an ex-soldier, and I suggest that when he was fighting for the people of Australia before the royal commission he was doing a much better work than was being done by the Victorian Attorney-General, who, as a legal luminary, takes money from both sides. I come now to Sir Charles Merrett, another gentleman who has been prominently before the public in connection with the inquiry by the petrol commission. I only wish that Mr Ham and Mr. Menzies were as highly respected by their friends as Sir Charles Merrett is by his. I do not know him personally, but 1I have never heard a single word uttered against him, and the fact that he appeared before the commission fighting against the unjust charges levied on the people of Australia by the oil combine entitles him to the respect of every member of this Par tion of the commission for several days. Besides giving voluminous evidence, he presented a petition containing 500 signatures of persons protesting against the operations of the combine, including university graduates, and asking that Mr. Pollock should be allowed to cross examine witnesses. I understand that he has sound technical knowledge of the oil business. Nevertheless, he was not allowed to cross-examine witnesses who appeared before the commission.",40
167,Mr SPEAKER,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Hon. G. H. Mackay). - Order ! I have listened to the honourable gentleman very attentively and I have reached the conclusion that he was proceeding to criticize, not only witnesses who appeared before the petrol commission, but also the royal commission itself, which has not yet completed its investigations. The honourable gentleman "" . has been sufficiently long in politics to know that it is unbecoming for an honourable member of this House to criticize any body so constituted, until its report has been presented to the House.",42
168,Dr MALONEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,I was only endeavouring to show how helpless the people of Australia are in the hands of the combine. I did not say a word about the commission itself.,42
169,Mr SPEAKER,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I heard what, the honourable gentleman was saying. 'His remarks concerning counsel and also some of the witnesses who appeared before the royal commission were couched in very strong terms. I , therefore, ask him to be more careful in his criticism of that body.",42
170,Dr MALONEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Ver y well, Mr. Speaker, I shall try to mend my ways; but I believe that the people of Australia are in agreement with me on this subject. I am sure that every purchaser of petrol is convinced that he is being treated unjustly by these high charges. The position could easily be remedied. If Parliament enacted a law to provide that the selling price of petrol in Australia should be the price charged in the country of origin, plus freight, duty, and reasonable distribution and administrative charges, there would be no complaint. Every one knows that unfair charges are being levied on the people by these combines. It has, I believe, been estimated that petrol users in Australia have been bled to the amount of £100,000,000 by excessive charges to provide unjust profits for the combines. A few weeks ago, I discussed this question in the press, and mentioned particularly the price of kerosene, stating that a profit of is. a gallon on the 36,000,000 gallons imported would provide an excess profit of £1,800.000 per annum. Kerosene can be landed in Melbourne at 5d. a gallon. If it were sold at lOd. a gallon, the profit would be about 100 per cent., whichshould be sufficient, and yet the selling price of kerosene in Melbourne is Is. lO^d. a gallon, and 2s. 3d. at Bendigo. A profit of Is. a gallon on 36,000,000 gallons would give an excess profit of £1,800,000 per annum. I regret that the Attorney-General "" of Victoria should, under privilege, have made such an attack on a Commonwealth public officer.",43
171,Mr SPEAKER,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"The honourable ber's time has expired.  sire to bring under the notice of honourable members, a matter which is of vital importance to South Australia, and which should be of interest, also to other of the country. I refer to the proposal of the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Perkins), to transfer 100 men from berra for employment at Port Augusta on ballasting and sleepering the West railway. This may be an exfoodstuffs cellent idea so far as the Canberra unconsigned employed are concerned, but I remind the Minister that there is a tremendous amount of unemployment in South Australia also. In the town of Port Augusta alone there are 160 men in receipt of government unemployment relief, and, no doubt, there are others out of work who have not yet put themselves upon the relief scheme. Throughout the whole of South Australia, the percentage of unemployment is probably as great as, if not greater tha.u, that for the Commonwealth as a whole. In the circumstances, it is a ridiculous proposal to transfer men from Canberra to a State that is already burdened with the problem of finding employment for its own citizens. It should be pointed out, moreover, that South Australia does not derive much benefit from the expenditure of Commonwealth loan money on works such as this. It was known in South Australia that this work would have to be done in the near future, and it was hoped that, during the carrying out of the three-years plan, employment would be found for South Australian citizens. Many of those out of work were looking iorward to tbU opportunity to obtain employment. J do not make a habit of grumbling about State disabilities, but one of the last things I had to do before the adjournment of Parliament in December, was to complain of the action of the Commonwealth Bank authorities in bringing stone from New South Wales to Adelaide for building purposes, when excellent stone was available in South Australia. That may have been a small matter, but the principle involved in this proposed transfer of unemployed men is of the greatesi importance. I earnestly appeal to the Government to make an effort to meet the memsituation in some other way.",43
172,Mr NELSON,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Northern Territory) [4.17] - Quite recently, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) and I were in the Northern Terriparts tory, and, while we were at Darwin, a fire occurred in the railway bond stores, resulting in the. loss of large quantities Canof foodstuffs, and in damage to government property estimated at £8,290. Th<= Eastshed was used for the storage of and such like commodities by rail to persons living in the hinterland of Darwin. When goods of that kind arrive at Darwin, they are taken possession of, while still in the ships' slings, by the railway authorities, and stored until forwarded by rail. The consignee is not given the option of appointing his own receiving agent. The goods in question were the first which had arrived at Darwin since the wet season, and honourable members must know that during that season it is impossible to transport goods to the outback places. The result was that many of the consignees were relying on this shipment for practically a year's supply of stores, and now those stores have been destroyed.* I asked the Minister who was responsible for the loss of the goods, which had been taken arbitrarily under the control of the Commissioner for Railways, and I was informed that under by-law No. 21, made in pursuance of powers conferred by the Commonwealth Railways Act, the Commissioner was not liable for the loss. The settlers in the north have been having a very bad time due to dwindling markets, &c, yet they will not receive one farthing's indemnity for the loss they have sustained. I suggest that when the by-law was framed, it was meant to refer to goods in transit on the railway, and not to those iri store at the waterfront. It is estimated that the value of the goods lost was approximately £20,000, and it is not right that the Railway Department should refuse all compensation. Many consignees whose supplies were destroyed were not in a position to order more, and, consequently, their position is hopeless. Surely the Government cannot expect the Northern Territory to be effectively settled if it does not recognize its sibility to those who are already settled there. Accompanied by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports inspected the bond store, which is a building about one half the isize of this chamber, where we found foodstuffs and other goods stored with matches, kerosene, benzine and other inflammable goods. Such an arangement would not be permitted in any other part of Australia. Although thousands of pounds worth of goods were stored in the building the department was too niggardly to employ a night watchman to assist in protecting them.",43
173,Mr RIORDAN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,Why did not the Government insure the goods1,44
174,Mr NELSON,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"They can be insured only up to the time at which they leave the ship's slings. The department would have to protect the goods while under the control of the Railway Department, but. apparently it assumes no responsibility while they are in the bonded store. On behalf of those who have suffered so seriously, I earnestly appeal to the Minis assist those unfortunate consignees who cannot finance themselves, and to do the fair thing by recompensing them for the losses they have incurred while the goods were under its control.",44
175,Mr HUTCHIN,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Denison) [4.23] - I wish to make a strong plea on behalf of the aged and infirm. I am glad that  is temporarily in charge of the House, because I know that he will sympathize with me in the case which I wish to bring under his notice. The aged and infirm, to which I refer, are the vehicles in use by the Postal Department at Hobart, and which are employed in connection with the maintenance of telephone lines and other matters incidental thereto. These vehicles seem to be in the last stage of their existence and have to submit to severe tests in running up and down the hills in the vicinity of Hobart. The use of such old vehicles must result in a loss of efficiency in connection with the work of the department, and their retention from the angle of efficiency would not be sanctioned by those engaged in private enterprise. The Postal Department should maintain its equipresponment in the same manner as any other business concern. During the depression some of the equipment, and notably those I vehicles in use at Hobart, have been allowed to get into a state of disrepair; but the time has now arrived when the department should take stock of the situation and make the necessary renewals. I can see no justification, by comparison with other activities, particularly those controlled by private concerns, for keeping in use such equipment. The maintenance costs must be heavy and must result in inefficiency as well as engender dissatisfaction in the minds of those who have to operate them. I bring this matter forward in the hope that the Postmaster General will immediately make provision for the necessary repairs or renewals to be made.",44
176,Mr STACEY,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Adelaide) [4.25] When the honourable member for Boothby  under the impression that 100 men were being sent from Canberra to work on the East-West railway, and that no South Australians were to be engaged. Unfortunately, the honourable member was not present last night when the Minister for  addition to the 100 men to be sent from Canberra, possibly 200 men were to be selected in South Australia. I understand that the amount originally allocated for the work was £60,000, but I believe that it has now been increased to over £200,000, thus making it possible to provide work for 300 men over a period of three years. When the position is fully explained I am sure that my South Australian colleagues will agree with me that it is only right that the work should be proceeded with. It has also been said that unnecesfor sary cost will be involved in transporting men from Canberra to Port Augusta, and possibly in returning them here, but I understand that it is proposed to ask the men to repay the cost of their travelling expenses over a period of twelve months. When these facts are taken into consideration I think honourable members will agree with .me that it is better that 200 men resident in South Australia should be provided with work rather than that the whole scheme should be dropped.",45
177,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Warringah-Postmaster-General ) [4.28] 1 know something of the agitation going on, particularly in New South Wales, in connection with the bankruptcy arrangements mentioned by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison). I can assure the honourable member that the representations he has made will be taken into consideration by the Attorney General (Mr Latham). The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) is under a misapprehension as to the manner in which the royal commission on petrol is being conducted. The honourable member said that the Commonwealth has not a legal representative on the commission, but I may inform him that the chairman of the commission is Mr Lamb, K . C , an eminent legal authority. In addition, the commission has the assistance of Mr Bowie-Wilson, an experienced barrister who is now occupying the position held by Mr Russell prior to his appointment to the Victorian judiciary. In these circumstances, the commission is quite capable of carrying on important work on which it is engaged. I say nothing with regard to the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) respecting the different persons whose names he mentioned. I do not consider that he should have adopted the course that he followed, and, in the circumstances, do not propose to reply to his attack. The matter referred to by the honor and the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) was fully discussed last night, and the Minister for the Interior  tention of the Government.

179,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I believe that the period will extend to three years. The Minister for the Interior has informed me that, in view of the protests that have been made and the views that have been expressed by honourable members, the matter has been re-considered, and the money which - was to have been set aside for the employment of these men will now be expended in Canberra, where they will be retained. The Minister for the Interior considers that he made last night a f u ll statement upon the matter that was raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson).",45
180,Mr NELSON,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,That is quite wrong. He did not make a statement; he answered a question.,45
181,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I have been asked to inform the honourable member that the additional facts mentioned by him this afternoon will be taken into consideration by the Minister for the Interior. I assure the honourable member for Denison, (Mr Hutchin) that the fullest consideration will be given to the question of effecting renovations to trucks and vehicles utilized in the work of the post-office in the Hobart area. There is, doubtless, some foundation for the attitude adopted by the honourable member. During the years of the depression, the post-office has been reluctant to renew any vehicles or equipment which could be serviceably employed, the object boing to avoid undue expenditure. with the honourable member that, in yiew of the uplift that is taking place in all sections of postal administration, the time has now arrived when a certain amount of expenditure is really warranted in order that a much greater outlay upon renewals may be avoided at a later stage.
