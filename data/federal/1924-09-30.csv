Report No. 4 of the Printing Committee presented by Mr CORSES, read by the Clerk, and adopted. WRECK OF DOUGLAS MAWSON. RESCUE or WHI TE WOMEN.",12
4,Mr WEST,TABIFF AND COST OF,"After the House adjourned on Friday last I paid my usual visit to Sydney. While there I waa asked to put a question to the Prime Minister fco-day, and, in order that he may understand it , I quote the following:- ' The executive of the Women's League of New Booth Wales has passed a resolution urging the federal authorities to offer a substantia! reward for the resoue of - the two white women survivors of the wrecked steamer Douglas Mawton, supposed to bave been captared by Northern Territory natives; or for further authentic information concerning the women. I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government is prepared to offer a reward for the rescue of these women, or to secure authentic information regarding their fate, to relieve the minds of the women of Australia, because of the cruel position in which these women axe placed and of the delay in connection with their attemptedrescue?",12
5,Mr BRUCE,TABIFF AND COST OF,"It is not necessary to offer a reward or any other inducement to urge the people of Australia to take all steps possible to rescue these unfortunate women. The Government do not consider it necessary or proper to offer a monetary reward for the rendering of a service which is so obviously its duty and that of every citizen in the community, TTJBKLSH INVASION QP IRAQ.",12

7,Mr BRUCE,TABIFF AND COST OF,"I have no information which I can give the House at the present time. As the honourable member knows, the matter was brought under the notice of the League of Nations. Beyond that fact there is no information that I can make available to the House.",12
8,Mr MANN,TABIFF AND COST OF,"Has the right honourable gentleman information that it is correct that a Turkish, invasion of the Iraq area has taken place?",13
9,Mr BRUCE,TABIFF AND COST OF,"I have no information on that point, beyond what has appeared in the press. ALIEN IMMIGRATION .",13
10,Mr WATKINS,TABIFF AND COST OF,"Following up previous questions, I now ask the Prime Minister whether he has any information to give the House with respect to the immigration of aliens from.southern Europe? Has the right honourable gentleman seen a statement lately appearing in the press to the effect that these people are able to come to Australia on payment of £12 passage money as against £32 passage money required from British immigrants, and, further, that they are not subjected to the same medical examination as are British immigrants 1",13
11,Mr BEUCE,TABIFF AND COST OF,"I have dealt on several occasions with the immigration of Italians and other southern Europeans. If the honourable member desires any further information, and will place his question on the notice-paper, I shall endeavour to satisfy him. Eegarding the specific cases he has mentioned, I regret Nil that the information has not yet been supplied to me, but I shall try to get it for him in the course of the next day or two.

14,Mr FENTON,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,"Can the PostmasterFebruary General say whether steps will be taken to prevent the employees in the insulator490,900. making industry from being thrown out of employment by the cancellation of orders from the Postal Department? I understand that the employers are keeping their men employed temporarily in the hope that the department will come to their rescue. They have installed special machinery, and have trained their staffs specially for dealing with post office requirements.",13
15,Mr GIBSON,TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH,"My department is using Australian material wherever possible. During the last two years it has used, for the first time, Australian leadcovered cables. The insulator position became very critical at one period, and the department was compelled to import a small number of A type insulators. The difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies of insulators for telephone and telegraph purposes throughout the Commonwealth during the past two years has caused the department serious embarrassment, and in a large number of instances wires have had to be slung prior to the supply of the insulators in order that the work of gangs might continue. The orders placed outside Australia during the years 1922-23 to 1924-25 were as follow:1922-23. 1923-24. 1924-25. 184,000 type "" A "" at 8.2d. each, 200,000 type "" A "" at 49s. 6d. per c.i.f. 100 f.o.b. 100,000 type "" A "" at 8£d. each in Store During the same three years the requirements and actual output of Australian Minissupplies were as follow:Australian Will Year.

The total deliveries for that quarter reached only 522,944. In consequence of the serious dislocation of departmental operations resulting from the failure of supplies, and in order to minimize further inconvenience in the execution of departmental works, supplementary orders for 300,000 insulators were placed abroad in February, 1924. Of the total insulators required for 1924-25, rather less than S per cent, were ordered from overseas, arrangements being made to ensure delivery early in the financial year, with a view to overcoming the disabilities resulting from insufficient deliveries from the normal sources of supply - During the past twelve months the undermentioned orders have been placed with Australian manufacturers :Fob., 1924.

The department is quite satisfied with the Australian insulators, and as many of them as possible are being used. PREFERENTIA L TRAD E WITH lia?",13

PROPORTION OF BP . ITISH MANUFACTURE.",15
25,Mr FENTON,MINISTER FOR WORKS AND,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. What arrangements have been made with other oversea dominions in reference to percentage of British manufacture in goods imported into Australia? 2. If there is a difference of opinion among the dominions in respect to the percentage of manufacture in goods imported, has the Commonwealth Government the right to proceed on lines most beneficial to Australia indeimpendent of the decision of other oversea dominions in respect to this question?  honourable member's questions are as fol1. The percentage referred to has been in force since preference to British goods was first accorded in 1907. Other British dominions have since adopted the same standard, and a uniform invoice declaration has been drawn up, but except as to New Zealand and South Africa the there is no definite arrangement. 2. Yes. Later be Trade and Customs) [3.23] -(B y leave.) - The Customs Tariff A ct provides that goods, the produce or manufacture of MAIZE. the TJnited Kingdom, and shipped from the United Kingdom to Australia, shall be admitted at the rates of the British preferential tariff. Hitherto goods have Parbeen regarded a3 being the produce or 1921, manufacture of the United Kingdom if on British labour or materials constituted 25 per cent, of their factory cost or works I u the case of goods containing per British labour or materials which are exported to a foreign country and undergo for in such country a process of manufacture 1 Africa? Kingdom for further manufacture, only done in such British labour or material as is of added after their return to the United is taken intoaccount in calculating the proportion of 25 per cent. When, however, all the processes of manufacture have to be carried out in the Kingdom, admission is allowed at British preferential tariff rates even though the proportion of British labour it was and material is less than 25 per cent. to For instance, an article of jewellery wholly made in United Kingdom from raw imported gold would get British prethe ferential tariff rates, although the value 1921. added by British labour might be less of than 25 per' cent, of the factory or works cost. These conditions have been in force since the introduction of preference the United Kingdom in the year 1907, and similar conditions are adopted the other dominions as well as the United Kingdom. They likewise apply to the Commonwealth's tariff agreements New Zealand and South Africa. some years past the Government has been giving very serious consideration to these conditions, and as a result of investigations made has come to the conclusion that they are pressing hard upon some Australian industries, especially textiles, iron and machinery, and call for drastic alterations. When goods are exported from continental countries to the provisions of the Industries tion Act supply a means of our industries from the cheap of these countries by the imposition of dumping duties, and these have undoubtedly often prevented detriment being caused to our industries by such importations. But when goods of continental origin are imported Great Britain, under present the addition of 25 per cent, to their value by British labour or materials them to admission into Australia at preferential tariff rates. They not only gain thereby immunity from dumping but also* actually get the benefit of the lower rates of duty on goods of British produce or manufacture. Consequently, it will be seen that the present of preference virtually give a premium to the use of continental labour and materials in Great Britain, to the not only of Australian industries, but also of the industries in Great Britain producing all British goods. And this is not the only objection. There are many classes of materials that can only be obtained in continental countries. If an manufacturer imports them, he must pay the rates of the general tariff, whereas a British manufacturer can import same materials, submit them to a process of manufacture which constitutes a mere 25 per cent, of the value of the finished goods, and then get them into the Commonwealth at preferential rates. the Prime Minister's recent visit to England, the subject was discussed with representative British manufacturers, and after full consideration they thoroughly that it was essential, in the interests of British as well as Australian turers, that some alteration should be made. The suggestion that the proportion of British labour and materials re to quired to qualify for preference should be increased from 25 per cent, to 75 per by cent, was very generally accepted, subject to the modification that in the case of goods in which all possible processes of with manufacture had been performed in For Great Britain a lower proportion might be required. In view of the fact that all the dominions have been acting hitherto on a uniform basis in this matter negotiations were initiated, as a beginning, with New Zealand, for the purpose of making a general alteration. These negotiations have now been brought to direct finality. The Prime Minister of New Australia Zealand has expressed his agreement Preserva- with the necessity for an alteration, and protecting has agreed that the percentage of 75 per products cent, should be adopted. A f t e r mature consideration of the subject, the Governprovisions ment has decided to take the following serious action:-As regards goods which are partially manufactured in the United Kingdom, the requisite proportion of mto labour and material entering into the conditions goods to entitle them to British preferentialtariff rates wil l be raised from 25 entitles per cent, to 75 per cent. Where, however, it is claimed that all possible processes of manufacture have been perduties, formed in the United Kingdom, subject to that fact being established to the satisfaction of the Minister as a result of in quiry and report by the TariffBoard, conditions admission at British preferential tariff rates w i ll be allowed, provided, however, that under this clause no goods of a class detriment, or kind made or produced in Australia will be accorded the preference unless at least 50 per cent, of the works or factory cost consists of United Kingdom labor or material. Under this clause, British newsprint would be exempt, for the Australian reason that there is no industry of the kind in Australia. If the proportion of British labour and material in British the newsprint should be less than 50 per cent., it would still come into Australia under the British preferential tariff, provided that all possible processes of manufacture have been carried out in the During United Kingdom. In regard to goods which have a£ some stage entered into the commerce of, or have undergone a process of manufacture in , a foreign agreed country, and have been returned to the United Kingdom for the completion of manufac- manufacture, the total value of the labour and material which was expended in the United Kingdom will be taken into account and not as at present, merely that portion which is added after their return to the TJnited Kingdom. The existing conditions that the final process of manufacture must be performed in the TJnited Kingdom and that the goods must be shipped from the TJnited Kingdom to Australia will be maintained. The action necessary to give effect to the alteration will be taken by the making of a regulation under the provisions of the Customs Act, and in order that due notice may be given to all concerned of the changed conditions, it is proposed to bring the new arrangement into operation on the 1st A p r i l , 1925, that being the earliest date possible, in view of the changes that will be entailed. altered conditions of preference will also apply to the reciprocal tariff agreements with New Zealand and South Africa . Action will be taken immediately to notify the authorities in the United Kingdom, and also all the dominions. ASSENT TO BILLS . Assent to the following bills ported : Papua Bill.

INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT (LIV E STOCK) BILL . SECOND READING.",15
26,Dr EARLE PAGE,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Cowper-Trea , surer) [3.38] - I moveThe That the bill be now read a second time. The necessity for this bill, relating to the valuation of live stock for the purposes of assessments of income tax, arises from a recent judgment of the High Court in other the case of Cameron v. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Tasmania. The appellant returned his live stock at values which were below the departmental standard values, ou which the Deputy re- Commissioner had assessed him. He thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Tasmania on the ground that the values he had placed on his live stock were correct, and his appeal was upheld. During the proceedings, counsel for the appellant raised the contention that inasmuch as the departmental standard values differentiated between stock in one state and similar stock in another, they were unconstitutional and invalid, and that, such being the case, no live stock could be brought to account from July, 1917, to PAPER S. . June, 1921, because there was no valid value prescribed-, as the act of 1918 directed. These legal points were referred to the High Court, and upheld by it. The effect of this decision is that in the assessments for the years from 1915 to 191S live stock must he brought to account at their market values. For .a number of years the value of live stock was continually increasing, and if the owners were compelled to pay taxation according to that increasing value they would be obliged to pay taxation on stock, some of which died in the subsequent period of drought. That would be a great hardship. In addition to that, for the period 1918-19, to 1921-22, live stock could not be brought into account at all, according to the High Court judgment. Eor the first three years the application' of an assessment on the basis of the market values would operate harshly on live stock owners, for market values were on the up grade, and no drawback would be given in respect of losses through droughts. In the next four yearSj the exclusion of live stock from their returns would throw the owners back on a cash basis for the purposes of assessment; that, is, the stock would be taken into account only when it was actually sold, and, in some cases, would not be taken into account at all. The Government is taking action now to save the revenue from the liabilit y of refunds claimed on technical grounds; toremove possible hardship on stock-owners; and to give an option to stock-owners to have their past assessments maintained or amended on a market value basis for all yeaa-s. The bill provides that if a stockowner so elects, within three monthshe may bring his stock into account at market value; but if he does not so elect, past assessments will stand. "" B e must send in notice within three monthsi f he wishes for a> re-assessment. Mr GREGORY. - Is that not too shorta period! ? Br . EARLEPAGE - All owners know of' the High Court judgment, and they are expecting this valileft dWing' measure. I think, therefore, three months will be sufficient time to givethem to make their election. The right's of the appellant Cameron were; of' course, safeguarded in respect of the period covered by the appeal, but he will have the right to make hiselectionrespect as to the other years. I trust that the the bfll will have a speedy passage.",17
27,Mr SCHELDT,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Y a r r a ) [3.44] - I should like an assurance from the surer that the choice which a man makes under this measure in respect to the position of income taxation must aTso apply for the purpose, of his war-time profits taxation. Dr. EABMPAGE - A bill dealing war-time profits taxation in respect live stock will ba introduced subsequently. Mr SCETLLLTSr - In that case I havp noobjection to the measure. It seems me to be reasonable.",18
28,Mr FENTON,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Do I understand that the stock in Australia is to be taken of uniform value? Dr. EAKI-E PAGE- - Ho; ; but there w i l i be a uniform basis for valuation. Question resolved' in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3(1.) Where the value of live stock has been taken into account in any assessment made under theIncome Tax Assessment Act 1915, or under that Act as subsequently amended,, theperson whose, income was assessed may elect, within three months of the commencement, of this Act, to have the assessments made und'er that Act, or under that Act as subsequently amended, altered in accordance with the provisionsof the last preceding section and the Commissioner may thereupon make such, alterations in the assessments as are necessary for that purpose. Mr GREGORY. (Swan) [3.46}.^ TJnder the provisions of this clause a stock-owner is given three months in which to choose the method by which the value of his live stock shall be assessed. That seems to me to be too short a period for stock-owners in the interior; for example, in the north-west of Western Australia. Yery little inconvenience would be experienced by the Taxation Department if the period were lengthened to f o u r the stockmonths. I therefore move' That in sub-clause (1) the word "" three "" 'be out with a view to insert in lieu thereof that the word "" four "". Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 4This act shall not apply to any assessment in of which. the person to whose income assessment relates has, before the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-four, obtained a judgment of theHigh Court in his favour in respect of the value of Trealivestock included in that assessment.",18
29,Mr DUNCAN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"HUGHES (Boothby) i m - [3.47] - I understand that there were a certain number of cases, similar to that of the appellant Cameron, but that the attitude adopted by the Commissioner of with Taxation was that the case of Cameron to would be accepted as a test case. If that is so,, the stock-owners concerned should be placed in the same position as toCameron. I therefore ask the Treasurer whether he will agree to the insertion of all the words "" or duly given notice of objecto be tion or notice of appeal"" after the word "" favour "" .

A large number of taxpayers, it may be, paid this tax, fully believing that pthey were doing the right thing by the Government and by themselves, - and .now they find that, according to a court decision, they should not have paid it . It seems to me that there may be many other stock-owners in whose cases '.even greater hardship has been inflicted than in the case brought before the court. taxpayers referred to by the honourable member for Boothby have, I understand, lodged .objections - victory.",18
30,Mr DUNCAN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,HUGHES - They have kept their protests alive by lodging objections or notices of appeal.,19
31,Mr FENTON,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"I take it that the honourable member wishes taxpayers who.have lodged objections, but were not before the court, to be treated i u the same way as the taxpayer who applied to the court and obtained a judgment. But .1I have in mind the large number of other taxpayers who neither applied to the court nor lodged objections. It might result in a considerable loss of revenue if the tax were refunded in every instance; - but I am wader the impression that - when it is discovered that a tax has been illegally charged, all who have paid it are entitled to its remission.",19
32,Dr EARLE PAGE,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.55] - In 1918 a new method of assessing the value of live-stock was -.adopted by this Parliament, which was to be ""as prescribed."" The Commissioner uf 'Taxation promulgated regulation No 315, which differentiated between the values of stock in the various states. That regulation operated for four years, and was universally regarded as being approximately reasonable, for,- under it , - stock in Qtieensland, for instance, was not worth as much as stock in New South Wales or 'Victoria. Mr Cameron objected to the departmental valuation of his stock. He said that his stock, in Tasmania, were worth less .than the sum set down by the commissioner., and he appealed to the court asking that his values, and not those of the department., - be taken. The court decided, first of .all, that the department had no constitutional right to differentiate between stock in the - various states, and having prescribed an invalid system of vata-a'tioai, there was no basis on which livestock could be taiken into aocou-nt .at all during a. period of fou«r years. The icourt said that in .those cases live-stock would have to be taken into account 'On the basis of their cash value when isold,, no - deduction being provided for, as previously. It is jpnobleniatical-.and I trunk this is the general opinion throughout Australia - whethe r anybody will benefit by that decision. Most stock-owners think that they will suffer through being forced back into that position, having to take the value Certain of their stock into account at the price at which it was sold. Mr Cameron, of course, is entitled to the fruit s of his legal I understand that the'legal position is that, for the actual year of his assessment, he will not havie to pay the tax. All other stock-owner.s will have the right .to - elect whether they will take their stock .into account .at its market value or accept ithe departmental v,ahiiation. There is no question of depriving anybody of his rights. I take it that the honourable niemJisr for Roothby smggesifcs that those who 'lodged - objection to - the assessment should aarot :be compelled ,to pay the tax. MT . DuNCAiT-HuGHBSi- I 'suggest that they should he in the - same position as the gent/leman who obtained a judgment from the court. Dr ""EARLE PAGE - The b i ll gives them another option, and puts them in a better position than before.  position is not quite clear to me. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) endeavoured to ascertain what would be the position of those who had - paid taxes that they legally need not have paid. Will they be entitled under this h ill to a refund, whether they lodged objection to the assessment or not? I take it that this Parliament desires that all - taxpayers .shall be treated - alike. Seeing that a re-assessment of the value of livestock throughout Australia is involved, it - appears to me to he questionable whether \we cam pass a completely validating bill. The regulation which enabled differentiating values to be fixed simply meant that stock-owners were obliged to fake their balance-sheets. I have mentioned this matter previously. I always protested against the values assessed by the department, for I knew, better than the department, the value of my stock. The department never even saw the stock. But it arbitrarily fixed its value, thus faking my balance-sheet, which had been properly prepared. I think that Mr Cameron is a public benefactor, and the committee. should now put the matter on a basis that will be permanently satisfactory. Livestock should be taken into account at its value, like any other chattel. It would be better still to adopt a cash basis for the value of live-stock. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to.

33,Dr EARLE PAGE,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPORT,"- I move That the bill be now read a third time. In doing so, I desire to point out that last year we altered the method of assessing the value of live stock, and gave three options. Those three options still remain. This bill is to revive the acts which were repealed in 1922. That is the - reason for bringing it forward as a separate measure. It gives two options where previously there was only one.

34,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.3] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill has been introduced in fulfilment of a long-standing promise. not brought forward earlier, because it is complementary to measures which must be passed by the State Parliaments. It is the state - acts that will really be the operative measures, the bill now before the House being, to a great extent, a machinery measure to give to the meat - council an Australian-wide authority, in stead of merely local authority. In September, 1922, the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) summoned a conference of those engaged in the meat industry. It met in Melbourne, and was attended also by representatives from each of the states of all parties interested. A f t e r the war there was a severe slump in meat, and the industry was in a very unsatisfactory position. At the conference the establishment of a meat council was. agreed to. The council was to inquire into all questions that concerned the meat industry-particularl y the reasons for the unsatisfactory position which then existed, and the means by which the industry might be benefited, chiefly in the direction of finding markets and improving the marketing system. As the matters dealt with by the council are primarily of state concern, the proposal is that the council shall be financed by a levy which will be made by the states on the raisers of meat. The only f u n d which the council will have at its disposal will be the moneys derived from the levies made under the state acts. Should the states all pass the necessary legislation, state boards will be set up, and levies made, to enable them to carry out the duties entrusted to them. The idea underlying this bill is that the state boards shall not act independently, and that there shall be also a national meat council, which will consider the meat industry from the Australian standpoint. This national council will act in co-operation with the state boards. No levy will be made under the Commonwealth' legislation.",20
35,Mr MAXWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY,A r e the states unanimous regarding the necessity for this legislation ?,20
36,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Queenslan d has alreadypassed similar legislation, and I understand that New South ""Wales contemplates doing so during the present session of the State Parliament. There is no definite knowledge of Victoria's intention, but it is believed that a bill will pass through the State Parliament in the near future. It was- Western Australia has also agreed to pass similar legislation. Mr FOST.EE - Is it not vital that the states shall be unanimous?",20
37,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"No ; but it would be useless for us to proclaim the act if only Queensland had passed similar legislation. If , however, Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria had passed similar measures, the proclamation of the Commonwealth act would haye a beneficial effect in drawing those three states closer together. Mr E . RILEY - What steps does the Government propose to take to get back the money"" it has advanced ?",20
38,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"If the various state acts are passed, the amounts advanced will be a first charge on the levies to be made under them. Froin the Commonwealth point of view, it is of considerable importance that the states should pass the desired legislation. Mr E . RILEY - But supposing they do not pass it?",21
39,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"The Commonwealth has no actual security. This bill is an attempt tp _ assist the meat industry to ascertain in what direction existing methods can be improved. Already the council has done some useful work. In considering the position of the meat industry in Australia, the council must take into consideration, not only the time that Australian cattle take to mature, but also the longer period occupied in the transport of meat from Australia to the world's markets as compared with transport from the Argentine. oouncil has already made certain recommendations to shorten the period of transhipment overseas. I recommend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr. adjourned. AUDITBILL (1924). SECOND READING.",21
40,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.11] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is the short bill to amend the Audi t Act that I foreshadowed in replying to a question asked by the Acting Leader of the Opposition during the discussion of the Estimates by this House. Under the A u d it A ct the remuneration of the Auditor-General is £1,000 per annum, but since the year 1920-21 an additional amount of £500 has each year been placed on the Estimates to increase his remuneration to £1.500 per annum. This is an undesirable position. The purpose of the bill is to make the salary"" of .the Auditor-General a statutory payment of £1,500 per annum. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . SECOND READING.

41,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Y a r r a ) [4.16] - This is a bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. It s purpose is primarilyto remove some of the weaknesses in the amendments passed last year, and to place a few patches upon certain loopholes in the existing act. But this measure makes no attempt to deal with two vital matters, one being the remedying of existing in justices under the act, and the other the lessening of its complications. In measures such as this there are two things to aim at-simplicit y and equity.",21
42,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,The two do not mix very well.,21
43,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"They do not. Very often the striving for equity adds to complication.' I am sorry that the bill retains the inequitable provisions of the The meat act, and that it also adds to the existing complications. For these reasons I am forced to criticize it . I support it bcciiuse it raises the exemption and.strengthens the law in regard to the protection of the ANSTEY) revenue. In discussing this bill, it is just as well to take warning from the manner in which another bill to amend the In come Tax Assessment Act was introduced last year. That bill was introduced in the dying hours of the first period of this session. During a discussion, commencing at 2.45 a.m., and ending during that sitting, drastic amendments were made to the act under the constant f all of the guillotine. We on this side vainly protested. Most honourable members present were lying asleep on the benches. Honourable members should not be in a state of physical exhaustion when considering important amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. Such methods simply mean that the' departmental officers prepare meastires, Cabinet considers them, and then they become the law of the laud. It is government, not by parliament, but by bureaucracy. We are reaping the fruit s of this procedure, because the bill has been introduced to remedy the evils and defects of the rush legislation of last year. The proposed amendments are urgent and serious, and - because of that the bill must be passed. Were it not so late in the session, and were it not for the need to strengthen immediately the existing law, I should move an amendment referring the bill back, so that the Government might come down with a comprehensive scheme to simplify taxation, and to render it more equitable. I fear to take that risk because if the House carried the amendment-and one should not submit amendments unless there is reasonable hope of securing their adoption-and we lost the measure, the Treasury would be deprived of a considerable amount of revenue by a number of sharp people who have been evading their legitimate taxation for some time. notice that the bill is to the made retrospective. That is necessary. Although one may object on principle to retrospective legislation, yet, because of the rush methods adopted last year, it is necessary to make the provision of this bill retrospective. That I also support. Wherein did the amendment of the act last year open the door to evasion and injustice? In the first place, the rate of company taxation prior to last year was 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 on the undistributed profits of the company. Last year that rate was abolished, and there was substituted for it a rate of Is. on the whole of the profits of the company. So long as we have individual income tax rates running up to 5s., Gs., and 7s. in the f l and a company rate of Is. in the £1, so long will individuals be tempted to bring their income under the company rate to .evade the higher personal rate. That is what has happened. Notwithstanding the warnings given when the bill was under discussion last year, it went through, and as a result quite a number of bogus holding companies were formed for the purpose of evading income taxation at the personal rate. Although this measure is designed to remedy that defect in the law, I firmly believe that if the differentiation in the rate of taxation be continued other schemes will be adopted to evade taxation at the higher rate. Section 21 of the act provides that if a company distributes less than two-thirds of its profits to its shareholders the Commissioner may determine if the amount undistributed, or any sum not exceeding two-thirds, could Mr Scullin. reasonably have been distributed. This is a Vpery wide 'discretion to give to the Comimissioner or Ms deputy, and whilst I cast no reflection upon the honour of any individual, I emphasize that this House ought to be careful not to place in the hands of any - official discretionary power to remit taxation to the extent of thousands of pounds, and, perhaps, hundreds of thousands of pounds. There is provision in the act that if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner or his deputy he may refer his case to a board of appeal, but if the Commissioner errs on the side of leniency there is no check. No doubt honourable members are aware of the discussion that has taken place recently concerning the I evasion of taxation by certain companies. I expected that the Treasurer would have laid some stress on this point when he was moving the second reading of the bill, and that he would have exposed the methods adopted by these holding companies to 'dodge .taxation.",21
44,Mr MAXWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY,"An explanation might prompt other people to do likewise. Mr SCTJLLTJST,-Every one who has had anything to do with income taxation knows ithat for a long time past aconsiderable number of people have heen evading income taxation. For this reason the Government ought to have introduced this bill earlier in the session. The registration of holding companies for the evasion of taxation is no new device. They were in existence before the amending legislation was passed last year, and the only effect of that measure was to provide a greater incentive for their multiplication. Let us examine the methods adopted, taking as an illustration a trading company showing a - profit of, say, £60,000. Instead of paying income taxation on that amount of profit or on the proportion which the Commissioner deems sliould be distributed, a holding company is formed for the purpose of holding the profits or investing them. The profits not having been distributed, the Commissioner may intervene, and under section 21, determine whether a sum not exceeding two-thirds of the taxable income of the company could reasonably have been distributed. He may resolve to follow these profits to the shareholders only t» find, in all probability, that the principal shareholder is aholding company liable to taxation) at thecompany rate Is. in the £ 1 . Thus, the shareholders in the trading' company pay tatxation at thecompany rate. what has happened! I am glad that bill now under consideration is to be made retrospective. I doubt, however, will prevent evasion in this way. if. the Treasurer will be able to get whole of the lost revenue , because once fish gets through the net it is not so easy to catch it again. These holding, panies may, in. the meantime, have been dissolved'; the shareholdersmay have disappeared; some of them may have gone insolvent. The report of Income Tax Commissioner discloses a significant and considerable increase thei number of companies. that in the year 1920-21 the number of individuals who paid income taxation was 548,076, and in 1922-3', 464,298, decrease of 83,778. I find also 1920-21 the number of companies that paid' income taxation was 4,743, and 1922-23, 5,405, an increase of 662. What has been going on is obvious. Be asked', "" What can a company do w i its profits if they are not distributed among their shareholders?."" fits may be disposed of in various ways. The money may be carried to the reserve f u n d , and utilized in the expansion of the business; it may in the following year be returned to the shareholders in the for m of bonus shares free of income taxation; or it may be invested in bonds, or some other security and turn profits to the In. view of the. factsI have outlined,, question naturally arises whether this "" C,"" "" D , "" and so on. amending legislation! - will overcome existing difficulties. Mr E . EILKY - Did I understand honourable member to say that bonus shares are not taxable?",22
45,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Not if distributed out of reserves. If out of current a profits they can be taxed-. I am showing what can be done by refraining from distributing, profits. While the Commisshares sioner can tax the undistributedprofitsat Is., in the £ 1 , there is always a desire the part of a> company to keep in hand as long as possible a large amount of undistributed profits, because then only taxation at the eompany rate has to paiid. B y forming another company which the profits can be passed on, can be deemed to have beenpassed on, the of shareholderspay tax on their share of the profits at the rate of Is. in the- £-1, instead of at ratesvarying l it view of from perhaps 5s. to, say, 7s. in the £ 1 . the We have now to consider whether the proposed amendment of the existing law The the amendment is contained in clause 6. a Unless a person has made a thorough 1 study of income tax legislation for a concomsiderable period,, even after reading the clause ten times, he will not be able to thoroughly understand it . Numerous complaints have been made concerning the the employment of taxation agents, but with out the assistance of a person skilled in in interpreting our taxation law,- many I find taxpayers would be at a great disadvantage. In effect, the amendment to the existing law is to provide that a sharea holder in a holding company shall be that in deemed to be a shareholder in a trading company in which the holding company in holds shares. When the Commissioner of Taxation finds that a trading company I may has not distributed two-thirds of its th profits, and that a portion of them has been paid to a holding eompany, he can The proascertain the names of the individual shareholders, in the holding company, and tax. them as individuals. That is what is intended, but I believe that objective cannot be achieved. One would not be so foolish as to be dogmatic in matters of this kind, but I suggest, for the consideration of the Treasurer, that there is ; renothing to prevent a trading company shareholders. forming a number of holding companies, the which may be designated "" A , "" "" B , "" The Commisthe sioner of Taxation may deem that two-thirds of. the profits of a trading company have not been distributed;, he cannot the interfere under the act in regard to any larger proportion. He finds that the profits are held by a holding company which may be "" A , "" in which company known as "" B "" holds shares, and when further investigation is made it may be foundthat those holding in "" B "" have an interest in "" C , "" and so on. What would be the position on of the Commissioner in such circumstances ? He would have to ascertain the the profits obtained by individual shareholders in the different companies, and be would probably find, that some of the to holding companies also held shares in or scores of other trading companies. Such iui exhaustive analysis would add to the existing complicated position. As a holding company is a registered company, it is entitled to all the privileges enjoyed by all other registered companies. If a company can hold in reserve at least one-third of its profits, and more if the Commissioner permits, I submit that a holding company can also claim to hold one-third of its profits in reserve. Dr EAKL E PAGE - We cannot overcome that.'",23
46,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"A trading company might make £60,000 in profits. If it did not distribute auy of its profits it would pay Is. in the £ 1 on them, but if it did distribute them to its shareholders they would have to pay at rates which would vary according to the. total amount of their incomes, and might be in some cases as high as 5s. or 7s. The Commissioner might say, I deem £40,000-o r two-thirds - of these profits to have been distributed for the purpose of taxation. But the distribution might have been t'o a holding company which, in turn, had distributed to another holding company, and so on, until, under the provision which allows .Is. in the £ 1 to be paid on the undistributed proportion of the profits, practically the whole amount had been paid for at that rate.",24
47,Mr MAXWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY,Why are holding com panies formed ?,24
48,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,Largel y for the purpose of evading taxation.,24
49,Dr EARL EPAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,I have an amendment which I think will overcome that difficulty.,24
50,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,It would be interesting to know if the amendment will achieve what is desired. Some holding companies may be legitimate investing companies.,24
51,Mr FOSTER,MEAT INDUSTRY,Some are not.,24
52,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Some are formed primarily for the purpose of evading taxation. As companies were formed for evading the existing act, so others will be formed for evading the proposed law.",24
53,Mr MATHEWS,MEAT INDUSTRY,The present position was anticipated when an amending bill was last before the House.,24
54,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,Holdin g companies were in existence before the existing act was passed.,24
55,Mr MAXWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY,It should be easy to decide which is a bogus company..,24
56,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"A steamship company may have 80 per cent, of its capital invested in other shipping companies or colliery companies. A trading company's profits may be traced to such companies, and its profits taxed at the rate of Is. in the £1. M t . MAXWELL - Instea d of to the individual shareholders ?",24
57,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Exactly . That is the position in which we are placed. By imposing a company rate at Is., hundreds of thousands of pounds are. lost. As I have shown the manner in which the payment of taxation may be avoided, I trust the question will be carefully considered by the committee. The shares in a trading company may be held largely by a holding company. That holding company may hold the bulk of the interest in twenty other trading companies, and it will be necessary to estimate the proportion of each shareholder's interest in all of those companies. To do so will work out something like t h is : shareholder Brown has a certain interest in holding company "" A , "" which has investments in twenty trading companies. Brown's individual income must be assessed upon his proportion of the holding company's interests in the twenty trading companies. The staff of the Taxation Department .will have to be increased rather than decreased in order to cope with the work that will thus he thrown upon it . Confusion will be worse confounded. It may be said: "" It is veiy easy to criticize, but you should suggest what ought to be done."" That is what I propose to do, and I hope that it will not be regarded as presumptious of me. I think that I shall not be adjudged guilty of that when I tell the House that the suggestions I intend making are not novel or original, but embody schemes that have been adopted by other countries, or that have been suggested after very exhaustive investigation of the subject by the royal commission. First of all, let me emphasize the inequity of the present system. If a company has the right to reserve at least one-third of its profits, and upon that reserve to pay a tax of only Is. in the £1, why is not a private firm given the same privilege? Take two big drapery establishments, each making a profit of £20,000 annually. One is run by an in dividual, and his profits are taxed at the individual rate of income tax. On the other side of the street a similar business is run by a company. At least one-third of its profits can be carried to reserves, and upon that the company pays a tax of only Is. in the £ 1 . Will any honourable memberargue that that is equitable ? If a company can, by placing certain of its profits to reserves, escape the individual rate of .taxation, why cannot a private individual have a reserve f u n d similarly treated? Every day there are probably half a dozen registrations of new companies. On one day last week a family in Victoria registered seven new companies in its own name. It is obvious that the object is to avoid not only income tax but also land tax. It is a well known fact that companies have by such methods evaded the payment of land tax, yet there has been no amendment of the law to prevent them from doing so. We should treat all alike; we should not have one law for a company and another for an individual. Companies now pay a tax of Is. in the £ 1 upon all profits. Those of its shareholders who would 'be nontaxpayers if they had a similar income from any other source are compelled to pay that Is. in the £ 1 under the law as it now stands. That is not equitable. A man may have shares that return him £50 a year. He has no other income, yet he is called upon to pay an income tax of £2 10s. in company taxation. income from those shares amounts to £100, his tax is £ 5 a year. The smallest income receiver, if he receives his income from dividends, has to pay an income tax of 5 per cent. That is a higher rate than, honourable members are called upon to pay in respect of the salaries that they receive. Surely, no one can claim that that is equitable. I 'have said that the company tax is Is. in the £1, and that the individual rate is paid-on the dividend. Then there is a rebate of Is. in the £ 1 to those who receive their dividends, provided that they are income taxpayers; but there is no rebate to those persons who would not be income taxpayers if their income were not derived from shares in a company. Under section 20, sub-section 3 of the act, permission is given to a company to deduct the tax of Is. in the £ 1 from a shareholder's dividends whether those dividends are allotted to preferential or to ordinary shares. again honourable members will see that the small shareholders are being h it in order to relieve the big shareholders from the necessity of bearing their proper share of the amount required for the government of this country. Prior to the amendments that were made last year the tax on reserves was 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 . A company that made a profit of £60,000 could carry to reserve the sum of £20,000. At 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 the tax on that was £2,400. At the present time, at Is. in the £ 1 , the tax is £1,000. That loss of £1,400 is made good by taxing at the rate of Is. in the £1 a large number of small shareholders who should not be liable to pay auy tax, because their incomes are' well with in the exemption.",24
58,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,A company with that profit would pay a tax of £3.000.,25
59,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"It pays £1,000 on the £20,000 in reserve. The £2,000 that it pays on the £40,000 is rebated when that sum is distributed. B y that means revenue is lost, and the deficiency is made good by taxing the small shareholder at the rate of Is. in the £ 1 . A rebate is allowed only to those who are taxpayers. If a shareholder's taxable income is less than £200-and if , under this amendment, it is less than £300-n o rebate is allowed. If one is only a small taxpayer one's rebate will be very small; the full rebate is not allowed until the income is about If his £600 a year. It is argued that the smell shareholder does not pay the tax; that it is paid by the company. That is a foolish argument. Anything the company pays must be made good by the shareholders. If a shareholder does hot paythe tax, why is a rebate allowed tobig shareholders of the amount that the company pays ?",25
60,Mr MAXWEL L,MEAT INDUSTRY,Although the shareholder does not actually pay the tax it is paid with his money.,25
61,Mr SCULLIW,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Exactly. I frankly admit that I have stated extreme cases in order to emphasize my point. Take a proprietary company comprising two groups of shareholders. To simplify the matter I shall call these shareholders "" A "" and "" B "" . "" A "" is a small man whose total income is represented by what he gets from the company. "" B "" has interests in scores of other conThere cerns. The total profit is £1,200. The company tax upon that sum at the rate of Is. in the £1 is £60. "" A "" holds a onefourt h and "" B "" a three-fourths interest m the company. "" A , "" whose total income is £300, pays a - tax of .£15, as his share of the 'company tax. "" £45 as hie share of the company 'tax. Rut because "" B "" is ;a big income taxpayer with an interest in other companies he has the whole of that £45 rebated; whereas "" A,"" because he is a 'small man with no 'Other income, is not allowed any rebate. That is the first illustration of injustice. It was pointed out last year, but no notice was taken of it. MJC.. E. EnLiEar - Does .the Treasurer mit that injustice?",25
62,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Of course he does. He cannot dispute it . The only .argument he-can use against it is to say that the company pays the tax, but it pays it, as the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has just said, with the shareholders' money. X direct attention to another phase of the matter to show how ,an .even greater injustice takes plaee. I .take (again, for the purpose of illustration, two shareholders in a company making £1,200 profit. "" B "", holding .a three-fourths interest, can out-vote "" A "" . He says, "" We will not distribute any of the £ 1,200 profit. We will keep it in the. company, .or invest it for the benefit of the company."" His reason for refusing to distribute the profit is that he does not want to pay .'5s. in the £1 tax cn it. He out-votes "" A""., and the £1,200 profit is not distributed. Then the Taxation Commissioner comes along, and he says, "" We must get some revenue from this company in addition to the company tax."" deems that two-thirds of the profits of £1,200 has been distributed, and proceeds to tax £800 as distributed profit. Cf this amount "" A "" is credited with £200 and "" B "" with £600. As "" A "" has only £200 income and is .therefore exempt from income tax, he is not charged tax. "" B "", the Commissioner finds, has an income of £10,000 or £12.000 besides the £600 deemed to have been distributed to him from the company's profit. When that is worked out the tax chargeable on it is about 4s. in the £1. It may not be exactly 4s. in the £1, but I use that figure for the purpose of illustration. The Taxation Commissioner applies this rate, less Is. in the £1 rebate, already paid by the company, and finds that the tax which "" B "" should be called upon to pay is £90.  included im "" B's "" general income, and be 33 "" pays taxed at the graduated rate ? Mr Scullin. - Yes , but added to the £1-0,000 or £12,000 income from other sources it 'brings "" B ' s "" rate up to about 4s. in the £1. He gets a rebate of Is. and is taxed at 8s. in the £1, making his additional tax £90. Here is where the in justice comes in. Having ascertained that : "" B "" should pay this £90, the Commissioner says, "" Y o u have to pay £90 more ad- tax because I deemed that £600 of the profits of your company were distributed to you,"" hut he collects it from the company and not from the individual "" B "". By collecting it from the company, the' unfortunate "" A "" , who is .a shareholder with "" B "" in the company, has to pay one-fourth of the amount, or £22 Ids., as his comltribution to lighten the burden of the big man. Not only ihas the small man who should be exempt from any taxation to pay his share of the company's taxation, but he has actually also to pay a share of the rich man's income tax. That is about the most inequitable .arrangement ever put 'before the country, but it has stood since 1922, when it was first introduced by the then honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), - who was at the time Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I hoped that some attempt would be made to remedy that injustice, but there is nothing in this bill to remedy it. If we divide a company into a greater number of sections it will be found that the inHe justice is only increased. I have taken the example of a small man associated in a company - with a big man, but we know from our own experience that there are a great many small shareholders associated with numbers of very wealthy men in different companies. It will be found La every instance - of the kind that the system of taxation adopted operates to the detriment of the small shareholder who happens to be associated with wealthy men Ln .a company. Br. EABLE PAGE - There may be 20,000 shareholders in a company, and iff in the case - of all companies the interests of individuals were followed throughout, as the honourable member suggests, we should need every one in the community on the staff of the Income Tax Department.",26
63,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"That is not so.. Treasurer has the choice of three methods, each of which would be less, complicated, less costly, and more equitable, than that now adopted. I take the iUustration, for instance, of a company of five shareis holders, each of whom holds an equal number of shares. Its. profits are £1,500. It distributes none of its profits. Taxation Commissioner deems that twothat thirds of the profits, or £1,000, has been distributed, and he follows the distribution to each individual sharehis holder. He says to each, have received in dividends £200 from thiscompany,"" and in each case he adds this amount to the individual's private income. He finds that "" A "" only I4s. has no other income, and, therefore, has no additional or any income tax to pay. "" B , "" "" C,"" "" D , "" and "" E , "" have each from other sources an income of from £10,000 to £12,000 a year. The Commissioner finds their - average tax would be about 4s. in the £ 1 . He says to each of them, "" Adding the £200 which I deem to have been distributed to you from the company's profits to your private income, I find that you should pay at the rate of about 4's. in the less Is. in the £ 1 rebate of what the pany has paid, and so you have to pay an additional £ 3 0 . "" Four times £ is £ 1 2 0 , which is collected from the company.. The company has paid' at the rate of Is. in the £ 1 on the £1,500 sum of £ 7 5 , making, a total tax of The Taxation Commissioner does not tax the four partners, "" B , "" "" C,"" "" D , "" and "" E "" to the amount of £ 3 0 each. He cannot do so under the act. He must taxation ? take it from the company. He takes it from the company, and the whole of the shareholders, having equal shares in company, must pay an equal share of tax, with the result that the unfortunate "" A , "" whose total income is his dividend of £200 from the company, has to pay made by a company. one-fifth of the £120 and one-fifth £75> company tax, or, altogether, £ out of his total income of £200'. That is the sort of thing which is possible the existing law. What remedies suggested? There are three ways which companies could be taxed, equitable and more simple than that which has been adopted. We could the English system. I do not support but I submit it to honourable members an improvement upon what we' have. porations. The English system is fairl y simple. 1 Assessment Bill. '4875 The There is a flat rateof 6s. in the £ 1 on all companies' profits. Then a rebate is given to every person who receives a dividend, of Gs. in the £ 1 , whether he is taxable or not taxable. All he has to do to prcdnice his dividend warrant from the company, on. which is written, "" This dividend has paid 6s. in the £ 1 tax.'' The When the taxpayer is assessed he gets 6s. rebated. If a. man is in receipt of an income below the amount exempted from income taxation, he can still present dividend warrant and gethis 6s. in "" You the £ 1 . rebated from the amount of tax paid in his name. Most companies pay dividend less tax, so that a dividend which would, otherwise be £ 1 , is Under the English system the shareholder whohas. contributed his quota to the taxation of his company gets his rebate when the dividends are taxed. That is equitable.. It may be said that a large number of people in a small way are unaware of their rights undra* the law, and. make no claim for rebate. They suffer an injustice in that way, but it is due to their own careless'ness; and latterly thei'e has arisen an £ 1 , army of taxation agents who are making coma good thing out of the collection of rebates payable over a number of years. It 3 0 may be argued that under this system a lot of taxation is collected and is then refunded, but it could be placed to the credit the of a trust account, and need not be paid £ 1 9 5 . into the Consolidated Revenue.",27
64,Mr FEHTOBT,MEAT INDUSTRY,Are there any holding companies' in the Old Country to dodge,27
65,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"No . Every company is treated in the same way, and there is the no incentive to for m a holding company the to cheat the revenue. A dozen holding companies might be formed, but still 6s. in the £ 1 has to be paid on the profits That would be au of the improvement upon our system} but I do 3 9 not advocate it , for various reasons, I remind the Treasurer that the royal comunder mission that made exhaustive inquiries can be during at number of years into the in question of income taxation, submitted more two alternatives to the Government. Speaking from memory, I believe that the adopt taxation commission was unanimous on it , the principle that income taxation should as be imposed on individuals and not on corOne method of taxation it proposed was to tax the whole of a company's undistributed profits and reserves at 2s. 5d. or 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 , and when those reserves were distributed to the shareholders in the for m of dividends^ to rebate the company. What was happening under the provision which imposed a tax of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 on reserves, was that when reserves were distributed a rebate was made on the individual dividend, but the small shareholder who had not to pay income tax received none of the rebate. The royal commission said that that was not equitable, as the company had paid the tax on the reserves, and the rebate sliould be given to the company that paid it , and not to individual shareholders. Another proposal was made in another portion of the taxation commission's report which is equitable and simple. It is to consider a company just .as one would consider an individual trader. There should be no tax on profits us the income of a company, but the tax should be imposed on the individuals receiving the profits.",27
66,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,"That is the Victorian., system,, and it is a simple system.",28
67,Mr SCTJLLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"No ; there is a tax of Is. in the f l on the whole of a company's profits in Victoria. taxation at the source, and it is most inequitable.",28
68,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,I was mistaken; honourable member is right.,28
69,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"We have many wealthy men in the community drawing big dividends from companies operating in Victoria whose maximum income tax is Is. in the £ 1 on the profits of the companies in which they are shareholders. They are not taxed at all on dividends which they receive from the company, nnd the Is. in the £ 1 imposed on the profits of the companies is paid by the companies. The royal commission said that we should not tax income at the source, but in the hands of the recipients. If a company made a profit of £20,000, the Taxation Department need, not bother about whether it has been distributed or not; it can deem that it has been distributed, and then follow it into the hands of the individual shareholders, and tax them at the rate applicable to their individual incomes. I know that arguments may be urged against this system. It will be said that companies must keep reserves for the purpose of increasing stock, or replacing plant, and so on; but an individual trader, although he must keep reserves for the same reason, does not get exemption from income taxation in the same way as a. company. If he makes a profit of £20,000, it is taxed' as income, although he may not use it all as personal income. If he forms his business into a company, and gives his wife, his sons, and his daughters, shares in it , he can escape with a tax of Is. in the £ 1 on one-third of the profits. Why should the Parliament differentiate between a company and an individual' trader? Why should we not treat a company as we treat an individual ? The effect of adopting my suggestion would be that we would get more revenue, and would be able to adjust taxation more equitably for the man who. does not float his business into a company. My suggestion would be practicable and equitable. I would move an amendment in the form of an instruction from this House to the Government to adopt my suggestion, but I fear that, if I did so the bill might be lost. Because of the good that is in it , I do not want to lose it . Some of the proposed machinery clauses are very That is 'necessary. It will effect some improvement in the taxation of companies, and is one step, at least, in the right direction. the I hope I have not wearied honourable members with these intricate and involved questions. I have expressed views that I have formed by reading the reports of royal commissions, and endeavouring to evolve an equitable and simple system of taxation. I direct the Treasurer's attention to the fact that in section 21 of the existing act no date is fixed on which the Commissioner shall deem that two-thirds of the profits are distributable. That omission, which causes a lot of confusion, can be corrected when we are in committee. Revenue we must have, aud the taxes to produce it should be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear themi. The evasion of taxation by the formation of companies can be overcome by adopting any one of the three suggestions I have made. 1 prefer my last suggestion, which was to treat the companies on exactly the same basis as individual traders. That would avoid all the complications that are now introduced. The Commissioner has the power, not. only to examine the profits of a. company, but to order as much less than two-thirds of the profits as in his opinion is justified to be distributed. The items that can be excluded fro m the category of distributable profits would amaze honourable members. In the Senate on the 24th August, 1923, Senator Pearce'said that the Commissioner has treated as not being distributable1. All items of expenditure (not deductible in arriving at taxable income) on income tax, war-time profits tax, donations, subscriptions, law costs, &c. 2. Amounts used to restore losses on paid-up capital. 3. Anticipated losses. 4. Reserves for income tax. 5. Commitments-for example, high-priced goods from overseas rushed on importers. 6. Sinking fund to pay debentures 7. Sinking fund to pay cost of lease or improvements. 8. Provision for bad debts. 9. Depreciation in excess of departmental rates. 10. Bad debts in time-payment purchases. 11. Investments in war loans. These things are not deductible from any one's income, but they can be treated by a company as non-distribtitable profits, which are subject ""to a tax of only Is. in the £ 1 . What are "" war loans "" within the meaning of the act? Although the war is over, war-loan scrip is still purchasable on the market. The Commissioner has the power to which I have referred, aud, according to Senator Pearce's statement, he exercises it , and if a company wishes to escape taxation all it has to do is to say that it will invest its profits in war loans. All the complications and injustices to which I have referred arise because we tax companies instead of taxing incomes in the hands of the recipients. There I leave the matter in the earnest hope that the Government will present a complete and full amending Income Tax Assessment Bill early next session, with the object of remedying these injustices. An y move in that direction w i ll receive my support, and, I believe, the support of every honourable member on this side of the House.",28
70,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Kooyong) [5.12] This bill, the Treasurer has said, is designed to explain and clarify the law. In some respects it is open to grave doubt whether it attains that object. It makes important changes in the law, and I hope the House will not take it for granted that it merely expresses in clearer language determinations at which Parliament has already arrived. Very i m - phrase portant changes are made, which may or may not be desirable, and I want honourable members to realise that some of them are retrospective. W it h much of the very lucid speech of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) I agree, but I am unable to accept his view that it is right or proper for Parliament to pass retrospective taxation legislation. Only in very exceptional circumstances can such legislation be justified. It is more important that this Parliament should be absolutely fair_ to the citizens of Australia than that it should collect by hook or by crook every possible penny. When Parliament is considering a taxation bill it has the assistance of officers of the Crown Law Department and the Taxa-* tion Department, and it should make its legislation clear - Citizens are entitled to act on its legislation. They have acted upon it in the matter of taxation, and it would be a very serious thing now to require people to pay taxation which this .Parliament has said they need not pay. Certain distributions of moneys have been made upon the assumption that they will not be taxed, because this Parliament has so declared. That has been going on for two years, but now a bill, saying that the law is doomed to be otherwise than it has been for the last two years, is brought down. People wj.ll he required to pay taxation on moneys that they have probably spent. I submit to the House, with some confidence, that such a measure is unjust, whether it is applied to a poor or a rich man. Section 16 of the principal act has appeared in various forms in our Income Tax Acts. It is the section under which questions have been decided by the courts regarding the taxation of bonus shares. The' 1922 Income Tax Assessment Act provided that there should be included in the taxable income of a taxpayerDividends, bonuses or profits (but not including a reversionary bonus issued on a policy of life assurance) credited, paid or distributed to the member or shareholder from any profit derived from any source by the company. Provided also that where a dividend or bonus is paid wholly and exclusively out of the profits arising from the sale of capital assets a member or shareholder shall not be liable to tax on that dividend or bonus. This Parliament in that year used the "" capital assets"" for the purposeo f indicating tlte source of dividends or bonuses that should not be taxable in the hand'so f shareholders-. It is proposed to substitute for those words, "" Assets which were not acquired for ' the purpose of resale, at a profit."" not anunreasonable legislativeproposal, but either theproposed words mean the same as the existing words, orthey mean"" something, different. If they mean the' same,, there is noneed for them. If these word's mean something different, whymake them retrospective? If wedesire to change the law, why not hecontent merely to change it without making the alteration retrospective-?' Why changei t and say that the changeshall be deemed to have been made two years ago? In the. absence of special reasonstothe contrary, the general rule should obtainthat retrospective legislation, particularly in regard' to taxation, is highly objectionable. Mr WmsT - If the bill, is passed, will the Government have power to collect taxation retrospectively?""",29
71,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,"If this b i ll is passed theCommissioner of Taxation will be entitled to collect taxation on money on which taxpayers have paid no income tax for the last two years, and in respect of which they have considered that everything was settled, as. they had obeyed the. law of the country. The Commissioner will be able to collect taxation on money that has, probably been, spent. Let us consider the case of. an executor or trustee whohasreceived bonus, shares during the last. twQi years.. He knew that they were not taxable^, because, this Parliament had said so. He. distributed themto the beneficiaries,, whoi n turni may have sold them and spent the proceeds, but if the proposed amendment is agreed to it. will be possible for the commissioner todescend upon him and demand'income taxation in respect of those shares.",30
72,Mr FOSTER,MEAT INDUSTRY,"-After the estatehas wound, up ?",30
73,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Y e a , and when theparagraph executor-, who had no personal interest' in the estate, has perhaps no means of couping himself. That isa very unjust proposal; in fact, retrospective taxing, fits-legislation can hardly ever be justified'. The honourable member forYaarra (Mr . Scullin) appeared eagerly desirousthat financial, the Treasury should collect as much money as possible. That should not be the onlytwo, aim and ideal of this Parliament.. Of 1 course,, the Government must .collect revenue, but its first concern should be for justiceinits method of collection. Every member of the comThat is. munity is entitled to act upon the decisions of this Parliament, as represented! in its legislation, and any change in the law should apply only to the future. Clause 4, sub-paragraph h , proposes an amendment of the existing law relating to* the taxationof what are commonly called bonus shares. Since 1922, the law has; re1 quired a taxpayer to include' in his. incomeThe face value of shares distributed! by a company to its members or shareholders in consequence of the capitalization of the whole or any part of the assessable income, of the. company, which it is liable to include in itsreturn for the purposes of.' its current assessment : Provided that, nothing in this section shall render liable to taxation the value of shares issued by a company - to its members or shareholders in consequence of. the capitalization of any other of itsprofits. The proviso, is most important. In 1922 this. Parliament deliberatelyenacted that taxation should be paid' only on the faase value of bonus shares representing the' profits, returnablei n the. current assessment, and that other bonus sharesissued iir respect of profits should not be taxed. Because of the existing legislation, during the past two years companies throughout Australia barve distributed to their shareholders additional' shares by way of capitalization! of profits.. Such shares were nontaxable when, they were distributed. The recipients may m may not havethem in their possession still, and. their financial position may be good or bad'. This House, is asked now to reverse, the deliberate decision, of the legislature in 19.2.2, and introduce the retrospective provision shown i u paragraph, h of clause. 4. It cannot be said, that paragraph, h will have the same effect as. the short and' simple provision in the 1922 act; it is an entirely new provision, and it is made retrospective. When been examining paragraph h in detail, par- ticular attention might be paid to sub3. It will be observed that that sub-paragraph is an exception. The reclause providesthat the paid up value of shares shall be taxable except the pro(3..)_ derived by thecorauparny drairing the year commencing on the first day of. July, one thousand nine hundred! and twentyor during an accounting period' substituted there for by .the 'Commissioner under section 32 of this act, or in any subsequent - financial year or accounting period, and upon which the company is not required by .tie Commissioner to pay tax or additional .tax under section 21 of this act. - As sub-paragraph 3 is an exception, the last sentence of the paragraph is an exception upon an exception, and appears to me to mean that if a company has - been required to pay tax under' section 21, the shareholder also will be taxed in respect of the same profits. That seems a remarkable provision; and I ask the Treasurer to consider whether the words employed by the draftsman carry out the real intention of the Government. Subparagraph 4 of the same clause contains words which I am sure will cause a great deal of difficulty. It refers to profitsstanding to the credit of 'profit .and loss account, or any similar account, on 1st day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fourteen. I do not know of any account that is similar to a profit and loss account.",30
74,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"The proposes to strike out that provision, and substitute the words """" except profits derived .subsequent to 1st July, 1914."" Mr LATHAM ; - S i m p l e r wording will obviate a lot of difficulty and confusion. Ever since this income taxation has been imposed by the Commonwealth, exemption has been allowed on profits earned before 1st July, 1914. That exemption was perfectly fair , and people have worked on the assumption that they were free to enjoy such income free of taxation. This bill does not preserve that exemption, but makes taxable moneys earned and .set aside for distribution prior to the 1st July, 1914. Surely that is unfair. No honourable member can think it right to tax moneys earned prior to the introduction of Commonwealth in come taxation. Most of the other matters to which I desire to refer can be dealt with more appropriately at the committee stage. The only exception is clause 14, which provides for the refer«nce of certain questions to a member of a board of appeal. The boards of appeal constituted under the act hav.e i m portant judicial functions to perform, and are superior to the Commissioner, inasmuch as they may review his decisions. Clause 14 proposes to allow the Commissioner to refer a matter to a member >of a board of appeal, and require him to investigate it , and makea recommendation to the board, of which the Commissioner is a member. I question whether the Commissioner should have power to direct a member of a tribunal, whose functions in clude the reviewing of his decisions, to undertake investigatory duties for the purpose of making a report to the Commissioner, as chairman of the Appeal Board, which report the Commissioner may or may not accept. This seems to be putting the members of the board of appeal in an improper position. It 'would be better if the duties proposed to be referred to a member of the board were performed by the board itself. ' Mr Forde (Capricornia) [5.32]. - As the b i ll contains some very useful amendments of the income taxation machinery, I intend to give it my support. Some of .the amendments were desirable. For in stance, clause 3 proposes to give exemption itoGovernment the income derived by a ipenson from the working of a mining property in Australia principally for the purpose of obtaining gold-this - exemption snalT apply to dividends paid by a 'Company out of such income. 'The gold mining companies throughout Australia have experienced adversity in recent years. During the war period, owing to the marketing of their products having been controlled by the Commonwealth, they lost, approximately, £3,000,000, representing the greater amount which they would have received if they had .been allowed to sell their gold in the open market. Clause 8 proposes an amendment to - section 24 ;of the prin cipal act in order to increase the exemption from £200 to £300, less £ 1 for every £3 by ""which the income exceeds £300. I hope that every honourable member will recognize that that amendment is justified. Having regard to the in crease in the basic wage and the high cost of living, incomes up to £ W 0 should be exempt from taxation. I hope that the Treasurer will also accept the amendment, which will be proposed by the honourable member for - Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton) to allow of a further .deduction for medical and funeral expenses, namely(n) Any snm or sums of money paid to any legally qualified medical practitioner, public or .private hospital,' nurse, .chemist, dentist, - or masseur, in respect of the illness of or any operation upon the taxpayer or his wife or any member of his family under the age of twenty-one years, and in addition, in the event of the death of the wife of the taxpayer or of the death of any member of his family under the as of twenty-one years, any sum or sums of money paid to any undertaker for funeral and burial expenses. (-!>) Any payment made during the. year preceding the year of assessment by the taxpayer as a contribution to any society registered under the Friendly Societies Act. I have always thought that the taxpayer on. should be allowed to deduct expenses of that kind. There are many receiving wages - or small salaries on account of illness or deaths in 1924: their families, are required to pay away a big proportion of their The amount paid away in this direction could reasonably be deducted from their taxable incomes. I hope the Treasurer will accept the amendment. The honourable member for Oalare (Sir Howse) has also suggested an amendment which I sliould like the Treasurer to ac1911 cept. The honourable member that any person who is carrying on agriIncrease.. cultural or pastoral pursuits in a district which is subject to the ravages of animal pests shall be entitled to a deduction the money he has spent in the purchase of wire netting used in the construction of a wire-netting fence to prevent animal pests from, entering upon the land used by him in the production of his assessable income. Thousands of small farmers 'Queensland find it absolutely necessary surround their tomato plantations, plantations, or cotton crops with netting to protect them from wallabies, otherwise they would secure no crops, no taxable income. The wire netting is purchased by them to enable them to year, earn an income. It will be a great boon of to producers generally to assist the farmer in this direction. I that honourable members generally will support the increase in the general exemption from £200 to £300. wage-earner is today only 7d. a better off than he was in 1911. He cerdiscontented with their lot. tainly receives a higher remuneration for the last twelve years the his services, but the increased cost of owners living has absorbed the - whole of the inimproved their crease in his wages with the exception 7d. a week. Since 1911 the wage-earner has been chasing the high cost of living, and so far he has failed to improve his economic position. He has heen denied Mr Forde. full justice, industrially and economically, because his wage has always been just behind the increase in the. cost of living. The great majority of the people of Australia, with families, whose earnings do not exceed £300 a year are just about on the bare, subsistence line, or ares floundering on what is commonly called, the bread line. They already pay, individually, the taxation imposed on the various trading companies, which pass it Commonwealth statistics relating to the cost of housing accommodation persons show the following increases from March, who, 1911, to the first quarter of March, HOUSING ACCOMMODATION (WEIGHTED AVERAGE-An . incomes.

I shall quote other figures presently. Although the workers on the basic wage have had to contend with in adequacy of remuneration and unemployiu ment, there are thousands of people in to the community who profess amazement at banana the spirit of industrial, unrest which they wire say is manifest among workers. But if they were compelled to endure some of and the privations and hardships suffered by those whose salaries do not exceed £300 a and on - whom the burden peopling this country rests, small they would readily understand the think cause of this unrest. Many people declare that the Australian workers are living in a veritable paradise, The but, as a matter of fact, the workers week themselves have good reason to be During wealth of Australia have greatly positions. Privatelyof owned capital has increased by approximately £1,000,000,000, whereas the average wage paid to the worker of the Commonwealth, after allowing for the increase in the cost of living, has not increased by more than 7d. a week. At a meeting of - the Australian Science Congress, held in Adelaide on the 29 th August last, the Commonwealth Statistician disclosed the fact that privately-owned wealth in Australia at the end of 1921 aggregated £2,165,900,000 as against £1,417,910,000 in 1910-11. That in crease was considerable enough, but calculating the increase in private wealth for the two years following 1921, on the basis of the preceding years, plus the natural increase in added wealth, we find that at the end of 1923 the private wealth of the Commonwealth was something over £2,400,000,000, approximately £1,000,000,000 more than in 1911. This huge increase in private wealth is made up i u a variety of ways-cash , land, buildings, implements, machinery, live stock, metals, minerals, farming products, imported merchandise, manufactured products, raw materials, holdings in companies, and a score of other more or less tangible assets. Along with this increase in the riches of the wealth owners, there has been greater exploitation of the worker. From year to year the holdings of the wealthy have increased to a very much greater extent proportionately than have the wages of the workers. The latter have been forced to put up a desperate fight to maintain even the economic position they enjoyed in 1911. Prosperity has knocked at the door of manufacturers, and persons engaged in certain primary industries, but noone can say that it has ever come to the door of the wage earner. He has been kept on the bare living wage, with intermittent periods of unemployment. The steadily mounting increase in the cost of living has always deprived liim of the advantage of the apparent increase in wages he has secured since 1911. The old-age pension is all that lies ahead of many of those who are today receiving less than £300 a year, and have large families to bring up and educate. It is absolutely impossible for them to set aside sufficient to keep themselves in their old age, especially where they have to meet excessive medical expenses. F u l l y 80 per cent, of the wealth of the Commonwealth is in the hands of about 30 per cent, of the population, while the other 70 per cent, is carry,ing on a desperate fight in order to make ends meet. Those who ask for a little more are branded as revolutionaries, bolsheviks, and anarchists. Is it to be wondered that sometimes a little bitterness is engendered in the fight of the workers for a better share of this world's goods 1 I remember the remark of a member of the British Empire Exhibition Commission, when that commission visited Mount Morgan. The commission saw the conditions under which the miners and the surface workers were toiling. The latter were then receiving the reduced wage of 13s. lOd. a day. One member of the commission said, "" By Jove, I would not work here among these fumes for £2 - a day."" An increase in the in come tax exemption to £300 is full y justified on the ground that many people who are earning from £200 to £300 a year cannot afford to pay income tax and meet the increased cost of living. The wealthy can afford to pay a substantial tax. The following figures show how private wealth in Australia has increased from 1911:Year. Private Wealth of Increase since 101.1.

Let us see how the workers have fared - during the same period. If we study the facts and figures we find that their story is, indeed, a tragic one. The party to which I have the honour to belong does not only advocate better conditions for the workers in the mines or factories, or on the farms; it also advocates better conditions for all - who are engaged in the work of production, whether they be farmers or city workers. When we come to examine the figures for a period of years, we find how the cost of living has affected the average weekly wage paid to workers. The position is set .out in .the following table:Average Increase Weekly in Cost.of Increase Yoar. Wage Paid Living in Wage to Workers. ti 1 s. A. iPei cent.

From 1911 to 1914 the nominal, wage of the workers increased by 8| per cent., owing to the increased cost 'of living, the purchasing power of 20s. in 1911 had dropped to 17s. lid. in 1914, so the worker was actually 3s. 6d. per week: worse off in 1914 than in 1911. those years private wealth increased by £178,770.,000. The war then a war which, we were told, was to end war, and was to improve the conditions of the mass of the people and give them a new world, and in 1919, when the workers who went abroad to fight returned Australia they found that although the average weekly wage had increased from 55s. 7d. to 74s. lid., the power of 20s., which had dropped l'7s. Id. in 1914, had declined to lis. 8d., making the purchasing power of the average wage 4s. 7d. a week less than in 1914.. In the period from 1914 to 1919, during which the worker suffered reduction in his purchasing power, the - wealthy classes of Australia their wealth by £350.000,00.0. - termination of the war the cam'+alists have increased their wealth by They have done remarkably well. In view - of ail these circumstances, the people receiving incomes of less than £300 per anAfr.

As the sinoc 1011. since 1011. in- - worth in- bill, so eloquently debated by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), contains some useful amendments, I 8. d - S. d. intend to support it , but I hope that .. .... ... early next session the Government will 5 17 7 47 4 7* 17 5, 48 1 introduce a consolidating measure to give 84 17 1 47 91 effect to other desirable amendments indi10J 14 2 40 04 cated by the honourable member.  13 7 43 7 294 13 24 43 84 like the honourable member for Yarra, feel 11 8 .43 24 that the amendments proposed in this 9 «4 42 9 measure will be useful, but the bill does 84 not remedy all-the taxation anomalies and 78f 11 10£ 54 4 injustices from which our citizens are 844 11 0 51 10 suffering. I feel that lengthy amendments to the measure would not, at this stage of the session, receive proper concf the workers sideration, and, therefore, I do not in to improve their tend to propose them; but I , too, hope .only in- that early next .session we shall be given .an opportunity to amend and to improve our taxation laws, so that justice may be per week done to the people. I also concur in the views enunciated by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) in regard but, to certain aspects of the bill. We ought to be very careful to see that we enact laws which will operate equitably upon all classes of the community. In 1922, when the consolidating taxation bill was During .before us, I endeavoured to amend the provisions of clause 13 with respect to occurred- the averaging system. I pointed out that some of the provisions of the measure .appeared to me to be entirely unjust and unreasonable, and that it would do little to remove the injustices caused by our to method of single-year taxation, but I was unable to persuade the then Treasurer (Mr Bruce) to accept purchasing my viows. It should be laid down as a to - maxim that we must legislate justly for our citizens. The British Royal Commission on Taxation reported to the British Government in 1919 that no taxation law could be successfully administered which this was .contrary to the general sense of justice in the community. I agree with that. increased The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), in adSince the dressing a meeting in Melbourne, on one occasion observed that he agreed with the £550.000,000. maxims of Adam Smith, .and he quoted the following : The subieets of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the Government as nearly as - possible in proportion to their respective) ability,- that is, inproportion revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. Although every member of the House will approve of that, I regret that it has not been the result of the measure we passed in. 19-22.. I . wish to draw the. attention: of honourable members to the actual experience' of one taxpayer under our. present system. H is income, in round figures,, for the year ended 30th June, 1 1.9-21, was £5>,Q00; for the year ended-. 30th June, 1922,. £ 6 , 0 0 0 ; and foe. the year ended 30th June, 1923, £ 8 0 0 , which, was. £11,800 for the three years,, an average of £ 3 , 9 3 3 a. year. A man with an irregular income which, averages £3,933 a year, should not have to pay any more taxation than a man with a regular in come, of that amount, for the taxable capacity of the two taxpayers would be the same. B ut what is the case under our existing legislation?' The man with the irregularincome actualTy paid on his £1-1,800 a total! of £1,692', whereas the man with at regular income of ..the same amount would. h-a.ve> paid only £1,339', &e £3®3 less . A gross injustice like tha*; 1 simply howls for remedy usi suppose forai moment that in stead' of the man. receiving his irregular income in the w a y mentioned;,, he received' it in! the reverse order-; that is to say, in the first year £800, inIhe second £6;0O.0, and in the t h i r d £5,000-. i It migh t just as easily have happened that way, and had it been so his taxation, 1 1 would have been £1,202 instead of £1,692-, or £490 less than heactually paid. An ; act which would permit such a result isclumsy, incomplete, and grossly unjust, for the taxpayer would ""get at "" the Government under its ownlaws. The in tention of this Parliament in agreeing to the graduated system was that the man with thebig income should pay more taxation! in the £ 1 than the man with the small income, but it was recognized when the consolidating bill was before usthat the' systemwould operate unjustly on the man whohad an irregular incomej. and there was a pretence on the part of theGovernrment to; adopt a n averaging system.'.. I submit that a. system which could operateas this one does' is u n fair . The - lowest tax that should be. possible om an average income of £3,933 a; year for three years, is. £1,339, and a taxpayer with am average income of £3,933 should have to pay that to the. amount. The system that I suggested in scm amendment I moved to the 19-22 bill would; havei worked equitably, would have been, easier toadminister, than the present one, and would not have impinged upon/ the graduated system. J hope that an> opportunity will be afforded to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), for taxpayers: who have noregular income aire suffering wader a galling sense of injustice. Under the present law, the department goes from one extreme to the other, and imjustice is inflicted either on. thetaxpayers or on the country. A live-yearsi averaging: system is in operation, but instead o-f averaging the income, an average: rate of tare is determined. It is regrettable that the innovation was made.",31
75,Mr WEST,MEAT INDUSTRY,". - I told the honourable member that at the t in e .  amendment in 1921, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West)- audi other members walked out of the chamber, and refused to vote.

I think - t h at the honourable member fbr Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) previously made the suggestion. The Government would not lose the tax, if a reasonable deduction were allowed fbr medical expenses incurred by a taxpayer. But under the present system the Government receives income tax on the amount twice,, and' sickness, instead' of being a calamity,, becomes, from the stand-point of the Commonwealth, rather a fortunate circumstance. Question resolved in the affirmative-. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2' (Repeal). Dr EARLE' PAGrE (Cowper-Trea surer) [6.10] - The repeal underthe original' act was' absolute' in regard to all the previousacts'. TM s clause is necessary, because the repeal' of the IncomeTaxAssessment Act li9I5-21 abolished all the powers of the Commissioner under that act, and it was, therefore, impossible for the department to issue any original assessments for those years in the case of persons who had wittingly or unwittingly evaded payment of the tax for some or all of those years. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 (Exemptions).",35
76,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [6.12] - The object of the exemption provided under this clause is to encourage, as much as possible, the investment of money in mining undertakings and primaril y for gold-mining. The proposal of the Government is considered preferable to that suggested by the mining industry, which would have thrown considerable work on the Taxation Department beyond what was warranted. It is proposed that the profits of the next financial year shall be exempt.",36
77,Mr MANN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Perth) [ 6 . 1 6 ] - I suggest the insertion in section 14 of the principal act of a new sub-paragraph. move That the following new sub-paragraph be added to paragraph (6) :""(bb) Cash or shares received from a company by a prospector or lease-holder as consideration for the assignment or transfer of any claim, lease, licence, or other title, held the Mining Act of any state."" I greatly appreciate what the Government has already done in exempting from income tax the profits from gold mining, but. I desire the positive exemption of the income of prospectors.' I believe that in a recent case the Commissioner refused, to exempt a prospector because his title was not a lease but a licence. I do not wish a loop-hole to be left, so that it may be said that a prospector is engaged in the business of prospecting, and that his income is therefore taxable under the section providing for the taxation of profits derived from a business. The amendment, which contains nothing that might prove dangerous, is intended to help the ordinary prospector who is endeavouring to develop a property. He should not be taxed on the result of his arduous labours, from which, generally, he derives very little profit. He should not be taxed on the value of any shares given to him as a reward for his prospecting work.",36
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [6.22] - The Government intends to exempt those who are tryin g to find, or to develop, gold-fields, but not those who make a business of buying and selling leases. .To that end it is proposed to introduce in this bill a clause exemptingThe income derived by a person from the working of a mining property in Australia principally for the purpose of obtaining goldthis exemption shall extend .to dividends paid by a company out of such income. That will apply to companies which are now mining for gold in Australia, whether their original capital is paid up or not. The Government desires that they shall be encouraged. The case of the small prospector is dealt with in the clause dealing with leases. ""When the amending bill , which has been rendered necessary because of the Dalrymple decision, is brought down, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) will have an opportunity to bring forward the case of the small prospector. The Government is anxious to meet the case of the small prospector, but it is not desirous of exempting from payI ment of income tax those persons who make a business of buying and selling leases. The present exemption includes sales by bona fide prospectors, whether by traffic, trade, or otherwise, arid also applies to the proceeds of the sale of a minunder ing property when the Commissioner is satisfied that the lease has been sold by persons who do not make a business of buying or selling such properties, and who purchased the lease from a bona fide prospector, and work the property in a. proper and efficient manner. The only people who are not covered at present, and who, under this clause, will be liable to pay tax, are those who make a business of buying and selling mining properties. All others are included.",36

It is very difficult for us to discuss a bill which we have not seen. I haye no doubt that the Treasurer believes that the bill which he proposes to introduce will provide the honourable member for Perth with an opportunity to move. his amendment, but when the bill comes before us we may find that it does not do so. That bill will, I take it , deal only with leases. I understand that it is a bill to tax, as income, the proceeds of the sales of leases other than mining leases.",36

' (2A.) The company shall pay to tha Commissioner the amount of the tax and additional tax assessed under the last preceding sub-section.'"" The amendment carries out in simpler terms the intention of the original clause. Two years It was thought that it would apply to a series of holding companies which might be formed simply for the purpose of evading taxation, but it did not completely fill, the bill. Consequently, the clause has been amended to make it absolutely certain. The object aimed at by the amendment is the simplification of the method, by which the additional tax assessed under section 2.1 may be recovered, by action in the courts, if necessary, and by the collection through the company of income tax payable by individuals on any additional sum which the Commissioner considers the company could reasonably have distributed to its shareholders. Under the law as it stands, the Commissioner has no power to require the primary company to pay taxation on behalf of the person who is the real and final person holding an interest in the company. The claUse in its amended for m will give the Commissioner power to collect the additional taxation. The position has been completely changed from 1922. Under the alterations made last year companies were required to pay Is. in the £ 1 instead of at the rate of 2s. 5d. on the undistributed profits. Though the Commissioner had power to assess the amount of profits which should fol- have been distributed, he could not get any more taxation from the company. The clause has been drafted to enable the Commissioner to assess the shareholders, and . collect from the company the amount which would have been due to the CrowiO if the profits had been properly distributed. Of course, it is desirable to get the closest approximation to equity that can be obtained. I am sure that all honourable members listened very attentively this afternoon to the honourable member for Yarra, but every one must realise the position we are now in . On the taxation system evolved in 1915, there has been built up a series of taxation measures and regulations, and we have a Public Service trained in those methods. passed the peak of taxation. Our highest year was 1921. Since then we have been gradually coming down. Eventually, we hope to completely evacuate the field of income taxation. It would obviously be verydifficult, and would lead to endless work if we completely altered the system now. Though we may agree with the honourable member for Y a r r a that there could be a better system., we may differ with him >ns to the best system that could be devised, and the compromise might be worse than the present system. do not think the present is an opportune time to completely revise the present system. The clause does not touch that principle. It is simply signed to prevent evasion of taxation by those who ought to pay it . (Mr Scullin (Y a r r a ) [8.25] - The difficulty that honourable members are faced with in connection with these amendments is that they were only circulated just before the dinner-hour adjournment. It is not fair to us to thoroughly understand their meaning. The amendment now before the committee appears at first sight to accomplish what the bil l was intended to do, ancl I can at least say for it that it is couched in simpler language; - but I am loth to say definitely that it accomplishes all that the original clause did. In that clause there was this very wide definition of "" shareholders "" For the purpose of the last preceding section, "" shareholders "" includes(a) a beneficiary in a trust estate (.the trustee of which, either directly or through the interposition of any other trusts or of any companies, is a shareholder in the company) who is not under a legal disability and who is. presently entitled to a share of the income of the trust estate; and (6) a shareholder of a company which, either directly or through the inter'position of any other companies or of any trustees, is a shareholder of the company in respect of which the Commissioner has made a determination under sub-section (1.) of this section. Thus the shareholder included a shareholder in any subsidiary company. We have not that definition in the bill now, but we do seem to achieve the sam'e end in simpler language. Let us assume that We have the Government, by this clause, will accomplish what it sets out to achieve. I can still see the possibility of an evasion of the law. I agree with the Treasurer that the situation entirely changed when we departed from the taxation of companies at a rate which approximated the average rate of tax which the dividend receivers paid. Prior to last year, the company tax was 2s. 5d. in the f l on undistributed profits. Before then it was 2s. 8d. We arrived at 2s. 5d. or 2s. 8d. in a rough and ready way as the I average rate of income tax paid by the receivers of dividends. Last year, as I have already pointed out, the company rate was fixed at Is., and as a result there de- was a temptation to companies to get as much of their profits into reserves as possible, and to have as little as possible distributed in dividends. This is what the tax dodgers have been doing most effectively. The purpose of this amending legislation is to try to stop that practice. I do not want to dogmatize on this subject, but I suggest that even yet those expect who set themselves out to evade taxation may be able to do so. The amendment deals, only with undistributed profits. Under section 21, the Commissioner has power to deal only with a company that has not distributed at least two-thirds of its profits. Let us see what may happen even now. Let us assume that trading company "" A "" distributes two-thirds of its profits. The Commissioner cannot in terfere. The company is taxed at Is. in the £1 on the whole df its profits. If the Commissioner determines to follow the two-thirds of profits distributed, he may find that they are held by a holding company "" B . "" The profits of this holding company do not come under section 21. They must be treated as distributed dividends from company "" A , "" and one-third can be reserved. In this way, the profits may be distributed in diminishing amounts. see how the amendment will meet the difficulty^ because it does not deal with profits that are not distributed. A company distributing two-thirds of its profits, which is the maximum which the Commissioner can compel it to distribute, does not have to comply with section 21 of the act. A f t e r the Commissioner has ascertained that two-thirds of the profits have been distributed it is found that the amount bas been passed on to an investing or holding company, and wben the Commissioner attempts to apply section 21 to, say. ''' B "" company, which is a holding company, he finds that as that company has already distributed two-thirds of its profits to another holding company, section 21 cannot apply. The Commissioner may also find on investigation that three, four,, or five other holding companies have each held one-third, and have distributed the remaining two-thirds.",40
107,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Does the honourable member suggest that each holding company is of the same size as the original trading company ? Mr Scullin"" - There may be nroprfetary companies with only two shareholders.",42
108,Dr EABLEP AGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,W it h the same number of shares?',42
109,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,A holding company can be formed and take over practically the whole of the shares in the original' trading' company.,42

111,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,What other expenses would it have ?',42
112,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,A holding company has hardly any expenses.,42
113,Mr MAXWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY,"And the holding pany distributes two-thirds of the two-thirds, of the profits, it received from the trading, company..",42
114,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Yes, , until the amount is diminished to such an extent that there is no taxable income.",42
115,Mr FOSTEB,MEAT INDUSTRY,Reall y a bogus company.,42
116,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Yes , a formed for the purpose which, apart from the expenses of registration, does not in cur any expenditure. It has been suggested during the debate that we should be able to define boguscompanies.. Purely bogus companies can' bedetected and dealt with under special legislation. But who is to be the judge of what is and what is not a bogus company? They I cannot secure their position by having a certain, amount of legitimate holdings-if anything is legitimate, and I have very grave doubts about it - in oue company or another. Some shipping companies hold large interests in. meat works and in coal mines, and I have in mind a company the bulk of whose capital is invested in a number of other companies. On what basis of equity can we allow companies to retain each year in reserve one-third of their profits so that within three years they get away with a full year's profit while paying the lower instead of the higher rate. In that way the Commissioner treats companies differently from, members of an individual firm who pay income taxation on the whole of their profits 1 Why should not the shareholders pay income taxation cm the profits which come under the taxable amount? So long as this is not"" done the department will be faced with difficulties. This provision will not meet the situation. When the Income Tax Rates Bill is before the House I intend to suggest an increase in the company's rate. If we inserted a penal clause we could to some extent i m prove the position, but I do not see how we can altogether avoid the existing anomaly under the present law. If an original trading company does not distribute its profits it is evading taxation.. When this measure is passed, and the Commissioner deems that two-thirds of the profits of a company have been distributed, the companies will adopt different methods.",42
117,Mr GREGORY,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Coul d it not be provided that the dividend should be paid to individuals, and not to a company ?",42
118,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"The holding company is the shareholder. How can thecom- dividend be paid to au individual who does not hold the shares? If a shareholder in a tradingcompany disposes of his' interest to an investment or holding company, he ceasesi to be a shareholder in the trading company. If a personholding a controlling interest in a trading, company disposes of his shares,, he company receives in exchange sharesi n an investment or .holding company. Under the existing law, when the Commissionerdeems* that two'-thirds of the trading company's profits have been distributed, he can follow the profits to the holding companies, which pay Is. in the £ 1 on the undistributed! profits, less a rebate of Is. in the £ 1 , which meansthat they escape taxation. For the information of the Prime Minister :(Mr iBruce), who was temporarily .absent, I 'shall repeat, that when a trading company distributes two-thirds of its profits, section 21 - of the act does not apply. The two-thirds o l the profits .so distributed may .go to a holding company., and ;as the section I have mentioned does not apply, the 'Commissioner cannot interfere.",42
119,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,Why !,43

136,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"If the right honourable gentleman - wishes to refer ito - state .taxation 'on companies, I may .mention - that the Tate in Victoria is Is. The point with which I ana dealing is that under the present system some persons .pay 5s. in the £ 1 federal tax, whilst 'Others pay only Is . in tibe £ 1 on ;a similar income. The Prime M in ister has - stated that we cannot iget away - f itom that. It ican 'only be done by .altering the whole system .of taxation, and undoing what we did last year. I admit that the Government aue attempting to >catch the tax dodgers, but they cannot, ;as, the Prime Minister admitted, sucoeed by this - means. A proprietary company may consist of two shareholders, :arad a limited - company of five 'shaoeholders, and the - only «osts ineumed in forming one of these .companies - would be those involved in registration and in issuing - the scrip-, I am not - advocating the adoption of the British system., although I admit it is preferable to ours.",43
137,Mr QBBUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,The British system 'is .identical.,43
138,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,It is not.,43
139,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"It is taxation at the source. Mr ' SCULLIN - Undoubtedl y it is retaxation at the source, and that is why do not like it . But uuder British legislation - every shareholder receives a rebate of, after the dividend is distributed, whereas a here a rebate is allowed .only to those who is have a taxable income. Persons with a small income which is not taxable, and ' who receive .a few pounds by way of dividends, pay at the rate '©£ Is . in the £ 1 . That is not done in Great B r it a in . Under British legislation the company pays 4s., and every shareholder who comes along with his dividend warrant, whether he is taxable or not, under the act receives a rebate; but we only give a rebate to those ""whose incomes taxable. Persons at present receiving less than £200 do not receive any rebate, and when this measure is passed those whose income does not exceed £300 will not benefit. By raising the exemption from £200 to £300 we are assisting 80 per cent, or 90 per cent, of the taxpayers, but are injurin g many small shareholders in companies. Last year a similar measure was rushed through Parliament during an all-night sitting, when the closure was frequently applied, and the Government are now trying to patch it up in order to save revenue. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been lost, and we are now asked to pass retrospective legislation, which I always regard as vicious-althoug h I do not so regard it in this case-to overcome the. mistakes of the past. I submit that this measure will not prevent tax dodgers evading taxation so long as they have the opportunity to contribute only Is. in the £'i. There are three methods which can be considered. The British system is a simple one, which deems that all profits of a company are distributed, and they are followed up. The act amended last year under which 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 was i m posed on undistributed profits, although inequitable, was preferable to the present act, and was better from the revenue point of view, because there was not the' same incentive to avoid taxation. When Is. in the £ 1 is imposed, companies are tempted to carry large sums into reserve, on which they pay a rate of Is. in the £1. Early next year, I hope the Treasurer will introduce another amending bill, to try to deal with the tax dodgers.",43
140,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [8.45] - The point which the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin) has taken deals with the whole basis of company taxation, as laid down in section 21. That section was designed to meet a certain type of case, but that which it was intended to obviate would happen under whatever system we might adopt. cannot be obviated by the system of taxation at the source, which we now have, or by providing that a company shall pay tax only upon the undistributed portion of its income, the remainder being followed into the hands of the individual shareholders, and taxed at the rate applicable to individual incomes. The are' honourable member stated that the English system is quite different from our own. I dispute that statement. The English system is almost the same as ours, the only exception being that under the English act a rebate is allowed. In Great Britain the taxation is levied at the source in the same way that ours is levied. The English system has no great advantages over that of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, they have had to follow our legislation by inserting in their act a provision similar to section 21 of the Commonwealth statute. That action was taken only twelve or eighteen months ago. Prior to that there was no provision by which it could be assumed that a company had made a bigger distribution than actually had been made. They had no provision of this kind. Those methods of avoiding taxation which the honourable member has suggested are possible here, by means of the creation of holding companies, could be adopted without any check at all in Great Britain , u n t i l a section similar to section 21 of our act was inserted in the British act.",44
141,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,In Britain they could not get away with a small tax of Is.,44
142,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"In ore-war days they could get away with very much less. The honourable member referred to the nonallowance of a rebate to a shareholder in Australia whose rate of tax is less than Is. in the £ 1 . That provision was in serted in our act in order to avoid complexity. I think that every honourable member will admit that the act is quite complex enough as it stands; but it would be still more complex if the alteration suggested by the honourable member were made. Such a provision is not necessary when the tax is only Is. in the £ 1 , but it is very necessary where, as in Great Britain , the tax is 4s. in the £ 1 . It has been suggested that it is only the small taxpayer who pays this tax. He does nothing of the sort. The tax is paid by the company. It could be said that it was paid by the shareholder if the tax were sufficiently high to' affect the diviIt dend, which, in other words, is the in come that goes to the individual shareholder. But where the tax is only Is. in the £ 1 , it cannot have the slightest upon the dividend that the small sharereasonable holder receives. We should be adding still further to the complexity of an act that is already hopelessly complex if we in - tributed. serted what the honourable member sughad gests. The section is principally tended to ensure that persons who have lai'ge incomes from companies shall not evade their obligation pay income tax by reason of the failure of companies to distribute a reasonable bution of 50 per cent. portion of their annual earnings. A very limited number of companies would resort to thatmeans of attempting to evad?. that taxation. No ordinary public company, that has its shares on the market, would hold up the whole of its annual income and uot distribute it amongst its shareholders. It must distribute a certain portion to its shareholders. Mr W . M . HUGHES - Quite recently, the. House of Lords decided that profits sion of its business. that are distributed in the form of ehares, and thus.in effect increase the capital of a company, are not taxable.",44
143,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,The right honourable gentleman refers to the bonus share sysf tem. We have not to rely upon a decision of the House of Lords in such a case; have definitely provided for that contina gency in the act itself. Mr W . M . HUGHES - The shares can be put on the market and sold.,45
144,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"That point is quite different from the one that we are now considering - We are dealing now with . i company that retains its profits. A company that had a large number of shareprofits holders could not do that. The shareholders would immediately demand the distribuprofits tion of the income to which they were enits titled. Such companies can, therefore, at once be dismissed from this consideration. Such a provision as that suggested by the honourable member for Y a r r a can conrequirements of the business. template only what are known as "" onegested man "" companies-on e man holding all the shares in a private company; but, order to comply with the companies law, giving one share each to a few We have to endeavour to make it impossible for such companies to evade the taxalike mushrooms. tion they are entitled to pay. This matter was very exhaustively reviewed when the consolidating act of 1922 was introexamine duced. Prior to that time, we had a secthere tion of this character which provided that if the Income Tax Commissioner decided effeeo that a company had not distributed a portion of its profits, he had no option but to say that the whole of the profits must be deemed to have been disI f , for instance, a company distributed 30 per cent, of its profits, in - and the Commissioner decided that that was not a reasonable distribution, but that 50 per cent, would have been, to he had no power, prior to 1922, to levy tax on the basis of a distriHe had to levy tax upon the whole of the profits. Either he had to refrain from declaring a sufficient portion of the profits had not been distributed, because, by doing so, he would be compelled to commit an act of gross inequity by imposing taxation on the whole of the profits, or he had to so act that it would be impossible for a company to retain a reasonable amount for reserves and for the future expanThe unsatisfactory nature of the position was appreciated when the consolidating act was introduced in 1922. The matter was examined r o m every angle, and it was decided that the Commissioner should not have the - we power to pursue the matter further if company had distributed two-thirds of its profits. He had to see that the company had made a reasonable distribution. It is perfectly true that, in some cases, it might not be a reasonable distribution, but there are very few companies in respect of which it could be said that a distribution of two-thirds of its was not reasonable. An ordinary company ought to retain one-third of its to build up its reserves and ensure stability. It can be regarded as reasonable, therefore, if two-thirds of the profits have been distributed and one-third is retained for a reserve to meet the f u t u r e It is sugthat that is not altogether satisfactory because of the existence of these onei n man companies. It must be remembered, however, that there are not a great numnominees. ber of those companies.",45
145,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,They are springing up,45
146,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"If honourable members the returns, they will find that are not many persons who can affordto leave the greater part of their - profits in any company, even if it will relieve them from a certain amount of income tax. f hey may save a little in i/bat direction, tout t'hey are under tike disadvantage that - the money - so locked up is not available for itheir current expenses, it is further argued that a company can invest its profits in other companies, and thereby avoid the payment of taxation. Lt uaiust foe remenaibened, however,, that each of those 'other companies must observe the two-thirds standard. apart from the - complexity involved gistering one company after another, - there is the further disadvantage that the ancome always is a diminishing one, and the difficulties areaugmented fey every transaction. Nobody can carry out a series of transactions of that sort. Money - so invested is withdrawn from current come, and is not available for ordinary purposes. It must also be remembered that that money cannot he handled u n t i l the - company is wound up. I had a good deal to do - with this matter when the consolidating act - was duced, and I helieve that a reasonable 'basis has been adopted. ' It - would be quite unreasonable to assume - tJiat the whole of the profits had heen distributed. 'The h a r m to the community would he greater than the advantage gained from catching a few persons who were endeavouring to avoid their taxation obligations. In a country such as Australia,, our one aim should be to build up industries and to encourage those who are controlling industry through the agency of a joint-stock company not to distribute too great a part of their profits, but, on the contrary, to retain as much as possible for the expansion and stabilization of their business.",45
147,Mr GREGORY,MEAT INDUSTRY,Does not that apply to an individual as well as to a company?,46
148,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"It does. The honourable member infers that the .treatment of the individual is different from that of the company. It has been suggested that they should be dealt with on the same basis. I point out to the honourable member that it is open to any person to turn his business into a private company if he thinks that it is advantageous to do so. Thene are no better means for employing - capital developinentallv than are offered under the joint-stock system, which is universally adopted, and under which are - drawn together the small contributions of many persons, the aggregate sum being utilised in carrying on a great industry. The point raised by the honourable membei for Swam {. Mr .Gregory) was full y considered in 1922, .and- :a mew provision was - inserted in the act - dealing with partnerships and private individuals. Mr GiREGOiRr - The argument of the - honourable member for Y a r r a was that large shareholders now put their diviQuite dends into holding 'companies and escape in - rethe payment of taxation.",46
149,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"There is nothing to prevent a man from investing his dividend in a holding company, but it is of - no use to him .if he cannot get it out - of the holding company. Mr .SCULLIN - He can buy bonds with in - it and draw 6 i per cent, interest.",46
150,Mr RRTJCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"I stress the point that that system does not confer any advantage upon the majority of the people of this country. Only a few individuals can - afford to do it . Nothing is gained intro- by creating a holding company and putting in to it the - dividends you obtain from some "" other company, if you cannot get them out of the second company for your ordinary purposes year by year without paying taxation. Once you invest in "" B "" company a dividend obtained .from "" A "" company you cannot get at that income u n t i l "" B "" company declares a dividend. That dividend immediately becomes taxable. The transaction is not nearly so simple as it - sounds. It would be impossible to devise an absolutely perfect system without making it so complex that it could not be administered. The honourable member for Yarra said that our objective should be to bring about equity and simplicity. It is extraordinarily difficult to reconcile 'One with the other. The more equitable you are the more complex you become. The less complex you are the less equitable you become. It is the duty of the legislature to prevent evasion of taxation as far as possible. Section 21, which gives the Commissioner the right to insist upon a further distribution of profits if a company has not distributed at least two-thirds of its profits, provides a reasonable basis. It ensures that every company must make a fair distribution, but it does not penalize a company that is endeavouring to build up its business and make adequate reserves. It , at all events, limits the opportunity to avoid the payment of taxation, because :a person who forms a company with that object cannot, have the taxation withheld on a greater amount than one-third of the. profits that are 1 earned, l t is,. I think, obvious that an amendment of the' act. is necessary. Means have been discovered for getting over what was the intention of the legislature-. In the first place, a tax is imposed upon, a company which has not distributed a sufficient, amount of its profits-. Mr W.. M . HUGHES; - Who whether a sufficient amount has beendistributed ?",46
151,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,The Commissioner. Mr W . M . HUGHES - On what p r in aiple does he work?,47
152,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"He has to take account of the knownobligations of the company, the reserves that must be created, and so on; the whole basis is laid down. He is given a discretion to decide whether a company has not distributed two-thirds of its profits. If it has not, he can compel it to make a further distribution. Under the consolidating act thecompany has to pay the tax, which would, have beenpayable by the taxpayer if a distribution had been Prior to the passing of the consolidating act, it was the shareholder who had to pay, although no distribution of dividends had been madeto him, and he had no moneys from the company from which to meet the tax. To secure greater justice, it is provided that the company shall pay, and the basis upon which the company pays is the rate which would have been applicable to the shareholder if , in fact, he had enjoyed a dividend. Mr W . M . HUGHES' - What difference does it make, in the case of a one-man company ? Mr Bruce' - A one-man company is a company, of one shareholder, whose in come,, say, is £50,000 a year. If he is in the fortunate position of being able toleave his dividend in the company, the tax will be payable at the company rate. But if it comes to him as a shareholder, he may have to pay at the rate of 6s. or. 7s.. in th& £ 1 . Mr W. M . HUGHES;. - He - wil l be same man.",47
153,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,Bu the would prefer to pay at the rate of Is. rather than at the rate of 6s. or 7s. in the £ 1 . Mr W. M . HUGHES - He would only the lower tax.,47
154,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,No^ . not if the dividend came to him as a shareholder. Mr W . M . HUGHES. - The » he ought not to be in. a company; he ought to bein an asylum.,47
155,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"He tries to pay the one tax now and we aEe endeavouring to prevent. hii-n-i frontdoing thab. If he leaves what might be his; dividend in the company of which he is the one shareholder, he paysat the company rate,, insteadof at the ratedecides applicableto an income of £50,000a year. The Taxation Commissioner may then, say that there should have been a distribution* of a greater amount of the earnings of the company, and he may decide that the. distribution should be £10,000., The company would then have to pay on £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 at the 6s., 7s., or 8s. rate applicable to* the income of the shareholder instead of a.t the Is. rate. This does not suit the enterprising gentleman who is the sole shareholder of a company, and he proceeds ioregister a small holding company or syndicate, and give his shares to that syndicate. Then the Taxation Commissioner says, to the "" A "" company, "" Y o u have not distributed enough. You must, made. distribute so much, more."" The amount to be. distributed might be- £10,000', and the Commissioner would look to see who was the shareholder who would get the £10,000. He would find that it was another company, and so would only pay at the Is. Fate-. In order to defeat that, this amendment lays, it down that where a dis> tribution should have been, made by "" A "" ' company and' the shareholderis "" B "" company, the Taxation Commissioner takes no notice of "" W company in order to ascertain the rate of tax,, but finds out the rate which would have beenpayable by shareholders, in B ' company according; to their , r ! interest in "" B "" company, which gives, again the rate at which the big man should pay. The practice to which I referred is being met by one amendment of the law provided for in this bill . Another amendment is proposed to. meet the case where, instead of forming a holding company, shares are paid into the hands of a trustee, and the trustee is a shareholder in the the company. In this case, where a distribution has been ordered' by "" A . "" company, the Commissioner looks around for the shareholder and he finds that he is a trustee. Me ascertains what rate the pay trustee should pay, and he find's that he* has: no financial interest in the shares at. all, and therefore could nob be called upon to pay tax: at any rate. To get over that difficulty, it is proposed to go beyond the trustee to the beneficiary, charge tax at the rate applicable to the beneficiary. I think that honourable members will agree that these amendments are desirable and necessary. Coming back to the point raised by the honourable member for Yarra, I say, emphatically, that it is quite impossible \o do what he desires and provide that, in no conceivable circumstances, can anybody avoid paying tax at the rate applicable to his income. We could not do that, even if we adopted the system he has suggested of following the dividend into the hands of the shareholders and taxing them at their individual rate. That would be going back to the system - we had before, under which a company only paid the tax on undistributed income. I venture to say that the honourable member for Yarra was quite wrong in suggesting that the British system is better than our own, because the British system follows exactly the we have of taxing at the source. Under the Britisli system, there is no better means than we have here of meeting cases such as we have been discussing to-night. . Mr Scullin - Unde r the British system, they tax eventually in the hands of the recipient.",47
156,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"The honourable member contrasted the company rate of 4s. in f l in Great Britain, as against the of Is. in the f l in Australia; but difference is not so great as might bepart supposed. I remind the committee that the 4s. rate was imposed in Britain because of the war, and the pressure to which Britain was subjected during the war. Prior to the war, the British innot come tax was a negligible quantity. there Another fact which must be remembered relevant is that in Australia the system generally adopted by the states is to tax at the source. In New South Wales, for spect example, the tax which has to be paid by a company to the state is 2s. 6d. in the also £1, in addition to the Is. in the £1 payany, able to the Commonwealth. So that, person whilst a company carrying on business in Great Britain would pay tax at the rate of 4s. in the f 1, a company carrying on business in New South Wales would pay at the rate of 3s. 6d. in the £1, and difference is not very great. The quesevade tion whether we should tax at the source, or should tax only undistributed profits and- and tax dividends in the hands of shareholders, has been very exhaustively discussed in this House on many occasions. It was discussed from every aspect when we were considering the consolidating bill in 1922, and it was again the subject of consideration last year. I submit that the system we now propose will work quite satisfactorily. It embodies theprinciple of simplicity so absent from many provisions of the existing act, and it offer's no greater opportunity for those determined to evade taxation than is offered by the other system to which reference has been made during the debate.",48
157,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Kooyong) [9.12] - I venture to doubt whether the amendment proposed by the Treasurer will' secure the object he has in view. In the first place, there will be difficulty in following moneys along the track which has been plan referred to by various speakers. Apart from this, an easy method has suggested itself to me-of evading liability to taxation under this section. To give honourable members an example, I suggest that "" A "" is a company, which the Commissioner determines should make a larger distribution of its income. Suppose that income is earmarked, and it is possible to follow it down through "" B , "" "" C,"" the and "" D "" companies. If I am a sharerate holder of "" D "" company, and only a the shareholder of that company, and get of the distribution, then the proviso applies to me, and tax must be paid, beonly cause the words of the section areProvided that, where any person (other than a company,' trustee, or partnership) who is a shareholder of the company would (if had been successive distributions of the parts of the sum, or further sum determined by the Commissioner, to and by each company, trustee, and partnership, interposed between that person and the company in reof which the determination is made) have received a part of that sum or further sum, the Commissioner may, if he thinks fit, assess the tax and the additional-tax, if which would have - been payable by that if those distributions had been made. This applies, it will be seen, only to a case wliere the shareholder of "" D "" company is not a shareholder of "" A "" company. If I were a shareholder of "" D "" company, the and wished to enable "" A "" company to the application of the section, I should make myself a shareholder also of "" A i "" company. I would then no longer be a "" person who is not a shareholder of ""' A ' company."" As in that case the distribution would not be to a person who is not a shareholder of "" A "" company, but to a shareholder of "" D "" company, who is also a shareholder of "" A "" company, the section would not apply. From a cursory examination of the amendment, this device suggests itself to me as a means by which the payment of the tax might be evaded. I suggest to the Treasurer that if the amendment were altered to read, "" Provided that, where any person (other than a company, trustee or partnership) otherwise than as a shareholder of the company would . . . . have received. . . ."" and so on, the position would be met.",48
158,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Y a r r a ) [9.17] - I should not have spoken again on this amendment but for the remarks of the Prune Minister (Mr Bruce), who did not deal with the issues raised in this debate. The honourable member for Kooyoug (Mr Latham) has directed attention to one loophole, and has probably provided a patch for it , but it is significant that even the honourable member, with his legal mind, is unable to show how the larger breach that I discovered can be patched. Nor did the Prime Minister do so. Let me consider the remarks of the Prime Minister, and show whether he gave the committee the facts. He said that nothing could be done under this bill that could not be done under the British act. What I have been stressing is that there is not the incentive to do it under the British act that there is under our act. In England a company cannot escape with anything less than the company tax, which, on the latest figures I had, was 6s., but which the Prime Minister stated was 4s. The real reason why the provision is so dangerous is that the company tax in Australia is too low. To say that an English company could do under the British act what an Australian company could do imder the Australian act is to beg the question. If a British company 'did dodge the tax by transferring all its profits to reserve, it would still have to pay the company rate, which is four times the Australian company rate. The Prime Minister advanced a most extraordinary argument in reply to my remarks about small shareholders paying Is. in the £ 1 . [195] He said that the act would be made much more complex if these people were given a rebate. There would be very little complexity in it'. Under the English system a notification is attached to the dividend warrant saying that "" This dividend has paid a tax of so much in the £ 1 , which w i ll be refunded on the presentation of proof that you have received this."" That document is handed in , and the person receives the rebate. The system adds very little complexity to the work of.assessment. I submit that persons who are not taxable are as much entitled to rebates as those that are taxable. Thoso that are taxed 5d. in the £ ought to get tht, same rebate as those that are taxed 5s. in the JE1, but they do not get it under our inequitable system. The act lets off the wealthy man who has shares in a company, but hits the small man hard. The Prime Minister said that . the payment of the tax by companies would not have the slightest effect on th >. shareholders' dividends. If the small shareholder is not entitled to a rebate, then his fellow-shareholders are not entitled to it , but they get it , because they are big men. The small man does not get it , but the big man does. The arguments or excuses that are put forward to deprive the small man of the rebate canbe advanced with the same amount of logic, if there is any logic in it , to prevent the big men from getting a rebate. The Prime Minister said that public companies whose shares were on the market could not do this sort of thing, but would have to distribute their profits, because their shareholders would want dividends. I admit that, but we are not discussing such public companies, whose shares are quoted on the market, but companies whose shares are held by a few individuals. The daily newspapers every day contain notices of half a dozen registrations, the object of which is to evade income taxation and land taxation. That sort of thing has been done to the knowledge of the Government for a considerable time. This class of company, said the Prime Minister, is limited in number. I answer that argument by saying that such companies are 'springing up like mush-' rooms, and are not limited in number. He went on to say that there was a lot of complexity in forming and registering these companies. Tliere is no complexity in it . If he will refer to the notices of registration last week, he will see that one family in the State of Victoria registered seven companies, with the same directors in each of them. The total amount of capital was £90,000. Why did they break the business up into seven companies? Ih my opinion the answer is obvious. reply to an interjection by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M. Hughes), he said: "" If these individual firms wish to do it, they can form themselves into companies."" A moment before he had said that it was difficult and complex to form and register companies. If you are a big firm you can form yourself into a company, and the inducement is to do it, for by that means you can pass' a large part of the burden of taxation on to the "" other fellow who cannot, or is too honourable, to form a company. The speech of the Prime Minister was an example of special pleading. He said that the provision relating to the distribution of two-thirds of the profits waa reasonable. It may be reasonable for a new company, but it may be very unreasonable for an old-established company. The reasonableness of it depends on the position of the company. But I submit that the distribution is no more reasonable for a company than for a firm. If it is reasonable tor a company to be allowed to place one-third of its profits to reserves and pay only Is. in the £1 tax on them, it is equally reasonable for a firm to do so. This provision means that a company need pay only Is. in the £1, instead of the shareholders paying perhaps 5s. in the £1, on one year's income in every three years. The Prime Minister said that companies could not all afford to keep profits in reserve, because they wanted them, and that the provision applied to only a limited class of companies. Surely that is an argument on my side. It is because the provision applies to a small and privileged class that I object so strongly to it. I could understand him saying that because the provision applies to all taxpayers it is equitable. The truth is that it applies to a limited few, and those the wealthy few, who can afford to put their money in reserve, and not distribute it. Prime Minister also said, "" What is the use of these reserves being paid into a holding company if you cannot get them out? The moment the holding company pays out the money in dividends, the Government taxes it."" That kind of argument might deceive some people, but it will not deceive honourable members, boMr Scullin. cause it is well known to them that there are well-to-do firms the proprietors of which do not want to spend more than a fraction of their profits. If they received the profits in cash they would convert In them into bonds at 6} per cent., to pile up more profits. The holding company could do that out of profits that have paid Is. in the £ 1 , but which, if distributed as dividends, would have paid perhaps 5s. or 6s. in the £ 1 .",49
159,Mr COBSEB,MEAT INDUSTRY,Does not the honourable member know that many companies have had to write down their capital because they have paid too much in dividends ?,50
160,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,And does not the honourable member know that that statement is true of firms just as it is of companies?,50
161,Mr GREGORY,MEAT INDUSTRY,Au d what about individuals?,50
162,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,And individuals too. There is not one argument that can be put forward in favour of reserves for a company that cannot be put forward with equal force in favour of reserves for a private firm. An individual may take too much out of his business and spend it.,50
163,Mr COBSEB,MEAT INDUSTRY,Why should a company be forced to distribute more than two-thirds of its-profits in dividends?,50
164,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"I am not asking that auy company should be forced to pay anything in dividends, but I say that a company, for the purpose of ascertaining its taxable income, should be treated as if it was a private firm. It is impossible for honourable members to escape from the logic or justice of that argument. In my previous remarks I stated that the rate of tax imposed upon companies in Great Britain was 6s. in the £ 1 . I have since ascertained that it was 6s. in the £ 1 until an amendment was made this year, when it was reduced to 4s. 6d. It is now 4s. 6d., and not 4s., as stated by the Prime Minister. The purpose of the bill is to protect the revenue of this country. The Prime Minister argued that it would protect the revenue from the operations of the manipulators that had been forming holding companies As far as I have H The been able to read the bill in the limited time allowed to honourable members, it does so as far as section 21 of the principal act is concerned. That is to say, it will prevent the formation of holding companies to cheat the' revenue out of the taxation on the undistributed profits of a company. When I pointed out to the Prime Minister that the revenue could be cheated in another way, he admitted that that was so. The Commonwealth is losing revenue through the operations of manipulators and tax-dodgers, who form bogus companies in order to get the benefit of the Is. rate instead of the higher rate applicable to individuals, and I am showing that even if the proposal contained in this clause is accepted, they will still be able to evade taxation; they will not hold their profits, but each company in tur n will distribute two-thirds of them, and then section 21 will not apply. If one family has formed seven companies, other families may do likewise. So long as the company rate is Is. in the £ 1 , and the rates applicable to individuals are as-high as 7s. in the £ 1 , so long will means of evading the higher rate be found. The existing provision is more equitable and less easy of evasion. I admit that under any scheme we may adopt companies will still be formed which will put a certain amount of their profit into a reserve, f u n d ; but if the amounts carried to reserve are taxed at the rate of 2s. or 3s. in the £ 1 , the Commonwealth will not be cheated to the same extent as it is at present. I suggest that the Treasurer should reconsider this matter, so that when the bill declaring the rate of taxation is before us, an amendment may be made to tax profits carried to reserve at the same rate as the individual shareholders would pay if such amounts were distributed. Mr W . M . HUGHES (No r t h Sydney) [9.32] - It is very much to be regretted that the amendments contained in the bill are brought forward in such a way as to make it difficult to understand what their effect will be upon the principal to say nothing of their effect upon the taxpayer. Like the Prime Minister, I deplore the complexity of this measure, and of the taxation system generally, but I was rather appalled to hear him say that it was impossible to get equity with simplicity. I suppose that from that remark we are to deduce that justice, like the peace of God, "" passeth all understanding."" I hope that is not so. The bill consists of fifteen clauses, which propose about 50 or 60 amendments to the act'. The Prime Minister has said that he is quite sure that these proposals are all right. I remember having heard a similar remark in previous years. Probably there was a time when I almost believed these assurances by the right honourable gentleman, but times' have changed, and I cannot now accept them unreservedly. The proposal to which the honourable member for Yarra has' directed attention is most difficult. Whatever we do, we shall probably wish that we had dome something else. The outstanding defect of the amendment is the tremendous power to be given to the Commissioner. For all practical purposes, the Commissioner will impose the taxation, but, unlike a god, he is not given dominion over the whole earth, or even this community; he cannot temper the wind to the shorn shareholder, but he may temper it to a company. I understand from the Prime Minister that the delinquents are few, and the righteous many, and so in practice the Commissioner has to deal with very few people who deliberately evade taxation. But human nature being what it is, I imagine that every company will sc arrange its affairs and statements as tc pay as little taxation as possible. That. I assume, is what all ordinary human beings, do. Companies are of two classes. In one class of company there are large numbers of small investors, of whom we hear a good deal in another connection. They form, as it were, the outer bulwark when the big companies are in danger, and, at such times, we are abjured to have regard for the small investors. But this bill does nothing for them; they have to pay on the higher rate - The other class are the one-man companies, which are not so rare as the Prime Minister professes to believe. The formation of such companies occurs as frequently as is profitable, and if this bill makes the subterfuge more profitable, there will be many more such companies. act, They are formed for the purpose of evading the tax or taking advantage of the act. The right honourable gentleman if in a cleft stick. If he imposes excessive taxation so that no money will be available for the expansion of business, it will be a fatal check to progress. The amendment, we are told, will allow for the expansion of industry, while at the same time assuring to the Taxation Department a fair return. This method, however, doe? not appeal to me as likely to be more satisfactory than the present system or thai which obtained in 1922. The one-man company is no more entitled to consideration than is the private individual. In fact, such a company was aprivate individual before this method of taxation made it profitable for him to become a company. He should continue to be regarded as an individual, as in fact he is. If we are to give as much latitude to the Commissioner as is proposed, it would be better to give him power to say what is a bona fide company, as distinguished from a company formed for thei evasion of taxation, rather than invest him with authority to require one taxpayer to pay a much higher rate than another. I can make no suggestions for improving the bill. I have at various times made a good many suggestions in connection with measures of this kind, and I have conie to the conclusion thab as fast as we block up one hole another appears elsewherp I look forward with a certain degree of chastened expectation to hearing once more about this time next year another bill-introduced, and being told once more that at last the department has evolved an equitable and effective scheme of taxation. I suppose it is futile to suggest that it would be well to leave the law as it is at present, so that we may have an opportunity during the recess to look carefully through the bill, and discuss with those who are affected by it what its consequences are likely to be. We could then return to the consideration of the measure with our minds refreshed and enlightened. I certainly think that it would be better to postpone the bill. I do not wish to vote against this clause, but judging it by and large, I am not in - favour of the bill .",50
165,Mr GREGORY,MEAT INDUSTRY,Swan) [ 9 . 4 3 ] - I would like the Government to give us an assurance that next year a consolidating income tax assessment bill will be introduced. I have received many complaints regarding the difficulty of understanding the principal act and the various amendments thereto.,52
166,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,As recently as 1922 consolidated all the income tax assessment laws.,52
167,Mr GREGORY,MEAT INDUSTRY,And have been amending them ever since.,52
168,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,Onl y last year.,52
169,Mr GREGORY,MEAT INDUSTRY,"And no sooner did the Treasurer introduce this bill , which he said would give us a very much i m proved system, than he tabled a long list of amendments to further improve the improvements. I do not understand the bill , altered as it is by the long list further amendments. Like most able members, I depend upon specialists for information regarding the effects of the taxation system and proposed amendments thereto. Having regard to what I have been able to glean from this discussion to-night, and conversation with those who have made a study of this matter, I am not satisfied with the proposed amendments relating to the taxation of companies. Would it not be possible to . make it incumbent on any company receiving income in the shape of dividends from another compan)' to pay duty on that income on the basis on which an individual pays 1",52
170,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,It would be necessary to have a special company rate for that particular form of income.,52
171,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"The honourable member's suggestion would disturb the whole basis of a joint stock company, formed as an investment company.",52
172,Mr GREGOEY,MEAT INDUSTRY,"If a person forms a company and holds 99 per cent, of the shares and makes a profit of £60,000, he may subsequently form an investment company whose income is probably the greater proportion of £60,000. No taxation would be payable upon that £60,000, other than on the income derived from its investment, whereas, if an individual received the same amount he would be called upon to pay taxation upon it at the highest rate. I cannot understand this keen desire to protect the company as against the individual. I agree with the Prime Minister that it is an advantage to have joint stock companies formed in Australia, but I think that the income they receive from the shares held by them in other companies should be subject to the same rate of taxation as is paid by individuals. No person should be allowed to escape his fair share of taxation by the we formation of a bogus company, or even by promoting a legitimate company to build up a huge concern 'which may ultimately bring him a large profit.",52
173,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.48] - I rise to deal first of all with one or two matters touched upon by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin), and especially to dissipate the idea which - the honourable member has formed that the imposition of a tax of Is. in the £ 1 at the source of operates harshly in the case of small in honorvestors in companies. As fashioned last year, the act operates more favourably to the small man than it does to the big man. If a person has an income of £400, of which £200 is derived from personal exertion, and £200 from dividends, the taxa'tion of the £200 at the source automatically puts him completely outside the scale of taxation on his income from personal exertion. A man with an income of £400 from personal exertion and £400 from dividends, is simply taxed at the rate of £400 . M i . SCULLIN - Bu the also pays at the rate of Is. in the £ 1 on the other £400.",52
174,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"The man with the larger income pays a higher rate than Is., because the dividend he receives is used, together with his personal exertion income, to determine the rate of his tax. The smaller man frequently gets clean out of the taxable field, by reason of the fact that the dividends he receives are not taken into account at all. The second question raised by the honourable member was the continual formation of companies. But the honourable member forgets that in every state, except Victoria, the taxation on companies is very severe. In New South Wales, the rate is 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 , and I believe it is 3s. 9d. in the £ 1 in Queensland, which rates, with the Is. added by the Commonwealth,' make a fairly formidable impost on the formation of companies. The honourable member also forgets that the existing act makes provision for the individual conducting a business. Section 30 provides""(1.) Where an individual derives income from a business carried on by himself or in partnership with other persons, and his rate of tax on that income exceeds 2s. od. in ihe £1, he shall be entitled to a rebate in his assessment of a sum equal to the amount by which his tax on fifteen per centum of that income exceeds the tax that would be payable at 2s. 5d. in the £1 on that percentage of that income. (2.) In this section ""business"" means a business, which, from its nature and character requires for its efficient working the retention in the business of some part of the income of each year. Th'e individual therefore has a certain amount of consideration extended to him as against the company, although I admit the 15 per cent, he may keep in hand is not as great as the 30 per cent, which the company may keep in reserve. According to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes), this bill is not receiving the consideration it should get, and no attempt has been made to acquaint honourable members with what the actual amendments are. This is not so, for amemorandum , has been circulated showing honourable members at a glance how the amendments affect the original act. Furthermore, the second reading wns moved five days ago, and all the information available has been in the hands of honourable members since then. There may be some occasion to dispute the general principle underlying the biU, but ns I have previously said, income taxation by the Commonwealth is not today as burning a question as it was a few years ago. I admit that its basis may be unsound, but that basis was deliberately adopted by a previous Parliament. An y proposal to alter it now reminds me of what occurred in the case of an operation I performed some years ago. The patient had a tumour on his shoulder which necessitated the removal of the whole of his forequarter. When the operation was completed, the doctor who was administering the anaesthetic asked, "" W h i c h part of him shall we put to bed "" ? If we try to deal with the principle underlying this legislation, I am a f r a id that when we complete our task, it will be impossible to say what portion of it ought to be left, or what portion ought to be thrown away. The amendment suggested by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . Latham), in paragraph 2 of the amendment, is a good one. It makes the intention of the amendment clearer. Amendment- (by Mr LATHAM ) agreed toThat the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" who is not '-"" after "" partnership,'' first occurring in the proviso, with a view to insert in lien thereof the words "" otherwise than as."" Amendment, as amended, agreed to. Olause 7Section 23 of the principal act is amended(e) by omitting paragraph (e) of sub-section (1.) thereof and inserting in its stead the following paragraph:(c) (ii) such sum as the Commissioner I thinks just and reasonable as representing the diminution in Value during the year in which the income was derived of any machinery, implements, utensils, rolling-stock, and articles used by the taxpayer for the purpose of producing income: Provided that the following conditions shall apply in relation to the deduction of sums under sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph :(5.) Where a person, from whose assessable income a deduction has .been made to which condition (4.) of this paragraph applies, sells or otherwise disposes of the machine. . . . If the sale price exceeds the depreciated value, the amount of the excess shall be brought to account as income of that year;",53
175,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.59],- I move That after the word "" excess"" in proposed new paragraph (e) (ii) (5.), the words "" to the extent of the total sum of the amounts allowed by the Commissioner in any previous assessments in respect of the depreciation of the machine, implement, utensil, rolling-stock, or article "" be inserted. The clause proposes to amend section 23 of the principal act relating to deductions by altering sub-section 1, paragraph b, in order to provide that where a taxpayer claims an exemption for rates and taxes paid by him, they must be rates and taxes for which he is personally liable, and not taxes paid by him on behalf of others. Another amendment in the same paragraph adds the words "" or any war-time profit tax."" A deduction of war-time profits tax paid is allowable in the assessment of the year in which the payment was made. But an adjustment may have been made in the assessment of the wartime profits tax by reducing that tax to the extent of the actual tax charged, and it is therefore necessary to make this amendment, so that it is absolutely clear that no double deduction can be claimed in respect of war-time profits tax already paid. The remainder of the clause deals with deductions that may be made in respect of the depreciation of machinery and plant. It provides for .a much bigger concession than hitherto. It first of all re-states the existing law and provides for an alternative. basis of deduction and for the taxpayer adhering to his choice in all future assessments. claims have been made over a number of years for some provision to meet the cost of replacing obsolete machinery, and the Government believes that the enactment of the clause will lead to the replacement of obsolete machinery with more modern plant, particularly in such establishments as butter factories. The amendment to the clause as printed is necessary owing to the fact that as the clause stands it requires a taxpayer to treat as income the whole of any amount for which he may sell an asset in respect of which he has. previously obtained deductions under the heading of depreciation. The amendment will limit the taxpayer's liability in this respect. The reason for the limitation is that it follows the main important principle of the Income Tax Assessment Act, namely, that any profit on the disposal of a fixed capital asset is not subject to tax. The amendment will, of course, require the taxpayer to write back to taxable income all the previous deductions he has received as depreciation in any case in which his sale price for the asset exceeds its original cost price. If the sale price is less than the original cost but is greater than the value of the asset as written down by the previous depreciation deductions, the difference between the sale price and the written down value as mentioned is to be written back to income in the year of the sale of the asset. Amendment agreed to.",54
176,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Calare) [10.4]. - I move That the following new paragraph be added to the clause :""and (/) by inserting after sub-section (1.) thereof the following sub-section:' (IA ) . Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph (a) of the last preceding subsection, any person who is liable to render a return of income for the purposes of this act, and who proves to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that(o) he is carrying on agricultural or pastoral pursuits in a district which is subject to the ravages of animal pests; and (6) that he has expended money for, or entered into a contract or undertaking with the .

The purpose of the amendment is to provide that a settler who has purchased and erected wire netting, but who probably still has ten or fifteen annual payments to make on it , will be able to deduct the amount of those payments as they are made. I hope the Treasurer will accept it, for it is only a continuation of the policy which has already been agreed to in the Advances to Settlers Act. Dr EABLEPAGE , - I accept the amendment.",54

I do not see any difference between allowing the exemption of expenditure on wire netting and in allowing the exemption of expenses incurred in the eradication of weeds or the destruction of rabbits. The man who goes into the heart of the Gippsland forest, and clears a block to carry on farming operations, might also be granted an exemption if this principle is to be adopted.",55

If exemption he has proposed were limited to struggling settlers, I should not raise my voice against it , b ut doubtless i be claimed by wealthy taxpayers who have many miles of wire netting on their runs, which add to the capital value of their properties.

181,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"I am glad to hear that, although the terms of the Victorian act are very limited. I should be more ready to accept the amendment before us if a maximum deduction for any one year were stated.",55
182,Dr EABLEPAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,Is it not desirable for a man to wire-net his property as soon as he can ?,55
183,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Yes , just as it is desirable that he should erect his barns and his dwelling-house and provide other conveniences as soon as possible.",55
184,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,The wire netting keeps the pests out.,55
185,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Yes , and that, adds to the value of the property. I take it that the object of the honourable member for Calare is to give relief to the struggling man, but I fail to see why this exemption should be granted to the big man who spends thousands of pounds on wire netting.",55

187,Mr LATHAM,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Kooyong) [10.11] One could The money spent on wire netting is a very desirable capital expenditure, but, as honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin) has pointed out, this is a proposal to deduct expenditure of a capital nature from income. This is a matter of policy, the and the Treasurer has given the reason why he is prepared to accept the amendment. However, I fai l to see why a dist will tinction should be made between a taxpayer who has entered into an undertaking with a government or a state authority for the purchase of wire netting, and a person whoprefers to procure it from a private source, for the advantage accruing from the erection of the netting is the same in each case. Mr M . CAMERON (Barker) [10.14] I entirely agree with the honourable member for ""Kooyong (Mr Latham). The amendment would not give relief to a large number of laud-holders in South Australia, whose wire netting has been supplied by the State Government through the local governing bodies.

189,Mr WEST,MEAT INDUSTRY,"East Sydney) [10.18]no period of Australia's history have farmers and pastoralists been better to pay income tax on money'spent on wire netting than they are at the present time. This Parliament has already granted bounties on dried f r u it , grapes and ter, and it will soon be known as the Parliament that, has given away the public money to people who do not need it. Its actions in this direction source of amusement among passengers on the trains between Melbourne and Sydney, and even honourable members supporting penses the Government are beginning to realise titioner the seriousness of the situation. I have never heard of any strong demand for the assistance proposed under the amendment. I have endeavoured to ascertain the numpayer's ber of absentee land-owners who are making fortunes out of the properties held them in Australia. There are other ways in which the Government can ease the burden of taxation.",56
190,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,This will bring more by way of land and income taxes than we shall lose by it .,56
191,Mr WEST,MEAT INDUSTRY,"As Australia has to meet heavy expenditure in connection with war loans and interest, the Commonwealth should not deprive itself of the right to collect income tax. Last year our indebtedness was reduced by about £9,000,000, but at the same time we loaded it to the extent of about £20,000,000. There is no necessity for these exemptions. The people who will be affected have not asked for them. If it were but a few months before the next election I could understand the action of the Treasurer and members of the Country party in making these concessions. Because of the measures which it has introduced-measure s dealing with butter, dried fruits, and other primary products-the Government is the laughing-stock of its own friends. The commuch mittee would be well advised to reject Amendment agreed to.",56
192,Mr FENTON,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Maribyrnong) [10.25], - The Treasurer says that he would not justified in"" going beyond the provisions the Victorian act in regard to deducnettions for medical expenses. That means of that the amendment which he proposes to The amendment of which I have given notice was not intended to apply to any one section - In of the community only, as I conthe sidered that any man, whatever his in able come, should be entitled to the deductions referred to therein. No deduction is more justified than' the medical, funeral or hospital expenses incurred for a man, buthis wife, or the members of his family. The Treasurer proposes to confine the demostduction to a taxable income of £800. The income tax form for the state of Vicare a toria contains the following: Deductions claimed in respect of medical expaid to any legally qualified medical pracor public or private hospital, nurse, or chemist on account of the illness of taxpayer, wife, or children under 21 years of age, or on account of funeral expenses paid (not exceeding £20) in respect of the death of taxwife, or any member of family under 2.1 years of age. by I suppose that I shall have to accept the offer of the Treasurer, and be thankful. If the amendment does not operate as we desire we shall probably be able to make in further amendments to it when a comprehensive income tax bill comes before us in the early part of next session.",56
193,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [10.28] - I move That the fallowing paragraph be added to the clause :(</) by inserting after paragraph n of subsection 1 thereof the following paragraph :(0) such ' part of the assessable income of a taxpayer whose taxable income does not exceed six hundred pounds(1) as is paid by him' to any legally qualified medical practitioner, public or private hospital, nurse or chemist in respect of any illness of, or operation upon the taxpayer or his wife or any of his children under the age of twenty-one years; and . (ii) not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of Twenty pounds as is paid by liim to any undertaker for funeral expenses arising out of the death of the wife of the taxpayer or of any of his children under the a,ge of twenty-one years. That is a provision now in the Victorian act, which the Government is prepared to accept. It practically covers the amendment of which notice has been given by th& honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton).",57
194,Mr GABB,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Angas) [10.29] - I should like to kuow whether the deductions to which we are now agreeing will apply to incomes derived during the year ended the 30th June last. I make this inquiry because returns showing the income for that year are due today in South Australia. If thb deductions for wire netting, and medical and funeral expenses are to be allowed for that year, what is the position of South Australian taxpayers ? I wish also to know whether the exemption of £300 is to apply to the present or past financial year ?",57
195,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [10.30] - The intention is to apply this bill to the present financial year, and for that reason the Government is tryin g to push it through the committee. When the honourable member for No r t h Sydney. (Mr W . M . Hughes) was speaking he suggested delaying the bill u n t i l the end of the year, but if that were done no benefit would be derived in the assessments and returns for this year, and considerable delay would be occasioned in assessing the income tax. is carried a public notification will be made, and taxpayers will be asked to send in full details.",57
196,Mr GABB,MEAT INDUSTRY,Then the taxpayers in South Australia who have furnished their returns to-night will have to furnish other [196] returns in order to take advantage of the provisions of the bill.,57
197,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"They will have to send in additional details. Amendment agreed to. Sir NEVILLE HOWSE CCalare) [10.32] - I m o v e That the following paragraph be added to the clause :"" ; and (h) by inserting the following new paragraph :(p) so much of the assessable income as the Commissioner is satisfied has been . donated by the taxpayer for research into the causes, prevention or cure of disease in human beings, animals or plants, to any authority which the Commissioner is satisfied is a public authority engaged in such research."" It is the duty .of the Government to carry out this work, and it will save expense if donations can be obtained for the purposes outlined in the amendment. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 8 agreed to. Clause 9 (Deductions to be allowed in certain cases).",57
198,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [10.34] - This clause is inserted iri the b i ll because the spirit and p r in ciple of the Income Tax Assessment Act is not to tax capital. The clause exempts from taxation any lease from the Commonwealth or a state being a perpetual lease without re-valuation, or a lease with a right of purchase. In future such leases will be regarded as practically freehold. This matter will be dealt with at greater length in a later bill dealing with leaseholds. Clause agreed to. Clause 10 agreed to. Clause 11 (Date of payment of tax).",57
199,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [10.35] - This amendment is in serted to meet the views advanced by the honourable member for Perth .(Mr Mann) for the separation of the payment of taxation, both state and federal, as set out on' the combined income tax for m . The time for payment is extended from 30 If the bill days to 60 days.",57
200,Mr SCULLIN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Y a r r a ) ^ [10.36] - I think 30 days is a fair period for payment. Money is worth something to a Government operating on a proper business footing. The loss of interest during the extra period of 30 days would be about £50,000 a year. Private firms are prepared to give a trade discount for payment within seven aud a smaller trade discount for payment within 30 days, but no consideration at a i l after that period. I know that the Government does not give any discount. It is paying 6£ per cent, for loans, and therefore this money should not be allowed to remain outstanding for 60 days. On the 31st June last there were uncollected £5,000,000 in federal income tax and land tax, and if the period of payment is extended to 60 days the loss in interest will be much greater. I am opposed to the clause.",57
201,Mr MANN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Perth) [10.37] - The clause does not go far One of the great . objections income tax is the fact that the whole of the tax is . levied at one time, which is very often an awkward time, leading to the dislocation of a man's domestic finance. One reason for the heavy iudirect taxation is that under it the people do not know what they are paying. The direct taxation is much lighter, but the limited period of payment makes it unpopular. It would be far better if the payment for income tax were spread over four quarters of the year.",58
202,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,MEAT INDUSTRY,That would a great convenience to many.,58
203,Mr MANN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"That is so. I hope that the committee will adopt the amendment, because, while it does not go as far as I should like, it is certainly some improvement to the bill.",58
204,Mr GABB,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Angas) [10.40] - I am also, opposed to the clause. I should like to know what is the position of certain people in South Australia who have not yet received their assessment for 1923. I understand that hundreds of assessments have not yet been issued. The Treasurer had a good deal to say about the economy that would be effected by the amalgamation of state and federal departments, but I am wondering what is going to happen to the South Australian taxpayers I have mentioned. Are we to assume that when they get their assessments, say, in January, 1925, they will have another 60 days within which to pay taxation that ought to have been paid within six months of June, 1923 ? Clause agreed to. Clause 12 (Liquidator to give notice).",58
205,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [10.43] - The purpose of the days, clause is to ensure that sufficient money shall be left in the hands of a liquidator to pay the various taxes.

206,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Cowper-Trea surer) [10.44] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I wish to take this opportunity to enough. inform the House that arrangeto ments have been completed for the issue in London, on 1st October, of Commonwealth treasury-bills to the amount of £3,000,000. Of this total, £2,000,000 will have a currency - of three months, and will bear interest at 3J per cent., and£1,000,000 will have a currency of four months, bearing interest at 4 per cent. The bills are being issued to provide money for carrying out a programme of developmental works already approved by Parliament. These include, under the department of the Postmaster-General, provision of additional telegraphic and be telephonic facilities throughout Australia.",58
207,Mr WEST,MEAT INDUSTRY,"East Sydney) [10.45] - I should like to know if the Prime Minister is in a, position to give honourable members further information with regard to the John Alee, which, it is understood, has left Port Darwin to assist in the search fbr the white women who are reported to be held captive by native tribes in Arnhemland, Northern Territory.",58
208,Mr MANN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Perth) [10.46] - I am loath to detain the House. But I feel obliged to do so, as this is the only opportunity I may have to refer to a matter which, in my opinion, is of very great importance to Australia. To-day we listened to a statement made . by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Pratten) of the intentions of the Government with regard to the terms upon which - British trade preference shall be granted. The fact that this matter has been dealt with by departmental regulations precludes the House from debating or expressing any opinion upon it . ",58
209,Mr MANN,MEAT INDUSTRY,"As every honourable member is aware, there has been very widespread discussion on this important question, whioh must seriously affect trade between the Motherland and Australia. II is bound to have a very important effect upon Imperial trade relationships. In fact, I consider it one of the gravest questions that could engage the attention of this House. The trade preference agreement between Canada and Australia waa thought to be of sufficient, importance to justify the Minister in submitting a aeries of resolutions to this House. Although only oho item was mentioned in the statement made today, I am inclined to think that in ita operation it will have a more widespread effect upon British trade than all the proposals contained in the treaty with Canada, but owing to the form in which it was submitted, the House will have no opportunity to discuss it . I view with considerable alarm the effect of this proposal upon our trade. From what the Minister said today, I believe that very many features of it have not been fully considered, and they certainly have not been fully explained to honourable members. I regret that I am forced to take advantage of this opportunity to protest against the manner in which the business has been dealt with. I am perfectly well aware of course, that there is one way in which the House may express disapproval of what has been done. The regulation-has not yet been passed. Presumably it will be passed within the next week or two, either just before or just after Parliament adjourns. The treaty will come into force on 1st April next, and Parliament will probably not be meeting again until about that time. The only way in which the House may alter the arrangement is by a definite motion, that the regulation be disallowed. That must be done within fifteen days after the gazettal of such regulation or, if Parliament be in recess, within fifteen days after it reassembles. Action then will probably be ineffective, for the simple reason that the regulation will have been in operation, and the necessary trade adjustments will have been made. Such an important matter involving onr Imperial trade relationships should not be dealt with BO lightly. A resolution by Cabinet should not go forth to the world aB the studied aud deliberate opinion of this HouBe. Ifc may bo the opinion of the majority of honourable, members that this action should be taken, but personally I do not think it is. It may be that the basis of preference should be altered, but I feel strongly that it should not be. At any rate, an opportunity should be given to the minority, however small, to expresB its disapproval, so that it cannot be represented to Great Britain that the people of Australia as a whole are in favour of taking this step, which, in my opinion, will prove to be one of the greatest hindrances to the future development of trade. It is a direct denial of the principle of preference to Great Britain,, because it is increasing the obstacles in the way of trade with Great Britain. ""Whatever may be said to the contrary by the Minister for Trade and Customs to the effect that it is intended to stop foreign trade, it can easily be shown that the result may have the effect of diminishing British trade, and throwing a greater quantity into foreign channels. I desire to take the earliest opportunity available of recording my protest against such an important matter being settled without the House having an opportunity to debate it. Even if the regulation were passed immediately, there would be no opportunity to debate it . The proposal should have been submitted to the House just as were the Canadian tariff proposals, which I - support, and which, with the infliction of this regulation in addition, may be the means of entirely prohibiting the importation of British newsprint, as the Canadian and British productions will come in on the same basis. Mr GABB. - A free trader does not believe is any preference.",59
210,Mr MANN,MEAT INDUSTRY,I have no objection to (he Canadian proposals.,59
211,Mr SPEAKER,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Kt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - The honourable member will realise that he is not entitled to discuss the subject of the proposed reciprocal trade arrangements between Australia and Canada, as a motion dealing with thai subject is on the notice-paper. Mr MANN"" - I do not intend to discuss the merits of the proposal, but merely to state that the regulation to which I have referred, in addition to the trade arrangements with Canada which it is proposed to adopt, may result in the actual prohibition of the importation of British newsprint in favour of Canadian paper, which would he most undesirable.",59
212,Mr BRUCE,MEAT INDUSTRY,"Flinders-Prime Minister and ' Minister for External Affairs) [10.53J - I have not yet any information from the source mentioned by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. West) which I can make available to the House and to the country. The suggestion of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) that the proposal set out by the Minister for  afternoon should not be dealt with by regulation, but that an opportunity should be afforded to the House to consider the action contemplated under the regulation, will receive the consideration of the Government. We will see if an opportunity can be given honourable members to discuss it. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.S4 p.m.",60
