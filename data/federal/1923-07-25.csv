10,Mr GROOM,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL,"The answers to the honfolorable member's questions are as follow.:- . 1. There is not, so Tar as I am awuTe, any Convention in regard to the validity of patents, - but there is a Convention under which, inter aUa, a person who bias applied for a patent in one of the countries which are parties to the Convention, may apply, within twelve months in any other country which is a parly to the 'Convention, and may be grafted a patent bearing the date of his first application. 2. Australia is a party to tihe Convention of Paris relating to industrial property, and bas tihe rights given by that Convention, but has not yet laooeded to ithe Convention as revised at Washington. 3 'and 4.

11,Mr KILLEN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL,"the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice What is the total a-moumt spent by the Federal Government in building soldiers' houses?",14
12,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows : To SOth June, 1923, the amount expended in the construction of War Service Homes, including in some cases the cost of purchasing the land on < which the houses were built, totalled £7,763,234. This figure includes a sum of £1,300,000 - advanced to the South Australian State Savings Bank for the provision of War Service Homes; but that institution has not supplied information as to. the actual - sum expended, and what part of the expenditure was in connection with (a) the construction of homes; (b) the purchase of homes and the lift in g pf .mortgages. To 30th June, 1Q23, the total expenditure in the Commonwealth in connection with (a), purchase of land and construction of homes thereon; and (6) purchase of homes and the lift ing of mortgages, equalled £15,030,386, which figure incJudes the advance of £i,S0O,000 to the South Australian State Bank. DIABETES. STJPPLY os INSULIN.",14
13,Mr MAHONY,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL,"the Minister for Health, upon notice- - 1. Have the Government investigated the efficacy of insulin as a cure for diabetes; and, if so, with what result? 2. What steps are being taken to make this product available to medical practitioners in Australia ? 3. Has the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory undertaken the manufacture of insulin; and. if so, to what extent and with what result? 4. Is it the intention of the Government to make the supply of insulin a Commonwealth monopoly, or will medical practitioners and wholesale chemists be allowed to import it? .5. Have any supplies been imported up to the present moment, either by the Commonwealth or otherwise?",14
14,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DUTIES ON AGRICULTURAL," answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Insulin should not be regarded as a cure for diabetes, but as a means of supplying glandular deficiencies associated ' with the disease. Investigations haye been carried on from the first announcement of the present methods of preparation, with ultimately satisfactory results. 2. The product is now available in limited quantities to specialists. The amount available is being continuously increased. 3. Yes. See No. 2. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories are issuing an active and sterile product. 4. There is no intention on the part of the Government to prohibit importation of efficient preparations. 5. The information is not available; but certain firms have announced that supplies are on the way from England. The Commonwealth Government will not import, as. according to the statements, of the original discoverers, insulin would not remain - active long enough to permit of its arrival in Australia from England in an active condition. NA LINE OF STEAMERS. USE OF AFHICAN COAL. Mr A . GREEN asked the P r i m e M in ister, wpon notice I. Is it a fact, as has been stated, that the Commonwealth Line of Steamers on the eastern States to England run-by way of Western Australia and the Cape-bunke r coal mined by black labour at Durban, in preference to coal won by white labour at Collie, Western Australia ? 2. If the fact is as stated, what is the reason for the preference given to African over Australian coal ?",15
15,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The answers to the h o n orable member's questions are as f o l low:- . 1. Vessels are bunkered in Durban because the coal is considerably cheaper than Collie, and is of a superior quality-in other words, the arrangements at present in force were adopted by the management in the interests of economy. 2. Durban coal costs 27s. 6d. per ton, Collie 33s. 8d.. and Durban coal gives about 20 per cent, better results. TOBACCO. Mr . ANSTEY asked the Minister for T r a d e and Customs, upon notice I.

26,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,"Flinders-Prime M in ister and Minister for External Affairs) [2,40] - I m o v e That on each sitting day, unless otherwise ordered, Government business shall take precedence of general business. Honourable members know that it is customary, when the House is nearing the end of the session, for Government' business to be given precedence over private members' business. The practice has been followed for a very long time, and I have no doubt that honourable members will agree to its being adopted on the present occasion. Some time ago the Government announced that it proposed to terminate the present session on the 24th August. I know that certain honourable members on the Opposition side of the House do not approve of that decision, but I would remind the m , that one of the primary duties of the Government of the day is to make the necessary arrangements for the conduct of the business of Parliament. That is one of the duties which honourable members opposite would insist upon discharging if they occupied the Government benches. During the present session private members have had the usual facilities for introducing subjects of particular interest to them, but the end of the session is riow not very far distant. It is proposed po introduce the Budget tomorrow, and in ' order to give honourable members the fullest possible opportunity of considering the Budget, the Estimates, and consequential legislation. Ministers propose that' Government business shall be given precedence. I feel sure that honourable members will agree to the motion, and thus afford themselves every possible opportunity to discuss measures, particularly those dealing with the finance of the country, which will come before them. Owing to the nature of the business which will have PAPERS. to be transacted between now and the end of the session, honourable members will have ample opportunity to bring under the notice of the House any matter to which they desire to draw attention. M i . CHARLTON (Hunter) [2.44] I have no intention of objecting to the motion. I realise that if the House Is to rise on the 24th August, private members' business must give way to Government business. At the same time, I wish, again, on behalf of this side of the House, to protest against Parliament being closed on the 24th August, after such a short session. , I am under the impression that in addition to sitting on Tuesdays, we shall shortly be .asked to sit on Mondays. The legislation that has to be dealt with in the remaining three or'four weeks of the session is very important, and should receive the attention of every member in this House. I doubt very much, if it can. have the attention i serves in the short space of time remaining before the 24th August. Parliament will not be able td do its best work if honourable members are required to sit every day in the week. Some of us would like to get the business done and go home. In that respect I am in the same category as other honourable members. We cannot sit from Monday until Friday inclusive, and until a late hour every night, and do justice to important legislation. The Prime Minister has indicated that when the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) delivers the Budget tomorrow, many matters arising out of it will require consideration, and will necessitate legislation. He said that he wanted to give the House sufficient time to deal with the Budget. I fail to see how we can deal with all this legislation in the limited period of three weeks. The Prime Minister would be wise, even at this late hour, if he would agree to the House sitting until it has had time to deal with necessary legislation in a proper and efficient way. It is-not in the best interests of Parliament or the country that legislation should be rushed through. If we make mistakes in passing legislation the responsibility will be ours. In hurrying to close the session too early we may do things which we may regret afterwards. I am. not opposed to the Government appropriating the time usually allowed to private members, but I object to rushing legislation through in order to close the session on the 24th August. The House should be allowed to sit, if necessary, for another two months. It would not make any difference to the Prime Minister, for the Opposition would grant him a pair, but it would make all the difference to the efficient conduct of the business of Parliament.",16
27,Mr BLAKELEY,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,"Darling) [2.48] I object strongly to the constant whittling away of the rights of members of this House by. the Government. Private members have retained very few privileges since the present Government took control of the House. Members have no channel tor ventilating matters of importance to their electorates and the people generally. A few weeks ago about £4,500,000 was voted by this House after only three and a half hours actual debate. I admit that the Prime Mint de- ister sat for thirteen and a half hours moving, "" That the question be now put."" Like a marionette he kept bobbing up, and like a phonograph he kept repeating, "" I move, ' That the question be now put.'"" Members of the Opposition vainly endeavoured to discuss matters which they considered of vital importance to the people of Australia. The Ministers of the different Departments could give ho information, and the Prime Minister himself was equally without it. The"" Bill was forced through, and members of the Opposition were prevented from speaking upon many matters of importance. That privilege was taken away by the brutal ""gag,"" and now the small privilege remaining is to be removed also. It is absolutely impossible for the programme of legislation proposed by the Government to be passed in the short period between now and the 24th August. I do not know whether the Prime Minister and the Government think that members of this House are so many children, or that the people outside bave no knowledge of what can be done before 24th August. If the Government had any capacity or ability to carry on the affairs of this country, it would have met the House shortly after it was elected. We know, however, that certain assassinations had to take place. Certain men had to be removed, and others placated. Certain warring factions in the different groups, which have now been welded together more or less harmoniously, had to be reconciled. At last, after a delay of something like six months, an understanding was brought about which has carried the Ministry through so far. From a Government such as the present one we could not expect much more.' I shall say no more about the vote of £4,500,000, after three and a half hours? discussion, and thirteen and a half hours' gagging, but there are on the notice-paper most important legislative proposalsof vital interest to the public, the discussion of which should take at least six months. Can the Budget be adequately analyzed and criticised in less than four weeks? Of course, if the Government are ashamed of their Budget, and desire to prevent a full discussion of it, they are proceeding in the right way to achieve tb,eir object. There will not be sufficient time between now and the 24th August to adequately discuss the Budget. The Navigation Bill, which involves a most important principle, should not pass through this House with less than two weeks' discussion. The Seamen's Compensation Bill is a highly controversial measure, which should receive at least three weeks' consideration. The A ir Defence Bill is another proposal which cannot be disposed of in a few hours. It was discreetly dropped by the last Government, and rumour in the corridors is to the effect that it will suffer a similar fate at the hands of the present Government. Certainly, there is very httle chance of its being passed in this House, even if the Prime Minister again applies the gag continuously for thirteen hours. Other measures listed on the business-paper are the Naval Defence Bill, Sea-carriage of Goods Bill, New Guinea. Bill, the Boy Scouts Association BillGod forbid that we should forget the boys scouts-and the Papua Bill. It has become the fashion for people to ask why so much time is wasted in Parliament, but adequate discussion is the only protection which the people have against an incompetent Government rushing through the House legislation that is unwise and unpalatable to the electors. When I first entered Parliament I formed the opinion that a great deal of time was occupied in useless discussion, but as the years go by-ma y there be many more of them- I have come to the conclusion, as the result of bitter experience, that legislightly lation can be passed too - hurriedly. Work can be perfunctorily done, and its results become a danger to the people. If the Government should even attempt to pass, before the 24th August, all the proposals that have been listed they will be guilty of madness. The only way in which that programme can be disposed of is by the extension of the session for at least six or eight weeks beyond the announced date of closing. Even in that time some of the proposals must be scamped. There must be in the Government programme a good many innocents which are doomed to* be slaughtered, and one. is forced to the conclusion that the Government knew when they listed them that many of them had not the slightest chance of being agreed to. It is all very well to dress the Ministerial windows, to say that so much work must be done in a certain time; and to attempt to run the legislative machine to a schedule; but the Government cannot do that, and they are not justified in - attempting it. Now we are told that private members are to be further deprived of their privileges. I shall continue to voice my objection to the whittling away of the rights of members, especially when I know that that course could have been avoided had the Government had the courage to submit their legislative proposals to the House six months ago.",17
28,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,"Dalley) [2.52] - I agree with the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) that honourable members should be very jealous of their privileges. I stress that point for the benefit of those honourable members who are new to the House. Private members have few privileges, indeed. They have not many opportunities of giving publicity to matters which they regard as being of public importance. Their greatest opportunity is private members' day, which the Government are now coolly proposing to abolish. I ask honourable members to realise what the Government's motion means. There is on thei business paper a most important motion in the name of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into alleged grievances concerning th© administration of the War Service Homes Department in New South Wales. I take it that that honourable member did not place that notice upon the paper. He was surely seized of his responsibility as a member; he must have thought that this matter was one of great importance. There have been allegations of grievous wrongs and mal-administration, and he took advantage of his privilege as a private member to give notice of a x motion which would enable publicity to be given to the matter. Now the Prime Minister is practically gagging him, and casting a reflection upon him, inasmuch as he says in effect, "" The notice of motion by the honourable member for Richmond is of no consequence; we must close this Parliament so that ""I may go to London."" It matters not that there may have been mal-administration in connection with ""War Service Homes in New South Wales. It matters not that returned soldiers are unemployed and sleeping in the Sydney Domain. At all costs Parliament must be closed, and the Prime Minister must go to London. I hope that the honourable member for Richmond will not lightly allow his rights to be set aside. There are other honourable members who, with equal sincerity, I believe have given notice of motions. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) has tabled & motion in reference to the construction of a railway line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs as part of the through North-South railway. Prime Minister cannot deny the importance of that proposal^ but he is asking the House to set it aside. The honourable member for Bass is a noied explorer. He has travelled from end to end of this vast continent. He has been at what is known as "" the dead heart of Australia."" I have heard the honourable member deliver lectures oh the subject of the Northern Territory, and from these one might be led to believe that the exploits of explorers like the late Lord Forrest and others fade into insignificance beside the wonderful achievements of the explorer from Bass. As a result of his vast experience, the honourable member has placed this notice of motion on the business-paper, declaring that the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs should be proceeded with at once. This is a question of vital importance to South Australian representatives, and it will be interesting to see whether those gentlemen are prepared to allow the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) to sweep away their opportunity of discussing it. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), who has a personal knowledge of the poverty and destitution that prevails in our midst, has a notice of motion in favour of the granting of a destitute allowance. He believes that Mr Mahony. it is the duty of Parliament to give a lead in the alleviation of distress, and is therefore anxious to have the matter discussed here. I could quite understand the Prime Minister dealing in the way proposed with motions standing in the names of members of the Opposition, but what has the honourable member for Eiverina (Mr Killen) to say about the swamping of his motion in favour of the contract system being adopted for all Government work? This is a question in which quite a large number of honourable members behind the Government are deeply interested, and the support given by the honourable member for Riverina to the contract system,- in opposition to day labour, was one of the grounds on which he was elected to this House. If the honourable member permits himself to be robbedof his rights it is certain that his constituents will call him to account at the next election. There is a proposal in the The name of the honourable member fbr Denison (Mr O'Keefe) to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the necessity fbr rjrovision being made by the Government for an adequate direct shipping service between Melbourne and Hobart. Session after session during the years I have been a member I have heard representatives from Tasmania complaining of the present inadequate shipping facilities. I ask Tasmanian representatives who sit behind the Government to consider carefully before they support a motion which will have the effect of depriving the island State of a much needed service. Then, Mr. Speaker, your illustrious predecessor, the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) has a motion urging the necessity for the authorization by Parliament of the publication of Hansard. I understand that without the authorization . proposed Hansard is not covered by parliamentary privilege, and actions for libel may be brought on what appears in its columns. The honourable member for Lang desires to place it beyond all doubt that Hansard reports are not subject to the ordinary processes of law. Surely honourable members generally will insist on having an opportunity to affirm that Hansard ' is a parliamentary document. There is another important motion on the notice paper in the name of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCNeill), who is a new member, and the Prime Minister should not deprive him of an opportunity to submit his motion. I hope honourable members will not be prepared to "" g a g"" themselves. The opening words of the motion are-' ' That a Select Committee of seven members, representing both sides . of tha House "" You will notice, Mr . Speaker, how fair the honourable member for Wannon is. He desires both sides of the House to be represented. The full text of the motion isThat a Select Committee of seven members, representing both sides of the House, be appointed to inquire into and report upon the alleged non-fullilment of the verbal undertaking placed before the House by the Minister for Trade and Customs prior to the passing of item 275 of the Customs Tariff on 9th November, 1921, as recorded on pages 12538 and 12539 of Hansard of the session 1920-21.",18
29,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,It is a matter affecting the honour of this House.,20
30,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,Yes ; affects the honour of a member of the Cabinet.,20
31,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,The honourable member may not now discuss a motion standing on the notice-paper.,20
32,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,"What I complain of is that, if the Prime Minister's motion is carried, the House will be deprived of its right to discuss the motion of the honourable member for Wannon. It is a matter of very great importance, affecting the honour pf a member of the Cabinet, and it concerns the political sincerity of many members of the late Country party. I am surprised at the Prime Minister attempting to brush aside a motion containing a reflection upon the honour of one of his own Ministers. I feel sure that he has not read the motion. If he realized its importance, he would be anxious to have an opportunity to defend the honour of his colleague. I hope that he will reconsider his decision. There is also a motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney).",20
33,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,"It is not in order for an honourable member to indulge in tedious repetition. By a mere recital of the motions on the notice-paper, and the application of the same criticism to each item, the honourable member cannot avoid the charge of tedious repetition. I warn the honourable member.",20
34,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,"I appreciate the attitude you adopt, Mr Speaker, and I take your' warning to heart; but I think that the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne is the most important of all . It should convince the Prime Minister of the iniquity of his proposed action. I think that I ought to be allowed to make a passing reference to the motion. ItreadsThat in view of .the pronounced favouritism of those who possess the gift of distribution of public works(1) This House declares that all architectural plans, designs, specifications, &c, of all works for the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Bank, the estimated cost of which amounts to £3,000 and upwards, shall be thrown open to the public competition of the architects . of Australia The matter is very important from the stand-point of the architects of Australia. I have no desire to show how the proposal of the honourable member.would benefit the Commonwealth. 0^ course, it would it directly encourage art",20
35,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,An honourable member may not discuss the merits of a motion on the notice-paper.,20
36,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,"I have no desire to do that ; but what I am complaining of is that the motion of the Prime Minister would prevent honourable members, fro m giving expression to their opinions on the subject. In the interests of the new members especially, the House should not be deprived of its rights in this respect. It is the clear duty of the Government to keep Parliament in session, and not to close it up hurriedly to enable the Prime Minister to visit Great Britain . Why could not the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) be left in charge of the House during the Prime Minister's absence?",20
37,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATE D WIRELESS,That matter may not be discussed on the present motion.,20

The Government intend no such thing. The action now proposed has been taken in every Parliament of the Commonwealth. I have all the facts before me, but I do not intend to delay the House by presenting them in detail. I shall tell honourable members what happened in 1912, when a Labour Government was in power.

41,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and .Railways) [3.27]' - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. In moving the second reading, I will briefly refer to matters in.connection with the proposed extension which I think will be of interest to honourable members generally. The Bill provides for the extension of the railway system of the Northern Territory from the terminus at Emungalan as far as Daly Waters, a distance of 160 miles. The extension commences at a point 1 mile dis15 tant from the north bank of the Katherine River ; it will cross the river by a highAYES. level bridge, and will terminate some 360 miles south of Darwin. The advisability of the construction of the line has been under consideration by the Public Works Committee on two occasions. The first reference to the Committee was in 1915, in relation to the construction of a railway from the left or southern bank of the Katherine River, 63 miles 65 chains in a south-easterly direction from Mataranka, which was at one time called Bitter Springs. This section was inspected and reported oh in 1916. The construction of . the line from Mataranka to Daly Waters, a distance of approximately 95 miles, was reported on in 1922, the route having been inspected in the previous year. The NOES. recommendation of the Public Works Committee in the case of both sections was that they should be constructed. In this House in 1920, on the motion of the then Minister for Works and Railways. (Mr. Groom), it was resolved that In accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1013-14, it is expedient to carry out the proposed work-Extensio n Pine Creek to Katherine railway southward as' far as Mataranka. A Bill to give effect to this resolution was prepared, hut it was not proceeded with. Last night the honourable member for Hindmarsh < Mr Makin) asked for what distance the line now proposed to be constructed .has been surveyed. I replied, and I find I was correct, that the distance surveyed is approximately 77 miles. That leaves approximately S3 miles of the proposed extension to be permanently surveyed. There has been a trial survey of the remainder of the line. If this B i ll is passed the permanent survey for this remaining portion will be put in hand immediately, and completed. The estimated cost of the line for which provision is made. by the Bill is £1,545,000. Honourable members will notice that this amount is in excess of the estimate submitted by the Public Works Committee in their reports. The Committee reported that the first' section from, the Katherine River to Mataranka would cost £320,000, and the second section from Mataranka to Daly Waters would cost £925,386, or a total of £1,245,386, or £300,000 less than the estimate now submitted.",21
42,Mr GBEGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Was not th® estimate of the Committee that which was submitted by .the departmental engineer?,22
43,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The £320,000 was an old estimate for the section Emungalan to Mataranka, and. the estimate now submitted is increased by enhanced construction costs and the greater - cost of transport of rails, fastenings, and sleepers, all of which have to be shipped to Darwin, and transported over the existing line. The estimate-submitte d to the Public Works - Committee in IS 15-WA S much lower than the amount for which ithe line can now be constructed. The lower estimate was prepared in 1915, and since that time costs have much increased because of the enhanced cost of materials, rails, fastenings, cement, timber, &c, and the inand creased freight on rails, &c, to Darwin.",22
44,Mr FENTONW,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Can the Minister say what was the difference between the estito mate and the actual cost of the first tion of the line?,22
45,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has not been question constructed. A Bil l was prepared to give effect to the resolution approving of its construction, hut was not proceeded with.",22
46,Mr FENTOIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Was not a section the line constructed from Pine Creek to the Katherine River ?,22
47,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes ; but that was before 1915. The estimate submitted to the Public Works Committee in 1915 was for a railway commencing on the south, side of the Katherine River. It was anticipated that the terminus of the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River would be on that side of the river. But the terminus is still on the north side, and some 75 chains of railway have yet to be constructed to reach the Katherine River. A bridge is required over the river. This hridge is a very important' part of the work, and it will cost a fairly large sum. The Katherine River drains a large area of country, and carries a great volume of water during the wet season. This necessitates the construction of a fairly extensive bridge with several spans. The bridge alone is estimated to cost £95,000. This is an item which was not included in the estimate prepared in 1915. The Bill gives.particulars of the railway, .and the route is shown on the plans now before the House. The book of reference, submitted in accordance with the terms of the Railways Act, gives a list of Ithe names of - owners and lessees of lands along the route. A great deal was said on thiB - matter last night by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), but I found on looking at the map this morning that much of the land traversed by the proposed railway is still unalienated Crown land. The area to be used for the railway is approximately 3'chains-on either side of the centre line of the railway. This will allow for public roads. It is proposed to construct the line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, but the bridges will be constructed so as to permit of the conversion of the line to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge'.",22
48,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Als o the sleepers.,22
49,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; only tie bridges culverts. The sleepers will be such as are necessary for a 3-ft. 6-in. line. If the whole of the extension were made so as be convertible into a 4-ft. <8^-in. line secthe increased cost would be approximately £160,000. After' looking at the from all angles, the Government considers that the most economical method is to build the railway on sleepers to carry a 3-ft. 6-in. line. These will have to be of of steel, to resist white ants.",22
50,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the Queensland gauge.,22
51,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , and it is also the gauge of the Oodnadatta line. Even if the railway is ultimately converted to the wider gauge, the sleepers will not be wasted. They can then be used for lines to serve as feeders for the main The line will be constructed of 60-lb. rails.",23
52,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the sleepers be of German make? German sleepers were tried in South Australia and they rusted.,23
53,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can assure the honourable member that German sleepers will not be used. At the commencement the line will not be a paying proposition. Very few developmental lines pay at the outset. They are, of necessity, constructed through sparsely-populated territory. A large indirect benefit, however, accrues from their construction. If we were to lay down the principle- I do not suggest for a moment that honourable members would do so-that we would not construct railways without an assurance that they would pay from the start, how could this country develop ? Where .would this country be today if that had been the policy of the past, and where would it be in the future if that policy were adopted today ? I think honourable members on all sides of the House will readily recognise the principle underlying that statement. The estimates of revenue and expenditure are based upon the assumption that Vestey Brothers' works at Darwin will be operating. The estimated revenue from the line will be £24,000 a year as against £26,700 working expenses. These figures will show a loss, not including interest, of £2,700 per annum. The interest charge at 5 per cent, will be, approximately, £77,250. That is how the loss upon ""the line will actually occur. The total loss, including interest charges, wal^ be £79,950 per annum. It will take time, of course, for the revenue to reach £24,000; but it is not anticipated that the period will be long, for the resultant development will, within a reasonable time, provide the amount of revenue I have mentioned. With the freezing works operating the estimate of revenue is regarded as conservative. The extension of the railway beyond Daly Waters, which will have to .be considered later, will bring the line nearer to the better pastoral country, and there is every hope that with that extension the revenue from the railway will exceed the working expenses. The railway is part of the line that will ultimately be carried through from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This section is common to all the proposed routes. The fact was referred to last night, and I think it was line. stressed, particularly by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), that this extension was recommended by the Public Works Committee, on the assumption that the line would gofcoCamooweal, and that it was upon that assumption that the Commonwealth Government proposed tc construct this section. The fact that the Public Works Committee gave that as a. reason for recommending the construction of the line does not justify honourable members in assuming that the same reason actuated the Government. If the line is ultimately, extended tlirough the Territory, a spur line to Camooweal to link up with the Queensland system would not be objected to, even by South Australian members. The railway will assist in the, development of pastoral country, and that is one of the main reasons why honourable members on all sides of the House should support the Bill. Australia cannot be developed without railways, and if Parliament says that it will not build railways it will, in effect, say, "" We are not going to develop Australia."" The railway will assist in the settlement of the Roper River lands. This river empties into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and traverses country from the Gulf to the railway and beyond. The line will bring nearer to railway connection the rich pastoral lands of the Barkly Tablelands. The Government has sent Mr Hobler, Chief Engineer of Commonwealth Railways, to report upon the practicability of providing railway communication with Borroloola and a port at the mouth of the MCArthur River. Mr Hobler is already on his way, and the Government hopes to receive his report before the end of the year. The line will also pass within 12 miles of the Marranboy Tin-fields. At present those tin-fields are 45 miles from the railway. Honourable members Will see that the Bill is short, and to the point. Clause 5 provides for deviations of one mile on either side of the line defined in the schedule, but as a permanent survey has been made over a great portion of the route, it is hardly likely that any deviation will be necessary. Clause 7 provides for the appointment of officers. The desire of the Government is that the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner - shall construct the railway, and that he shall nob be hampered by any restrictions. Honourable members will understand that it is not proposed to give that power manently to the Commissioner. The B i relates only to the construction of this section of line. Under section 16 of the Commonwealth Railways Act, ib was in - contract. tended that all railways constructed or to be constructed should be lutely in the Commissioner. The Commissioner, who is charged with the reportions sponsibility of conveying the public and working the traffic, must have full power over the lands through which the railway runs. In section 11 of the Northern ritoiy Administration Act 1910, it is videdNo Crown lands in the Territory shall sold or disposed of for any estate of hold except in pursuance' of some contract entered into before the commencement of this Act. In other words, no lands in the Territory shall be alienated the Crown, and - whilst the Commonjustified. wealth Bailways Commissioner is a monwealth authority, yet in accordance with the usual railway practice, he is body corporate, with distinctive powers, and it is necessary, in the interests of safety and good business, that the lands should be vested in him, as was intended under the Act providing for the conin it . trol of the'' Commonwealth railways. Clause 9 is one that usually appears in Railway Construction Acts. vides that in the event of any portion of the line being carried out by contract the contractor shall be compelled to his employees the prescribed minimum rates of wages, and to observe prescribed conditions of employment.",23
54,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it intended to carry the work by contract?,24
55,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It may be necessary to arrange for the carriage of materials by contract; and the Commissioner may consider it expedient to carry out small portions of the work by contract, and that event it is desirable that the tractor shall not be permitted to employ labour at less than ruling rates of wages. creased. It is a safeguard of which members of the Opposition should be the last to complain.",24
56,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it the policy Government to build the line by day labour?,24
57,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Considering the conditions under which the line will be constructed, and the remote and inaccessible nature of the country, the Governperment considers that the Railway Commisl l sioner should do the constructing work, but that materials, such as girders for bridges, rails, & c , should be obtained by  vested absolabour be day labour ?",24
58,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , except for such of the line as the Commissioner may consider it expedient to construct by contract. It is not proposed to tie down the Commissioner by saying to him that Terno man shall be employed except under profche day-labour system. If he considers it necessary, he will have the right to be carry out any portion of the work by freecontract. In view of the extended debate last night on this question",24
59,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was justified.,24
60,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not for one fro m moment say that the time spent was not The honourable member must Comadmit that no impatience was shown by myself or the Government regarding the a length of the speeches; but in view of the fact that the Government gave a full opportunity to honourable members to discuss every phase of the question, I ask them to give this Bill an expeditious passage. There are no contentious matters",24
61,Mr MAXWELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Will the Minister explain how the revenue of £24,000 is estiI t promated ? Does it take into account the probable increase of revenue due to the closer settlement of the country following pay to the construction of the line?",24
62,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No . I do not think - I speak with a certain amount of reservation-that the estimate takes into conout sideration a probable increase in settlement. I think the estimate is based upon normal conditions, and upon the assumption that the pastoral in dustry will provide the revenue stated. For instance, if cotton-growing devei n lops, or any other new for m of closer consettlement makes headway, I assume that the estimated revenue w i ll be largely in ",24
63,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Angas) [ 3 . 5 0 ] - I admit the concluding statement of the Minister, of the that the Government did not seek last night to burke the discussion on the motion relating to the construction of this railway. But there may have heen several reasons for their forbearance. one was that the Government had not come to a definite decision in regard to the A i r Service Bill , and the debate the motion last night was a convenient stop-gap.",24
64,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do not be uncharitthe able.,25
65,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Well , perhaps the vernment recognised that South Australia is not receiving a fair deal in ' regard to the. railway policy for the Northern Territory, and they thought that it would not be righ t to ' ' gag ."" those South tralian members who wished to put case for their State. As I do not intend to vote against this Bill , I shall not cuss it at great length;, but I wish to will make it clear that any curtailment remarks is nob due to repentance of the State. attitude which some of my South Australian colleagues and I adopted and on Friday last. In spite of what has been said by the Minister, there is no sion evading the fact that the railway from Mataranka to Daly Waters is being prorealized posed on the recommendation of the lic Works Committee, which recommenthe Government. dation was based upon the intention that that section shall be ultimately exSouth tended to Camooweal. No sophistry or therefore camouflage can hide that fact, and it because the majority-unfortunately , not all-of the South Australian members recognised quite clearly that this proposed line isrecommended with the intention of ultimately extending it to the boundary of Queensland, that we opposed it. We shall not vote against the Bill , because we do not wish to create the impression that we are opposed to the construction Camooweal. of a line from Mataranka to Daly Waters. We realise that it must be built before the through North-South line can be were undertaken. But we believe that if could get precedence for the Oodnadattainstance, Alice Springs section we would have stronger argument, when the northern section was ultimately extended to Newthat castle Waters, for the bridging of gap between that point and Alice Springs before any extension to Camooweal was undertaken. I foresee two other big fights in this Parliament. The next proposal will be for an extension of the proposed line from Daly Waters to Newcastle Waters, and we shall have the same speHad cious argumehfc advanced then, as has been put forward on this occasion, that such extension will be for the purpose of Probably trying to make the line pay.",25
66,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do not be pessimistic.,25
67,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I base my statement on upon South Australia's experience during the seventeen years which have elapsed since the Northern Territory was transferred i o Commonwealth. I hope that before the next fight takes place the railway will Gohave been extended fro m Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, but I am doubtful of that hope being realized. The really big fight will come when this Parliament has to decide whether the extension from NewAuscastle Waters shall be in the direction the of Camooweal or direct south towards Alice Springs. When that struggle opens disI hope that all South Australian members be united in pressing for the fulfil of my ment of the contract made with their",25

69,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That will be the occaf o r the decisive f i g h t ; but, having watched the political game closely, I haye that we can only gain tins point Pubby continually hammering and worrying Unfortunately, that attitude has not been always adopted by Australian representatives, and we find ourselves in our present was position. South Australian members have held the portfolio of Minister for Home and Territories, and two of them, at any rate, were mild-mannered gentlemen, who did not put up as stubborn a fight for the rights of South Australia as others perhaps would have done. The Minister for Works and Railways has suggested that later on a spur railway may be buil t to",25
70,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No . I said that the sleepers to carry a 3-ft. 6-in.'gauge line not likely to be wasted, because they we could be utilized in any spur line. For if a spur line were buil t to a Camooweal they could be used in it . Mr ""GABB - The suggestion behind remark was that the line to Camoothc weal would be merely a spur, but the thought in the minds of the members of the Public Works Committee, as revealed in their report, is that the Camooweal line will not be a spur, but a section of a main line to link up Darwin with the railway systems of the eastern States. that not been the intention of the Committee some of the Queensland members would not have fought as strenuously as they did for the Camooweal connection, and would not have voted as they did last night. I do not begrudge QueensOommonwealth land whatever trade she can get from Northern Territory; I hope that whatorder. ever is best for the Territory will be done. The honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) was unfair to South Australian members when he said last night that so long we could drag the trade to Adelaide we did not care anything about the developaddressed' ment of the Territory. There is no South Australian who does not feel that the Northern Territory is part of his State. Therefore, we wish it well. We people of South Australia have always regarded the of the Bill. Territory as peculiarly ours, but too big a proposition for us to handle in the terests of the White Australia policy. are not such fools as to think there is possibility of the whole of the trade of proposed. the Northern Territory being dragged to Adelaide. I suppose we shall get only a small proportion of it . I have wondering if the Minister, for whom I have great respect, has said to the South vote against the Bill. Australian members who voted against their colleagues last night, that he proHouse posed to visit Alice Springs, and, if investigations were satisfactory, in course the line northwards from Oodnaplaced datta would be built.",25
71,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have not discussed that matter with them.,26
72,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I accept the Minister's assurance, but I 'thought that perhaps some such discussion he had influenced the vote of two South Australian membeen in the past. bers last night. The Minister cannot say that there is any justification for not ceeding with the . Oodnadatta-Alice Springs section until he has personally inspected the country. Surely it should Mr Speaker. be equally necessary for him to inspect the country between Mataranka and Daly Waters, which, to southerners,- is not as well known as is the country tween Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. ritory, Nevertheless, I hope the Minister will to Alice Springs- I am certain his health would benefit if he were there now-bu I cannot accept the suggestion that the extension from Oodnadatta. to Alice Springs is dependent upon the Minister's personal inspection and approval. doubt a personal investigation will strengthen him in regard to any recomtruly, mendation he may make to the Governonly ment, but the claim for that extension rests, not upon the Minister's opinion, but upon a definite agreement between the and South Australia. the - Mr MAXWELL - I rise to a point of The honourable member is discussing the merits of a railway from Ood the nadatta to Alice SpringB.

77,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The point of order prohas been decided, and it is not in order to discuss it further.",26
78,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I bow to ^your ruling, The statement has been made that the Mataranka-Daly Waters line cannot be expected to promote the beearly development of .the Northern Terand as there are several other progo jects which I consider would have a greater developmental influence, I wonder t why the Government have submitted the proposal contained in this Bill. I have heard it stated also that the line from Mataranka to Daly Waters is. not exNo pected to pay its way at the commencement. The Minister stated today, very that if Governments constructed those railways that would be immediately payable, very few would be built. 1 agree with the honourable gentleman, but the second proposal is one which, if it were carried into effect, would make a present Commonwealth line more profitable than it is now. The Public Works Committee, however, has said that the other proposal is only a piecemeal extension, and that profit cannot be expected until the line has been carried to other portions of the Territory. I hope that if the present Minister is in office while this line is in course of construction, he will make himself absolutely sure in Tegard to the officers responsible for the supervision. penditure of £1,500,000 is involved, and in that remote part of the country, if sub-contracting is permitted on the recommendation of the officers, the whole work will require careful watching. The Minister should, if necessary, have officers lo watch officers, and see that no subcontracting is permitted.",26
79,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I assure the honourable member that I shall keep a sharp lookout.,27
80,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am glad to have that assurance, because we can quite see how, if there is sub-contracting, persons may be able to make a ""nice little b it "" out ot the Government.",27
81,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wakefield) [4.7] - There is no reason for any further discussion on the question of route. We have been told by the Minister (Mr Stewart) that he intends to personally inspect the route from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, and that, if the result of his inspection is favourable, the Government will proceed with the survey of that section. I listened very carefully to the statement of the Minister, who told us the estimated cost of the proposed line from Mataranka to Daly Waters. It is impossible, of course, to have more than an approximate estimate, having regard to the remoteness of the country affected.",27
82,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The estimate was submitted only as approximate.,27
83,Mr FOSTEE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I regret that there is not a larger attendance of members, because I wish to deal with the financial side of a proposal which, throws the gravest responsibility on the Government, affecting, as it does, in the highest degree, the future of that part of Australia. If we permit the cost of this line to become unduly excessive, the burden of debt will have to be carried for half a century. We have no information as to how the estimate has been arrived at; we do not know what proportion of the expenditure will be on the railway line itself, and what proportion will be devoted to building, permanent and other station requisites and so forth. I deem it my duty on the present occasion to recall the history of the construction of the EastWest railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. In the absence of any statement to the contrary, I understand that the same official administration will have An ex- charge of the proposed line as had charge of the East-West line. The whole history of that line discloses a tragedy, a repetition of which should not be permitted. Estimates were carefully prepared, and every precaution taken in the preliminary stages. When Parliament approved of the construction, the Government of the day called in the assistance of the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia, the States more immediately concerned, and also of New South Wales, with the result that an engineer from each State was deputed to examine the survey, which had also been made by surveyors selected from each State. But, speaking from memory, the original estimate of cost, if not doubled, was exceeded by 75 per cent. Provision had to be made for workshops, and the officers in control prepared an estimate for cut-stone buildings°at Port Augusta, for which, on the authority of the Cabinet, a preliminary advance was made of £25,000 on account of the total cost of £250,000. I know that part of the country, and I also know something of railways and railway construction in other States of the Commonwealth. I made inquiries, and took as a basis for my calculations railway centres where ten or fifteen times more business was being done than was likely to develop in the case of the EastWest railway for half a century to come. I found that at Geelong, Ballarat, and other centres, instead of cut-stone buildings, iron buildings were provided for workshops; and I begged the then Government to appoint a committee of experts with a view to putting an end to the official proposal. My protests, however, were unavailing, until at last Mr. King O'Malley, to his credit, appointed two mechanical engineers of good standing to make the necessary inquiries. In a week those engineers returned with a report that for an expenditure of about £65,000 workshops could be provided adequate for all needs for the next thirty to fifty years. As a matter of fact, that smaller provision has proved quite adequate, and will meet all demands for the next fifty years. These facts give some idea of the first blunder made. No reliable estimates of the cost of the railway were given by the Chief Engineer in charge until the work had been three-parts or four-fifths completed. During the currency of the contract there were alterations which increased the cost considerably, but not to the extent that honourable members might imagine. The war, and causes arising out of the war, increased the cost,' but the greater part of the' materials, such as sleepers and rails, had been contracted for at pre-war prices. Regarding the small proportion of the material for which war prices had to be paid, and putting the most favourable construction on what occurred at the time, the conduct of the work was a calamity; the line proved a sink into which public money was poured because of the incompetency of the men in charge. There were numerous instances of waste of money along the whole line.",27
84,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Teesdale-Smith contract, for one.",28
85,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That contract represented an infinitesimal part of the work. In the case of another portion of the line, the tender put in by Mr Teesdale-Smith and his partner was excessive. I told the then Prime Minister that I had the assurance of a contractor that if the work were rc-advertised, he would undertake it at half the amount named by Mr TeesdaleSmith.",28
86,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Rt. Hon.W. A. Watt). - Will the honourable member show the connection of these matters with the Bill 1,28
87,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I shall show a financial connection. This is a matter of great, interest and importance to Australia as a whole, because the disaster of the EastWest railway is not yet forgotten. In all my thirty years of political life, I have - never known ab deplorable a business. The engineer who had charge of the const-ruction said he could carry out the work for about half of the amount tendered; and no doubt he could, in view of the assurance given to me by the contractor of whom I have spoken. There were numerous other mistakes. Quarries were opened up at great cost, expensive machinery was installed, and railways were laid to the quarries. It was subsequently discovered that the material in the quarries was quite useless for ballast. Mr Scullin.I-What has that to do with the present Bill?",28
88,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It bears on the matter of the construction of the railway. Scores, and probably hundreds, of columns were written in the press about the blunder, and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), who was in the House at the time, was a member of the party responsible for it.",28
89,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am waiting for the honourable member to apply his remarks to the Bill.,28
90,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Government propose to construct the railway fin the Northern Territory under the same management. Do honourable members realise that the work will eventually cost millions of pounds? Are they prepared to see a repetition of such an outrageous waste of public money, which was due to incompetency on the part of the management?",28
91,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Most of the work was done after the Labour Government went out of office. MT. FOSTER,-A S a member of the House at the time, I followed the construction of the East-West line from end to end, and I was everlastingly bringing the facts before Parliament; but. no redress was granted. Although two separate Prime Ministers promised an investigation, by expert railway men, of the cases brought under the notice of the House, no investigation was made. I call upon honourable members, as custodians of the public purse, to consider whether the construction of the proposed railway in the Territory should be proceeded with until we have data to. the last detail, and until we have secured the services of the most efficient engineers obtainable.",28
92,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Would the honourable member have said anything about the East-West line if the Northern Territory railway had been started in the south? Mr Foster,-The criticism I have offered today was made throughout the period during which the East-West line was under construction. There is very little information available to the House regarding the rolling-stock for the Northern Territory line. There has never been a greater calamity in railway construction in Australia than thei'e was in connection with the East-West line, owing to the adoption of the day-labour system and the provision of an excess of rolling-stock both during and subsequent to construction. The present Government have placed the principle of Government work by public tender in the forefront of their platform. There is rolling stock on the East-West line to the value of about £970,000, and the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) discovered fourteen engines at Port Augusta that had never been used. The Blue-Book contains an account of twenty-two such engines.",28
93,Mr SCUXIJN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"On a point of order, what has the number of the engines on the East-West railway to do with the Bill before the House?",29
94,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY, A general reference only to the matter to which the honourable member has referred would be in order.,29
95,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I point out that it is impossible to build a railway without engines. There is a danger of providing too many engines in a similar fashion for the Northern Territory railway instead of leaving a contractor to decide the number of engines and the quantity of rolling-stock required, thus relieving the Government of that responsibility. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) does not like to hear the truth about the East-West line. If I am not permitted to tell the truth in this Chamber, I shall make it known outside. The press well remembers what took place.",29
96,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY, - An honourable member may not enter into a discussion 6f the merits of the vate contract system as against government work.,29
97,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I put it to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I am dealing with the proposed cost of the railway, and I contend that the estimates are not reliable. God knows that Parliament has wasted enough money already, and it is time honourable members were in earnest in scrutinising public expenditure. There is another matter upon which I should like some information. Is the railway in the Northern Territory to be managed from Melbourne T",29
98,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They tried to manage Darwin from Melbourne, and they made a ghastly mess of it .",29
99,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was like pouring public money into the sea. The construction of the East-West railway was managed from Melbourne. For years the work was directed by telegraph, and draftsmen in Melbourne were employed preparing drawings. A mistake was made in the construction of an engine house. It was found, when the building was well advanced, that the engines could not enter it. The foundations were of concrete, and dynamite was used, to blow up the massive concrete, the whole work having to be started afresh.",29
100,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the official who was then in charge still in his - position ?,29
101,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . Buildings at Port Augusta were erected upon an unsuitable site, and they had to be pulled down and shifted. It is not pleasant for me to say these things, but I feel it to be my duty to do so. I urge honourable members to investigate the present proposal before they commit the country to an expenditure of a million and. a half of money. The total cost will amount to many millions before the North-South line is completed. The people should be saved from the financial burdens that could be prevented by efficient management.",29
102,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the honourable member referring to any particular individual in connection with his charges?,29
103,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am referring to the responsible engineers who constructed the East-West line. Anticipating the construction of the Northern Territory railway I asked Cabinet, when the Railway Commissioner's period of service was nearing an end, if they would allow pri- me to inform him that his term would not be renewed, and if they would agree to call for applications in Australia, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States of America, for the most capable engineer obtainable. What is required is a man in the prime of life, a high class engineer, who could be trusted to carry out a work of such importance as the Northern Territory railway which will have to be constructed at an enormous distance from the seat of government. All the leading railway experts of Australia agreed 'that it was an outrage upon common sense when the construction of the East-West line was directed from Melbourne instead of the principal work being done on the spot. Railway work generally has been revolutionized of late years. vernments have realized the importance of obtaining as their Chief Railways Commissioners the most brainy men to be found. When New South Wales selected Mr Johnston as its Chief Commissioner, men in that State such as those responsible for the blunders on the East-West railway made matters too hot for him. Not knowing which way to turn , he relinquished his post;, but when he was on his way home, the then Prime Minister sent a wireless telegram asking him to return ' to Australia and take over the construction of the East-West, line for the Government. He might have been prepared! if he had been asked while he was here to undertake the responsibility, but he had made his plans and continued his journey to the Old Country. Victoria, after similar experiences, followed the New South Wales example. In this State they decided to secure up-to-date men with new ideas, and they appointed more than one such man as Chief Railways Commissioner, beginning with Mr Tait. what Mr Tait did for the railway system of Victoria. Quite recently the railway revenue in this State was decreasing, and the different lines instead of earning pretty nearly full interest on the cost of construction were going back. The Victorian Government secured the services of Mr Clapp, and the railways have again shown splendid results.",29
104,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"U n for t u n at e l y , he put up the rates.",30
105,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He did put up the rates, but he has made the railways pay.",30
106,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He might easily make them pay, having a monopoly.",30
107,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Railways CommisMinister sioners in all the States, have a monopoly. In South Australia - today they have appointed a man at the big salary of doing now. £5,000' a year for the term of seven years. He has not been in the country am now suggesting. six months and he has already saved than twice the whole of his salary for the seven years of his. engagement. only just begun his work. One of his reforms in railway management is in decentralization of control. The new man in South Australia has, plotted out the railway system of. that State in three divisions, and he has taken three of the* brainiest and most efficient men. in the service, irrespective of age or status, The State Go- and made them responsible for those divisions. They are expected to do the whole' of the business of their divisions from their particular centres on the spot. Every railway man in South Australia will admit that this will result in enormous economy, and in great satisfaction to the people, who will be able to transact even their most important business in their own centres. The new Railway Commissioner in South Australia has withdrawn from Adelaide a big proportion of the staff previously employed there, because it is no longer required. I have noticed in the newspapers ' that Mr Clapp and his fellow Commissioners in Victoria are proposing reforms in the same direction. The Commonwealth Government should have the most efficient railway engineer in Austraha, but instead, they have an' engineer whowas never anything better than a second-rate man-. We should have the very best that money can provide. If we had gone on with the unification of the gauges of ' the railways of Australia, We know d'o honourable) members, t h i nk that the State railway ' experts would have consented to be led by a Commonwealth officer who does not possess their qualifications ? I do not wish to debatethis .question unduly, but if I cannot convince members of this Parliament I intend, in the public press of the. country, to insist that this National Parliament shall have in its service the best men who can be found in any part, of the. world,, to control and conduct these big railway undertakings, and' thus avoid; past costly blunders.",30
108,Mr SCUSLLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable gentleman had .his opportunity when he was for Works and Railways.,30
109,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When - I was Minister for Works and Railways I did what I am I prepared the way for a policy exactly the same as that which I There is no getting more away fro m the fact that we have men who are not fit for the responsibility of He has big public expenditure.

We require only the most vigorous men in the prime of life to conduct these big undertakings.",30
110,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY," Order ! I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the motion for the-second reading of the Bill. He is taking advantage of the motion to make an attack upon a public officer, and that is not in order.",31
111,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I protest, sir, against that interpretation of my conduct. am responsible to the people of this country for what I say. My statementhas had reference to the expenditure of the funds of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and the possible cost of the railway under consideration. I stand by every word I have, said, and when I have heard a few criticisms I shall possibly return to the matter again.",31
112,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [4.40] - I intend to oppose the Bill for strategic reasons. In doing so, I should like to traverse some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) concerning the East-West line as an example. Will the honourable member contend that there is a better railway in any part of Australia than that constructed from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie ? Mr FOSTEB.(-Why should it not be a good railway? Mr YATES:-It is the finest railroad there is in the Commonwealth, and the man who was responsible for it was very proud of the job he had done. 1 refer to Mr Elliot.",31
113,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Mr Elliot agrees with every word I have said.,31
114,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I should like to have him. here to confirm that statement, which does not carry conviction, because, although the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) was Minister for Works and Railways, and has said that - he watched the East-West railway from the beginning to the end of its construction, yet he has never attempted to explain why twenty engines should have been left at Port Augusta unused. It should be a matter of interest tp the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to know why those engines, in accordance with the policy of the Government of the time, have never turned a wheel. A story goes the rounds that the Government of the day were far-seeing and optimistic in the matter of railway construction, and that the twenty engines I refer to were built to be employed on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railway from Oodnadatta to the Northern Territory. Mr FOSTEB,-They were not.'",31
115,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the rumour. As the honourable member said nothing about those engines, I suggest that he does not know the reason why they were bought. I Mr Foster - I do know all about them.",31
116,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then the honourable member has been more lacking in his duty to the Commonwealth than the oflicer whom he has maligned in connection with the construction of the East-West railway. .He was a responsible Minister, and it was his duty to reveal these things, and not to leave it to a successor to discover them.",31
117,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They were published in the reports of the Department for years.,31
118,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If that be so, they were referred to in a way which concealed the information from the general public, or the present. Minister for Works and Railways would not have published the discovery he claims to have made.",31
119,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They were referred to in the annual reports of the' Railway Commissioner for years.,31
120,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then it must have been in such a way that no one knew what had happened. These engines may have been included in the rolling-stock of the EastWest railway, but no one knew that they were surplus stock that .had never been used, and should never have been acquired. I agree with the honourable member that we have not sufficient information with regard to the financial aspect of this proposal. I do not wish to see the Commonwealth Government fritter away public money. I do not desire that they should spend money as some was spent on the East-West railway when Mr. W. Kelly, then member for Wentworth, was Minister for Works and Railways. I would remind the honourable member for Wakefield that we now have in this House a member for the Northern Territory, and I suggest that if there is any maladministration such as has been referred to in connection with railway construction in the Territory, the honourable member for the Territory will not let it pass unnoticed.",31
121,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I dare say the honourable member could tell us something.,32
122,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Possibl y he could tell us something about the railway which was authorized and never constructed. He might be able to say why the Government did not construct that line. I hope the present Minister for ""Works and ways (Mr Stewart) will hold the view that the Commonwealth is able to build its own railways. If we are not, we should make ourselves competent, and I think we could do so without importing fresh blood. I believe that amongst the engineers of Australia we could find some one competent to do what is required. We have had one or two importations recently, and amongst them Mr Webb, the Eailway Commissioner of South Australia. I point out to the honourable member for Wakefield that Mr Webb has not yet published his first annual report, and he cannot say what saving he will make in the conduct of the railways. One thing he has done has been to cut out all cleaning of brasswork on rolling stock. He has had it all painted black, and in consequence has earned the sobriquet of "" D i r t y Dick"" in South Australia, and the name well fits him. Personally, I am prepared to pay for a good hat if I can afford it.",32
123,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member does not pay, he talks. It is the people who pay ",32
124,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I pay as much as the honourable member for Wakefield pays. The honourable member parades as a farmer, but he is not a farmer. He does not depend solely upon his political salary, because he has been a storekeeper at Quorn since my entry into political life. Mir. ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER. - I ask the honorablo member to confine himself to the motion.",32
125,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was replying to an injection to the effect that I am not a contributor to the railway revenue of the country. I hope the policy adopted in the Northern Territory will not be that adopted in South Australia. The late Commissioner decided that a railway station should be not only a thing of utility, but a thing of beauty. He did away with all unsightly hoardings, and had picket fences erected and painted white. Three prizes were offered for the best kept stations in South Australia, nnd stationmasters vied with each other to win the prizes. A new station was erected, and probably such a station will be required in the Northern Territory when this extension is made. We built the new station. I do not know the Eail- opinion' of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr.'Foster), but all the taxpayers of South Australia were proud of it. A feature which was new to them was that the ramp was lined with glazed tiles. Over these glazed tiles there is now a big advertisement for ""Velvet soap."" That is how the Commissioner is making a profit on the railways.",32
126,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Tb e honourable gentleman is talking a lot of drivel.,32
127,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am stating what is actually happening. Is the honourable member for.Wakefield (Mr Foster) prepared to say that my statement is not correct? I want to get away from the extraneous matter introduced by the honourable member for Wakefield, but I join with him in emphasizing the view that the Minister should display some sagacity and take all possible steps to see that the mistakes made in the construction of the East-West line are not repeated in the extension from Mataranka to Daly Waters, Now I come to the meat in the pie. The extension has been recommended by the Public Works Committee, but I challenge members of the Committee to state their opinions on this much-debated question, and to explain why they made the recommendation, and why they went outside the ambit of their instructions in dealing with a connection to Camooweal which would settle for all time-or , as the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) said, "" for generations""-the question of the extension of the line through the centre of Australia. There is more in the recommendation than appears on the surface; and I believe that what I have suggested will happen if the recommendation is accepted. I did not make that suggestion without first drawing conclusions from the evidence printed in the report. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) said that South Australia wanted to "" drag"" everything to Adelaide. Does it not look as if South Australia has the best right to the traffic? Who is more entitled to it? Which State has attempted to develop the centre of Australia from its own territory? State carried a railway to Oodnadatta ? What State built one frean Darwin to Pine Creek? What State erected an overland telegraph for the use of the Commonwealth, and for the benefit of the eastern States, for many years? but the central State of Australia ? When we ask that the promises made should be honoured, and that the Commonwealth shall do the work which, in the interests of Australia, cannot be done too quickly, we are taunted with desiring to "" drag "" everything to South Australia. does a line to Camooweal mean ? Does it not mean that business will be "" dragged "" to Brisbane, Townsville, «r Cairns? Is that in the minds of the Ministers and the Public Works Committee? Combes has evidently got to work on the Committee. On the map supplied with the Committee's report he has outlined a proposal which he mad® to the Commission of which he was a member in 1914. The Minister has said that Mr Hobler has gone to Pellew Islands to see if that scheme is practicable. It appears that the intention is to side-step South Australia, not only for twelve years, but, as the honourable member for Lilley said, "" for generations."" There seems to be no limit. Honourable members may say that the proposed line will - develop three-fourths of the Territory, but, after having studied the figures relating to its possibilities, I say that it will do no more than develop the northern ports and the north of the Northern Territory. The map issued with the report, if it shows anything, shows that - But the larger idea of national development which South Australia conceived and desired to carry through, which would involve a railway right through the Territory, has not been considered. It is stated in evidence that the Oodnadatta line stops 80 miles short of the good country at Charlotte Waters. If the line were carried 80 miles further to Charlotte Waters and Alice Springs, a losing proposition might possibly be changed into a payable one. I say "" possibly,"" because Mr Combes stated that he had never known a pastoral railway that had paid Mr Yates. working expenses and interest. Mr. Combes says thatThe extension I have suggested of the Queensland railway system across the Barkly Tableland What would develop the Northern Territory better than any other scheme proposed. It would not'pay directly; but I do not think there is any railway in Australia, serving purely pastoral country, that has ever paid working expenses and interest.",32
128,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Railway s into pastoral What areas in New South Wales do not pay.,33
129,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They do not pay anywhere. Some of the developmental lines into agricultural areas do not pay. In South Australia, practically all the developmental lines do not pay.",33
130,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They pay working exWihat penses, but not interest.",33
131,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I should rather think they should.  Australia paid 5 per cent, in 1910. Mr Mr YATES - I am speaking on the authority of the Hon. James Jelley, a member of the Railways Standing Committee in South Australia, who supplied me with the figures relating to the working of the South Australian railways. The country railways of that State arecarried by the metropolitan railways. It is .the same in New South Wales. Unfortunately, I cannot lay my hands on extracts from the Bulletin which answered that question completely. The Bulletin showed that in New South Wales there is not a developmental line that pays. Therefore, the fact that the Northern Territory line will not pay is no argument against building it .",33
132,Mr WHITSITT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is not an economical proposition to construct the line.,33
133,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is, if one considers something more than pounds, shillings, nnd pence. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt) will agree with that view wh'en he considers production foT use instead of for profit. At present it is only when the Government can see a profit that it is willing to do anything. If the honourable member will think along the lines of production for use, he will join the Labour Party. I asked the Minister-and I had a motive in doing sowhy sleepers for a 3-ft. 6-in. railway will he used. He replied that those sleepers could be employed at a later stage for spur lines. I suggest that if spur lines are built they should be of the same gauge as the main line, so that there will be no necessity to transfer goods at the junctions. That, as appears from the evidence, was clearly the intention of the 'Government.",33
134,Mr GRKOOKY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Sleeper s would have a very short l if e in that country, and it would, therefore, be a mistake to provide at the start for an unnecessarily wide gauge. - Mr YATES - I have read that powellized sleepers are lasting very well in the Northern Territory, and that only in one or'two instances has the white ant got into them. It is stated in the evidence before the Public Works Committee that the powellized sleepers have won out. The in tention of the Government was that the line should be built to a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. Wle are getting further away from the compact with South Australia. I quote the following evidence given before the Committee by Mr Norris Garrett Bell, Commonwealth Commissioner of R a i lways, as set out on page 290 of the Committee's summary of evidence:-If a 3-ft. G-in. line were built on a 4-ft. 8}-in. Toad, it would be only necessary 'to shift one rail in order bo convert the line to the broader gauge. The newest .portion of the Darwin line has been laid on that principle, but the old .portion of the track is only made for a 3-ft -6-'in. gauge. 'The - disadvantage of - extending the present mileage 'of 3-ft. 6-in. railways is that it will be necessary to have unore rolling-stock, \both for the construction and the operation of the line, and when 'the 'line is converted to '4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, that 'Stock will be a drug in the market. Of course, it will be very many years before the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge is converted throughout Australia, but I 'hope it will not 'be long be/fore dtfher gauges 'are 'oonverbed to the standard of 4-ft. i%%-in. If (the - complete North-South line were .tn be built straight away, the first job would be to alter the gauge of the existing sections from Port Augusta to Marree or Oodnadatta, and Darwim to Emungalan (Katherine After). But if the line is - to .be built piecemeal, it would .pay to leave the existing sections as they are. 'There would be some advantage, if the Tailway followed 'the eastern route, in having - a gauge uiwiform wish .tihnrt - of the Queensland - railways., in order to enable quick transit of trains and common use of rolling-stock, but cattle will never be carried satisfaetorily for such long 'distances on 'a - narrow-gauge line. In Queensland the longest distanoe - cattle are travelled without detraining, watering, and ieeding. is 580 miles. The detraining knocks the cattle about, and a this is always objected 'to by the owners. The cattle are kept in the trucks up to 32 land 34 'hours, and then are detrained, fed, and watered. But on the Bast-West line we can carry stock 1,050 miles, and keep them in the trucks for 48 [601 hours. . .On a narrow-gauge line cattle trucks are so wide, comparatively, that it - is not safe to attain the maximum speed. I - quote that evidence to show that the Government is doing something which, in its own judgment, it should not do. The object may be to fill up the gap created by the scrapping of the A i r Force Bill . J t is for the members of the Public Works Committee to j u s t if y the position into which ithey have led the Government. They - have to let South Australia know where it stands, and whether it will ever obtain a railway from south to north. No one supports 'decentralization more than I . I do not believe in dragging everything to Adelaide. My idea of the best ""way to develop Australia is to put a railwa y right across the continent, with natural connexions east and west. It should be made a national railway. I support the North-South railway, bocause it is a national project, and will be of national benefit if tackled in a national manner. If , however, it is to be built piecemeal, the people of Australia, instead of having a railway line right through the centre of the continent, will have a line from Daly Waters to An thony's Lagoon, thence to the mouth of the MCArthur - River, and that will be the end of the - development of the vast Northern Territory which South Australia was good enough - to - give to the Commonwealth.",34
135,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bass) [5.6] - I support the Bill , although I think that the - Government are commencing railway extension 'at the wrong end. 'Had the ex-Prime Minister { Mr W . M . Hughes) been still at f h e head of the Government, 'the members for South Australia would be - making speeches very different from those we have heard from them during the last two days, because the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would have been commenced as the first section of 'the Nerth-'South line.. I regret, also., that 'the House has agreed to allow 'Govern'-mentf business to take precedence for the remainder of the, session, thus precluding me from submitting a motion, of which I gave notice some weeks ago, in 'regard - to railway construction in the Northern Territory. Although I think the Government are extending the railway from the wrong, end, I cannot 'oppose their proposal, because the line is certainly going in the right direction. That is the only merit it has in the eyes of South Australian representatives. The Government are a little unwise in giving effect to only one portion of the Public Works Committee's report. The Committee recommended the further extension of the existing northern section, and also the extension of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, and I think that even now the Government will be well advised to construct the latter project simultaneously with the former. It may be news to honourable members that on the whole 1.60 miles of country which the proposed line will traverse, there is not one occupied holding except that established by the Government at Mataranka. tainly, there is a little mining at Marranboy, which is capable of great development, bufc I do not think that a distance of 45 miles from the railway would seriously handicap the production of t in . There are more people at Alice Springs than between the Katherine River and Daly Waters.",34
136,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How many are there at Alice Springs?,35
137,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There were fortytwo when the Sectional Committee of the Public Works Committee visited the place, but unless the Commonwealth is prepared to spend £1,000,000 to £2,000,000 in constructing the railway Port Darwin further south to Newcastle Waters or Powell's Creek, the line will be a heavy drain upon the finances of the country for many years. The extension from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would have a better opportunity of paying its way than will the extension of the northern section. Experts say that the influence of a railway upon pastoral pursuits is felt for a distance of 100 miles on either side. A line constructed from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, a distance of 297 miles, would servo Mount Stuart, the actual centre of Australia, and a comparatively large number of occupied holdings - I do not wish to mislead the House in regard to the quality of the land in different portions of the Territory. It is quite safe to say that the richest portion is the Victoria River district, for not only is that land equal in quality to that of the Barkly Tablelands, but it has an abundance of natural waters which the Tablelands do not enjoy. On the Tablelands illimitable supplies may be tapped by boring to a depth of about 200 feet, and there are wonderful natural grasses. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) said that the Public Works Committee would have great difficulty in justifying its recommendation that the northern section should be extended southwards to Newcastle Waters-I - personally think it should be carried further south before swinging to the east-bu t the country which the line will traverse is infinitely superior to that strip between Newcastle Waters and the Macdonnell Ranges. Evidence taken by the Public Works Committee supports that contention. Dr Gilruth informed the CommitteeCer- A railway to the Macdonnell Ranges will make the position much safer for the pastoralists, who have had difficulty frequently in getting stock even from the Macdonnell Ranges to Oodnadatta. Tliat is a long, dry stretch, Oodnadatta being within the 5 to G-in. rainfall belt. Even Eergott Springs is within the 6-in. rainfall belt. No r t h of the Barkly Tablelands and in the Victoria River district there is a very good rainfall, varying from 15 inches \to 20 inches per annum.. Those districts thus enjoy a wonderful advantage over the country further south. I remind the honourable member for Adelaide that the Public Works Committee was instructed to report upon two definite sections df the from proposed North-South railway, and was not empowered to take evidence whether or hot the Commonwealth was keeping its contract with South Australia. A pronouncement upon that point was not the function of the Works Committee. Such a question must be determined by the High Court. In Queensland evidence was advanced that no compact exists.",35
138,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did anybody say that? . Mr JACKSON - I do not say that the compact does not exist. Mr M . CAMEBON - Why did the Committee go to Queensland for evidence?,35
139,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Committee was asked fco undertake a definite inquiry, and the proper procedure was to visit any places where evidence was available. As this proposed railway is essentially a national project, it was essential that the Committee should visit all States that were directly interested in it . The Committee took evidence even in Western Australia because of the possible effect which railway development in the north of the continent might have upon the Kimberley country. When witnesses coine before the Committee it is not for members of the Committee to dictate what evidence they shall give. Queensland members of the Committee exercised their right to ask various witnesses their opinion regarding the arrangement which the State of South Australia was supposed to have made with the Commonwealth.",35
140,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member said that that question was not referred to the Committee. Evidently the Committee exceeded its authority. Mr JACKSON' - It was not referred to the Committee, but I will not say that the Committee should have discarded evidence, that was presented to it .",36
141,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member think that questions regarding the compact were justified?,36
142,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I became a member of the Public Works Committee two or three weeks before the transcontinental trip by the sectional Committee was undertaken. The sectional Committee was composed of Senator Newland (Chairman), Senator Foil, and myself, and in matters of procedure I was guided by the two members of longer experience, and the Secretary.",36
143,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who was in the chair when those questions were asked?,36
144,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Senato r Newland. Such questions were asked not only by Queensland members of the Committee, bufc also by the Chairman of the sectional Committee. If honourable members' will read the evidence, they will discover that the same issue was raised in South Australia, and, I believe, at least one South Australian witness expressed grave doubts whether any compact for the construction of the railway north and south exists. However, that issue does not concern the House at the present moment. The enforcement of the compact, if any exists, is a matter for the attention of South Australian members. I think I can safely say that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) and I wore the only unbiased members of the Committee.. I exclude the Chairman (Mr Gregory), because, on account of ill ness, he attended very few of the meetings at which this reference was dealt with. The other members of the Committee comprised three Queenslanders, one South Australian, and one representative from New South Wales. Each of those three States hopes to derive some benefit from the construction of the North-South railway. The Queensland members of the Committee wished to swing the railway to the east, in order to link up with the Queensland railways and ports, and the New 'South W l a e s representative helped them, because he thought that such a line would be extended south vid Boulia, Windorah, Eromanga, and Thargomindah to Bourke, thus forming direct communication between Darwin and Sydney. Of course, Senator Newland was battling for the interests of South Australia. Mr M . CAMERON - For the honouring of the compact? Mir. JACKSON - No . He thought, as I think, that the first section of the railway to be built should be that from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, because the country is worth it . Such a railway would make a lot of land productive, and would have more chance of paying working expenses and contributing something towards interest and sinking f u n d than will the 160 miles of line from Mataranka to Daly Waters, where, as I have said, along the route of which there is not one occupied holding, except the Government station at Mataranka, which has been run . at a considerable loss for many years. Dr Gilruth's evidence, continuedI consider that a railway extension in the north, and another in the south, from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, would be sufficient to open up the Northern Territory, without running a railway through 600 or 700 miles of poor country. A railway extension from the Katherine to Daly Waters would not traverse very good pastoral country. From the .Katherine practically to Mataranka is all, poor country. Tliere are patches of better country heTe and there, but the meTe fact that nobody has taken it up, although it is practically near to civilization, indicates the character of it without necessarily seeing it . I think it is time the Government made some announcement as to when they will continue the line southwards from Daly Waters, and whether it is their intention to extend it eastwards across the Barkly Tableland into Queensland. Personally I favour the eastern extension, but it is no use attempting, with two little railways, or even with a through railway, to develop a country four and a half times the size of the British Isles. There must be many thousand miles of railway before that country can be properly developed.' When the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) was speaking an honourable member opposite interjected that if the line were to be built from the south instead of from the north he would not be condemning the railway management. In fairness to the honourable member for Wakefield, I may say that when he and I discussed that phase of the question last week he - was very definite as to what he proposed to say in the House today. I am confident that if the line had been taken from the south instead of the north the honourable member's words would have been the same. Mr Hobler, the Commonwealth engineer, when giving evidence before the Committee, suggested that, instead of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, there ought to be a line to Marree, north to, Birdsville, and thence to Camooweal, across the Tablelands to Darwin. A more insane proposition could not be put before the Parliament of any country. look at a rainfall map of Australia we find that the belt with a rainfall of under 10 inches is in the west pa'rt of Queensland, and that for something like 700 or 800 miles the railway favoured by Mr . Hobler would go in a southerly direction, and eventually in a south-westerly direction, through country with a rainfall of from less than 8 inches to 3|- inches. I shall read an extract from the evidence of a man who lives on the very route of that suggested railway, and honourable members should ask themselves whether any one man who thought that a railway was likely to go through his property-of course, to his considerable benefit-woul d give such evidence if he did not honestly believe it to be true. The witness was Mr Willia m John Crombie, whose, station is situated where the rainfall is $ \ inches, and where frequently no rain falls in twelve or fifteen months. He saidVery little of the country is subject to floods. Honourable members may smile, but permit me to explain what that means. rain comes to places in Queensland, as at Winton, the gently sloping country allows the water to, flow over a largearea, and to. flood thousands of square miles, but of a very shallow depth. I had a letter some time ago from Birdsville stating that there had been no rain there for eight months,, but that the country all round was asgreen as .possible.. The explanation that the water had flowed, dawn some 200 OF 300miles., so that while there was no Mr Jackson. rain there was plenty of feed. That is what the witness meant. To proceedVery little of this country is subject to floods; the average rainfall is under 4 inches per annum. The bore water runs for about 2 miles through my country, and the stock have to be brought from any portion of the run to that water for a drink. I have put down fourteen wells, and in every instance have struck salt water-so sadt, in some instances, that the hydrometer will not measure it. The deepest well was 98 feet, and the shallowest 54 feet. The cost of my putting down a bore would be altogether too great;, this bore here cost £11,000, and I do not think the country is worth it. Open bores are just a harbour for vermin-dingoe s and rabbits-and run to waste. It would be of more use if the water were confined in some way. Here is the point to which I desire to call particular attentionIn my opinion, this country is not good If we enough to warrant the construction of a railway from Marree to Birdsville. Yet an engineer for Commonwealth Railways says that the country is better in 1 the . north of South. Australia than in Central Australia. If - honourable members read that gentleman's evidence they will see that he got badly "" tangled up "" in his description of the country at the Kimberleys, Alice Springs and Central Australia, and the north-east of South Australia. Prom honourable members who have read Professor Gregory's Dead Heart of Australia, dealing with what is known as. the Lalie Eyre Basin, I shall be disap-' pointed if I hear any suggestion that the North-South line should be built in such a "" dog-leg ''' fashion as through the Barkly Tablelands, the western portions of Queensland, and into the State of South Australia. I understand that in 1912 the Queensland Government proposed to construct a line linking up its three main lines that run out from the coast; but nothing has been done in that direction. I shall not be a party to expenditure on taking a line through any When portionof a State so poorly watered as is the west of Queensland.",36
145,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is not t r u e ! It is not because the country is bad that no action has been taken. The case quoted by the honourable member is quite an isolated one.,37
146,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the. honourable, is member seen that country I",37
147,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yea ; I have travelled over a. good portion.,37
148,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member has been anywhere near Bendourie, and says that that country is good, he must have gone there with his eyes shut. For from 150 to 200 miles about Bendourie and Birdsville the country, if not exactly a continuation of sand-hills, has a poorer rainfall and is worse than any country in the Northern Territory.",38
149,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why quote one spot, and gay that it is typical of the whole of western Queensland ?",38
150,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I did not say so, but it is typical of most of the country that this suggested line would run over. I am not concerned with the Gulf country, where the rainfall and the land are good, but with that portion where the Queensland Government hopes that the Commonwealth GovernmetS will build a railway which the State Government is afraid to build. I am disappointed that the Government has not seen its - way to accept the advice of the Public Works Committee, and proceed with the work of construction in the south. I was interested to hear from the honourable member for Wakefield that the Minister (Mr Stewart) intends to visit Alice Springs, and to report to the Government on the position there. sincerely trust that by car, or camel, or horse, he will have a look at the country the line will traverse, and then tell the plain truth in regard to both sections. I can quite understand that the Government cannot see its way to carry the line to Newcastle Waters, because that project would have to be referred to the Public Works Committee for consideration and report. But before we pass the second reading I think the M in ister ought to assure us that the work now to be carried out' is only part of the scheme, and that it is the intention of the Government to ask the Public Works Committee to report on the further extensions in the south, through to Newcastle Waters or Powells Creek, and also the extension across the Barkly Tablelands. If these works are carried out, I feel sure that for a number of years the railway requirements of the Territory will have been met. Then will be the time to decide whether the line shall link up between Alice . Springs and Newcastle Waters or Powells Creek, wherever the terminus may be ",38
151,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What rainfall is there at Alice Springs?,38
152,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"For twenty-eight years prior to 1920, there was an average rainfall of 10.73 inches.",38
153,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Northern Territory ) [5.30] - It is not my intention'to labour the question. What I am concerned about is the passing of the measure as t : stands, and that, I take it , is assured. There are, however, a few comments that I should like to make in connection with the statement of the Minister (Mr . Stewart). We are told that steel sleepers are to be used in the construction of this line. It is true that the Territory is somewhat infested with white ants, and that ordinary timbers are of little or no use in railway construction. The statement has been advanced that powellised sleepers are quite all right, but that I deny. Practical experience has shown that powellised sleepers are useless in the Northern Territory, where I have seen them penetrated at all angles by white^ ants. Where this treated timber is ex-' posed to the atmosphere, as in the stanchions of bridges, it becomes simply a mass of dry rot which can be kicked away. However, there is in the Territory a timber which resists all attacks, and it I is available in quantities more than sufficient to meet the requirements of this railway. I refer to iron-wood, quantities of which were used in the construction of the original railway in the Northern Territory and are sound today. That is what could not be said even of steel sleepers. In view of the fact that the use of iron-wood would open up a new avenue of employment, the Minister would be well advised to discard both steel and powellised timber in favour of sleepers which will last not only for a decade but for a century. Iron-wood used in the Territory in the times of the Dutch settlement is quite sound today.",38
154,Mr MAXWELL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What sleepers were used on the existing section of the line from Darwin? ' Mr NELSON - On the last section constructed by the Commonwealth, from the Katherine to Pine Creek, powellised and steel sleepers were used, the former on the curves, and the latter on the straight. The section from Pine Creek to Darwin was laid with a dish-shaped sleeper which has not proved in any way effective. Bust attacks it , and it cannot be compared with iron-wood for such work.",38
155,Mr BOWDEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is there sufficient ironwood available?,39
156,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is ample for the section now proposed to be constructed, but it is doubtful whether would be sufficient for the whole line Oodnadatta northwards, and for replaceset. ments. It was recently suggested that 8-ft. sleepers suitable for a 4-ft. 8i}-in. line could be supplied at 10s. each. do not think that steel sleepers could obtained nearly as cheaply as that, and am certaiu that their life would not. half that of ironwood sleepers. I hope that the Minister (Mr Stewart) will sider this aspect, and also the matter the gauge. The section constructed from Pine Creek to Emungalan was laid witli a view to its subsequent conversion the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, and I have no doubt the same practice could be followed on the section now under' consideration. - In view of the proposal to unify the railability way gauges, it would save much expense if, in the first place, sleepers suitable the standard Commonwealth gauge were provided, because, when the conversion took place, hundreds of miles of railway could be widened in a comparatively short time. If sleepers for the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge were employed, and we had to replace them, they would represent a total Eight-feet sleepers would not be more expensive than those suitable for a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line. The average life of powellized sleeper in the Northern Terrifrom tory is less than twelve months, although view. the steel sleepers laid between Pine Creek and Emungalan in 1915 are standing well. The nearer they are to the coast day. the shorter the life of the sleepers, owing to the increasing humidity and saltness of the atmosphere. I understand that steel sleepers are useless for curves, therefore, ironwood should be adopted least on all curves. The Minister (Mr. Stewart) remarked that the experts were of opinion that the extension of the from its present contemplated terminus ai Daly Waters to Newcastle Waters would pay. That is an astounding stateunreservedly ment",39
157,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not think that I willingly withdraw the remark. made that statement.,39
158,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If not, I must have misunderstood the Minister.",39
159,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As a matter of fact, the line cannot pay for the next hundred years.",39
160,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Railway s in areas there like the Northern Territory cannot be from expected to prove profitable at the outTheir object is to develop the country, and, if they do that, they will pay indirectly. It has been mentioned that I the building of the proposed line would be assist to open up the Roper River area, I or Arnheim's land, a district that I venbe ture to say has not been visited by any honourable member. There are very few conpeople, even in the Northern Territory, of who have been there. It is one of the best watered and best grassed parts of the Territory, and this line, as suggested to by the honourable member for Bass (Mr. Jackson) will materially assist the development of. that area. It has been said that Mr Hobler reported on the advisof the construction of a line from Borroloola; but I maintain that it is not for part of Mr Hobler's duty to suggest new routes. As a railway expert, his activities should be confined to the particular area through which he has been asked to build a line. It is not within his province to say where it is advisable to build a line,; he should confine himself to the loss. construction of authorized lines.",39
161,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Mr Hobler was sent as a railway engineer to give an estia mate and to report on the possibilities railway and engineering points of,39
162,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Some of the engineers have outlined railway policy before to,39
163,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has been suggested that Mr Hobler's remarks were a deciding factor, but I am glad to hear that and, statement refuted by the Minister. at The honourable member for Angas (Mr. Gabb) has taken 'exception to a statement that I . made yesterday by way of line interjection. I did not wish to impute any ulterior motive to honourable members from South Australia, and I now withdraw the statement that I made. Certainly I was somewhat heated at the moment, and I assure the honourable member for Angas that I I am pleased that the Minister intends visiting the country that would be served by the southern portion of a North-South line, and I have no doubt that he will be greatly impressed with its possibilities. My own opinion is that the Oodnadatta-Alice Springs end of the line would be the better paying proposition for some years ahead, by virtue, not of its agricultural or pastoral potentialities, but purely because of its mining possibilities. Shortly after its construction, a line fro m Oodnadatta to AliceSprings would attract thousands of people to the mining areas in the Macdonnell Ranges. The section now proposed to be constructed in the Territory will not be a large revenue-producer, but it will continue the railway in the right direction; and, if the land laws are administered in the interests of development, I am satisfied that the line will prove useful in the near future. If , however, the land is locked up, the line will merely serve a few large squatters. I am not deceived as to the intention of some of the advocates of a deviation from Newcastle Waters across to Camooweal. An extension to Camooweal Would not to any great extent assist the development of the Territory. The possibility of a line from Borroloola to Newcastle Waters has been mentioned, and that would be far more likely to lead to development than a deviation to Camooweal - The whole matter should be viewed from an Australian stand-point, and no consideration as to how Queensland should be linked up should prevent honourable members from giving effect to the best proposal for the settlement of the Territory. I am not much concerned whether the Queensland railway system is linked up at one or at any number of points, so long as a railway is buil t through the Territory. We have not only to consider South Australia and Queensland. Western Australia has just as big a moral claim as those - States to the development of parts of the Territory. The western portion of the Territory is identical with the north-west coast country of Western Australia. The main consideration should be how best and most quickly the Territory can be served. Great results cannot accrue from the extension of the railway to its present proposed terminus; but I am satisfied that the right route has been selected, and that ultimately the through line will be completed. I am at all times ready to support a step in that direction.",39
164,Mr WHITSITT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Darwin) [ 5 . 5 0 ] - I do not wish to give a silent vote on the. Bill . I am asked to vote for the expenditure of £1,500,000 on 160 miles of railway. I have before me a line of railway 200 miles in length which has lost in round figures, £720,000. I have not yet been informed of the productivity of the land adjacent to the proposed extension, or what it is suitable for. We are asked to spend £1,500,000, and we do not know who is going to occupy the land adjacent to the line, whether the land is now occupied, what is the productivity of the land, or what the railway, when constructed, .will carry.",40
165,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member . will get that information fro m the report of the Public Works Committee. ,",40
166,Mr WHITSITT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"- I have not that in formation. We are informed that one train a fortnight is sufficient over the 200 miles of railway already constructed, and, in these circumstances, is it not mad-cap folly to propose the expenditure of £1,500,000 to extend this line for 160 miles.",40
167,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is from a financial point of view.,40
168,Mr WHITSITT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then , from a financial point of view, I shall vote against the Bill.",40
169,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Maribyrnong) [5.52]. - - I regret the absence of some members of the Public Works Committee, because I wish'to say with respect to one aspect of the matter, which has led to a very serious protest from representatives coming from South Australia, that there is a distinctly political flavour about the recommendation of the Committee. It has not given a judicial decision upon the matters submitted to it . I want to know why the Committee went out of its way to say anything about diverting this line to Camooweal, in Queensland. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) disclaim responsibility for that. I am not here to decry any portion of the Commonwealth, but I believe that if the North-South line is constructed in accordance with the agreement with South Australia, it. will be taken as nearly as possible directly south fro m Port Darwin u n t i l it reaches Oodnadatta. I was very glad to hear the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr - Nelson) refer to the claims of the centre of the Northern Territory. There is a vast area in the centre of the Territory, the possibilities of which have not yet been determined. Some of us have followed the reports of explorers who from time to time have advanced into the interior of Australia, but we really do not yet know what are the resources of Central Australia. I do not believe that wo ever will know its resources until there is railway communication with those par-ts that have not yet been thoroughly investigated. There is a tendency to divert railways at the expense of the Commonwealth in the direction of a certain State, which, because of its population and financial position, is in a position to look after its own interests without looking to the 'Commonwealth for the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds.",40
170,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who suggested that that should be done?,41
171,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I say that the Public Works Committee went out of its way to make mention of Camooweal in connection with this project. The Committee's decision was a political decision. If Committees appointed by this House are to give political decisions, the sooner they are abolished the better. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), who, according to nil reports, has splendidly filled the position of Chairman of the Public Works Committee did not, because of illness, take part in the investigation . of this proposal, .except perhaps in the formulation of the report in conference with his colleagues. This afternoon the - lionorable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) made the statement that when the Chairman was absent from meetings of the Committee, there were only two unbiased members of the Committee who took evidence in connection with this matter.",41
172,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did the honourable member mention their names?,41
173,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . He was one of them himself and the other was the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews). That leaves the other members of the Committee to explain their position. I am not imputing wrong motives, but when three members of a committee who come from the same State make a long pull and a short pull in a certain direction the House does not derive much benefit from the investigations by that committee. I hope that this is the last occasion upon which it may be said that political and State views have been taken of what should be regarded as a great national undertaking.. The honourable member for Darwin .(Mr.. Whitsitt) has complained that we are being asked to spend .£1,500,000 upon this extension. A3 he does not know the quality of the soil along the route or who occupies it, he intends to vote against the proposal.",41
174,Mr WHITSITT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is business, and I came here to do business.",41
175,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable mem-' ber comes from a comparatively small part of the Commonwealth, and we have to deal in this continent with vast distances. I suppose that in every State, including Tasmania, it is possible to point to certain sections of the railway system that are* not paying.",41
176,Mr WHITSITT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , but nothing like this.",41
177,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It all depends on the outlook. We are following the example of other great countries, where the people have regarded railway construction not merely from the pounds, shillings, and pence point of view, but have constructed railways which are being operated today to great advantage, although they do not pay - The Governments of those countries do not expect them to pay for years to come.",41
178,Mr WHITSITT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But they confer indirect benefits.,41
179,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I recognise that same indirect benefits may follow from the construction of this line. I believe it was the Fisher Government that made the arrangement for the taking over of the Territory by the Commonwealth, and we have too long pursued a mark-time policy there. Notwithstanding certain legal interpretations of the agreement with South Australia, the essence of the contract is the construction of a direct North-South line.",41
180,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the only line that can help the Northern Territory.,41
181,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would assist the development also of other parts of Australia. I believe that Professor Gregory was responsible for the statement that there was a "" dead heart"" in Australia. I disagree entirely with that statement. We talk loosely of "" d r y areas"" and ""sandy tracts,"" but nomadic tribes, of Arabs who at one time made a bare living, in certain portions, of the* Sahara Desert found that by boring they were able to obtain water from below the surface of the laud, and could use it for irrigation, and. they were subsequently able to carry on very fine farms. need to disabuse our minds once and.for ull of the idea that there are great tracts of barren country in Australia. We know that at one time, on maps of Australia, there was written across the Mallee the words "" Desert country."" That was one of the greatest libels ever published. Geographers, have of ten made similarmistakes in their descriptions of country. I will not say that fro m an agricultural point of view, but certainly fromi a mining point of view, Central Australia has marvellous, resources, and may yet open tothei Commonwealth practically unlimited wealth. B y carrying a line into that district we shall be doing something which will lead to the development, of Australia generally. I hope that X have misinterpreted a promise which the Minister gave aa a reason for saying little about the section of the NorthSouth railway earamecting Oodnadatta with the Macdonnell Banges. He said that, aa sooni asi he could be relieved of his parliamentary duties he intended to make ajourney from Oodnadatta along the route of' the tine inquired into> by the Public Works Committee. I hope; he did not give that as a reason for delaying the construction/ o l that section, and' that before tha Bill leaves' the Committee stage he will say what course the Government intend to pursue with regard to that part of the recomorrendation o l the Public Works Committee-.. We ax©' mow being asked to expend £1,500,00,0. on. the construction of 160 miles of railway in the Northern Territory, and I think that the expenditure will cover a. number of years. When I was a member of the Public Works Committee an inquiry was made into the construction of an extension' from Pine Creek to the Katherine Rfver-. It should beremembered thai! fheKatherine River isa very wide stream in the wet season', 1 and those' charged! with the construction of a. bridge over that, river will need) to secure thei structure int such a way that it wild noifr bes washed away in. flondt time. That wiUl ba one of thes engineering; difficulties associated with this extensions. The bridge is estimated to cost £90,000, but I think its. construction will' occupy a very considerable, time. Mr WA . TKINS - It should not, as, there, are good high banks on either side of the river.",41
182,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There , will be no difficulty We about it at all.",42
183,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member will' take the trouble to read the evidence which has been taken on this matter he will find that during a certain portion of the year it is absolutely impossible to carry out any bridge construction at the Katherine Biver. I know of several bridges which are in hand at the present time; and they are taking' a .long time to buiid. Theengineers engaged on this bridge will have toguard against the torrential rains,, otherwise the first half of the bridge may be washed away before they will be able to proceed with the second half. I have heard the evidence tendered by men who are qualified to testify. They state that it will be no easy matter to build a bridge over the Katherine Eiver. The building of this bridge will delay the work very considerably. I presume that it will' be necessary to construct the bridgebefore an engine can be used to convey structural materials to other parts of the line. Until the bridge has been completed very 1 little but earthworks can be put in hand. I am not speaking now aa a pessimist, but I am pointing out. how long the southern part of the lin e will be delayed if it has to wait, for. the completion of the northernportion.. The Minister may say that he would, like to see the country himself,, aud be in. a better position to make a recommendation to the Governs ment from first-hand knowledge. I hope, if he makes such, ai visit, that he"", will bo accompanied by those who are capable: of giving him expert advice'. Although I voted for the; amendment, movedby the honourable member for.

184,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The greatest engineering problem is the Katherine River.,43
185,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that the construction of the line was stopped at the northern bank of the Katherine River because of the big expense involved in building the bridge. The Minister has corroborated my view, that in tropical countries very considerable difficulties have to be overcome in bridging rivers. 1 understood the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) to say that very little of the land adjacent to the line is occupied. In this connection the Minister has made available to the House a typed schedule headed ""Northern Territory Railway Extension. Book of Reference of Land Required for Proposed Extension of Darwin-Emungalan Railway to Daly Waters. Length, 160 miles 35 chains. Minimum width of land required, 600 links."" This schedule gives the names of the lessees of land through which the railway will pass. I do not think that one foot of the Territory has yet been relinquished by the Crown. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that statement. Mr .STEWABT - I do not think there is any freehold in large areas.",43
186,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certain companies are mentioned in the schedule, and iby ferring to the map I find that they supposed to hold large areas on either of the line. Willeroo and Manbullo Ximited, Kruger and Walden, and F. E. Thoneman arc names printed on large areas.",43
187,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,'The honourable member will be able to deal with that aspect the question when the Bill relating to Land Ordinance in the Northern Terriin tenders. tory is brought before the House.,43
188,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There was force in work the contention of the Leader of the O/pnearly position (Mr Charlton) when he said that it would have been better for House to deal with the Northern Terrinouncement tory Crown Lands Bill before dealing with the extension of the railway. the House knew how the Government inRanges. tended to act towards those who hold land under lease or licence, it would be better able to handle the proposal to construct a railway. Bovril (Australian Estates) and N . A. and A. V . Miller are well established in the district. I was afraid that the Minister intended to adhere to the intention of having all work done by contract. In that event, many abuses would creep in. Honourable members may say that abuses would creep in under a system of day labour, but the abuses would beimuch greater if the work were carried out by contract. If contractors were operating . there, the Commonwealth would require a well-paid army of inspectors to see that the work, was done honestly. I am glad that, notwithstanding the protests of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), the railway will be constructed by day labour. I trust that the supervision over the work will be such as to insure efficiency. Day labour can be, and has 'been, made a success in Victoria by proper supervision. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Government should not do its work iby day labour.",43
189,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It has been stated that it cost £300 to remove one tree by day labour in that part of Australia.,43
190,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wor k carried out on the East-West railway line showed the great superiority of day labour. Prirevate contractors would have charged are £2,000,000 to do work which the Comside monwealth Government did by day labour for £900,000 less.",43
191,Mr KILLEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Government did not call for tenders for that work.,43
192,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Some of the keenest and cleverest men in Australia tendered of for that work. Some of the most promia nent contractors in South Australia sent The prices asked by the tenderers were so high that the Commonwealth Government decided to do the itself. The result was that it saved £1,000,000. I support the motion. Before the Bill reaches its final stage the perhaps the Minister will make an anas to what the Government proposes to do regarding a railway beI f tween"" Oodnadatta and the Macdonnell",43
193,Mr LACEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Grey) [6.16] - I do not wish to be understood as opposing the Bill , but I bope it will not in any way prejudice the construction of the line from Oodnadatta northwards. I rise to answer certain allegations that have been made during the discussion. vernment must have some reason for starting the line from the northern end, while making no provision for the southern end. It may be that a departure from the agreement made with South Australia is contemplated. It is essential for the development of the Northern Territory that there should be a direct line north and south, as proposed in the agreement with South Australia. Running out from that line there might be spur lines - to develop the country to the east and west. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) referred to the construction of the EastWest line. His remarks had reference probably to clause 9 of the Bill . While it is the intention of the Government not to let the whole of the work, or any large section of it , by contract, the honourable member for Wakefield endeavoured to prove to the House that work done by contract is cheaper than that carried out by day labour. When dealing with the question of contract versus day labour last Thursday, I quoted very extensively from a report by Mr A . W . Robinson, Chairman of the Railways Standing Committee in South Australia. I do not wish to repeat what I said on that occasion, but in reply to the honourable member for Wakefield, to apprise Government of the true position, I desire to place the full facts regarding the construction East-West line before the The honourable member for Wakefield was unable to state offhand the estimated cost of constructing the transcontinental railway. The report of the Railways Standing Committee in South Australia shows that the estimate submitted by Mr Henry Deane in 1911 was £3,508 per mile, excluding rolling-stock. The greater portion of the construction wae carried out by the present Commissioner, Mr Norris _ G. Bell, and it was estimated that the final cost of the line would be £5,807 per mile. The total estimated cost was £4,045,000 and the actual cost to June, 1919, £6,04,5,017, or £5,750 per mile. It has been said that there was a shameful waste of public money because the estimate was exceeded by £2,300 per mile. Complaint might just as reasonably be made that the line was too cheaply conThe Go- structed, because in 1913 the South Australian Railway Department estimated that a similar line, with the same ruling grade, between Salisbury and Port Augusta, would cost £7,833 per mile. Mr . Deane's estimate and the estimate of the South Australian Railway Department were based on wages at 10s. per day, whereas the average wage actually paid was 13s. OJd. The actual expenditure included £1,246,265 for work for which Mr . Deane's estimate made no provision whatever. It is only fair to state the details of the work which was actually carried out, but not provided for in the original estimate, because the comparison made by the newspapers and everybody else is a comparison of the estimated cost with the actual cost.",43
194,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . --The honourable member may not relate the history of the East-West railway unless he can apply it specifically to this Bill.,44
195,Mr LACEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The justification for my remarks is clause 9, which will allow the Commissioner to carry out work by contract. Upon that point certain remarks were made by the honourable member for Wakefield. the",44
196,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I called the attention of the honourable member for Wakeof the field to the fact that his remarks were House. wide of the issue. I ask the honourable member to make them as intimate to the Bill as possible.,44
197,Mr LACEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am endeavouring to show that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth that no portion of the proposed railway shall be constructed by contract. The figures I have quoted prove that the East-West railway was built more economically by day labour than it could have been built by contract. In the same report is a statement by Mr . Bell to the effect that between the preparation of the estimate in 1911 and his assumption of office in 1914, additions and alterations were made to the original design, specification, and conditions, 1 which added to the estimate almost £1,250,000. The following is a summary of these alterations :Weight of rails increased from 70 lbs. to 80 lbs. per yard Ballasting with broken stone or gravel instead of earth and increasing quantity of ore ballast... 501,196 Additional earthwork ... Provision of electric staff ... Improvements to wharf and jetty at Port Augusta Road, over-bridges, and road diversions and level crossings at Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie ... Terminal accommodation at Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, including workshops, machinery, acquisition of land, &c. ... ... Payment for public holidays and accident pay and compensation for injured woaikmen ... I sincerely hope that .the Minister will order that the proposed line bo built departmentally.. The contractor has to in cur the same costs as has the Department, and in addition the Government have to pay him his profit. A good deal has been said about the surplus rolling-stock at Port Augusta. I assure the Minister that there is a good deal more rolling-stock there than he is actually aware of, and ho might consider whether it could be converted to the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge and used on the North-South railway.",44
198,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The locomotives cannot be converted.,45
199,Mr LACEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"An y surplus rolling-stock that cannot be converted should be disposed of as soon as possible and other stock purchased. This material was bought at a time when it was proposed that the North-South line should be buil t on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, starting from K in goonyah. I believe that the line was actually surveyed, and the Government of the day displayed .great foresight in procuring the additional rolling-stock which is stored at P o r t Augusta today.",45
200,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The line was not surveyed.,45
201,Mr LACEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No railway should be constructed in the Northern Territory that will prejudice the direct North and South l in e and despite what has been said r by the honourable member for Wakefield and others, all construction should be iby day labour.",45
202,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,45
203,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 8 . 0 ] - I wish £ to reply to one or two speeches made in the course of the debate, particularly the ... 191,286 speech of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster). It was an extraordinary speech, and, in effect, a tirade of ... 253,336 abuse directed at Mr Bell, the present ... 8,428 Chief Commissioner of Commonwealth 24,186 Railways. As it was made in a place where Mr Bell himself cannot reply, 1 should be lacking in my duty, as the 14,647 Minister in charge of the Department, if I allowed the statements to pass unchallenged. The honourable ... 204,671 member for Wakefield accused the Chief Commissioner of incapacity, and in proof ... 47,715 pGinted to the results of that officer's workin the construction of the Transcontinental £1,246,265 .Railway. The honourable member contended that the estimated cost of that line was largely exceeded because of the Commissioner's incapacity. It is perfectly true that the estimated cost was largely exceeded; but I deny that that was because of any incapacity on the part of the Commissioner. I should like to quote a few figures in regard to the dost of the line. The estimate, prepared before the present Commissioner took office, was £4,04'5,000. It was an estimate far lower than it should have been. Excluding rolling-stock, it represented £3,508 per mile. The rails, fastenings, and sleepers alone cost £3,000 per mile, which, under the estimate, left a little over £500 per mile for laying the road, doing all the earthworks, building the bridges, culverts, telegraph lines, and so for t h . POT permanent way material alone the estimate was short by no less than £1,270,000; that was for the purchase price of the material, and landing it on the works. The weight of r a i l was in creased from 7tf lbs. to 80 lbs. per yard. Ballasting was done as against earth packi n g ; additional earthworks were carried out in order to give better grades. A great deal of the line was ballasted in a more permanent way, and resulted in a line superior to that anticipated when the estimate was framed. Perhaps the best way of proving that the cost of construction was not excessive is by comparing it with the cost of construction of railways within the State of South Australia. The actual cost of the railway, excluding rolling stock, was £5,900 per mile. The Gawier to Angaston line, in South Australia, cost £8,728 per mile, while the River ton to Clare railway cost £9,167 per mile. The Gawier to Angaston line was built when materials were cheap and wages were low, and, under the circumstances, the cost of building the transcontinental line was not excessive.",45
204,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Compar e like with l i k e ',46
205,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thes e figures have been quoted before, and the fact that they make the honourable member uncomfortable does not deter me from quoting them again. I have had prepared a comparison of the costs of work carried out under contract by Mr Teesdale Smith over 14 miles, and by the Commissioner over an adjoining 14 miles. Under the Teesdale Smith contract the price of cuttings was 4s. 6d. per yard, and under the Commissioner 2s. 3|$d. pei"" yard. The price of hanks under the Teesdale Smith contract was 2s. 6d. per yard, but under the Commissioner this cost was included in that of the cutting. Under the Teesdale Smith contract the price of side cuttings was 2s. fid. per yard, and under the Commissioner Is. 4^d. per yard. The price of surface formation under the Teesdale Smith contract was 60s. at IS feet wide, and under the Commissioner 42s. I d . at 17 feet wide. The honourable member for Wakefield, although he cannot deny these facts, uses alleged excessive cost of the line as a proof that the Commissioner is incompetent, and unfit to undertake the construction of the line contemplated by the Bill . I do not know whether the honourable member, when Minister for Works and Railways, ever travelled over the transcontinental line.",46
206,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have travelled over it .,46
207,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,When the honourable member was Minister ?,46
208,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No .,46
209,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member has accused the Chief Commissioner of incompetency, but it appears that when he was invited by the Commissioner to travel on the line he did not accept the invitation.",46
210,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Commissioner invite the Minister!,46
211,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then I shall say that the honourable member did not accept what was a very proper suggestion for the Chief Commissioner to make. The EastWest line is the best equipped and the best conducted in Australia, and it gives greater satisfaction to the travelling public than any other railway in this country, and probably in the world. These results have been obtained under the control of a Commissioner who for half an hour today was the subject of a tirade of abuse from the honourable member. Let me now quote some of the opinions expressed by world-wide travellers on the way in which the East-West line is conducted by the present Commissioner. The original letters in which these opinions appear may be seen by honourable members if they so desire. In one letter it is statedThe railway struck rae as being extremely well managed and equipped. Another letter saysI do not think T could have heen more comfortable. AnotherI have travelled in many parts of the world, and I do not know in any service more careful attention to the travelling public. AnotherI have travelled in most of the famous European expresses, and this year crossed North America by the New York Central and Canadian-Pacific Railway. Your cars exceed anything I experienced in America in comfort.",46
212,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not deny that.,46
213,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then I pass on. The recognised standards of cost in operating railways are, for maintenance, the cost, per average mile of railway open, and, for locomotive and traffic working, 'the cost per t r a in mile. The management, under Commissioner Bell compares more than favourably with that in South Australia. The maintenance of permanentway under Commissioner Bell costs £ 7 2 per mile, while on the South Australian railways that cost is £ 1 7 1 per mile. The traffic working on the Commonwealth line costs 19d. per mile, and on the South Australian railways 28d. per mile. The honourable member for Wakefield cannot refute those figures.",46
214,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They do not mean anything I,46
215,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member went on to say that the extra locomotives referred to were ordered by Mr . Bell. As a matter of fact, these locomotives, which, in the words of the honourable member, "" have not turned a wheel,"" were ordered by the Fisher Government, and not at the request of the Commissioner.",46
216,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Perhaps it would be only fair to say that they were ordered for the North-South railway.,47
217,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not going to discuss that question now. In any case, they were not ordered by Mr Bell as excess engines which he thought he would require.",47
218,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Was Mr Bell Commissioner then ?,47
219,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes .,47
220,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then , how do you know that he did not order the engines?",47
221,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have seen the files, and have ascertained when and how they were ordered.",47
222,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I rise to a point of order. Are the Minister's remarks relevant in a second-reading speech on the Bill?,47
223,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Rt. Hon. W. A. W at t - The honourable member's point of order is scarcely a good one, in view of the fact that several honourable members have been permitted to discourse on the relative costs of the East-West railway in contrasting the contract and day-labour methods of construction.",47
224,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not get such latitude.,47
225,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member had reasonable latitude, and the M in ister must have the same, and no more.",47
226,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I ask for no more, but I shall not unduly labour the point. I should like to quote an extract from a speech made by Mr A . W . Robinson, M . L . A . , of South Australia, in moving the adoption of the eighth general report of the Railway Standing Committee in the House of Assembly, Adelaide, i u 1920. Referring to construction costs of the East-West line, he saidThe actual cost to June, 1919, was £0,045,017, or £5,750 per mile. It is said to be a sliameful waste of public expenditure, because the estimate was exceeded by £2,300 per mile. It might be just as well to complain the line was too cheaply constructed because, in 1913, the South Australian Railway Department estimated that a practically similar line, with the same ruling grade, between Salisbury and Port Augusta, would eost £7,833 per mile. I quote these extracts in order to show that the Commissioner, who will have charge of the construction of this line if the Bill passes, is not, as suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield, in competent, but is a man who can safely be trusted with such an undertaking. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner has had a long and honourable service. He was for twenty-eight years in the service of Queensland, and has been for nine years in the service of the Commonwealth. Hehas rendered loyal and f a it h f u l service. The honourable member for Wakefield suggested that he intended to get r i d of this officer because of his incompetence. I wish to say that I do not concur in the opinion which the honourable member expressed. I do not regard the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner as an incompetent officer. Only today he has been appointed for a further term of two years, which will bring him up to the age l i m it for retirement-sixty-fiv e years. That should in dicate my opinion of him, and during the next two years I can leave it to members ) . of this House and the public to decide whether the honourable member for Wakefield or myself is the better judge of a competent railway engineer. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) suggested the use of ironwood sleepers, and we will go carefully into the points he has raised.",47
227,Mr GBEOOBY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What sleepers are proposed, according to the estimate of the cost of t h » line? I understood that as many wooden sleepers were destroyed by white ants, it was proposed to use concrete or steel sleepers.",47
228,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The present intention is to use steel sleepers, but in view of the remarks which have been made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, if the Commissioner finds on investigation that there is some substitute for steel sleepers which would give as good or better results, we will not tie ourselves down to their use. There have been many complaints by honourable members coming from South Australia. They have complained that for years and years not a solitary thing has been done towards the construction of the NorthSouth line. That is perfectly true, but the present Government is not responsible for the inactivity of previous Governments. A f t e r six months of office it has submitted this Bill to the House, and a concrete proposal for the expenditure of over £1,500,000 on the North-South line. It is strange that honourable members should complain of the inactivity of the Government when it is the only Government that has so far shown any desire to be active in the construction of the line.",47
229,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Buf c the present vernment is active in the wrong direction.,48
230,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Le t me say that the construction of the southern section of the line is not lost sight of by the Government. It is under consideration, and in order that We may be fully apprised of the conditions under which its construction must be proceeded with, I intend, as I said before, to go over the route of this section, look at the country for myself, and report upon it to the Cabinet. It has been suggested that some members of the Public Works Committee have not the necessary experience fco enable them to give a valuable opinion aa to the pastoral and other possibilities of the country through which the extension proposed by this Bill will pass. Perhaps, without trumpet-blowing, I may be permitted fco say that I have had some experience of new pastoral country aud practical experience of agriculture. I know as well as most honourable members, and better than some, what are the potentialities of new and undeveloped country. I have great faith in the inland districts of Australia. The history of settlement in this country is that the pioneers who took up the out-back portions were regarded as optimistic lunatics. In the early days in Victoria when pioneers went out-back to Donald, Birchip, and Rainbow, in the lower Mallee, they were regarded as fools who had gone beyond the safety lino. But a few years later men moved out to Woomelang and to Ouyen, also to Carwarp and the Yatpool country, where I selected land. pessimists asked us, "" Do you ever expect to grow wheat in that country ?"" and when we put in our seed in 1914, and there was a drought, aud we grew no wheat, they said, ""We told you so."" We replied that although we grew no wheat, settlers 150 miles further south grew none in that season. To-day Carwarp aud Yatpool aro sound agricultural settlements, though less than ten years ago the land was used only for the raising of a few sheep. I believe that the history of the Mallee will be the history of other outback country in Australia, and that land that is today regarded as beyond :he pale and useless, will by future generations be regarded as sound pastoral country, if not also as sound agricultural country. That is my opinion, and I Gothink I can say that the other members of the Government hold the same view. We haye great faith in the outback country, and so far as our financial position will permit, we will do all that we can to open up the back portions of Australia. This Bill represents a first instalment of work in that direction, and as the motion has been fully debated, I ask honourable members to give the Bill the quick passage its merits deserve. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3The Commissioner may, subject to this Act, and to the Commonwealth Bailways Act 1917, extend the railway in the Northern Territory by the - construction of a railway from the southern terminus of the railway in the Northern Territory to Daly Waters.",48
231,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Swan) [8.20] - This clause gives power to the Government to extend the Northern Territory railway to Daly Waters. I do not suppose there is one member of the Committee who would vote for the extension of the line to Daly Waters unless he knew that the Government had a distinct intention to carry it further. I was unfortunately ill when the report of the Public Works Committee was being considered, and I , though Chairman of the Committee, had no association with it. But it shows that this extension will carry the Northern' Territory line into very poor country. The recommendation of the Committee The in favour of it is based on the presumption that further action will be taken by the Government, and I think that the Minister for Works and Bailways (Mr. Stewart) should take honourable members into his confidence, and tell us what the Government intend to do after the line is constructed to Daly Waters. He should say whether it is intended to continue the line directly south or divert it towards Camooweal. The Public Works Committee ihas recommended 'that the line should be diverted towards Camooweal, but we should know the intention of the Government, if it has come to a decision on the point. I think that we should consider first of all the development of the Northern Territory. I would vote at once for the construction of a line from Oodnadatta northwards as far as the Macdonnell' Eanges, withi the object of connecting with the good country to the norcth of Oro&nadatta. Something be: done to make the lot of people in that central area better than it is.. I. do not think that suck a railway wonldi pay, but it would help todevelop; the interior, and I would! willingly, vote for its construction. Reports; recently received show that thesre isi a very lasge area of good coimatjiy in the Macdonnell Ranges,, but there is a big intervening asrea of poor, country. do not know whether honourable have read the voluminous evidence . that has been collected in connection with this matter. I acknowledge the promise made to the South Australian Government for lie construction of the Worth-South way, but the object of this Parliament at the present time should, be todevelop* the Northern. Territory, and give tha people who, we hope-, will go' there, somechance to make a success, of the in work. Clarke,. Mr Combes, ' and Mr. say were appointed a Commission tor make an examination of the northern part of the Northern Territory,, hut they were recaJled' after about seven months, and before they could nearly completeithe work whichthey had undertaken. Their report,, so far as it goes, is an admirable one, and T think the Government would be well advised if they appointed another Commission of three persons outside of Parliament, one of whom should be an engineer, to make a thorough examination of the north,, even though they should occupy twelve months ih doing so; in order that this should ' be provided' with accurate infor1 mation onthc possibilities of the country.. We have had' recently from Admiral Clarkeson upon the Pellew Isla-nds:, and there might yet. be arequest 1 for a railway from the Northern tory line to the coast near there-. a Commission as I have suggested should enable this Parliament and the people to discover what can best be done for the development of theNorthern The sooner we realise that we can in no circumstancesretain' control' of the Northern Temitory unless wepeoplei and developit-,, the better..

I would not vote for-a penny of this expenditure if I thoughttheGovernment would not continue the line in a south-easterly direction. The 1'ong section of the line will not be able to pay fbr axlegrease, unless it isconnected with existing railways by beingtaken either right through to South Australia or to OamooweaF. It is I for the House to say whether the railway members should be taken right throughor ro Camooweal. I do not expressany opinion on that point. I object to the allegation of bias. I do not believe that members of the Public. Works Committeewere rail- actuated by bias in preparing their reports. Even Senator Newland, who is a representative of South Australia-, in dorsed some of the Committee's decisions. 1 It would be much better if we could' get Mr. outside gentlemen, with a knowledge of Lindfche Northern Territory, to advise us what to. do to develop it .",48
232,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hindmarsh) [8.32] I endorse the contention of the. honoj-able member for Swan ((Mr Gregory), that / when railway matters are under consideration, andi the interests of variousStates are concerned, the opinionsof expert authorities, should be securedl.. If t for no completely, other reason,. I would say that beeausei of the interjection made by the. honourable member foe Bass. (Mr Jackson.) when the honourable member for Marihyrnong (Mr .

He has travelled through the Territory and over the route, which is being considered. He. expressed very definite, opinionsregarding the claims of the people in the southern pant of the Territory.

233,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Member s of the Committee desired me to take the trip through the Territory in place, of one of the other members. That, action does not indicate State bias.",50

237,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did the honourable member hear them?,50
238,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I did not; but. I asked the honourable member privately whether be had said that only two members of the Public Works Committee were unbiased? He modestly included himself, and said the other unbiased member was. the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews),. I . think it is . characteristic of the honourable member for Bass that he should, push his, own barrow in that way. I draw the. attention t f honourable members to. the fact that the motion complained of had nothing to do with the reference submitted for inquiry. The Minutes of Proceedings stateSenator Foil movedTliat the Committee place on record its, opinion that the construction of the section Mataranka to BaJ'y Waters, will',, of. itself, contribute very little towards the early development of the Northern Territory, and that the - recommendation for its construction isonly agreed toas being a section of an eventual line across the Barkly 1 Tableland, to C;i moo weal, vUL Newcastle Waters. That, motion, waa seconded b,y me, and the Committee divided as follows,:Ayes, five; consisting of .Senator Foil, Senator Newland, Senator Plain,, Mr. Jackson,, and myself. Noes, one;. Mr ' Mathews. It will be seen that the. name of a. representative from South' Australia (Senator Newland), appears in the divi- ' siosn,, and, although the honourable member for Bass says that only two\ members of the PubKc Works Committee are unbiased, he himself supported the resolution complained of. I protest against the attack made, upon members of the, Com-' mittee, some of whom are members of another place, and particularly against the innuendo that the Queensland members of the Committee used their position to 1 influence the report against the interests of South Australia. Any one who reads the report, will come to. thei conclusion that the Committee based its resolutions upon the evidence submitted. Mr MARTIN.;-The honourable member knows that, theCommitteewent outside the references to it.",50
239,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not know anything of the kind. The resolutions deal with the reference, aud with the reference only. Some extracts from the minutes on which the resolutions were based have been quoted for a purpose, but nob io unduly influence Parliament. I submit that the Committee has merely endeavoured to do its duty.",51
240,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wakefield) [8.43] This afternoon, I made certain statements as a matter of public duty. They gave me, not pleasure, but pain. I intend to speak as plainly again to-night in reply to the Minister (Mr Stewart). Every word he has said has been said several times ibefore, and is in print. All his arguments have been replied to. He has not replied to a single vital objection raised by .South Australian members.",51
241,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY, The honourable member is not in order on this clause in replying to a speech made on the motion for the second reading.,51
242,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then I shall take another course. The clause relates to "" Power' to construct the railway,"" and I shall deal with the men who will be intrusted with that work. I ask for your ruling, sir, whether the clause giving authority to construct does not provide the Committee with an ""opportunity of discussing the capacity of the officials who arc to have charge of construction.",51
243,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Clause 7 provides for the appointment of officers.,51
244,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thos e are officers to be appointed by the official in charge of construction. Upon the clause now. before the Committee, I can appropriately repeat in the public interests the statement. I made this afternoon, that the Government are proposing to allow this work to be constructed by officials whose past services prove them to be unequal to the big responsibility involved in future undertakings. I reiterate with emphasis every word I uttered this afternoon in that regard. Not one charge that I made has been refuted by the Minister. I know that the rolling-stock is all right, but the man who designed the coaches could not continue longer under the control and direction of the present Railway Commissioner, and he left the Commonwealth Service to take another appointment at double his former salary. I could continue for hours mentioning the names of most efficient men who found it impossible to remain under the control of the Commissioner.",51
245,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Was it because of the Commissioner, or the double salary, that the oflicer to whom the honourable member has referred left the Commonwealth Service?",51
246,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because of the Commissioner. The Minister has a great deal to learn in regard to this matter. I do not blame him, but I do blame the senior members of the Ministry, especially the Attorney-General (Mr Groom), and Senator Pearce, who have knowledge of a waste of public funds to an extent unprecedented in the history of this country. I feel bound to say this. Are not business methods to be employed in connection with public works'f Are we all incapable? I charge those honourable gentlemen who were Ministers at the time that these great losses occurred with incapacity similar to that of the officials. The taxpayers of this country will suffer the loss of millions of pounds if the methods of the past are continued. It seems a tragedy that our memories of the awful losses of public moneys are not more vivid. The Minister of Works and Railways referred to the cost of construcing the East-West railway.",51
247,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is not the railway to which this Bill relates.,51
248,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not desire the same losses to be incurred in connection with the construction of the North-South railway. The East-West line presented no engineering difficulties; it was one of the easiest constructional projects in any part of the world, and one section runs in a straight line for over 350 miles on a level plain. The Minister compared that surface line with the Long Plains railway which, although traversing fairly level country, was one of the heaviest and best roads ever undertaken in Australia. If such a ridiculous and outrageous comparison was inspired by the Commissioner, it proves the calibre of man he is. We know of structures that were erected at enormous costs, and then pulled down. I could continue for two hours enumerating similar mistakes, every one of which has been recorded in Hansard, and has been criticised by every metropolitan newspaper in Australia. These things are forgotten by the gentlemen who today have the handling of the public purse, and advance such trashy replies to the charges made against them. The Attorney-General was a member of the Ministry when the then Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) sent a wireless message to Mr Johnson asking him to return to Australia, and take over the completion of the East-West railway, because the Commonwealth was in such desperate straits. In regard to the Teesdale Smith tenders, I told Sir Joseph Cook that I could get him a tender for half the amount that the line was costing by day labour. Three or four contractors had put their heads together, and the Government did not realise the fact. After £2,000,000 had been spent on the railway I introduced Mr Joseph Timms to the Prime Minister in 1913, and he offered to complete the railway for another £2,000,000. The Government submitted the offer to the engineer, who afterwards became Commis* sioner, and he stated that he could build the line as cheaply as could a contractor, and he recommended that he be allowed to complete the job by day labour. Let the Attorney-General deny that statement.",51
249,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Quote Smith and public official. Timms' tender for earthworks, which was 2s. per yard higher than the cost by labour.",52
250,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I told Sir Joseph Cook that if he would advertise tenders he would receive an offer to plete at 50 per cent, below the unsatisject factory tender. Mr Timms offered put down a very big deposit for the pletion of the line. His intention that two or three big contractors should co-operate and build the railway rapidly. There was enough capital behind group of contractors to carry the scheme through. They would have had the responsibility of finding rolling-stock, the Commonwealth would not have had on its hands nearly £1,000,000 worth rolling-stock, which is Jying along - line today, and cannot be sold. There is hardly a locomotive on the railway of the right type for drawing an express train. These are solid facts, and the opinion I am expressing is shared by the best railway men in Australia. The construction of the East-West railway made day labour stink in the nostrils of the people, and drove more nails into its coffin than has any other work carried out by the Government. I repeat every word I said about the incapacity and inefficiency of the officials who built that railway. I am only echoing the opinion of leading railway men. Mr GROOM.;-The honourable member has no authority to say that.",52
251,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I ""have; and I charge the Attorney-General with having been as much responsible for that disastrous business as was anybody else. I ask the people of the Commonwealth to decide whether that sort of thing is to continue. The Minister for Works and Railways has explained that the decision whether day labour or contract shall be employed will - not rest . with the Government; authority to do as he pleases is to be given to a man who has shown that he has no organizing capacity, who does not know how to handle men, and amongst whose employees there is seething discontent.",52
252,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member must see that under cover of this Bill for the construction of a railway he is attacking :i,52
253,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Are ' we not making day a decision regarding the expenditure of public funds ? Do we not represent the taxpayers ? I ask the present Government whether they have abandoned the policy for of the previous Government, which was comcontract labour wherever possible, subto check by departmental estimate. to My voice will be lifted again and again comin protest against wasteful expenditure. was What is to become of the people of the Commonwealth if their money is to be expended by people who have committed the such blunders in the past?",52
254,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Darling Downs-Attor and ney-General) [9.0] - I had no desire to take part in this debate, but in view of of the statements made by the honourable the member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), in which he has seen fit to make an attack upon a public officer who is not here to defend himself, I shall give the House my experience of that officer,.",52
255,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You have said this before.,53
256,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot recall that I have ever publicly in this House said anything about the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner (Mr B e l l ) . honourable member, for reasons best known to himself, has adopted an attitude of strong personal hostility to Mr . Bell.",53
257,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is not a word of truth in that. I tell you that to your face.,53
258,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then the honourable member has taken this attitude for no reason at all. Either he has reasons or he has no reasons. I have investigated some of the statements he has made tonight, and I tell honourable members that there is no foundation in fact for them. The honourable member for Wakefield has accused me of some responsibility for expenditure in respect to the construction of this railway. I had nothing whatever to do with that expenditure. I was not in the Government at the time when most of the money was expended.",53
259,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You were in the Cook Government.,53
260,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was in the Cook Government, but I had nothing to do with this railway at the time. The honourable member knows that. To some of the statements made by the honourable member to-night there is a direct and complete answer. I shall tell the House my perience with this railway. As Minister, I came into touch with it from 1918 to 1921. A f t e r that the member took control of it from me. While I had control of the Commonwealth Railways I was brought into association with the Commissioner of Railways, Mr Bell. I could not have had a more conService. scientious, capable, and efficient officer of staff than I had during the whole period.",53
261,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You knew nothing about virtues of the Scotch. the business; you are a lawyer.,53
262,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I admit I am a lawyer. Perhaps the honourable member has folmade. lowed some calling which has fitted to be a better judge than I am. I am telling the House, without bias, what my Australia. experience was. Before Mr Bell was engaged by the Commonwealth Government he had had years of experience in men in Australia. Queensland, and I understand that every Minister who has. had anything to do with him in Queensland has regarded b im as a most capable, just, aud efficient officer.",53
263,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He is still serving Queensland. The Mr GROOM - He was in charge of constructional work there, and the work that was carried out during his term of office with the Queensland Government stands today as evidence of his capacity and efficiency.",53
264,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You are talking childish stuff.,53
265,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The . honourable member has taken advantage of his position in this House to attack a man's reputation, and because I am telling the truth he has lost his temper.",53
266,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Perhaps you wil l allow me to state that I have ,a right and a public duty to say that a man is inefficient.",53
267,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member has a perfect right to express any opinion he likes, but when he exercises that right to make statements such as he has made to-night, I cannot permit them to remain uncontradicted, because they cast a reflection upon the credit of one of Aus- * tralia's best public servants. I refuse to sit here and allow a man to be attacked behind his back.",53
268,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Rubbish !,53
269,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member may consider it to be rubbish, but I do exnot. I think my duty is to stand by a man who has served me, as Minister, well.",53
270,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who has the duty to honourable stand up for the country ?,53
271,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,My experience of Mr . Bell is that he is one of the most careful . and economical officers we have in our,53
272,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He is Scotch; that is the of that best thing about him.,53

274,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I di d not say that. I said I had behind me the leading railway,53
275,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable'member was not justified in saying that. I have had opportunities to gauge the opinion of the leading railway men of Australia on this subject. I know that one of the highest railway authorities who has ever visited the Commonwealth expressed the opinion that Mr Bell is one of the greatest railway experts we have. The honourable member knows to whose opinion I refer.,54
276,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that the leading railway men in Australia do not take the figures that man gave, nor do they agree with him.",54
277,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is most unfortunate that the honourable member should have taken advantage of hiB place in this Chamber to make an attack on a public servant. I make no apology for my intervention on behalf of Mr Bell, because, in my experience, he is one of the best public .servants Australia has ever had.",54
278,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"On a personal explanation, I ask you, Mr Watkins, whether the Attorney-General is justified in saying that I have made an attack on a public oflicer when, conscientiously, and according to my view of my duty, which I took an oath to perform when I came into this Parliament, I have only tried to show the Committee that certain officers are incompetent and inefficient, and yet are in trusted with the expenditure - pf millions of money.",54
279,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY, The honourable member is only continuing his attack. He is not making a personal explanation.,54
280,Mr FOSTEE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have not made an attack on any individual. I have only done my duty in saying that this man is in efficient.,54
281,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [ 9 . 8 ] - I have every sympathy with the Minister in the position in which he has found himself. It is not a new experience for Ministers in this House. I recollect that a former Minister who was deposed indulged in the same kind of talk. I refeT to Mr . K in g O'Malley. We are becoming accustomed to these attempts to shift responsibility. I trust that the Minister's successor will not be subjected to this treatment. In justification of Mr Bell, it may be said that Australia has one of the best railways in the world in the EastWest liue, and it was constructed under day labour in the middle of the war. ' I take up the debate from the point where it was left by the honourable » member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k in ) , though I do not propose to say whether the Public Works Committee has been impartial or partial. I shall let the Committee's actions speak for them-, selves. I refer to, its report. Senator Foil movedThat as the agreement attached to the Northern Territory Acceptance Act No. 20 of / 1910, has already been amended to meet cireumstances which have altered since its ratification, the Committee place on record its opinion that arrangements be made with South Australia which would further amend the agreement and permit of the construction of a railway which future development will show to be in the best interests of Australia. I ask the Committee what it meant by that motion, which was carried 1 W h at right had the Committee to attempt to interfere with the compact made between the Commonwealth Of Australia and the State of South Australia? Clearly, and distinctly the Committee exceeded its authority in making the proposal contained in that motion, which is completely condemnatory of the Committee, and shows the attitude it has adopted. I find that the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jackson) voted for that motion.. Will he tell us by interjection the reasons that impelled him to do so?",54
282,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I will not ; but I will make a few remarks upon it later.,54
283,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hope that the honourable member will not deal cursorily with it , but that he will go full y into the question. The Public Works Committee unquestionably exceeded the ambit of the references to it in giving expression to the views contained in that motion. It has made a distinct side step. That is not the only paragraph in the report which shows the attitude of the Committee. The report is one of the most inept productions that we have ever had from a Committee which was appointed to deal with a big public work. It has recommended a line that will lead nowhere and which, it admits, will contribute very little towards the early development of the Territory. Is this all we are to expect from a Committee which collects public fees and peregrinates all through Australia ? Another resolution of the Committee which carries condemnation with it readsThat the Committee place on record its opinion that the construction of the section Mataranka to Daly Waters will of itself contribute very Httle towards the early development of the Northern Territory, and that the recommendation for its construction is only agreed to as being a section of an eventual line to cross the Barkly Tableland to Camooweal, vid Newcastle Waters. The Committee has placed on record for ""all time that it agrees to the construction .of a railway which will not contribute to the development of the Territory. Had the Committee done what it really wished to do it would have recommended, straight out, that a line should be constructed to Camooweal' v id Newcastle Waters. Honourable members will see that that statement is justifiable if they look at the map which is attached to the report. Why is that map attached to the report? It contains on it dotted lines which represent railways that theCommittee suggest shall be constructed. One of those lines is from Daly Waters to Anthony Lagoon and then on towards Pellew Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria.",54
284,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," The honourable member is getting wide of the question, and quoting the Public Works Committee's report on other lines.",55
285,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Before we consent to the construct]on of this line we should find out whether another route might not be preferable. The question is whether (we shall consent to a line from Mataranka to Daly Waters.,55
286,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," The honourable member's remarks would be quite in order on the second reading, but the House by passing the'second reading has agreed to construct this particular portion of the line. The honourable member must not at this stage discuss the Bill as a whole, particularly the report of the Public Works Committee regarding other proposals.",55
287,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can hardly see that I am out of order when other honourable members, including the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) ancl the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k i u ) have been allowed to discuss alternative recommendations of the Public Works Committee. I am now suggesting reasons why we should not agree to the clause, and pointing out that the Public Works Committee has recommended or suggested alternative routes. My contention is that the best route for the line' would be to another terminus.",55
288,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY, The House has already affirmed the proposal for constructing the line between the two points named in the Bill .,55
289,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then it would appear that honourable members have no power fco amend this clause; because, on the second reading, the House affirmed the proposal for building a railway from Mataranka to Daly Waters. I was under the impression that it was the right of every honourable member to move an amendment to any clause, even if that amendment had the effect of altering the whole Bill . As I say, the Public Works Committee suggested alternative routes, even one into the territory of Western Australia. If we cannot act on the recommendations of the Public Works Committee, I should like to know why that Committee went beyond its ambit in this manner in order to suggest a policy to the Government. However, I can only say that if the route laid - down in the Bill is approved South Australia will be penalized, and the agreement with the Commonwealth flouted.",55
290,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bass) [9.21] - It seems that something I said, this afternoon, has created a little consternation amongst my Queensland fellow members of the Public Works Committee. As soon as this fact was brought under my notice I gave an assurance that when my Hansard proofs reached me tomorrow I would see exactly the words I had used, and, if necessary, would withdraw any objected to. When I made use of the word ""unbiased,"" I may have been a little unfortunate in my choice of a word. Perhaps I can more clearly express myself by saying that the members. I spoke of were the only ""disinterested"" members.",55
291,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is worse !,55
292,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think so. The Tasmanian and Victorian members of the Committee can hope to gain nothing for their States whether the line goes into Queensland or into South Australia, and that was what I desired to convey to honourable members this afternoon. I do not impute any improper motive whatever to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Macleay), or the other Queensland members of the Public Works Committee. As members of that Committee, we have to draw our conclusions on the evidence given. A f t e r travelling through the Territory, I was moved to vote in the same way as the honourable member for Lilley voted. Let me say, in reply to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) that T came to that conclusion because of the fact that, when the line has reached Daly Waters, or a little further south, it would be far better to cross the Barkly Tablelands, where there is the finest pastoral country in Australia, than it would be to make the 400-mile stretch south to the Macdonnell Ranges. That was the reason I voted for the swing into Queensland, and also for the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs ",55
293,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Senato r Newland supported the same motion.,56
294,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Exactly ; the three members of the Committee who went to the Territory voted in the same way, and I think honourable members would do well to accept their report - I wish",56
295,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What right had you to suggest Camooweal ?,56
296,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Because Camooweal is on the border of Queensland.,56
297,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Ye t you denounced that State this afternoon.,56
298,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I did not. This afternoon I spoke rather feelingly about the poor country in certain parts of western Queensland; I did not refer to Camooweal, but distinctly referred to the country south of Boulia. I shall not vote for any proposal that the Commonwealth construct a railway in western Queensland. The Queensland Government has given an undertaking that if the Commonwealth construct a line to Camooweal, it will link up the Queensland railway system.",56
299,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," The honourable member having made a general reference, had better now confine himself to the clause.",56
300,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has said that the Public Works Committee went outside the ambit of its reference in the recommendations that it made. one who objects very strongly to the people of today tying down the people of tomorrow. We of today are suffering from promises made twenty years ago, and amongst these is that for the building of Canberra. I will not be a party to committing the House or the country to an expenditure of anything from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000 on a line north to south, or a line south to north, when a line to Alice Springs, and a continuation of the northern line to Daly Waters or Newcastle Waters, will do all that is necessary in the way of railway development for the next twenty or t h i r t y years. Will the Minister (Mr . Stewart) assure us that it is the intention of the Government to continue the line from Daly Waters to Newcastle Waters, or even Banka-banka Station, as a portion of their future policy ? If so, I am prepared to vote for the clause at once.",56

Minister (Mr Stewart) could give us an idea of the cost of taking the necessary railway materials around the coast to Darwin, and then by train, compared with the cost of sending them from Adelaide or Port Augusta on the already constructed line. In my opinion the latter course would be by far the preferable for the carriage of not only material, but also necessary labour. The Minister has not yet informed us, so far as I know, that he is assured of a full supply of labour for the line contemplated by the Bill . Adelaide, Melbourne, and even Sydney, are centres for the supply of the necessary men; and in view of the prevailing unemployment, I suggest that the Government take the course that will result in the readiest transport. Would any honourable member who had the choice prefer to undertake the construction of a railway from the Port Darwyi end to the construction of a line of similar length from the Adelaide end ?",56

309,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member suggest that this extension of 160 miles should be built on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge?,58
310,Mr MAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"T suggest that not only this extension of 160 miles should be constructed on that gauge, but that the existing Northern Territory line should be converted to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. claim that that is a sensible suggestion. My great complaint in respect of many public undertakings in the Commonwealth is that those responsible for them contented themselves with meeting existing conditions, and did not look forward to the demands which would arise in years to come. Before honourable members agree to the construction of another 160 miles of the Northern Territory railway on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge they should realise what it will cost to convert it to the standard gauge of 4 f t . 8% in., and also ithe existing railway from Darwin to Mataranka to the same gauge.",58
311,Mr MANNING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Macquarie) [9.40] I have not taien part so far in the discussion of this matter, but I have listened with interest to what has been said. One thing that has been rankling in my mind since I read this Bill is this clause proposing the construction of the line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. In view of the gauge of the existing Northern Territory railway, it does mot seem to me to be a practical proposal to suggest, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh ,(Mr is an optimist. Makin) has done, - that this extension sliould the constructed on the 4-f.t. .8-J-in. gauge. I move'That the following words be added to clause:- "" but the sleepers shall be of cient length to enable the gauge to be widened to 4 f t. 8£ in. when required.""",58
312,Mr MAXWELIL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is that not contemit. plated by the Government ?,58
313,Mr MANNING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I understand that it is the intention of the Government build the bridges of sufficient width carry a 4-ft. S\-'m. line, but the sleepers, which are to he steel sleepers, are not be of 'sufficient length for this purpose, because of the comparatively small addimittee tional cost which would be involved. Minister said that the additional cost would amount to £1,000 per mile, but comparison to the total cost of the that would represent but a small realise amount. We are proposing to spend over £1,500,000 in building 160 mile3 of railway, and by not having the sleepers of sufficient length for a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge we shall be perpetuating the evil and inconvenience which has cost this country untold nrllions up to the present time. I was much struck by the picture which I the Minister painted of what might happen in this part of Australia in the light of what has happened in other parts of the Commonwealth. How a man holding such views as he has expressed can recommend the extension of this line with sleepers capable of carrying only a 3-ft. 6-in. line I cannot understand. I have it on good authority that steel sleepers would probablylast forty or fifty years. Who can say what will happen in this country long before that time has elapsed? Very little more than fifty years ago, in my father's home, some wise people said that uniform railway gauges in New South Wales and Victoria were desirable, whilst others said that the railways would never meet in their lifetime. Yet before fifteen years elapsed the New South Wales and Victorian railways met on the northern bank of the Murray. The .same thing will occur aga'.n. This country is not going to .stand still. I venture to think that we are in for an era of advancement and prosperity in this country never previously equalled siwee ithe days of the gold diggings. Mr .JACKSON - The honourable member",58
314,Mr MANNING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have lived my life in the inland districts, and, like the Minister for Works and Ba lways, I am : the an optimist. I know land which fourteen suffiyears ago was considered to be outside the safe wheat-growing area. It was said that a man was mad to go into I did not hold that opinion,*and I went into it. I saw the class of country, noted the rainfall, and turned down the to advice given by Government statisticians to and officials. That was only fourteen years ago, and now that district is recogto nised as .one of the safest wheat-growing areas in New South Wales. The 'Comwill make a blunder if it allows The the clause to pass without making provision for sleepers long enough to carry in a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line. I trust the line Minister will accept the amendment. I that a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line is all Nortliern Territory [REPRESENTATIVES.] thab can be justified at the present and that for many years to come such line will be sufficient. It is proposed provide bridges of a width sufficient to carry a 4 - f t. 8^-in. gauge line, and sleepers of adequate length would entail only a small additional expenditure, and would save an enormous sum of money 4-'ffc. when the day comes-as surely it w i l when it is necessary to convert to a 4-ft. Sit-in. gauge. The longer the day of version is put off the heavier will be expense. Do not let us perpetuate i Northern Territory the blunder that has proved so expensive in the south of Australia. ' Mr OKEEFE (Denison) [ 9 . 4 8 ] - I suppose that one who does not belong to South Australia, Queensland, or Western way. Australia, and has not lived in the Northern Territory, may still have the temerity to venture into the debate. though I have not taken any part in the discussion, I have listened very earnestly to the speeches that have been made by honourable members who have been over the route of the proposed line. I have also been interested in the explanation 8^-in. gauge line. given of the potentialities of the Northern Territory by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), I have noted the little pleasantries tween several honourable members on the not require alteration. Government side, who differ among themhand, selves as to the route the line should low. The question is whether preparation shall be made now for enlarging the gauge in the future to 4 f t . 8£ inches. I would prefer to see the line taken due south, as was arranged in the agreement with South Australia. I have never believed that the money to be spent on this line, to the wider gauge, but that is not likely whatever route it follows, would be wasted. The line will not pay for years, but we should not look at this class of railway from the point of view of pounds, shillings, and pence. We should ask ourselves not whether the line will pay in the immediate or distant future, but whether its construction is wise i interests of the country. Not very f ar from the proposed line there are, I underyet stand, great possibilities for development. It is stipulated in the clause that gauge shall be 3 f t . 6 inches, but reference is made to the necessity for adopted? making provision for a wider gauge in the future. The Minister is aware that when the line from Port Darwin to Pino Railway Extension Bill. time, Creek was extended to the Katherine a River the original 3-ft. 6-in. gauge was to adhered to, but bridges were buil t and sleepers were used which were suitable for a 4 - f t. 8|-in. gauge line. It is remarkable that every provision should be made up to a certain point for conversion, to a 8 i - in. gauge, but that beyond that l - point provision is not made in regard to sleepers. It will be a patch-work job. I conam informed by those who ought to know the that to use the longer sleepers would n the entail very little extra expense.",58
315,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would cost about £160,000 more, or approximately £1,000 per mile. Mr O ' KEEFE - I do not think £1,000 per mile would be ill-spent in that",59
316,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Rsfilways) [9.581- I hope A l - the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) will not press the amendment. Tho estimate provides for bridges and culverts-includin g the large bridge over the Katherine River, which will cost £95,000-capabl e of carrying a 4-ft. The reason that sleepers suitable for a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge line were not included in the estimate was and because the cost of conversion will not bebe great if the bridges and culverts do On the other the initial cost of providing the follonger sleepers would be approximately £160,000. The House has already passed an appropriation for £1,545,000, which will provide for bridges and culverts large enough, and strong enough, to carry a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line. It is quite true that the line may be converted some time % to happen in the near future. I ask the many honourable member towithdraw the amendment, because his wishes have been met in every respect except the length of the sleepers. The Government has made reasonable provision for the future conversion of the line. I ask the Committee n the to agree to the clause as it stands.",59
317,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bass) [ 1 0 . 0 ] - I have to be convinced that the 3-ft.. 6-in. gauge is not suitable for Australian r a i lthe ways. What would have happened in no Queensland if that gauge had not been The people could not have borne the burden of building railways on the 4-ft. 8^-in. or 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and they would have had to he content with a much shorter mileage of ruilways than they have today. 'i'he South African and Tasmanian railways are of 3-ft. C-in. gauge, whilst the railways in Java are of metre gauge, which is less than 3 f t . 4 in. Nevertheless, the Javan railways, are so well built that the Sectional' Committee of the Public Works Committee travelled in trains at an average of 33 miles per hour, including stoppages, and I understand on reliable authority that they run up to 42 miles per hour, notwithstanding that the carriages are 10 f t . 6 in. wide, inside measurement, which is greater than the width of the carriages on the 5 f t . 3 in. railways of Vietoria. I support the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge.",59
318,Mr MANNING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Macquarie) [10.2]. - I am loath to withdraw the amendment, because it does seem ill-advised to incur a very large expenditure in making provision for the conversion of the waterways without making similar provision in regard to other portions of the. track. However, as there seems no prospect of the amendment being agreed to, I ask leave to withdraw it. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to.
