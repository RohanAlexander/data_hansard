0,NA,Unknown,"Thursday, 26 May 2011 The SPEAKER (Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 09:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA The SPEAKER (09:01): I remind members that when they come into the chamber they should ensure their phones are set so that they will not disturb proceedings. This is one of the small gestures members could make to remind themselves that they are entering into the chamber of the House of Representatives. NA The SPEAKER (09:02): On Monday the member for Dickson raised as a matter of privilege whether the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing had deliberately misled the House in responding to a question from the member for Banks on 12 May 2011. The member for Dickson provided the Hansard of the minister's remarks and an extract from the budget related paper 'Delivering better hospitals, mental health and health services'. The member for Dickson submitted that the minister's statements that the two biggest injections of new money in the mental health package are in years one and two and that the new money in year five is just $50 million or about two per cent of the total package are contradicted by the budget's figures. Deliberately misleading the House is one of the matters that can be found to be a contempt. While claims that members have deliberately misled the House have been raised as matters of privilege or contempt, no such matter has yet been referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. To establish that contempt has been committed it would need to be established that: (1) a statement had in fact been misleading; (2) the member knew at the time the statement was incorrect; and (3) the misleading had been deliberate. In addition, to amount to contempt, the action would need to amount to, or be intended or likely to amount to, an improper interference with the free exercise by the House of its functions. I have examined the Hansard records on this exchange and the document presented by the honourable member for Dickson. The minister's answer can be regarded as debating contentions that have been made by the opposition about funding of mental health. While I note that this is by way of unnecessarily debating an answer, it is nevertheless a matter of a debating point, a dispute about the interpretation of data. I appreciate that there are different ways in which figures can be interpreted and used. Like Speakers before me, I believe that such differences as these are probably best pursued as debating issues using the various forms of the House available to members. For these reasons, on the evidence available to me, it is not clear that a prima facie case has been made such as would cause me to give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. NA Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Amendment (Registration of Foreign Proceeds of Crime Orders) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (09:05): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Organised crime affects all Australians. The Australian Crime Commission estimates that between $10-$15 billion dollars every year is lost as a result of organised crime. This is money that is being siphoned from legitimate Australian businesses; it is money that cannot be spent on education, health or any number of services. And in this way, organised crime steals from every Australian citizen every day. In an age where borders are increasingly permeable, effective and international crime cooperation increasingly important. The growing use of sophisticated technology by organised criminal groups means assets derived from criminal activities are often moved offshore to avoid detection and confiscation by local authorities. Organised criminals are motivated by greed-money is their lifeblood. If we can stop the money flow we can stop organised criminals in their tracks. The Gillard government has made combating organised crime a priority, and being able to confiscate assets and profits which are a result of crimes committed overseas is a key plank in this strategy. Legislative framework Australia has a strong framework for cooperating with foreign countries and restraining and confiscating benefits derived from foreign criminal offences where those assets are located in Australia. Part VI of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Mutual Assistance Act) enables an Australian court to register and enforce orders issued by a foreign court. These foreign orders include restraining, confiscation and pecuniary penalty orders over property derived from serious criminal offences. Once a foreign order is registered in Australia, it is able to be enforced as though it were an Australian order made under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Provisions in the International Criminal Court Act 2002 and the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995 expand upon the regime in the Mutual Assistance Act and allow an Australian court to register and enforce forfeiture orders issued by the International Criminal Court and specified international war crimes tribunals. efficient A recent High Court decision regarding is New South Wales proceeds of crime related provisions has highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions imposed onto a court properly reflect the nature of judicial functions under chapter III of the Constitution. Specifically, the decision reinforced that courts must be allowed to exercise supervision over the making or enforcement of proceeds of crime orders. Amendments in bill To ensure the legislative framework providing a court with the power to register and enforce foreign orders continues to operate as intended, this bill will make minor but important amendments to the Mutual Assistance Act, the International Criminal Court Act and the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. The amendments to each of these acts will provide a court with greater discretion when determining whether a foreign order should be registered and enforced in Australia and whether or not to hear an application for registration on an ex parte basis. The amended provisions will require a court to register a foreign order unless it considers it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so. In determining whether registration of a foreign order is in the interests of justice, the court is to give due regard to the overarching purpose of the regime. Objects provision In order to clarify the purpose of this regime, the bill will also insert an object clause into subdivision A of part VI of the Mutual Assistance Act. The objective of the subdivision is to enable Australia to give effect to foreign orders in situations where property related to serious foreign offences is located in Australia. As reciprocity is the fundamental basis of international crime cooperation, it is vital that we are able to provide the same level of assistance to other countries as we would expect of them. Conclusion Where a person has committed a serious offence in a foreign country, and proceeds from that offence are located within Australia, it is important that Australia is able to enforce foreign orders. Australia must not be seen as a safe haven for criminals and their ill-gotten gains. These amendments will ensure that the legislative framework continues to operate as intended and that Australia can register foreign proceeds of crime orders in an effective and timely fashion. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Higher Education Support Amendment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Garrett. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
1,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (09:11): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian government is committed to transforming the scale, potential and quality of higher education in Australia. When we came to office in 2007, we understood very clearly the transformative potential of higher education. We understood that new investment and reform was required to allow our nation's universities to meet the increasing demand for higher qualifications from students and employers, to meet our nation's future workforce needs. In 2008, the government commissioned a wide-ranging review of Australian higher education, known as the Bradley review. This review was the catalyst for the major package of reforms 'Transforming Australia's Higher Education System', announced in the 2009-10 budget. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011, which I am introducing today, will implement more of the reforms announced in that package. Fundamental to the government's reforms has been the understanding that the Australian economy today-and the Australian economy of the future-will require more Australians to be degree qualified. The demand for ever more sophisticated goods and services will require higher levels of innovation and skills in our workforce. In Australia today, the demand for professionals, managers, and community and personnel services workers is outstripping demand for clerical workers and labourers. More professionally qualified people, engineers and managers will be needed by 2015. We will need them in the healthcare sector. We will need them in the mining sector. We will need them to respond to future challenges that arise across the breadth of the Australian economy. This is why the government has made a commitment to the expansion of a highquality university sector to educate the graduates needed by an economy based on knowledge, skills and innovation. This approach is essential if Australia participate fully in and benefit from the global knowledge economy. The government has set an ambitious goal for national attainment. It is seeking to increase the proportion of 25to 34-year-old Australians with a qualification at bachelor level or above to 40 per cent by 2025. This was one of the major reasons the government committed to demand-driven funding for undergraduate student places at public universities. We are committed to funding growth in undergraduate student places and to opening the doors of higher education to a new generation of Australians. The bill being introduced today gives effect to that commitment. The bill reforms the Commonwealth Grant Scheme which provides the Australian government's financial contribution to a student's place at university. Australian universities will no longer be asked by the government to ration Commonwealth supported student places among students competing to get a bachelor degree. The government will make its financial contribution to the cost of educating all students admitted to undergraduate courses of study. The government will no longer set the number of undergraduate places that a university can offer. From 1 January 2012, universities will have greater flexibility to respond to student demand, and employer and industry needs. The Commonwealth Grant Scheme is to be changed so that universities will be funded, not on the number of places which the education minister decides they will be is to given, but based on the number of places they provide. The legislated cap on the Commonwealth Grant Scheme is being removed by the bill. By 2012, the government will have increased higher education expenditure on teaching and learning by 30 per cent in real terms since 2007. This year, the government will fund more than 480,000 undergraduate places at public universities. With an anticipated four per cent growth, next year this will rise to over half a million places-a 20 per cent increase since 2008. To fund this historic expansion of opportunity, the government provided an additional $1.2 billion in this year's budget, bringing the total demand driven funding to $3.97 billion over successive budgets. The government recognises that it will continue to have a role in the national oversight of our higher education sector. It will retain some powers to assist achievement of those outcomes and to enable it to respond to national imperatives. Higher education providers will continue to be required to have a funding agreement with the Commonwealth in order to be eligible to receive Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding. The bill amends some provisions relating to these funding agreements. The most significant of these amendments relate to the specification of maximum basic grant amounts. These changes are required by the change to the method of calculating the amount of grant a university will receive under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. In addition, there may be circumstances in which the Australian government needs to limit the extent of future growth in unallocated undergraduate places. The minister will be able to do this by specifying a maximum basic grant amount for these places in a university's funding agreement. Significantly, the minister will to specify an amount that would reduce the funding for undergraduate student places that a university receives from one year to the next. The government will not be specifying any maximum basic grant amount for unallocated undergraduate places in any funding agreement for 2012. It also does not plan to do so in future years, but the government does wish to ensure that growth in undergraduate courses is sustainable, does not involve excessive risk and that the government's fiscal position is properly managed. The government is not uncapping funding for student places in postgraduate and medical courses. It will continue to allocate Commonwealth supported places in these areas. The government will be maintaining each university's current target for postgraduate student places in 2012. It will also be ensuring that postgraduate student places that have been provided within the existing allowance for overenrolment continue to be funded. The bill provides that the government can specify in a university's funding agreement a maximum basic grant amount for allocated places that is higher than the amount for the university's target load. The government's forward estimates of expenditure provide sufficient funding to ensure that there is no contraction in the level of Commonwealth supported postgraduate student places. It will be working with the sector to establish a framework for funding postgraduate places into the future. The outcomes of the base funding review will also be taken into account when considering future arrangements in the not be able postgraduate coursework area. In recent years, there has been a major expansion in the number of medical schools. The number of domestic medical graduates is projected to rise from around 1,900 to over 3,100-an increase of over 60 per cent. This has placed significant pressure on the availability of clinical training places and internship opportunities. These are vital to maintaining the quality of graduating doctors. For these reasons, the government will not be removing the controls on student medical places at this time. The government will be monitoring demand and supply for graduates in all disciplines in the early years of implementation of the new funding system. The bill ensures that the government has the capacity to respond to any new skill shortages and, if necessary, to the oversupply of graduates in particular areas. Amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 will ensure that the government retains powers to allocate places for particular disciplines. The bill allows the minister to declare a course of study to be a designated course of study. This will provide the minister with the capacity to allocate places for those particular courses. The bill provides that such a declaration must be tabled in both houses of parliament and is a disallowable instrument. The government believes that the measures contained in this bill for demand driven funding of undergraduate places provide for much needed investment in higher education. As a result of these reforms, universities will be able to grow with confidence and diversify in response to student needs. Consistent with the shift to a demand driven funding system, the government agreed in its response to the Bradley review that the student learning entitlement (SLE) provisions of the act would be abolished from 2012. The SLE currently limits a person's ability to study at university as a Commonwealth supported student to the equivalent of seven years full-time study, subject to exceptions specified in the act which allow for further periods of 'additional' SLE and 'lifelong' SLE to be allocated. Application of the SLE has resulted in instances of hardship for particular students-for example, where a student who completes a three-year undergraduate science degree subsequently goes on to reenrol in a six-year medical degree. In cases such as these, students can exceed their SLE and no longer be eligible for a Commonwealth supported place. The bill repeals part 3-1 of the Higher Education Support Act and amends other provisions of the act to remove the SLE and its role in the various funding schemes under the act. The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act to require that each Table A and Table B higher education provider enters into a mission based compact with the Commonwealth. Compacts will provide for Commonwealth oversight of the teaching and research missions of the universities. Mission based compacts provide an important process of dialogue and communication between universities and the government. Compacts provide assurance concerning the alignment of university missions with the Commonwealth's national goals in the areas of teaching, research, research training and innovation. They do so in a way that recognises that the objectives of government and universities are often shared. In preparing compacts for the 2011-2013 period, the government has been made aware of universities' growth strategies, their intentions for maintaining the quality both of teaching and the student experience, and their contributions to the government's attainment targets. As a consequence, the government is better informed about the future research directions of universities, their strategies to advance innovation and of their efforts to train Australia's research workforce. The Australian government will continue to work cooperatively with higher education providers through compacts to ensure that individual university missions serve Australia well in teaching, research, research training and innovation. It will continue to monitor developments, progress and achievement across the sector. The bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act to promote free intellectual inquiry. Free intellectual inquiry is an important principle underpinning the provision of higher education in Australia. It is one that the government has committed to include in the act. Free intellectual inquiry will become an object of the act. The government's funding arrangements should not be used to impede free intellectual inquiry. Table A and Table B providers will be required to have policies that uphold free intellectual inquiry in relation to learning, teaching and research. This will be a new condition of funding. Most universities already have such policies and I know they all wish to support research and teaching environments which promote free intellectual inquiry. It is fundamental to the scientific method and rigorous scholarship. It is necessary to evidence to be challenged, competing theories to be debated and facts to be established. It provides the foundation for our understanding of the world and the accumulation of knowledge. This bill reflects the government's continued commitment to invest in Australia's universities and to expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a higher education degree. As a consequence of this bill and our investment in higher education, more Australians will have the opportunity to gain a university education. In this next generation of students, there will be many people who will be the first in their family to embrace the opportunities that a university education can offer, with the promise of a high skilled, high paid job when they graduate. Our industries will get the university educated workforce they need. Our regional communities and industries will share in the benefits. Australia will have a growing and sustainable higher education system which meets the needs of our nation. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Garrett. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
2,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (09:26): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. enable The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 makes amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. The bill amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to extend the existing funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year. The government is conducting a review of funding for schooling due to report in 2011. While the review is focused on the mainstream, there may be implications for the design and operation of the closely complementary programs run under the act. This extension will allow sufficient time for the government to implement any changes arising from the review, whilst also meeting its responsibilities around proper planning, engagement, consultation and change management with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, communities and funded organisations. The bill confirms the Australian government's commitment to review all funding arrangements for schooling, including in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education-focused programs which are run under the act. The Australian government is committed to closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. This extension will facilitate consideration of the findings of the review and the best way to utilise the funding under the act to support improved educational achievement for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The bill will also formalise a number of previous decisions of government in relation to the mechanisms for the delivery of a number of initiatives related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. At the commencement of Reconciliation Week, I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Garrett. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
3,Mr GARRETT,BILLS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (09:29): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The government's Social Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 represents the first stage of the income support payment reforms contained in the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. This package will provide greater incentives for parents to engage in the workforce, reduce their dependency on welfare and will provide families with a greater measure of financial security. Joblessness among families represents one of the most immediate challenges facing Australia as an inclusive society. In a time of increasing national wealth, many Australian families risk being left behind and many Australian children are in danger of missing out on the opportunities that a dynamic and growing society has to offer. Evidence indicates that joblessness is closely linked with higher rates of poverty, lower achievement in education and training, and poorer health outcomes for both parents and their children. Families in which neither parent works, or in which single parents rely on welfare payments as their sole source of income, can produce entrenched problems leading to intergenerational disadvantage. This is especially a concern for single parent families, who constitute 70 per cent of the total number of jobless families in Australia. In order to break the cycle of joblessness and welfare dependence, the government is enacting a range of measures to help parents address the barriers which prevent them and their children from taking advantage of the opportunities which Australian society has to offer. To this end, the government is introducing changes to parenting payment and Newstart allowance for single principal carer parents that will provide greater incentive for single parents to engage in paid work, to reduce their reliance on welfare and to promote selfSecurity sufficiency. This will in turn serve to provide positive role models for the children of income support recipients and help reduce the chance of welfare dependence passing onto their children. Under the Building Australia's Future Workforce reforms, single principal carer parents on Newstart allowance will be able to retain more of their income support as their employment income rises. This will mean that single-parent families will be able to earn almost $400 extra per fortnight before they lose eligibility for Newstart allowance. This provides a strong incentive for single parents to undertake or increase their hours of work, and allows their family to see the immediate benefit of their labour. These changes further build upon the government's more flexible participation requirements for parents reforms that were introduced in July 2010 which allowed parents greater flexibility in engaging in meaningful participation whilst balancing their parenting responsibilities. As part of the broader changes to parenting payment, in this bill the government is taking a positive step towards reducing the inequity that exists between different parenting payment recipients based upon when they first applied for payment. This inequity is a legacy of the 2006 Welfare to Work reforms of a previous government. In July 2006, the parenting payment provisions in the Social Security Act were amended such that a person who claims parenting payment from 1 July 2006 can only qualify for parenting payment until their youngest child turned eight (if they are single) or six (if they are a member of a couple). Prior to July 2006, a person could qualify for parenting payment until their youngest dependent child turned 16. However, people who were in receipt of parenting payment immediately before 1 July 2006 were allowed to remain under the previous rules. These 'grandfathered' recipients can continue to qualify for parenting payment until their youngest child turns 16. A full eight years longer than new recipients if they are single or 10 years longer if they are partnered. In order to achieve more equitable and consistent eligibility rules for parenting payment, this bill will amend the Social Security Act so that only children who were born to or came into the principal care of their parent before 1 July 2011 will count towards the grandfathered status of the parenting payment recipient. This change will limit the ability of parenting payment recipients to extend their grandfathered status and will ensure that all parenting payment recipients will be treated equally in a shorter time frame than would otherwise have been the case. This bill is just the first step towards creating more equitable treatment for parenting payment recipients. Further changes will take effect from 1 January 2013 and will be included in a separate bill which will be introduced later this year. Overall, these changes will form an important element of the income support reforms that the government is undertaking as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. These reforms will encourage more parents to participate in and share in the benefits of paid work, will provide better support and assistance to parents, and are an important step to making the system fairer. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Financial Viability) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Kate Ellis. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (09:36): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am introducing a bill to the House that builds on the government's commitment to better ensure the financial viability of the child care sector. Members will recall the overnight collapse of ABC Learning in 2008-a collapse that was simply unprecedented in this country. It was a collapse made possible by the fact that the former coalition government allowed ABC Learning to continue to expand virtually unchecked and unhindered. As a result, with virtually no notice, almost 100,000 families across the nation were left wondering what they were going to do the next morning. Tens of thousands of confused parents did not know if they would be able to go to work or to study the next day. Sixteen thousand child care workers did not know if they still had a job to go to. When a child care provider as large as ABC collapses, the consequences for both families and staff are severe. If it had not been for the Australian Labor government's quick and decisive action in 2008, when we stepped into stabilise the sector and keep ABC's doors open for families while future arrangements were made-these families, children and workers would have been left in the cold. Instead 90 per cent of these centres continue to operate for Australian families today. But this government also pledged that we would never let this happen again. Following that catastrophic collapse the Australian government committed to strengthen stability in the child care industry so that parents' could be confident that their care arrangements would be there to support them when they need it. We have introduced a range of new measures to better ensure the financial viability of child care providers. We are:  more closely scrutinising the financial background and key personnel of child care providers when granting approval to operate a child care service; and  requiring operators to give the Department 42 days notice of their intention to close. Furthermore through legislation that is currently before the Senate, we will:  enhance the government's ability to deal with 'pheonixing'-where an operator who accumulates debts, exits and then re-enters the market under a restructured company; and  strengthen the secretary's powers to refuse applicants who are not fit and proper persons to operate child care services. The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Financial Viability) Bill 2011 builds on these reforms. The amendments in the bill broaden the powers of the secretary of the department to request detailed financial information about large, long-day-care providers and use this information to assess their financial viability on an ongoing basis. It will also deliver greater audit powers to the Australian government where we have serious concerns about a provider's financial health. This means that for the first time large, long-day-care providers will be required to demonstrate that they are financially viable as a condition of receiving government funding. These providers will also be required to continually demonstrate their financial viability each year in order to receive government funding. This will establish an 'early warning' system, so that the Australian government can anticipate and respond to a potential collapse of a major child care provider. Our focus on large, long-day-care providers in this bill is in recognition of the widespread impact a collapse of such a provider-like ABC Learning-can have on families, children and child care workers. The Australian government recognises that child care is an essential enabler of workforce participation, most particularly for Australian women. At a time when employers are crying out for workers then it is essential that we are supporting parents who want to return to work to be able to participate confidently. Parents need to have trust that when they drop their child off in the morning that their child is in quality child care. Importantly, they also need to know that when they drop their child off at care, someone will be there to meet them each and every day. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 4) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
4,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (09:41): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's tax laws. Schedule 1 reduces the quarterly income tax instalments for the 2011-12 income year for those taxpayers whose instalments are adjusted for previous years' gross domestic product growth. This is referred to as the GDP adjustment method of working out instalment amounts. The great majority of taxpayers required to pay quarterly instalments use this method, including most small businesses and individual investors such as self-funded retirees. These amendments reduce the GDP adjustment factor for the 2011-12 income year from the default, which would be eight per cent, to four per cent. This delivers small businesses and the other taxpayers using the GDP adjustment method a $700 million cash flow benefit in the 2011-12 income year. This provides eligible taxpayers with a smoother transition from the two per cent GDP adjustment factor that the government applied for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 income years as the economy recovered from the global financial crisis. This measure is part of the government's package of measures to improve the cash flow of small businesses and simplify their tax affairs. Those measures include the instant asset write-off for any asset costing less than $5,000, an immediate deduction of up to $5,000 for motor vehicles and reducing the small business company tax rate to 29 per cent. The government will have more to say on these measures when the legislation for them is introduced. Schedule 2 removes the ability of children under 18 years of age to use the low income tax offset to offset tax due on their unearned income, such as dividends, interest, rent, royalties and other income from property. The government has taken important steps to reduce taxes on low-income earners by doubling the low income tax offset from $750 to $1,500. This delivers a benefit to taxpayers earning up to $67,500. But increases in the low-income tax offset have doubled the amount of non-work income that can be allocated to children tax-free. There is evidence that 200,000 distributions from trusts have increased in line with the increased low-income tax offset, to take advantage of the opportunity to minimise tax by allocating income to children. The low-income tax offset was never meant to act as a tax minimisation vehicle. This measure reduces the incentive for families to split income with their childrenprotecting the integrity and improving the fairness of the income tax system. Children will still benefit from the full low-income tax offset for their income from working. Double orphans and children with disabilities will also be fully protected under this change. The government sees trusts as a legitimate business tool and remains committed to clarifying, updating and rewriting Australia's trust law. This will greatly assist the 660,000 trusts in Australia. Meanwhile, the Liberal-National coalition remain bitterly divided over the opposition's tax policy in relation to trusts, one minute they want to tax family, small business and farm trusts as companies, the next minute they have changed their mind and are arguing whether it was opposition policy in the first place. Mr Tony Smith: Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, I reluctantly point out to you that the Assistant Treasurer is completely out of order. If he wants to use the parliament to attack his opposite number or the opposition, there are forums where he can do that, but this is the introduction of a bill. He should know-and I will give him the benefit of the doubt for not knowing-that his remarks are to be confined entirely to the substance of the bill. I can anticipate what he is going to say, because he has circulated it. If the Assistant Treasurer did not know that, I give him the opportunity to simply stick to the substance of the bill. That is well knownyou know that very well yourself, given your experience. I raise that point of order.",29

6,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"The government sees trusts as a legitimate business tool and remains committed to clarifying, updating and rewriting Australia's trust law. This will greatly assist the 660,000 trusts in Australia. The Gillard government has a clear tax framework that makes sure that taxpayers pay their fair share, increases national savings and retirement income and simplifies the tax system for Australians. We present a tax framework which is very important, and it is important that the opposition too responds to it and has a tax framework. ",30
7,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Sturt will desist from interjecting.,30
8,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"At least we are certain about what to do on trusts. Schedule 3 contains amendments to streamline the process for claiming tax deductions for the cost of total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance provided through superannuation. These amendments are designed to reduce costs for superannuation funds in complying with the law following the expiry of the current transitional relief which applies to these insurance policies. Superannuation funds commonly take out death and disability insurance to cover liabilities they may incur to their members. Disability insurance taken out by superannuation funds includes TPD insurance. The cost of TPD insurance provided through superannuation is deductible to the extent the policies provide cover which is consistent with the definition of 'disability contributions superannuation benefit' in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Where broader insurance cover is provided, superannuation funds are required to obtain an actuary's certificate to determine the deductible portion of the premium. These amendments allow the percentage of certain TPD insurance premiums that is deductible to be specified in regulations. This will assist superannuation funds by avoiding the need to engage an actuary to determine the deductible portion of premiums in many cases. The regulations containing the prescribed percentages will developed following consultation with industry. The government introduced transitional provisions in 2010 which were designed to allow time for the industry practice of deducting the full cost of broader disability insurance policies to be brought into alignment with the operation of the law. These transitional provisions expire on 30 June 2011. The amendments in this schedule extend this transitional relief to funds that selfinsure their liability to provide disability benefits. This will provide equitable treatment between self-insured funds and premium-paying funds, and will avoid the need for self-insured funds to amend tax returns and obtain revised actuary's certificates where they have claimed deductions for broader disability insurance for the relevant income years. Schedule 4 introduces amendments to ensure additional employer contributions imposed by an industrial agreement, or the rules of a superannuation fund, will not be reportable employer superannuation contributions. Reportable employer superannuation are contributions to superannuation above the minimum required by the superannuation guarantee that employees can influence, such as salary sacrifice and similar arrangements. Reportable employer superannuation contributions are counted as income when determining a person's eligibility for government financial assistance programs. Contributions mandated by an industrial agreement, or a superannuation fund cannot be controlled by employees, and cannot be accepted by employees as income or other benefit. These contributions should not be be considered income when assessing a person's eligibility for government financial assistance. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Butler. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",30
9,Mr BUTLER,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian government has a strong commitment to caring for our older Australians. In line with this commitment, the Gillard government will spend around $10.9 billion on aged care in the 2010-11 financial year. Moreover, the government is delivering on a range of significant aged-care reforms to enhance the delivery of recipient centred aged-care services. In tandem with these reforms, ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to adequately protect older Australians living residential aged care is of paramount importance to this government. The government takes this responsibility seriously and is committed to working with aged-care residents, and industry to identify areas where improvements can be made. In the 2010-11 federal budget, the government announced it would increase protection for accommodation bonds and strengthen complaints management in aged care as part of its commitment to providing better health and better care for older Australians through the national health reform agenda. I am pleased to be delivering on these promises today by introducing the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. Essentially, the amendments contained in the bill increase protection for residents in two ways: first, they strengthen protections for accommodation bonds held by providers of residential and flexible aged-care services and, second, they improve complaint management in aged care. In addition, the bill makes other minor amendments to remove redundant provisions relating to aged care which are no longer operational and can be misleading to agedcare providers. Protecting aged-care residents' savings Accommodation bonds were established to give approved providers a source of capital funding for investment in residential aged-care infrastructure. Accommodation bonds are essentially an interest free loan from the aged-care resident to an approved provider. The provider has the responsibility to repay the bond when the resident leaves the aged-care service. In the event that an approved provider goes into liquidation owing bond refunds, the Australian government makes those refunds through the Accommodation Bond in Guarantee Scheme. Since the introduction of the Aged Care Act in 1997, there has been strong growth in the value of accommodation bonds held by the aged-care sector. As at 30 June 2010: approved providers held more than $10.6 billion in bonds on behalf of more than 63,000 agedcare residents; the average total bond holding held by an individual approved provider was $11.2 million; and the average new accommodation bond charged during the financial year was around $232,000. The total value of accommodation bonds held by approved providers has more than doubled since 2004-05-equating to an average increase of 20 per cent per annum. This is a significant amount of funds held by aged-care providers on behalf of their residents. And, as the Australian population continues to age and the demand for aged care increases, the funds loaned to approved providers through accommodation bonds will continue to grow. Given the significant funds loaned by residents to their approved providers, it is important that this money be directed to residential and flexible aged-care infrastructure and that there be robust accountability mechanisms in place to underpin confidence in the safety of residents' funds. To date, the majority of approved providers have effectively met their obligation to refund bonds to their residents. However, since the introduction of the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme in May 2006, it has been activated on five occasions with around 150 accommodation bonds refunded at a cost of approximately $24.5 million to the taxpayer. This experience, together with that of the Department of Health and Ageing in undertaking prudential monitoring and compliance activity, has demonstrated that regulation of accommodation bonds could be further enhanced. In particular, there is a need to reinforce the role of bonds in financing capital investment in aged care. This bill provides greater clarity about the uses of accommodation bonds and strengthens the link to aged care. Specifically, the bill reinforces that bonds taken after 1 October 2011 should be used for capital expenditure at aged-care services, repaying debt associated with capital works and refunding existing bonds. The bill also makes it clear that accommodation bonds can be used for financial investment. For example, a number of approved providers invest bonds in term deposits prior to building a new facility. Importantly, the reforms are structured to ensure that crucial investment in aged-care infrastructure is maintained. A broad approach is taken to capital expenditure and includes costs for activities directly associated with capital expenditure. The design of the reforms also ensures that regulation does not unduly impact on effective corporate structuring and business arrangements. For many approved providers, the reforms are not expected to have a significant impact as they will already be using bonds for the permitted purposes. However, a two-year transition period will be implemented to ensure that those approved providers that need to make changes have sufficient time to act to meet the new requirements. Unfortunately, the risk that some entities may not act appropriately in dealing with accommodation bonds cannot be completely removed by regulation. Therefore, it is important to have strong incentives in place to discourage this type of behaviour. Under the new arrangements, offences will apply when misuse has been identified. New criminal offences will apply where an approved provider has used bonds for a nonpermitted purpose, is insolvent and is unable to repay accommodation bonds when they fall due. In the very worse of cases, criminal offences will also apply to individuals within the organisation. Individual offences will only apply in circumstances where (a) the approved provider has used bonds for a nonpermitted purpose, is insolvent and unable to repay accommodation bonds and (b) where an individual was complicit in this. For example, where the individual was a key personnel of the approved provider (that is, in a senior position), knew the bonds were being used for a non-permitted use and was in a position to take, but had not taken, reasonable steps to prevent the misuse. The introduction of offence provisions for the misuse of bonds demonstrates the government's commitment to addressing the serious moral culpability of those who choose to misuse bonds which are essentially loans to approved providers by people in vulnerable positions. Aged-care residents need to be confident that their funds are being used for the intended purposes, that there is transparency about that use, and that there is sound regulation in place to monitor and protect their savings. As I have mentioned, the focus of the enhanced protection for accommodation bonds is to reduce the risk that approved providers are unable to make refunds to residents. Given this emphasis, the bill removes the current restrictions on the use of the income derived from bonds and accommodation charges. Currently, these restrictions are more significant than those related to the actual bond itself, but by removing the restrictions this will free up these funds for use by approved providers, reduce regulatory burden and ensure that regulation better targets the area of greater risk. To support all of the new arrangements, the bill will also introduce information gathering powers in circumstances where, for example, concerns exist regarding the capacity of an approved provider to repay accommodation bonds. This will improve the capacity of the Department of Health and Ageing to actively manage or monitor risks as they emerge. Improving the handling of aged-care complaints The second key element of the bill relates to the management and resolution of complaints about aged-care services. The Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme (the scheme) provides a means through which concerns relating to the delivery of residential, community and flexible aged-care services subsidised by the government can be investigated. In July 2009, in response to industry and community concerns about the scheme's operation, an independent review to identify areas of improvement was completed. A key outcome of that review was the recommendation to increase the consumer focus of the scheme and to strengthen the focus on resolution of complaints rather than just investigation of complaints. While many of the recommendations have already been implemented administratively, amendments proposed through this bill will enable the implementation of the reforms to continue. To this end, the bill proposes to enable the Conclusion 'investigation principles' to be replaced with new 'complaints principles. The proposed new complaints principles will describe the improved complaints scheme and will have a stronger focus on resolution of complaints. This will provide consumers with a more flexible scheme where a range of options are available for assisting to resolve a complaint, including: early resolution, conciliation and mediation. Other amendments Other amendments contained in the bill will make some minor, operational changes to remove redundant provisions relating to aged care, which have the potential currently to confuse the public. Timing Subject to the passage of the bill through parliament, it is proposed that the reforms relating to bonds take effect from 1 October 2011. A two-year transition period will be in place until the end of October 2013 to allow the sector time to become familiar with new requirements relating to the permitted uses for bonds. This will assist to ensure a smooth transition. Changes relating to complaints principles take effect on 1 September 2011. Minor amendments and removal of redundant provisions will take effect on royal assent. These changes have been the subject of consultation with the aged-care sector, the banking and finance industry and consumer representative groups. Their views have been instrumental in shaping these reforms. To ensure smooth implementation, the review's government will continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders, providers and care recipients and their families, and obviously listen very closely to their views. I am very pleased to introduce this bill. The amendments it contains ensure, as far as possible, that the financial interests of residents are protected, that effective regulatory safeguards are in place for accommodation bonds and that a regulated source of capital funding is provided for investment in aged-care infrastructure. This bill provides a regulatory framework that is commensurate to the risks associated with the strong growth of bond holdings in the aged-care sector, which is currently over $10 billion. It also provides for a shift in way aged-care complaints are dealt with, from one of investigation to one of resolution, facilitating pragmatic, resident centred outcomes for all concerned parties. By doing so, this bill will help promote public confidence in the aged-care system. Debate adjourned. NA Rearrangement",31
10,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:02): by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following item of private Members' business being called on, and considered immediately: Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 2011Order of the day No. 18. Very briefly, the Attorney-General will be commenting on behalf of the government on the constitutionality of this issue.",35

12,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,There are a lot of bush lawyers on standing orders here. Mr Stephen Smith: I was making no contribution.,35
13,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"I thank the Minister for Defence. The question before the House is that the motion for the suspension of standing orders moved by the Leader of the House be agreed to. It is open to debate. If somebody seeks the call, they will be given the call or I will just put it to the vote.",35
14,Mr MCCLELLAND,BUSINESS," I submit that the motion moved by the Leader of the House for the suspension of standing and sessional orders should be agreed to, because there is an important constitutional issue to be considered in respect of this private the member's bill. I submit to you, Mr Speaker, specifically that there is no proper basis for the bill to proceed once it is called on. There is no proper basis for it to proceed in the House of Representatives, having regard, first, to the requirements of section 56 of the Constitution and, second, to the fact that the bill could not properly have been introduced into the House in view of standing order 179(a). I addressed the first matter generally in a letter of advice to you, dated 16 February 2011, which you tabled on 21 February of this year. I will briefly revisit that constitutional issue before discussing the requirements of standing order 179. Essentially, under Australia's constitutional arrangements, the government of the day is responsible for the management of public revenue and the budget. Specifically, section 56 of the Constitution states that laws appropriating money shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has been recommended by message of the Governor General. The Governor General's message can be given only on the advice of the government of the day, and this procedure is reflected in standing order 180. House of Representatives Practice, fifth edition, 2005, at page 409, states that an appropriation bill includes a bill that would have the effect of increasing or extending the amount that may be paid out of the existing Consolidated Revenue Fund. In my letter of advice to you, I outlined the historical background of these provisions and referred to the previous advices provided by the then Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick. In particular, Sir Garfield was of the opinion that a bill appropriating money includes a bill that has the effect of liberalising the conditions under which the benefits are payable. I will shortly discuss why the subject bill would have that effect. Before I do so, however, I refer to the second issue to which I have referred-that is, the requirement of 179(a), which provides: Only a Minister may initiate a proposal to impose, increase, or decrease a tax or duty, change the scope of any charge. The Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 2011, if brought on, would have the effect of both changing the scope of the charge and also introducing an appropriation. In particular, very briefly, I know that this proposes to abolish the age limit relating to the payment of superannuation contributions for employees. If the bill was passed, employers who did not make the superannuation contributions for employees aged over 70 would be liable",35
15,Unknown,BUSINESS,Honourable members interjecting,36
16,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! If members want to have a discussion across the table whilst the Attorney-General is on his feet they can do so elsewhere.,36
17,Mr MCCLELLAND,BUSINESS,"I thank you for your courtesy, Mr Speaker, and trust it will be extended by my very noisy colleagues on both sides of the House. If the bill were passed, employers who did not make superannuation contributions for employees over 70 would be liable to pay a superannuation guarantee charge in respect to any shortfall under the act. The consequence of the bill would be that employers would be required to pay charges in cases where they are not currently required to do so. Standing order 179 would have been applied to introduce such a measure and this did not occur. The issue of appropriation also arises because, where the additional charge applies, the Commonwealth would be required to make a payment for the benefit of relevant employees and the Consolidated Revenue Fund would be accessed for that purpose. The proposed law would therefore also involve an appropriation within the meaning of section 56 of the Constitution and or standing order 180. On that basis, to be validly passed, the bill requires a message from the Governor General, which may be obtained only on the advice of the government, and the government does not propose to obtain a message in this case. I therefore support the motion that the bill be bill brought on and, once brought on, Mr Speaker, I would respectfully request of you that you rule that the bill should not proceed. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (10:08): In rising to speak to the motion as to whether the bill should be brought on, I think that the points made by the Attorney General need to be answered. Standing order 179 deals with a bill which deals with a tax matter. Clearly this bill does not deal with a tax matter and it is for that precise reason I did not include in the bill a provision that would enable any superannuation payments made to a person over the age of 75 to become a tax deduction. Instead, I am proposing to move that as an amendment to an existing government tax bill, as I am entitled to do, which would grant a tax deduction for that payment. As the law currently stands, when an employee turns 70, the employer may elect to pay or not pay the superannuation guarantee charge. I believe that to be ageist and sexist as well because it does apply very often to women in that context. But the ageism is very patent. The fact of the matter is that every employee in paid employment should be treated exactly the same and not be disadvantaged because of their age. As the law currently stands, when one turns 70, as I said, the employer does not need to pay the superannuation guarantee charge. If the employer elects to do so then it is a tax deduction up the age of 75. Thereafter, it is illegal to pay the superannuation guarantee charge and therefore there is no provision for it to be a tax deduction. My proposal is that the age limit of 75 be abolished on the basis that it is discrimination against people on the basis of age. This government are introducing a commissioner for ageist issues, so they are being hypocritical in the extreme in trying to vote down this bill. As I said, the question tax deductibility for the very small number of people who presently are in that category of working over the age of 75 will be dealt with by amending one of the existing government tax bills. But now I go to the question of why the existing bill is not a tax bill. I will go to some advice which I have received from the Parliamentary Library. I will direct your attention to the questions that were dealt in estimates. Nobody in the library is prepared to pay a registration fee for their practising certificate. Although they are qualified lawyers, they do not hold practising certificates and therefore they give advice on legal matters without determining it to be legal advice. I will read out the advice I was given. They were asked whether in their view this was an appropriation bill. The advice was given by Morag Donaldson from the library. She said: 'It does not appropriate revenue or money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the government. It simply abolishes the age limit of 70 years from the calculation of the shortfall component which is used in assessing superannuation guarantee charge payable when an employer fails to make superannuation payments by repealing paragraph 27(1)(a) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.' This advice, like many legal authorities, says that the bill is not a tax bill. It does not change the scope or any charge. While the bill may have consequences for the revenue, it is only if the government is to pay moneys to meet the shortfall in superannuation payments. On the face of it, the bill does not impose, increase or decrease a tax or duty. It specifically says that, because the bill is not an appropriation, section 56 of the Australian Constitution does not apply. Just to remind people, section 56 says that a vote, resolution of or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or money shall not be passed unless the proposed purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by a message from the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. That has not occurred. To state again what this bill is about: it is a question of age discrimination. The law currently says that for someone between the with age of 70 and 75 who is in the paid workforce their employer is not obliged to pay",36
18,Unknown,BUSINESS,Honourable members interjectingMrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Perhaps we could have a little attention.,37
19,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! Those conferencing in the aisles will resume their seats. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: That does include the Leader of the House, who is lobbying instead of being a member.",37
20,Unknown,BUSINESS,Honourable members interjecting,37
21,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! The member for Mackellar has the call. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Thank you very much. I will simply say to the Independents on the cross bench, who have a very important decision to make on the question of ageism, that this bill is about precisely that. It is about abolishing a requirement in the law that disadvantages an employee on the basis of age. If it were a law that was disadvantaging an employee on the basis of race, I bet nobody would hesitate to vote for it. If it were a disadvantage on the basis of sex, I bet nobody would hesitate in voting for it. But because it is a disadvantage on the basis of age, the government is working overtime to persuade the members on the crossbench that they should be supported and that the crossbenchers should not support the bill to abolish this disadvantage to employees on the basis of age. I have said over and over again in this place that I want ageism to be considered just as offensive as sexism and racism. It is not reasonable, in a country that says it is inclusive and that it wants every individual to matter and be important, to have on our statute books a provision that disadvantages an employee just on the basis of that person's age. If the crossbenchers were to agree to the government's persuasions and knock it out, it would be a vote against people on the basis of age. I really do not think that as a group of people they would find that accepted. The government will try and the Attorney General has tried to say it is a constitutional issue. Let me give you the background to the way the bill came forward. I asked the clerks to draft the bill. The clerks did draft the bill. It went into the process, under the new paradigm, of giving each member their right and entitlement to bring forward matters of importance to the people. Subsequent to the bill going into the process, I got a note from the Clerk's office that said, 'Some people have been asking: is this an appropriation bill?' On further investigation I was told it was the government that was askingwanting to knock it out. So there was no problem when the bill was drafted; there was no problem when it went in. It all happened post facto. Suddenly, the government wanted to knock it out. I then went and sought other advice. When I was heavied by many people to try to amend my bill to say that it would only come into effect when the government introduced an appropriation bill, I refused to do so because that would have made the bill null and void-it would not come into effect. I was urged to do that as recently as today. I say to you, Mr Attorney-General, that if you feel so passionately about this issue then here is a proposition: let the bill have a second reading and, when we go to the consideration in detail, you move amendments and give an undertaking that you will bring in an appropriation bill to effect what I want to do and remove age discrimination. That would be a fair and reasonable way for you to proceed. But to try and knock the bill out on the basis of it being against the Constitution when it is giving every single Australian the right to be treated equally and not discriminated against on the basis of age, I find appalling. I find it appalling that someone for whom I have a good respect would want to argue in that way. So I say to you: I have given you a proposition; I have given you a way forward. You could give it a second reading. You could then move your amendments and give an undertaking that you would bring in an appropriation bill to give effect to my private member's bill and then agree to my subsequent amendment to the tax bill to grant the tax deductibility. That would give us a way forward and it would remove the age discrimination that is currently in our law and totally unacceptable. I go back to first principles. We have about 100 people in the Public Service who are over the age of 70, and my understanding is that the government, as the model employer, does not pay these people the superannuation guarantee. That is unforgivable. I say to you: if you accept what I put forward-that you give the bill a second reading, that you then move the amendment that it will only come into force when you bring in the appropriation bill and that you give an undertaking that it will do so, and that you will accept the amendment to allow tax deductibility for people over the age of 75 where the employer is then enabled to pay that superannuation guarantee charge-we would have a fair solution and a resolution which ought to satisfy your concerns. It certainly would satisfy mine, because it would be bringing justice to the people who are currently disadvantaged. That includes your own employees. Let me it say again: there are Public Service employees under this government right now and that is why it is important that we deal with this as a question of suspending the standing orders.",37
22,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! The member will make her remarks through the chair. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: I would be very interested to hear whether or not the Leader of the House or the Attorney-General will agree to the proposition that I have put forward. And if you do not agree to the proposition that we are putting forward then give us the reasons.,39
23,Mr Turnbull,BUSINESS,Robert spoke very broadly on this issue. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: spoke very broadly on this issue. I am only answering the points he raised.,39
24,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,The member will refer to members by their parliamentary titles. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: I will indeed. I apologise-the Attorney-General.,39
25,Mr Albanese,BUSINESS,You wouldn't know what he said. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Well you would not-you were having caucus up the back. You would not know what was said.,39
26,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! The Leader of the House will cease interjecting. The member for Mackellar will ignore interjections. The member for Mackellar has the call. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. He is rather easy to ignore.",39
27,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"The member for Mackellar will refer to the motion. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: If I could just make that point again. There are currently employees of this government in the Public Service who are not being fairly remunerated because they are being discriminated against on the basis of age and are not being paid the superannuation guarantee charge. As the model employer, the government has an obligation to act like a model employer. Allowing this bill to go into effect, either by passing the bill and letting it become law now or by accepting the proposition that I have put to you, would mean that that discrimination will come to an end. If you insist on having this bill voted down",39
28,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"The member will refer her remarks through the chair. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Through you, Mr Speaker, if the government simply Robert wants to stonewall and not find a solution to this problem and its own proposition is that only changes should be made affecting people between the age of 70 and 75, it will do nothing about removing the absolute age discrimination of 75. If we are to be truly inclusive in this country, if the government establishing a commissioner against ageism is to have any meaning, then this bill needs to go forward. I say to the crossbenchers, to the people who are independent: you are at a critical time. You have the opportunity to say that you want ageism to be as unacceptable as sexism and racism. Then you have the opportunity to give this bill a second reading. In speaking on the suspension motion, we are at a crossroads as to whether or not the government is fair dinkum about wanting to end ageism. We on this side of the House certainly are. It is a strong and principled and I would seek the government to either allow it to pass or seek the solution to their difficulty as they see it that I have put forward.",39
29,Mr OAKESHOTT,BUSINESS," In beginning to discuss the question before the House, which is a suspension motion, I do want to thank the members of the House who have participated in some lively discussions in the last 15 minutes, including the Manager of Opposition Business, the Leader of the House, the Speaker himself and the various clerks and my crossbench colleagues. For something that was so simple on the surface, this is proving to be a classic example of something that is layered with all sorts of challenges and considerations not only with regard to the question before the House and the following question, where we have a suspension motion to allow a private member to debate anything of their choice. That, I would hope, has the support of all members of this House, and I should not expect any division from any crossbench colleagues or anyone in this chamber. One of the parting comments of the previous speaker was asking for support from the crossbenchers to allow the Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill to have a second reading. I think that is a no-brainer for the whole House. I would be very surprised if any member chose to vote against a private member's interests to bring forward something for consideration. It is the next question before the House, with regard to voting on the substance of the bill, where there are some more layers and challenges. I listened closely to the Attorney General's advice and the advice from government, and it only further accentuates the point that we have an issue before this parliament that is unresolved and needs to be resolved. As was mentioned again by the bill previous speaker, we have competing advice from institutions within this parliament with regard to whether this is or is not either an appropriation bill or a tax bill. We need to sort out the question of what is or is not a money bill. We are here in this 43rd parliament for 2½ more years and we can expect many private members to bring forward all sorts of issues, as is their right in a parliament that is alive, and we need to resolve this question, particularly the boundaries and the grey areas of what is and what is not a money bill. This has obviously been a historical dispute between the two chambers of the parliament and it is proving itself now to be a weapon of politics in relation to activities within this chamber. It needs to be resolved. To emphasise the point, the member for Mackellar has brought forward the Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 2011, as is her right. Yet, in seeking advice, we do get conflicting advice. The member for Mackellar I think somewhat unfairly verballed the clerks in accusing them of drafting the bill and then changing their mind. In defence of the clerks, they will draft anything that a member of parliament wants to bring into this chamber, as is their right. When asked for advice from not just the government but also people such as me, seeking to clarify questions constitutionality and whether a bill is or is not a money bill, we were provided advice that we can only take on face value as objective and as advice from people working in the parliament's and the nation's best interests. The advice that they have provided is that this bill can be captured as a money bill. Their advice is in some areas worth reading into the record, with the indulgence of the House. There are several points in the advice received. The first is that there is a standing appropriation provision in the original actthe Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992-that appropriates funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to make payments on behalf of employees to superannuation funds in the event that the employer does not meet their obligation under the act to pay the necessary superannuation contribution. If this happens, the Australian Taxation Office in turn issues the employer with a debt notice equivalent to the amount of superannuation guarantee payment. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the net effect on government's fiscal position is probably negligible. Nevertheless, technically the proposed bill, if enacted, could give rise to payments under the standing appropriation. Thus if it is not the eventual net position but rather the fact that payments would be made from the standing appropriation that matters, it could be argued that a Governor General's message would be necessary to cover this eventuality. The second point relates to standing order 179, which provides: a. Only a Minister may initiate a proposal to impose, increase, or decrease a tax or duty, change the scope of any charge. And there are some considerations in that regard that point towards this bill being within the scope of a money bill. The advice from the clerks also suggests that both these of issues could be described as technical matters. However, they could give rise to a situation where there is a breach of the principle that the financial initiative rests with government if the need for an appropriation and the imposition of a charge arose as a consequence of the bill being enacted. In light of this, again the advice suggests that an amendment be moved in the consideration in detail stage of the bill that may address some of these issues. That is the advice, on the one hand, from the very good clerks of this chamber-who are apolitical, independent of thought and try to steer a path for legislation in the nation's interests. At the same time, advice has been provided from the Parliamentary Library. I gather that was sought by the member for Mackellar, and I thank her for that. That is conflicting advice indicating that, no, this is not an appropriation bill, because it does not directly appropriate revenue or money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the government and nor is it a tax bill because it does not change the scope of any charge. I am happy to make those two pieces of conflicting advice available to the House or to any member of the chamber. The point is, we need to resolve this question of what is or is not a money bill before we get into the form and substance and issues around ageism and superannuation reform. They are all very noble causes, and I understand the government is looking to bring in substantial reform and I welcome and support that, and I also look forward to participating in debate around that soon. I also congratulate the or member for Mackellar for identifying the issues in regard to ageism generally and the need for those in a workforce that is ageing to be able to receive the same rights and entitlements as anyone of any age in that workforce. Having said that, if we are going to get down to the form issues I think there is a cost to business that I would like to see some more details on. I would be happy to continue the conversation past today and, as well, I would hope that the member for Mackellar and the Assistant Treasurer, who is in the chamber and who I think has carriage of superannuation reform, could actually have a meeting of the minds sometime soon and see whether this issue can be plugged into the overall direction of superannuation reform that will be in place in the next six months, I hope. The way I read what is going to happen is that we will all support a suspension of standing orders and then we will be considering the substance of the bill. I will not be supporting the bill itself, because of the advice primarily from the clerks in this chamber. But I do flag that we are getting to the point where this is one of the last times this will happen unless we can resolve this issue of defining a money bill and defining clearly the relationship between the lower house and the upper house and then get a clear pathway on this important question. I think we will be starting to look for a test case if the government does not take this on as an issue of importance and substance. With people using this obvious opportunity as a weapon of politics, I am sure that this case will arise sometime soon. I would hope that, in good faith, the government does try to start a conversation with the other chamber, start a conversation with those who are wanting to get the right outcomes for parliamentary democracy, and then we can be making decisions not based on conflicting advice from various institutions all of whom work for this chamber. I will be supporting the suspension but not supporting the substance of the bill, and I hope this is an issue that can be taken on by this parliament in the broader sense about defining what is or is not a money bill.",40
30,Mr BANDT,BUSINESS," Let me make it clear for everyone, because this does seem to be turning into another one of those Thursday morning specials, that when the Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill comes before the House in substance, whether that is now or at some later stage, I and the Greens will be opposing it. We will not be opposing it on the grounds that it is a money bill or an appropriations bill; we do not agree with that argument that has been put by the government. The grounds on which it will be opposed will be fleshed out later but, in short, we believe the government has available to it a better solution for tackling this issue. We are concerned about potential tax implications and implications for the revenue in passing the bill as it is and, like the member for Lyne, we would want more discussion about what potential cost implications for employers-and that is despite being sympathetic to the underlying principle of the bill. As far as the questions before the House today go, it is our understanding that, if there is support from the opposition for a suspension of the standing orders to allow a debate today, then that is the way we will vote as well. I notice that the bill is not listed on the Daily Program, so if it was the view of the private member proposing the bill that it was not scheduled to be voted on today then I believe, as a person who moves private member's bills, we have an interest in ensuring that the matter proceeds in an orderly fashion and that there is not the bringing on of votes in a way different from the expectations of those who brought the matter before the chamber. We will be wanting to make sure that there is proper opportunity for debate in accordance with the wishes of the mover of the bill but when it ultimately comes on we will not be supporting it-not because it is not a money bill, and we do not agree with that, but because we do not agree with the bill.",42
31,Mr WILKIE,BUSINESS," On 21 August last year the 150 members of this parliament were fairly elected. It is our responsibility to make this parliament work and to work well, and for it to be a place where good public policy can be developed and become law. But we do have eating at our work the lingering question over what exactly is a money bill. We are seeing that again this morning. The questions that are now arising consistently about what is or is not a money bill are breeding instability and uncertainty, and that is wrong. I do call on the government to look at this matter afresh and to put in place mechanisms or processes or definitions or whatever is needed for this uncertainty to be done away with. We had such uncertainty with the changes to the youth allowance, we have uncertainty with the superannuation charge and there is the possibility of uncertainty over increases to defence pensions, if that legislation does come down from the Senate. It has become a political weapon. It is not healthy and it is not in the public interest. I therefore call on the government to address this matter so we do not have this issue time and time again, and I call on the opposition to act responsibly in this matter and not look for areas of public policy where we brush up against this and create such instability. This parliament must last three years. We have all been elected to sit in this place for three years. It is arrogant for anyone in this place to think we have a right to destroy this parliament-to pull it down and to go to an early election. That would not be in the public interest. It is in the public interest make this parliament work. On this specific bill, the Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill, I applaud the member for Mackellar for her strident and ongoing efforts to end age discrimination in Australia. I think the fact that we currently have an age limit of 70-moving to 75, in fact, if a government initiative progressesis still a form of age discrimination. I ask the government to look afresh at whether or not 75 is the right age for people to stop receiving mandatory employer superannuation payments. Personally, I see a case-and this will be something about which to lobby and perhaps to argue in this place in the future-for mandatory employer superannuation payments to not have an age limit; they should be paid indefinitely. We should encourage greater participation of older people in the workforce. In fact, we should celebrate it. There is no reason in my mind why someone who is competent at age 76 should not be a full and productive member of the workforce and their employer should not be expected to make employer superannuation payments. That is how I approach this. So I applaud the member for Mackellar for the work she is doing and that I hope she continues to do. There is, though, the obvious problem of lack of warning for business if such an initiative were implemented straight away. I think the government has the settings right when it says that business should be given a couple of years to prepare for changes to superannuation arrangements. But at the end of the day the reason I will not support this bill is the ambiguity of whether or not it is a money bill. I have now seen a number of pieces of advice which have given completely different perspectives on whether this is a money bill. At least one piece of advice I received contained within its to judgment a certain amount of ambiguity still. Personally, where there is ambiguity about whether something is or is not a money bill I will default to inaction-to not progressing it-because I think that is in the public interest. To bring on a constitutional crisis would be the wrong thing to do. I do not want there to be a test case to resolve this. I want the government and the opposition to act responsibly and in the public interest to address this so we do not have to have a test case, and I do not want this to be the test case.",43
32,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:40): I close the debate relating to the Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 2011 and thank all those who have made a contribution to it. I particularly welcome the comments of the last speaker, the member for Denison, who outlined quite rightly that it is in the public interest for these issues to be resolved and for the parliament to serve its full term. I take some contention with the comments of the member for Lyne. This is not an issue of a dispute between the houses. The way we deal with bills that might come from the Senate to this House was a previous issue. This bill originated in this House. This is a bill that, according to the member for Mackellar's own statements, repeated a number of times during her contribution to this debate, has an impact on government revenues. The member for Mackellar outlined repeatedly that a number of employees of ministers-that is, public servants-would be impacted by this legislation. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Every time they employ another 3,000 they have to pay.",44
33,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"The member for Mackellar has herself outlined why this is a money bill. Money bills are specifically ruled out without an appropriation being recommended by a message from the Governor General under section 56 of the Constitution and the procedure is reflected in standing order 180. This has applied regardless of who the government of the day is. Indeed, this is a procedure that protects the executive and protects the government in its ability to apply a budget. If this protection is not there, then there is no way that appropriate decisions that are fiscally responsible can be made because appropriations could be sought in isolation from the overall budget. This protection is needed if we are to have responsible economic policy in this nation. I say with respect to all the members who have contributed to this debate that we have resolved our position. Our position is that we support the Constitution of Australia. Our position is that the Constitution of Australia was written with a great deal of foresight and common sense. Common sense suggests that they actually got it right. So it is very clear that it is possible for the House to pass motions expressing a view about what should happen, but it is not possible to pass legislation that has an impact on the budget. That is absolutely critical to the stability that the member for Denison, the member for Lyne and others spoke about as being so necessary. We have had attempts that were not tried during the last parliament, attempts to bowl up legislation that might, in isolation, be viewed by some members as having merit. There are a range of things I would like to see revenues spent on, but I understand that, at the end of the day, you have expenditures and you have revenues and they relate to each other. And we have a commitment to return to surplus by 2012-13. So the position is very clear, I think. The government, in moving this resolution for the suspension of standing orders, gave full and proper notice. I know my office certainly advised the Manager of Opposition Business and the shadow minister, who is indeed here with full knowledge of what time this debate would take place today. So what has occurred is in accordance with the normal selection procedures. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",44

35,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,This morning. That is what I said.  the blue.,45
36,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,The position was clear. It was discussed at the Selection Committee again last night. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: We were told last night it wasn't coming on.,45
37,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,By whom? That is not true. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: It is not in the Notice Paper.,45
38,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"I identified it and we rang and gave notice this morning to the Manager of Opposition Business following very clear established process. The government supports the suspension. The government does not, however, support this bill being able to proceed. I understand, Mr Speaker, that you wish to consider the matter, but I respectfully submit, in support of the Attorney-General's submission on this matter, that these are indeed critical issues for the appropriate operation of the budget. I commend the resolution to the House. Question agreed to. The SPEAKER (10:47): Before I call on the order of the day, I would like to say that I have appreciated the debate. It was not a debate on a suspension that we would describe as normal, but I think the matters before us are very important. I assure the House that I will decouple the substantive matter before the House from the procedural matters and I will look at those procedural matters because they are of great moment. They are very important matters, a fact which has been acknowledged, I think, by participants in the debate on the suspension. There was reference made to opinions that members have received. On that basis, I would prefer it if the House were to allow me to go away, take on board those submissions and come to a more considered point of view. As has been mentioned in the debate, there could be options available to me, one of which could be that I rule that no further discussion take place. That would be a very serious ruling and one that I would not wish to make without due consideration. Based on some of the comments that have been made. I would note that, pleasantlybecause this is a matter that is within the province of the House-we can actually decide. It is not a matter of resolving a dispute between the houses. But the core principle about the application of the definitions of bills still stands. I thank members who have made comments about that. It is my intention to call on the matter and I would hope that I could have the cooperation of the House in then having the matter immediately adjourned. NA Abolition of Age Limit on Payment of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Debate adjourned. Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",45
39,Ms MARINO,BILLS," I do not want to see any legislation or policies from this parliament that affect the decision-making process or the decisions made under the Family Law Act that provide less protection for children and families who are at risk of violence or abuse or both. That is why these proposed family law changes deserve very serious scrutiny. I also do not want to see changes to this legislation used and interpreted by anyone in a way that results in unsafe, unhappy children and even more desperate, angry and frustrated parents. Should this legislation be passed, only time, the experience of families, statistical information and genuine, transparent assessment and reporting will provide accurate information on its impacts. There is probably no more difficult or contentious part of the Australian legal system than family law. We know why: it deals with relationship breakdown, disputes between separated parents, the welfare of children and young persons, and divorce and property settlement, which are all extremely difficult, contentious and emotive issues. While the Family Court's paramount considerations are 'the best interests of the child or young person' and 'matters relating to the child's protection and care', it is very difficult-frequently impossible-to provide practical, workable or equitable outcomes for those involved. The explanatory memorandum, in describing the changes being made by the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill, says it: Bill 2011 … retains the substance of the shared parenting laws … and continues to promote a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents where this is safe for the child. I have no doubt that most people believe that under this principle decisions should be made in the best interests of the child in family disputes and that a child should have the right to a fair and proper relationship with both of their parents, which was the intent of the shared parenting provisions introduced in 2006. The aims of the 2006 reforms were, in part, to encourage greater involvement by both parents in their children's lives after separation. They were also to protect children from violence and abuse and to help separated parents agree on what is best for their children, rather than litigate, through the provision of useful information and advice as well as effective dispute resolution services. I note that a report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies has confirmed that legislative changes in 2006 placed 'greater emphasis on the need to protect children from harm from exposure to family violence and abuse'. The identification of and response to family violence became more systematic under the 2006 reforms, which have improved some of the ways in which the family law system identifies families at risk of violence. That is an extremely important finding, in my view. The report also noted that the principle of shared parental responsibility is widely supported and that there has been a very substantial shift away from using the Family Court to resolve disputes. This is a very good outcome for all concerned. Another extremely important finding from the AIFS report was that the shared parenting reforms did not expose children to greater risk of violence or abuse. This reflects the intent of the 2006 reforms and the Family Law Act. However, I am seriously concerned that the expanded definition of family violence in the bill before the House may weaken rather than strengthen the protection of the of the 2006 reforms. As we are aware, many cases that reach court involve abuse and neglect, and the Family Court has to try to make sense of broken families and relationships in making its decisions. Rarely are these decisions viewed by all parties as a perfect solutionindeed, they cannot be-and it would be unfair on those who work in the Family Court to expect perfect outcomes. However, neither is it fair to pretend that people are hurt by the court in reaching its decisions or that in some cases that hurt is extensive to the point of being potentially life-destroying. The true 'winners' in the Family Court process are the children and parents who, in spite of their personal circumstances and hurt, are able agree on outcomes and never get to the Family Court at all other than to ratify that agreement. That was one of the AIFS report's findings about the effects of the 2006 reform-that in the substantial shift away from using the Family Court to resolve disputes, people are genuinely putting the welfare of their children first. They are separating and divorcing as amicably as they can to try to make the best of a very difficult set of circumstances. When that happens, the children are the real winners, and the increasing number of parents who have chosen this course of action since the 2006 reforms have allowed their children to 'win'. For those parents who, for so many reasons, cannot resolve their issues the Family Court is the only option. This bill seeks to address the issue of family violence, in particular the need to protect children from abuse and exposure to abuse; however, in seeking to do so it basically reverses the presumption of innocence-something I am quite concerned about. By removing the need for abuse to be proved, the government by definition is proposing speculation based on unproven accusations. According to the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the new definition of abuse will: … remove the requirement for the assault to be an offence under an enforceable law in a State or Territory. It further says: This means that those working with the Act, including courts, legal practitioners and family members will not be required to have regard to the terms of State and Territory laws when not considering whether abuse has occurred. The new definition will remove uncertainty about knowing the elements of an offence and whether an offence has been committed. The final line-'whether an offence has been committed'-seriously concerns me. The bill proposes to remove the certainty that comes with having to prove abuse and imposes the uncertainty of having the court decide whether abuse has occurred. The existing act defines whether an offence has been committed; the bill before the House removes that certainty. How this provision will be used, interpreted and potentially abused by one or both parents is an issue that concerns me, as does how in practical terms it will work for and impact on parents and children. I am seriously concerned that false accusations may well undermine or cover actual cases of abuse that do need to be exposed. This bill defines abuse as: … threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful. (2) Examples of behaviour that may constitute family violence include (but are not limited to): (a) an assault; or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour; or (c) stalking; or (d) repeated derogatory taunts; or (e) intentionally damaging or destroying property; or (f) intentionally causing death or injury animal; or (g) unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had; or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support; or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture; or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member's family, of his or her liberty. As I said previously, the derogatory taunts were an issue which concerned me. It may therefore be incumbent upon family law exponents to ensure prospective clients report to the appropriate authorities any repeated derogatory taunts which may be used in future legal action. In practical terms, how will this work? After all, in the case of two parents of otherwise good repute this might be the only differential the court can use to make a decision. Perhaps we may well see both spouses keeping diaries to record any form of derogatory remarks for future court reference. The Hull committee report in 2003, on which the 2006 changes to the act were based, considered that while the court should of course protect children from violence and abuse, the law should do more to ensure the involvement of both parents in the majority of families. This is what the explanatory memorandum to this bill seeks to continue. In particular, the law should help people move away from the previous tendency to assume that it was best for children to spend most of their time with one parent and only spend alternate weekends and half of the school holidays with the other parent. How to an does the government propose to ensure that this right to a real relationship with both parents, as enshrined in the 2000 amendments and explained in the explanatory memorandum, will be preserved under the current proposals? Like many members, I receive constant evidence from people who come into my office with issues. Ten years ago, prior to the 2006 review, a constituent of mine was before the Family Court of Western Australia in a dispute over custody. He was told by the now retired judge that he was not concerned which parent the child was placed with as long as he, the judge, could sleep at night. I know that such a comment-to either gender-can be offensive to the parents. At the time it was a brutally honest reflection of how the decisions were made and what influenced the judge. The reforms of 2006 demonstrate very clearly that there have been changes in this since then. The pain, the resentment and the frustration of being seen as a loser in the Family Court will be with my constituent for life, as it will be for so many others in the community. As I said, I do not want to see any legislation or policies from this parliament that relate to decisions made under the Family Law Act that would provide less protection for children and families who are at risk of violence and abuse. I certainly do not want to see changes used and interpreted by anyone in a way that results in unsafe, unhappy children and even greater numbers of desperately unhappy, angry and frustrated parents.  to speak in favour of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and I commend the member for Forrest for her contribution on this topic. All governments must take very seriously their responsibility to protect children from child abuse and respond to family violence. That was the message from the Safety for Children Alliance which visited parliament yesterday to demonstrate their support for this bill. things were a little bit friendlier in this chamber I would have been happy to join them at the front of Parliament House, but it is not the sort of parliament where people can go missing. The Gillard government has also received a number of reports into family law reforms and how the system deals with family violence. These reports include: the Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms by the Australian Institute of Family Studies; the Family courts violence review by Professor Richard Chisholm AM; and Improving responses to family violence in the family law system: An advice on the intersection of family violence and family law issues by the Family Law Council. It is clear from these reports that we can and must do more to protect and support families at risk of abuse or violence. My wife has worked in child protection for more than 20 years and she often tells me of the lifelong scars suffered by those who experience this kind of physical and emotional abuse in the family home. She is a frontline child protection worker, so she only deals with families when things have gone bad. It is horrible to see how some families treat children. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, last night was State of Origin night. For the benefit of Tasmanians and Victorians, for many of us who call New South Wales or Queensland home, State of Origin is one of those iconic contests that brings out our pride and love for our home state and team. Unfortunately, there is one horrible aspect to State of Origin night. I am told that on State of Origin night the state that loses experiences a spike in incidents of domestic violence. I love State of Origin football but, knowing this, on every Origin night I feel anxious about what will happen once the final whistle is blown. So for me, as a Queenslander, a win is always a slightly If bittersweet experience-part of me would like every game to be a draw, but I know that will not happen. So when it came to last night's game, I know the Attorney-General, who introduced this bill and whom I was sitting beside, hoped for a different outcome to me, but when it comes to eliminating family violence we are very much on the same team. Family violence and child abuse cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. Children must be protected from harm and violence, as well as from witnessing harm and violence against other family members. Personally, I come from a broken home so I well know that all separating families face incredible stress and pressure as child custody and property matters are resolved. Where there are violence or abuse issues, the anxiety and apprehension experienced by families is all the worse. All too often we see in our newspaper headlines the grim reminders of what happens when things go wrong. All too often it is men-occasionally women-who hurt the ones they love. I know that as a government and a society we can never get it perfectly right. We can never have a system that will prevent every single murder, but that does not mean that we should not try to achieve that system. This bill does not change the essence of our shared parenting laws designed to promote a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents, obviously where this is safe for the child. All those barneys that we have in family courts, which keep lawyers employed, over access or residency or whatever we want to call it, should always defer to what is best for the children. That should be the prime consideration. This bill will enable the family law system to better respond to matters involving child abuse or family violence. It amends the Family Law Act 1975. We need to revisit that briefly. How groundbreaking it was when the Whitlam government brought in the Family Law Act. It amends that act to prioritise the safety of children in parenting. It changes the meaning of 'abuse' and 'family violence' to better capture harmful behaviour, including actions or threats by a person against another family member or their property. It also includes witnessing such actions or threats. It strengthens adviser obligations. It ensures family courts have better access to evidence of abuse and family violence and it makes it easier for child protection authorities to participate in family law proceedings, because all too often that crucial evidence is missing. Unfortunately, that is probably not great news as concerns workloads for my wife and her work colleagues, but as it will make children's lives safer I am sure they will wear the initiative. The court will quickly consider need to make any orders to ensure there is sufficient information available about the allegation of family violence or child abuse in order to resolve the issues and ensure that appropriate protections are in place. The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments to the Family Law Act: it clarifies the Family Court's power to dismiss appeals and to delegate procedural application in appeals to registrars; it clarifies that parentage testing orders and parenting declarations are not parenting orders; and it aligns the Family Court's and the Federal Magistrates Court's provisions on administering oaths or affirmations and on the swearing of affidavits. This bill sends a strong signal that family violence and child abuse will not be tolerated. Violence and threats of violence are never acceptable. I revisit the concept that this is not a silver bullet that will solve everything. Parliament is not the community. I am merely my community's representative. Our laws help people but obviously it is the community that saves lives and that saves children from experiencing harm and rescues them. It is the community that raises children. We are merely a part of that process. All too often, when there is a family tragedy-the all too horrible circumstance of murder, normally of the woman and the children, and then the suicide of the murdering male-people come on talkback radio and say, 'Who should we blame? What member of the government or what government department should we blame?' But too often it is the community that has turned its back on the household in distress. Like the campaign going at the moment for a child protection agency, too often we have turned our back. Obviously, what would have changed things early on was a knock on the door, as neighbours, friends and good citizens do, to say, 'How are you going. Can the we take the kids out and give you a break.' Too often our community streets are lined with cells, not homes-these little silos of lives that do not intersect with the people living right next door or right across the road. We see it in the recent tragic circumstances on the Gold Coast. Also, there is a court case happening at the moment concerning young twins in Sunnybank Hills who perished because no-one knocked on the doors and asked what was going on. I welcome the bill and I hope it will have a positive impact on family relationships and children's health, development well-being. I commend the bill to the House.",46
40,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," Family law is the one jurisdiction of the federal judicial system to which almost all Australians have had exposure at some level at some time in their lives. It is a sad fact of life that virtually every one of us will either have first-hand experience or have someone, most likely several people, within our circle of friends who has had contact with the court. It is also a sad fact of life that family law disputes are often amongst the most intractable matters to come before a court, often in a context of extreme personal bitterness and too often occasioned by violence and abuse of the most horrible kind. It is also a fact of life that any attempt resolve these disputes will often leave both parties feeling aggrieved and, much worse, their children exposed to the fallout and remaining at risk of violence and abuse. Many of the failed relationships that come before the courts have been blighted by mental illness and substance abuse problems, sometimes on both sides, and, because judges are human, the courts will not always get it right. In disputes involving children the principal guidance the act provides is that the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration. Just how the best interests of children can be determined, however, is and will always be a vexed question. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as I know you would be well aware, in December 2003 the House of Representatives Committee on Family and Community Services tabled a unanimous report titled Every picture tells a story. The committee was asked to consider whether, given that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration, what other factors should be taken into account in deciding the respective and time each parent should spend with their children, post separation. The committee, headed by Kay Hull MP, heard evidence from more than 2,000 witnesses over six months. One of its findings, which informed many of its recommendations, was: We are convinced that sharing responsibility is the best way to ensure as many children as possible grow up in a caring environment. To share all the important events in a child's life with both mum and dad, even when families are separated, would be an ideal outcome. This was the finding of the entire committee, across party lines. The committee heard heart breaking evidence of children separated from one of their parents by inflexible Family Court orders, which caused anguish to parents and children alike and which had to long-term detrimental effects on children. The so-called 'shared parenting' laws were introduced by the Howard government in 2006 in response to that report. The changes to the family law system included changes to both the legislation and the family relationship services system. The main elements of the legislative changes were to require parents to attend family dispute resolution before filing a court application, except where there are concerns about family violence and child abuse; to place increased emphasis on the need for both parents to be involved in their children's lives after separation, including the introduction of a presumption of shared parental responsibility; to place greater emphasis on the need to protect children from exposure to family violence and child abuse; and, finally, Standing to introduce legislative support for less adversarial court processes in children's matters. The legislative suite included a requirement for the Australian Institute of Family Studies to undertake a large-scale longitudinal evaluation of the effects of the reforms. That evaluation was completed in December 2009, and I will return to its findings a little later in this speech. The coalition is very proud of the Ruddock reforms and justly so. I turn now to the bill before the House. The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 is a bill to amend the Family Law Act 1975 by including an additional object to give effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which decisionmakers may have regard when dealing with children's matters; by changing the definition of family violence and abuse; strengthening the obligations of lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors to prioritise the safety of children; requiring inquiry and reports on family violence and child abuse to be part of court proceedings; repealing the so-called 'friendly parent' provision; repealing the provision for cost orders in the case of false family violence applications; and providing for simpler procedures for the participation of child welfare agencies in family law proceedings. Some of these amendments will have the coalition's support. Others, however, in our view seek to wind back the Ruddock reforms and will be opposed. I will deal with the substantive provisions in turn. Prioritising the safety of the child: the proposes to insert a new subsection to section 60CC, which requires the court, when determining what is in the child's best interests, to give greater weight to the primary consideration that protects the child from harm where there is inconsistency in applying the two primary considerationsthe other consideration being the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. This amendment is unnecessary and gratuitous. The existing section 60CA makes the best interests of the child the paramount consideration, and existing section 60B clearly articulates that a meaningful relationship with a parent is subordinate to the paramount consideration. In purported aid of the objective of this amendment, the bill seeks to add, as a further object of part 7 of the act, that it is to give effect to the UN convention. The explanatory memorandum states that the intention is to confirm, in cases of ambiguity, that part 7 should be interpreted consistently with the convention. However, to the extent that the act departs from the convention, the act will prevail. The proposed amendment does not incorporate the convention into domestic law. Given that the act already gives effect to the principle of the paramountcy of the best interests of the child, the need for this amendment is not clear. At this stage this is a matter for the consideration of the Senate committee. The opposition reserves its position as to whether this amendment will ultimately be necessary. I turn to the definition of family violence. The exposure draft of this bill proposed a definition of family violence that included any behaviour that was subjectively emotionally, psychologically or economically abusive or threatening. Many stakeholders have voiced their concern that any instance of marital discord could be tailored to fit this definition. The definition bill now proposed defines family violence as: … violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family … or causes the family member to be fearful. It differs from the existing definition in that it imposes a subjective test. The existing definition requires a reasonable fear for the family member's well-being or safety. The new definition attempts to qualify its subjectivity by incorporating a list of examples of behaviour which includes assaults, repeated derogatory taunts, damage to property and other unreasonable or criminal behaviour. However, it is an open question as to whether the list of examples is sufficient to frame and limit the subjective definition. There is no doubt that any of these behaviours exhibited would cause a person to be fearful. They would also give rise to a reasonable fear for a person's well-being or safety under the existing test. The problem with the subjective test is that a person seeking to demonstrate that another person is violent need only state that he or she fears controlling or coercive conduct. The state of mind need not be reasonable. The consequences of a finding of violence can be drastic and permanent. It is not appropriate that a court need not inquire as to whether the fear is well founded. Accordingly, the coalition will press for the retention of the objective test in the existing legislation. I turn to identification, inquiry and reporting on family violence and child abuse. The Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation found that the legislative changes introduced as part of the 2006 reforms placed greater emphasis on the need to protect children from harm and from exposure to family violence and child abuse. This meant that the identification of, and response to, family violence became more systemic under the reforms. However, it found that improvements still need to be made in identifying and responding to pertinent safety concerns. The proposed amendments broaden the reporting requirements in this regard to interested persons rather than just the parties in child related proceedings. This will include independent children's lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors. There is a continuing need to improve responses to child safety concerns and it is recommended, subject to the specific findings of the Senate committee, that these amendments be supported. Similarly, the record of child welfare agencies in family law proceedings has in many cases been deeply unsatisfactory. Amendments to improve their participation and accountability are welcomed by the coalition. Turning to the repeal of the friendly parent provision, section 60CC(3)(c) of the act currently requires family courts to consider the willingness of one parent to facilitate the other having a meaningful relationship with the child. The provision has been criticised as discouraging parents from disclosing family violence and child abuse for fear of being found to be 'unfriendly'. The bill seeks to repeal this provision and replace it with considerations of the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in major long-term decisions in relation to the child, spend time with and communicate with the child and the extent to which each of the parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil parental obligations to maintain the child. These criteria already exist in section 60CC(4). The explanatory memorandum cites the Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation and the Family Law Council report as the basis for the repeal of this provision. This is misleading. The Australian Institute of Family Studies found that some concerns were expressed that the provision discouraged the reporting of violence, but there was no statistical information to suggest that this was actually the case. The criticism was in fact voiced in the Chisholm report, which was uncited in this bill's explanatory memorandum, and was described as 'gossip' by the Family Law Council. Failure to facilitate a relationship between a child and a separated parent remains a salient issue for the attention of a court and has been found to be an incident of emotional abuse in several reported cases. If the enhanced violence and abuse reporting obligations are supported, there can be no reason for a parent's obstructive behaviour to be excluded from consideration. I will turn to the final matter that concerns the opposition, which is cost orders in relation to false allegations of abuse and violence. The bill repeals section 117AB, which provides for mandatory cost orders, albeit that some such orders might cover only a portion of the costs. These orders are made when a party knowingly makes a false allegation or statement in the proceedings. The explanatory memorandum cites the Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation and the Family Law Council report as finding that the section operates as a disincentive for disclosing family violence. Again, this is misleading. The Chisholm report alludes to practitioner concern as the basis for its recommendation for repeal, but neither of the major studies cited make any substantive finding. The Family Law Council report in fact recommends that the provision be clarified with an explanatory note or public education campaign. It should be noted that the test within section 117AB is a stringent one. A mandatory costs order could not arise from evidence that was not preferred in the circumstances or even from evidence given recklessly or without belief. It applies only knowingly false evidence. If a court was prepared to make such a finding, there is no reason why a costs order should not follow. Individual members of the judiciary have confirmed that such false accusations are by no means unknown and that sanctions should apply in such cases. The policy objectives of the 2006 reforms were to help build strong, healthy relationships and prevent separation, to encourage greater involvement of both parents in their children's lives after separation, to protect children from violence and abuse, to help separated parents agree on what is best for their children rather than litigating through the provision of useful information and advice and effective dispute resolution services, and to establish a highly visible entry point that operates as a doorway to other services and helps families to access those other services. As the Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation confirmed, the legislative changes introduced as part of the reforms placed greater emphasis on the need to protect children from harm and from exposure to family violence and child abuse. This meant that the identification of and response to family violence became more systemic under the reforms. The Ruddock reforms have been the subject of criticism. However, all the indications are that the reforms have been largely successful. Many of the criticisms have arisen from misinterpretations, whether wilful or otherwise. Sensibly, the government has withdrawn from its more radical proposals and at this stage will leave the core shared parenting provisions largely intact. However, it is disturbing that it has accepted the criticisms of the friendly parent and cost order provisions at face value and has misleadingly cited positive or neutral to findings on those provisions in support of its proposed amendments. The coalition will always support any sensible proposals to reduce the exposure of children to abuse and family violence. Our record indicates that and it takes these issues very seriously. Some of the amendments proposed by this bill are worthy of support. However, as I have said, it must be recognised that proceedings in the family jurisdiction are some of the most bitterly contested and intractable found in any litigation. Judges and practitioners are well aware that child related proceedings may be brought for any number of collateral purposes-which of course is in itself a form of child abuse-and that mechanisms must exist to deal with this. For these reasons, I will be moving the amendments that have already been circulated in the chamber. Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (11:28): It is with great pleasure that I speak in support of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 today. Earlier this year, the Attorney-General and I launched the national plan to reduce violence against women and their children-a groundbreaking 12-year plan to end the unacceptable levels of domestic and family violence being perpetrated in Australia each and every day. I am pleased to say that this Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill is further evidence of this government's ongoing commitment in this area. Today, I take the opportunity to address not only what this important bill will do but also why it is needed. It is important to dispel some of the myths that have grown up around the issue of family and domestic violence in this country and to place the facts firmly on the record. Firstly, I acknowledge the significant work of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the Family Law Council and Professor the Hon. Richard Chisholm in providing the strong evidentiary basis for these amendments. I especially acknowledge the numerous women, men and children who have shared their painful experiences to help inform the development of these important changes to the law. The reforms will allow Australia's family law system to respond more effectively to family violence and child abuse. Importantly, the reforms we are introducing through this legislation will ensure the safety of children during the process of separation. This bill will prioritise the safety of children in parenting matters. It will strengthen the obligations of family consultants, family counsellors, family dispute resolution practitioners, and lawyers to prioritise the safety of children. Under the proposed reforms these advisers must encourage families to focus on the best interests of the child and, in doing so, to put the well-being of their children front and centre when reaching parenting arrangements. Importantly, we are actively removing the provisions that had the perverse effect of discouraging the reporting of family violence. To this end, there will be a new duty on the courts to ask each party about the existence or risk of family violence and child abuse. Parties will have to report their concerns about family violence and child abuse to the courts, and the courts will have to deal promptly with these concerns. Other people interested in the proceedings will be able to make similar reports to the courts. Courts will no longer consider the extent to which a parent is friendly to the other parent, and individuals will no longer need to fear being saddled with a costs order if they report family violence to the courts. The bill will also make it easier for state and territory child protection authorities to participate in family law proceedings where appropriate. These are all vital reforms in our goal to secure safer parenting arrangements for children. This bill will continue to support shared care and a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents. However, where family violence or abuse is a concern the courts will be required to prioritise the safety of the child over the child's maintaining a meaningful relationship with each parent. The bill will also give effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, allowing decision-makers, in the event of any ambiguity, to interpret the Family Law Act consistently with Australia's obligations under the convention. As part of these amendments, behaviour such as stalking and emotional, psychological and economic abuse is explicitly referenced in the definitions. These amendments are extremely important to a government that is committed to addressing the epidemic of family and domestic violence in this country. The rate of domestic and family violence in this country is an epidemic, but it is an epidemic that is not frequently discussed either in this House or in our neighbourhoods and communities. Let us take a moment to look at the facts. Those who suffer from family violence are predominantly women and children. The evidence for this is irrefutable. Research by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that one in three Australian women has experienced physical violence since the age of 15. Research conducted in Victoria just a couple of years ago revealed that intimatepartner violence is the leading contributor to death, disability and illness amongst women in that state who are aged between 15 and 44. Shockingly, while these rates of violence in the general population are appalling, we know that Indigenous women and girls are 35 times more likely to be hospitalised due to family violence than other Australian women and girls. There seems to be what I find a very concerning trend in this country for people, both men and women, to try and play down the statistics-to try and shy away from them-or shut down discussion on the matter, but it will be absolutely impossible make inroads into these family and domestic violence figures if people continue to diminish their importance. Family violence is at the root of some of the biggest social issues facing our nation, including mental health, alcohol and substance abuse, poor education outcomes in children and homelessness. That is why it is entirely infuriating to read about or hear people who play down the impacts and incidence of family violence, suggesting that the problem of street violence against men is far more significant. Let us be clear that all violence must be acted upon, and for this reason we must bring it out of the shadows. We must ensure that we face what is a deeply disturbing reality. It is important to take this opportunity to dispel the myths and put some facts on the record. While it is true that men are more likely to be victims of violence, this violence occurs predominantly at the hands of a stranger and in public places, such as the street or the pub, not at the hands of a family member, not at the hands of a partner, not at the hands of those they trust the most and not in their own home. In fact, violence against women and children is, tragically, too often hidden within the family. As the studies that support these amendments have shown, we know that many cases of domestic and family violence and family abuse continue to be underreported. The evidence base for these amendments is undeniable. The Australian Institute of Family Studies and the Family Law Council say that the Family Law Act is failing to properly protect children and other family members from family violence and abuse. The Australian Law Reform Commission and the New South Wales Law Reform Commission have both emphasised the need for the family law system to respond more effectively to family violence. In his review, to Professor Chisholm found that many families before the Family Court have had to ask the question: 'Do I report family violence to the court and risk losing my children or should I instead stay silent?' We simply cannot and should not live with a family law system in which parents are forced to ask that question or are forced to stay silent when they know there is a risk to family safety. In the face of this overwhelming evidence, we must act to deliver the necessary reforms and ensure the best outcomes for vulnerable women, men and children. As I have already mentioned, the government has been presented with substantial evidence from Australia's top research bodies that some provisions of the Family Law Act were discouraging the reporting of family violence. Specifically, both the AIFS and the Family Law Council have demonstrated evidence that parties were not disclosing concerns of family violence and child abuse for fear of being found to an unfriendly parent under the act. We are changing that provision. In addition, there was evidence that vulnerable parents were choosing not to raise legitimate safety concerns for themselves and their children due to the fear that they would be subject to a costs order if their case was not proven before the court. We have made sure that these cost orders are no longer mandatory. The amendments in this bill will make it easier for the court and other decision makers to inform themselves about family violence when determining matters under the Family Law Act. Through these amendments we hope to see increased reporting of family violence in Family Court matters. We know that this violence does exist. We need to make sure that the court is in a position to receive and weigh evidence on it. This leads me to the final myth that I would like to dispel today. There has been some opposition to this bill from individuals and groups who say that separated mothers routinely make false accusations of family violence and child abuse. They say that vindictive parents commonly pressure their children to make false claims for the purposes of revenge or to gain tactical advantage in child custody disputes. It is concerning that these groups are gaining increasing prominence and respectability in this country, that we are hearing their arguments repeated across the nation and indeed in the parliament and that they are distorting domestic family violence figures, spreading misinformation and propagating the view that family violence and child abuse claims are fabricated during custody proceedings. But what is more concerning is that this spurious view seems to have gotten some traction in our community. Surveys undertaken a few years ago by VicHealth be found that 46 per cent of respondents agreed with the statement that: … women going through custody battles often make up claims of domestic violence to improve their case. Forty-six per cent of respondents agreed with this. I would like to be very clear about this. This reasoning has been entirely debunked by research in Australia and overseas. A report in 2007 by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that the family violence allegation rates in custody proceedings in the Family Court of Australia or in the Federal Magistrates Court are similar to the reported rates of spousal violence profiles in the general divorcing population. In short, claims that abuse allegations are manufactured are bogus and unsupported by any respectable form of evidence. Violence and abuse claims are not being made up to support some perceived advantage in Family Court cases. In fact, Australian research tells us that the concerns about child and family violence are real, especially during divorce proceedings. Women and children are at their most vulnerable to family violence when parents are separating, and we have seen some pretty high-profile examples of this in recent weeks. These amendments before the House ensure that our family law system can never again be described as failing to adequately protect children and other family members from family violence and child abuse. These amendments make sure that the Family Court asks the question about family violence. These amendments make sure that the court has the facts that it needs to make child safety a priority. Some people have said that the reforms in this bill will be bad for men or that they will be good for women, but this is not a debate about that. This is a debate about the rights and safety of children and the responsibilities of parents. It is contest about who will be better or worse off. All family members have the right to be free from harm and to live without fear of violence or abuse. I am pleased to note that this bill has been strongly supported by the community, by those professionals who work in the family law system and by those who have worked so long and so hard to bring about change. In fact, an overwhelming majority of the 400 submissions received during the exposure draft process supported these changes. The government recognises and upholds the right of each child to have love and support from both parents, but that comes unequivocally with the responsibility to protect them from harm. I congratulate the Attorney-General and his department for their work in achieving a significant law reform package. This is something that our government is committed to, both in legislation and through support programs and the new national plan. We will work in solidarity with every state and territory government of all political persuasions to turn around what are staggering, disturbing and very real statistics in our community. I would hope that this is something we could work on in a bipartisan fashion in this House, because Australia has a shameful record. It is a record that we need to bring out of the darkness. We need to confront it head on. We need to make sure that we are saving more children, women, men and family members from this sort of abuse.",51
41,Mr WYATT,BILLS," I acknowledge the comments made by my parliamentary colleague the member for Adelaide. Many of the points that she made are extremely important in this debate. I rise today to speak on the proposed amendments to the Family Law Act through the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family not a Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. There is no doubt that we all condemn violence towards children and partners in a relationship, particularly women. This is not a debate about that. This is a debate around several proposed changes to the act which have come about after several reports were released last year, including the Australian Institute of Family Studies' Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms, Professor Chisholm's Family Court's violence review and the Family Law Council's submission, Improving responses to family violence in the family law system. Essentially, this bill seeks to include a provision to give effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, extend the definition of family violence, extend responsibility for inquiry and reporting into allegations of violence and wind back the reforms introduced by the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock in 2006. It also repeals provisions relating to the facilitation relationships with separated parents and costs orders with respect to false allegations. The 2006 Ruddock reforms put the best interests of the child at heart. A child in a situation such as divorce has a right to be safe and to maintain a relationship with both parents where possible. The coalition believes it is best for separated parents to agree on what is best for their children and not to be dictated to by government. And the child should have the ability to build and maintain a strong relationship with both parents. It is a very fine balancing act to get family law right, and the government needs to consult with all family groups. It is not surprising that when the Gillard government released an exposure draft of the bill last year that there was a widespread community response. The radical changes did not sit well with some in the family law community and thus the current bill was proposed by the government. We are also in the middle of an inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on this very bill. They are due to report their findings on 23 June and this inquiry has also received a number of responses. At my last count there were 210 unique submissions, of which there was a submission from an organisation in my electorate of Hasluck. The Gosnells Community Legal Centre submitted a letter to the inquiry outlining not only its general support for the bill but its recommendations to further strengthen the reforms commenced in 2006. I thank the Gosnells Community Legal Centre for making its views known in such a topical debate. I know that family law affects a number of my constituents in Hasluck and the Gosnells Community Legal Centre does an outstanding job of representing and assisting people throughout the city of Gosnells. Section 60CA of the Family Law Act, entitled 'Child's best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order', states: In deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration. This bill proposes to insert a new subsection into section 60CC which is to prioritise the rights of the child. This is quite unnecessary as section 60CA, which I read before, clearly puts the child first in making a decision in regard to the parenting order. The government also purports that this will give effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The explanatory memorandum states that this inclusion is to reinforce the fact that part VII of the act should be interpreted under the UN convention. However, what it does not state is the fact that when the act departs from the UN convention the act will prevail. Therefore, the addition of this amendment will not actually override the act nor incorporate the convention into domestic law. Thus, one would have to wonder what is the purpose of this amendment. Why include it if the act already deals with the exact issue and will not actually impact upon areas of domestic law? The child should always be the centre of decisions made in respect to a parenting order and the 2006 reforms ensured that this was the case. The bill goes on to extend the definition of family violence. It is good to see that sometimes the Gillard government does listen to its constituents and key stakeholders because when the exposure draft of this bill was released there were a number of people concerned that the new definition could lead to issues in an everyday marriage being defined and argued to be family violence. Yes, family violence does affect people emotionally, psychologically and economically, but the government expanded this to the extent that a simple marital argument or action that one party deemed to be unfair could be defined as violence. Whilst it is good to see that the government must did conduct a consultation process and actually listened to those Australians who made an effort to have their say, the new definition is unfortunately no better. The newly proposed definition of family violence may weaken rather than strengthen the concept. Whereas the existing definition required a reasonable fear for the family member's well-being or safety, the new definition is both vague and an overextension of the government to try and categorise what family violence actually is. The new definition states that family violence is: … violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful. It then attempts to qualify this by listing 10 behaviours which would qualify under the new definition. The list, in which there is no doubt that the behaviour is not only unreasonable but in some cases criminal, still leaves open the question of whether it frames the definition suitably. One facet of this bill which is a step in right direction is the broadening of the reporting requirements of cases of family violence and child abuse to 'interested persons' rather than just the parties to the proceedings. Therefore, this will include children's lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors. Response to child safety concerns should always be improved and built upon. Greater accountability and participation is very much welcomed. The biggest concern of this amendment is the repealing of the 'friendly parent' and 'costs orders' provisions under the current Family Law Act. These were key reforms under the former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock in 2006 and, whilst the reforms have been subjected to a sustained ideological attack, all indications are that the reforms have been very successful and ultimately supported. The 'friendly parent' provision of the current act is defined under section 60CC(3)(c) as being: … the willingness and ability of each of the child's parents to facilitate, and encourage, a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent … This ultimately means that the family courts will have to consider the enthusiasm of one parent to work with the other to establish a relationship with the child. Whilst the government claims that the provision discourages parents' disclosure of family violence for fear of being deemed unfriendly, the current act deals with this in section 60CC(4). The bill will repeal section 60CC(3)(c) and replace it with considerations of the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in major long-term decisions in relation to the child, to spend time with and to communicate with the child and the extent the to which each of the parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent's obligations to maintain the child. This is already in the act in section 60CC(4). The failure of parents to be encouraged to foster a relationship between a child and a separated parent is a major issue in the family law courts and could be found to be an emotional abuse in some cases. Another major element of the current act is the repealing of section 117AB, which provides for mandatory costs orders where a party knowingly makes a false allegation or statement in the proceedings. I know of several families in Hasluck who have had to deal with this section of the act and it has actually protected the child and the other partner from having to bear the cost of defending against a false allegation. Without mandatory costs for knowingly making a false allegation of family violence, it opens up the courts to added cases and will impact adversely upon families. The reasoning behind repealing this section of the act is that the cost orders supposedly discourage individual allegations of family violence for fear of having to pay the court costs if found to be false. The test for having to pay mandatory costs orders is stringent. It applies to knowingly providing false evidence, thus could not arise from evidence that was not proffered in the circumstances, or was given recklessly or without belief. If ever a court were to make such a finding-that one party knowingly provided false evidence-then there is no reason why a costs order should not follow. False accusations are not unknown and sanctions should apply. In the debate around costs orders we should not forget that the safety of the child needs to be paramount. By removing the imposition of costs orders on false allegations, the government is opening up children to the added burden of having to go through extra court processes and angst between parents when a false allegation is made. If there is no disincentive to making false allegations it is much easier to accuse your partner of family violence without any evidence or deterrence. There will be people that will forsake the truth for their own personal gains. The child and the truth are paramount to this argument. By removing costs orders there are three parties that will be affected: firstly, the child or children in question. Having to go through the courts to determine whether the family violence allegation is in fact true or not is a psychological stress that is unwarranted. In the context of the allegation being false, why should the person making the allegation not be reprimanded? This one person, who knowingly made a false allegation and provided false evidence, will not have to bear the costs of the court proceeding and there is no deterrence to adding this stress onto their child. It may sound like I am implying that once this bill passes, every disaffected parent will go out and make false allegations of family violence, but that is not what I am advocating. I am speaking for those women and men who may find themselves in these situations. This brings me to the second party affected: the parent who has had the false allegation made against them. This is not only an emotional and psychological blow to them but an added financial cost to defend themselves against an allegation that is not even true! How fair is that? Divorces are always costly exercises, especially where there are children involved. Financial costs added by defending oneself against false allegations can adversely affect one's willingness to work with the other parent towards what is best for the child and for their employment and future prospects. I mentioned previously that there are three parties affected by the repealing of costs orders, and the final party is the courts. Family law courts are already overburdened and stretched to their limits. If there were to be an increase in false allegations which the courts must act upon, this will add increased stress on the services provided by this institution. Yes, courts should investigate all allegations of family violence and, as I have previously stressed, the interests of the child are paramount in this process, but having no deterrence for making false allegations is a step in the wrong direction. We, as a parliament, should foster a context of resolution and negotiation, not one that is adversarial between parents. Once it becomes adversarial then this can easily escalate into verbal battles and potential violence, increasing the risk to the child's physical, social and emotional well-being. I wish to reaffirm my commitment to any sensible proposals which reduce the exposure of children to abuse and family violence. The coalition's record indicates that we take this issue very seriously. Whilst some of the amendments proposed are worthy of support, clauses 18, 19, 20 and 43 of the bill, which refer to the repealing of the 'friendly parent' and 'costs orders' sections the act, are particularly worrying. Proceedings to do with family law are some of the most bitterly contested and difficult processes to get right. I look forward to the recommendations from the Senate inquiry and hope that they are a step in the right direction for Australian families.",58
42,Ms SAFFIN,BILLS," I rise in support of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I do so because this is a bill that is designed to improve the situation regarding the best interests of the child and is about safety of children. We will disagree about ways in which this can happen, but I think all members would agree that if we are dealing with legislation involving children, the safety of children has to be the primary principle, the starting point. In family law that is not always easy. In fact it can be fraught. Family law is an area that legal practitioners either embrace or eschew, which is indicative that it is not an easy area to work in. I commend those legal practitioners and others who choose to work in this area, many of whom love doing so and do it extremely well. It can be really difficult to determine through the prism of law and courts, in a system that might have parts grafted into it involving mediation or working out what is in the best interests but ultimately still within that conflict paradigm, because that is how a lot of our court systems operate-in a contested environment. I really want to commend the Attorney General for the work he has done in this area. He has done it methodically and forensically over a period of years. He has been mindful of the reviews, mindful of public opinion and very mindful that some changes needed to happen in this area, if not to get it completely right-I am not sure how you can ever do that-then certainly to make it better. That takes me back to looking at the of 2006 evaluation done by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. They looked at the impact of the changes, which included the introduction of the presumption of shared parental responsibility in the Family Law Act 1975. That was taken up in the community-not in the legislation itself but the way it was inculcated into the community and the legal community-as meaning equal parenting; equal time. That seemed to be a push by some, but a reading of the legislation did not say that. Shared parental responsibility is certainly it something that was widely supported, and is still widely supported. In fact, that is what a lot of parents do-they just get on and do it and they do not need to be in the Family Court. Once you are before the Family Court, you already have a problem. You are not there because everything is hunky-dory quite and everyone is getting on-though some people do rock up and get their agreements registered and things like that. You are there because there is discord and disagreement, and in some situations there is violence. That has never been an easy matter to deal with, either, within the Family Court system. If you are looking after protecting the best interests of the child, that is done at a state level with state agencies and then you have the situation where you are going before the Family Court, the two parents and a child or children, and raising the issues. My experience has seen a reluctance on the part of state agencies to get involved, because they say it is a matter before the Family Court, yet they have a primary responsibility to that child. I have always found a gap in that area. That gap still exists, and that is something that still needs to be tackled in a broad sense. Some of the children who are subjected to violence or abuse or are in a situation where they are affected by it in certain ways, if not directly physically then psychologically and in other ways, are falling through the gaps. That is a hard area that requires a lot more to happen at state level, and I hope that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has that on its agenda. The Australian Institute of Family Studies also found that the principle of shared parental responsibility, although widely supported, was misconstrued often as requiring equal shared care time and led to unrealistic expectations among some parents. Therein lies a problem as well. They also found that the majority of parents in shared care arrangements believed they were working well but there were concerns where ongoing fear of violence existed, and these were concerns and situations that were not being addressed and needed to be. Then there was the Family Courts Violence Review, conducted by Professor Richard Chisholm, and also the Improving Responses to Family Violence in the Family Law System review, and that was carried out by the Family Law Council. They looked at the effectiveness of legislation as well as court practices and procedures, particularly in cases involving family violence, which was what it was about. We found after these reviews that there was still a long way to go in effectively responding to issues relating family violence. They actually said some way to go, but my comment is that there is a long way to go in that area. Hence we have had a series of consultations with the public, and there have been submissions. I have received submissions and I have put forward submissions from my area, and they have been broadly supportive of effecting some change in this area and a recalibration, if you like, of the Family Law Act to make sure children's interests are taken care of. People often say if we stop a parent from seeing a child, more violence could ensue, but my reading of all the research and statistics shows that the violence usually happens during access. It is not a case of stopping access, but I want to put that point on the record. The Attorney released some new research, I think in May, and again it was from the Australian Institute of Family Studies. It found that interparental conflict, fear, abuse or safety concerns remain prevalent for a significant number of parents following separation, and that almost one in four parents experienced family violence before their separation, and in many cases children had witnessed some of the abuse or violence. That is consistent over a long period of time with the statistics that we have about family violence and domestic violence. We know it is still prevalent in the community and we know that when parents separate and there has been violence in the broad sense of the definition, not just the physical, that does not stop. That gets played out in a range of ways, and it gets played out in the ongoing relationship that the parents have to have with the children. It can then get played out institutionally through the institutions. It has been a real problem. I have talked with many parents in that situation, particularly women. I am doing that at the moment, and they just feel rather bereft-they feel that the law is to not helping them or their children in any way, and they do not know where to turn. I know some of them are keen to see the changes this amendment will bring, but some of them say it does not go far enough. There will always be comments like that, but it is a matter of how far you can go in this area. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, said: The bill will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to promote safer parenting arrangements for children. As people who pass laws we need to be mindful that the laws we pass do precisely that. The Attorney-General further said: Firstly, the bill will prioritise the safety of children in family law proceedings. That is really important, because even though the rhetoric has been there for a long time it has been far more difficult to put it into practice within a setting of contestation, accusations, allegations, counteraccusations and counterallegations and where you might get state agencies with a hands-off approach. Then you might have a situation in which the court appoints a legal representative for the child. That can be helpful, but that is not properly worked through either. The child has their own lawyer and the parents have their own lawyers, so you are adding some more people into the mix. Sometimes they are told that the parents are not able to the children about certain things. As I said, it is a fraught area. There are no easy answers, but this amendment will give a bit more certainty to those safer arrangements for children and a bit more certainty around the interest of the child being first and paramount. This amended act will include an additional object to give effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which decision makers may have regard when dealing with children's matters under the Family Law Act. Under our legal system that does not happen just of right. It has to be legislated so that it is in there. That will give the decision maker some extra tools for doing what they do now, which is looking at the child's best interest. That is really important, and I know a lot of people have welcomed it. It also strengthens the obligations of lawyers, family dispute practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors to prioritise the safety of children. So there will be that legislative requirement as well, and it is important to have that in there. To that end, the courts dealing with children's matters will have to ask the parties to proceedings about family violence and child abuse. That is seminal, because if you do not ask you often do not find out. I recall that when people presented to hospitals with accident emergencies the question of whether they were victims of domestic violence never used to be asked. That was changed first of all in New South Wales and then around Australia. Andsurprise, surprise!-when the question was asked they found out. Asking that question is really helpful in getting a better outcome for the child, and that is what this legislation does. I commend the Attorney-General and I commend the legislation.",62
43,Mr BILSON,BILLS," I first talk to of all acknowledge the students from Elisabeth Murdoch College and their teachers Kevin and Amy, who are in the gallery today. It is great to see young people parenting gaining a sense of how the legislative process operates in Australia as part of their education. I welcome them warmly and hope today is informative and useful for them. The discussion we are having now is about amendments to the family law framework. The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 is not without some contention. It seeks to amend a body of law that for all members in this parliament is a very difficult area in which we are all called to work and to assist people aggrieved by a process that, by its very nature, means we are engaged because people are frightfully unhappy-and I commend the previous speaker, the member for Page, for that phrasing. The dissolution of a relationship or resolution the breakdown of a family is traumatic and difficult enough at the best of times, but our legal framework expects people who might have-dare I say-a hatred for each other to somehow rise above their personal feelings and to be very objective, calm and open to mutual adjustment at a time when they would probably rather drive over the other person with their car. This is an awful lot to ask. All the qualities and characteristics we hope would come to the fore after a family finds it can no longer maintain the unit and the harmony that it may have once had are very difficult to find at a time of such distress, at a time of disappointment and at a time when what was once, hopefully, a collaborative relationship between parents may have become quite combative. In the 15 years I have been in this place, few areas have attracted as much effort from me or as much tension in the constituency as this area of family law, because people come to my office when they are very unhappy and they are looking for a way to resolve that unhappiness. In a perfect world, as was touched on by the previous speaker, a family breakdown or dissolution will not ever come to fully utilise the provisions of the law we are discussing. Parents with a shared and deep commitment to the well-being of their children will work through what works best for the kids. In my contributions to this debate I often say, 'For the sake of the kids, let's find a way of making this work better.' I am pleased to say that the Howard government did find a way of making it work better, with a series of reforms that I think were quite groundbreaking and followed an enormous amount of work. Admittedly, there were some incremental improvements over time, but it was an effort that brought to the fore an improvement in the tool kit that is available to resolve these very difficult and at times combative and distressing family law disputes. If people can sort these things out amicably and in a spirit of mutual adjustment-one where their love and devotion for each other is no longer the issue but where there is a joint-venture between the parents to raise healthy children-many of the provisions of this law are not called upon. What we are actually talking about is a legal framework which seeks to encourage people to behave in a way that might not be the way they are feeling. As I have often said, trying to use black-letter law to get people to behave in a way that is not in their hearts is very difficult. We are back here today searching for new legal instruments to try to encourage people in situations where collaborative problemsolving, shared purpose and a new joint venture to raise healthy children may not be what is in their hearts-they may just want to win. They might want to win what they might view as the last argument with their partner or spouse at the end of a long period of unhappiness. Or they might just want to make sure that they do not lose too much. When I was first elected, the family law process seemed to adopt a winner-take-all approach. If you won the argument, all of the policy settings flowed your way. For too many that meant a role specialisation. During the relationships, parents would share in the raising of children, the securing of money and resources, and the giving of their love, care and support for their loved ones. When the relationship fell apart, it was almost as if there was a role separation. You became either the carer-there was a term 'custody' and a sense of ownership of the children-or you were basically left to bankroll the place. One was the carer and the other was the cash cow. You can see how that would be unsatisfactory for many, because the relationship had been so much more before the marriage came to the point where it needed to be dissolved. There was a fantastic body of work done by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. It produced a report entitled Every picture tells a story. I pay tribute to Kay Hull and the team on that committee who worked through the difficult, emotional and at times traumatic task of trying to unpick so many individual experiences to try to find a better legal framework to support arrangements for children after a relationship dissolves. What was interesting was that, at the end of that work, some of the tools were legislative or legal. But there was an insight that that on its own is not enough. The work of that committee brought forward the creation of the family relationship centres. This was a change in the toolkit which helped to create some prospect that people would get help at a difficult time to work through questions about who would give primary care, what the shape of the care would be or how the financial needs of the children would be met. That was a terrific body of work, but there were also some legislative changes sitting alongside the provision of resources for the community and families to use in those sorts of situation. I want to pay particular tribute to the Family Relationship Centre in Frankston for its remarkable work and the recent report it published showing that it is making a very real difference in the lives of people facing a very traumatic stage in their life and in their children's lives. I salute all the people involved in that area. Helen Constas and her team and the committed professionals and volunteers at the Peninsula Community Legal Centre are also part of the picture in providing help for people to understand the legal framework so they can mediate and negotiate and explore possibilities. Not far from Frankston Station there is a little place where courageous people make sure access arrangements and time with children can be facilitated, observed and even supervisedto make sure that violence does not play out. That service is a very important and overworked service. So there was a broad toolkit of support in addition to the law, but there was also an acknowledgement that we had not quite got this right and that we needed to revisit our care approach. So a number of reviews were part of that package of measures, and those significant 2006 reforms to the law and to some of the infrastructure that sits around it were partly what fed the discussion today. What we are talking about is: can we improve that system? The government has come forward with what they think might be ways of improving it. I am very interested in those opportunities for improvement, because I am not convinced that we have it precisely right. But I am also not entirely optimistic that we will ever get it right, because it does require participants to take some responsibility for their own actions and the well-being of the children they have brought into this world-and how you get that message across is a difficult problem. One of the key elements was this idea of a presumption of equally shared parental responsibility. The idea there was not that someone would come to a discussion about future care arrangements with a right or entitlement to share the care as a card that they could play in the argy-bargy that took place as these arrangements were being sorted out. What it aimed to say was that a parent-mother or father-can make a meaningful contribution to the raising of children. Just as we value and make sure that people make financial contributions to the raising of children, surely parental care, support and nurturing should be part of that contribution-a rounded contribution that is in the best interests of the children. That was one of the presumptions made. To many it overcame that point that I was making the earlier about the 'winner takes it all' attitude that made some of these family law processes incredibly combative. That approach set it up so that, where there was a contest-not in every case-the outcome for care arrangements was black or white, not shades of grey. The new presumption meant that the court was asked to consider how care arrangements could be best set up where parents had an equal commitment to the best interests of the child. A series of checklists was brought forward to work through that. The well-being of the child remained at the pinnacle of those considerations, but there were a range of other considerations that could be brought in. At the heart of these was the objective of ensuring the child maintained a meaningful relationship with both parents, although not at the expense of protecting the child from harm. But there are examples which show that that idea, and the legal framework which supported it, has not always been well implemented. I am always cautious about junking a legal provision, because the problem may be that it is being exercised poorly rather than that it has been poorly framed. All the reports that have been done-whether it is the Chisholm review, whether it is the Family Law Council report, whether it is the report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies-have again and again identified the need for training and professional development to be improved; the need to build knowledge and capacity to make sure that legal provisions are properly exercised and implemented; the need to deal with what may be argued is a misunderstanding about the primacy of the protection of children and the subsidiary nature of other considerations. I am not convinced that the law needs to be changed in the way proposed in the bill. My reading of the law and my consideration of the reviews into it suggest that there may be some misunderstanding or confusion, but I am not sure that that resides within the itself. I think there is a considerable opportunity to build, amongst the professionals who are involved in the process, awareness and knowledge of its implementation and the use of evidence and information to inform better decisions. That process is always guided by the best interests of the child but takes into account other legitimate considerations, with the ambition of optimising the contribution of both parents, not just financially but also in terms of their love, care and support. Family law is an area where concerns about violence and child abuse have often emerged. Family violence is abhorrent. It is completely unacceptable in our community, and it is particularly unacceptable at a time of family adjustment and transition such as during the dissolution or discontinuation of a relationship. The dissolution of a relationship may be a consequence of abuse and violence, and of course that must be taken into account and be a key consideration in the prime objective, which is the well-being of the child. That has to be there, and the machinery is there to take that into account. There are the arguments about how well we go about reporting family violence. There are also arguments-and I have seen this in cases brought to me by advocates-about how effectively family violence is considered in individual cases. That consideration has to be there and it has to be objective, based on reason and with the capacity to validate someone's concerns. If not, those concerns emerge as a tactical argument; as a positioning proposition; as a card to be played, because it is seen to be advantageous, by one party in what may already be a combative dispute over the future care arrangements for children. Those cards should be played where it is valid and reasonable to do so. If the reporting framework for family violence and abuse is law inadequate to provide for that card to be a verifiable assertion, rather than an assertion that cannot be backed up or is contested by others with an understanding of the family circumstance, then you need to consider carefully how much weight you give that card. This bill does not seek to strengthen reasonable concern about violence and threats to the child or the parent as a fundamental consideration in the well-being of the child and the family unit; rather, it seeks to redefine it in a way that I fear is unsafe. The coalition's amendments to this bill reasonable. I urge the government to take account of them, realising that it is not always the law but may be the way- (Time expired)",64
44,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Family violence is an issue I desire to help address during my term as the member for Robertson, because family violence impacts on so many families-way too many families-in my own electorate and, indeed, across the entire nation. As we in this country move forward to addressing this critical issue, I see this legislation as an important element in increasing the safety, health and well-being of families. Nothing affects the fabric of that most vital unit in society-the family-more than instances of domestic violence. This government and preceding Australian governments need to be commended for the public awareness campaigns that have been enacted on domestic violence. Nobody could deny that many Australians still remember the Violence Against Women-Australia Says No advertisements. That campaign was the beginning of a public discussion about what, sadly, was a dirty little family secret for too many years in too many families. Those advertisements did raise in the public consciousness a sense that domestic violence is completely socially unacceptable. But, despite the effectiveness of these campaigns in raising awareness, raising awareness is not always enough to change behaviour. Sadly, violence within families continues to be a significant issue for the Australian community. Regrettably, in my electorate of Robertson we are not immune from family violence issues-a significant problem does exist. are Information about domestic violence is communicated to me by passionate community workers, and I am particularly mindful of a recent visit to a women's refuge in my area during which I saw women and children who had fled, in the most difficult circumstances, from fear and long periods of suffering. Information about domestic violence has also been communicated to me by men in my community, who have spoken particularly of the psychological harm that some of them have come to through long periods of acrimony. It has also been communicated clearly to me by people working in the law, who often provide counselling as well as legal advice to people in critically dangerous situations. I am aware of the good work of all these people in engaging with the issue and practically supporting people who need assistance. I am particularly mindful of the work that the legal profession does to bridge the gaps in areas that social services are sometimes unable to bridge. It is clear to me that much more work needs to be done in order to address the issue of domestic violence. I am pleased that this parliament is being proactive in this area. A critical way to be effective is to reform family law to ensure that family violence is addressed through the law and that the safety of children is prioritised. This bill follows from the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006 enacted by the previous government. The shared responsibility amendments represented a progressive law reform that satisfied the notion that children benefit from being raised by both parents wherever that is practical. Indeed, the development of family relationships centres has had an immense and positive impact on the Central Coast. This is an area where I sincerely believe that the previous government deserves credit. Yet, despite the developments of recent years, the effect on children from violence in the home and within families remains a grave concern. In my view, family violence issues are inadequately addressed by the Family Law Act in its current form. I believe that this is one means through which these concerns can be addressed. I say this because the issues of family violence against children and domestic violence will not be solved by one piece of legislation alone. Rather, it requires a long-standing commitment by governments on both sides of the political divide to change any remaining cultural sentiments about such violence being acceptable and to put in place instruments that help us progress to better outcomes for all young Australians and their families. The aim of this bill is to ensure that the safety of children is a priority when parenting matters are determined under the Family Law Act 1975. It remains an ideal for parenting responsibilities to be shared between both parents in the event of a relationship break-up. This bill, however, ensures that the Family Law Act better emphasises that the safety of children must always be the first priority when determining such parenting matters. This bill also aims to send a loud and clear message that all forms of family violence and child abuse are unacceptable. One of the key means in which this act achieves this is by changing and expanding the definitions of abuse and family violence to ones that are more appropriate for the purpose of the Family Law Act. The definitions contained in this bill are much more clear and comprehensive. They provide a far more appropriate standard of what should be considered by the courts to be abuse and family violence. As a former high school teacher, I understand that a stable childhood, free of abuse and family violence, is essential in ensuring children reach their potential. As many of my colleagues in the teaching profession across this nation would acknowledge, schools are the sites at which a lot of the trauma of family violence is discovered. The reporting conditions that bill demand teachers to link people into the kind of care that they need is a big advance from the time. I started in that profession. While I am aware that there are inspiring exceptions of remarkably resilient young children who do survive this, and I do not want to increase the sense of victimhood that can sometimes gather around this issue, we do know that there are long-lasting impacts on children who are affected by abuse and family violence, and the outcomes can indeed be tragic. Our understanding of the types of abuse, including our understanding of mental health and well-being, has led to a much more robust definition of what abuse is. The definition of abuse in this bill includes causing a child serious psychological harm by subjecting or exposing the child to family violence. This definition also includes the serious neglect of a child. These two definitions of abuse are not currently included in the Family Law Act, yet I think that Australians absolutely concur with that definition. I am sure that nobody would deny that the definition contained in this bill constitutes what a reasonable person in the street would consider to be family violence. The current definition of family violence in the Family Law Act is only one sentence and it concerns violent actions towards a person that causes another family member to be reasonably concerned about their safety. I genuinely believe that the definition proposed in this bill is a far more comprehensive and appropriate one that captures the sorts of situations we hear about in our community and enables better resolution in the interests of children. The definition includes a list of instances that constitute family violence. This list is not exhaustive and it is not intended to restrict the court-and that is a critical issue that needs to be on the record. It does, however, ensure that the definition of family violence is wider and includes a variety of activities that are not considered to be physical violence. One category in this list is: … unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support … Sadly, I have met a woman who was a victim of this kind of neglect and control by a partner who kept her on $10 a week. It is an impossible situation. I firmly believe that denying a family member financial support, denying a family member their liberty or preventing a family member from maintaining connections with their family and culture are all actions that clearly constitute family violence and demonstrate a lack of understanding and acceptance of the core provisions of our democracy-that is, equality and freedom. I am proud to be a member of a government that firmly recognises that this needs to be developed. Family law has long been a difficult area of law because of the need to deal with sensitive issues and balance competing interests which directly affect families. All situations involving family law are unique; you cannot have a one-size-fits-all solution. There is, however, one principle that I will always support and which I believe is expressed in this bill: a care for the future health, safety and well-being of children. That must always be the most important priority of family law in matters involving children. This bill strengthens the obligation of family law advisers to prioritise the safety of children. This is an important amendment because, whilst the role of an adviser, such as a legal practitioner, is to get the best outcome for their client, this must not occur at the expense of the safety of children in family law matters. Under this legislation, advisers in family law matters are obliged to inform and encourage their clients to act in the best interests of their child. This includes the requirement that the adviser must inform the person that they should regard the a time interests of the child as a paramount consideration. Additionally, the adviser must inform the person that the child's best interests are met when the child is protected from physical and psychological harm. Advisers themselves have no power to compel a client to act in a particular way, yet legal advisers should definitely be obliged to discuss these matters with their clients, even if it is an incidental discussion on these issues when providing advice can lead to a more positive outcome for children and young people. I have a deep respect for people who work in family law and in organisations that aim to assist families. These include solicitors and their staff, family relationship counsellors, mediators and family law consultants and workers in refuges. All of the people who work with those who are vulnerable play a part, but I am particularly mindful of people who work in the family law courts. These occupations are difficult because lawyers and their staff are dealing with people who are often aggrieved about a particular situation involving their family. Recently, an event took place in my electorate concerning an innovative program regarding domestic violence. This program is called the Integrated Domestic and Family Violence Service, which is a partnership between the New South Wales Police, local government and various community organisations. The aim of the program is to provide an integrated response to issues concerning domestic and family violence and to ensure that cases are managed in a manner that provides parties with support when dealing with family violence. This includes providing families with support to navigate themselves through the services designed to assist them to recover, and often people lack the agency to negotiate that territory without support during times of crisis, particularly in a context of acrimony or if they have suffered the loss of self-esteem that follows being subjected to psychological and physical harm. It often takes a long time to recover from domestic violence, and this is even more complicated for families when children are involved. Often people find it difficult to get the help they needed, and the time period following a traumatic event is one of high risk. It is in this period when support is often lacking that the Integrated Domestic and Family Violence Service will attempt to coordinate support. These innovative programs require a strong and appropriate Commonwealth family law framework in order to be effective. On the Central Coast, the Central Coast Community Legal Centre plays a vital role in providing family law advice to people who would otherwise have difficulty accessing it. The legal centre broadly supports the bill and the submission made to the Senate inquiry by the Women's Legal Service. I await the findings of the Senate inquiry as to any changes that may be made to this bill. I am very proud of the Australian Family Law Act, which provides for a comprehensive and progressive system of family law. I am also proud of the progressive amendments to the Family Law Act, which have provided appropriate reform and have ensured that legal issues that have arisen have been addressed. Whilst the integrative solution is fundamental as a response to family violence, the role of family law legislation is to prevent it. Of course, this government, despite the utmost desire, sadly cannot prevent all domestic and family violence. Despite this, as a parliament we can better ensure that the safety and well-being of children is of the utmost importance when parenting decisions are made. As a parliament, we can better ensure that safer parenting arrangements for children are promoted when there are child abuse and family violence concerns. If we believe that the will of the Australian people, as expressed in this parliament, is to prevent to the best of our ability domestic and family violence, then we will support this legislation and enable it to be enacted into law. I commend the bill to the House.",68
45,Mr SIMPKINS,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to make some comments today on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. As members of parliament, when we meet with our constituents it is rare that we meet people who are in a more tense, difficult or even extreme situation emotionally than those who come to speak to us about problems with broken marriages and relationships, particularly where that impacts upon relationships with children from the marriage or relationship. Also, the media reminds us, too frequently, that there are occasions where kidnapping and violence towards children are linked to relationship breakdowns. We all cannot imagine why anyone would choose to harm a child as a result of these sorts of breakdowns within families relationships. For us, this means that we must legislate and examine every opportunity for reform so that parents and couples have options for the best support and so that levels of enmity and stress can never be factors in the fate of children. That is why in 2005 and 2006 I applauded the changes that the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, introduced into this place under the Family Law Amendment (Shared Responsibility) Bill 2005. In that legislation the first 15 family relationship centres were provided for, including the one that operates in Joondalup, not far north of Cowan. The legislation also provided for 50 new services, including 33 early intervention services, which commenced delivering effective relationship services for families. These were the centrepiece of the $397 million family law reform package designed to address the reality that one million children had a parent living elsewhere than with them and that one in four of the children in separated families saw their non-resident parent once a year or not at all. In 2006, 51,375 divorces were granted, according to ABS figures. In 2007, there was a big drop down to 47,963. I believe that is the biggest drop in recent history. In the concern to reduce the adversarial nature of divorce proceedings, particularly where they involve child custody, family support services were set up nationwide to provide dispute resolution services before divorce cases go to court. These services were set up as not just an entry point to the family law system but to provide case assessments, referrals and practical assistance to parents and also guidance and assistance before there were significant problems in relationships. The initiative, as I said, commenced with 15 family relationship centres and 33 early intervention services, including men and and family relationship services, family relationship counselling, family relationship education and skills training services and specialised family violence services. There were also post-separation services, including four services under the Contact Orders Program, seven children's contact services and six family dispute resolution services. As I said before, the family relationship centres were designed to assist families in strengthening their relationships, providing Parental support and assistance to people in all stages of relationships, including marriage, parenting and the difficult times around separation. It was said at the time that these centres and the initiatives overall were designed to assist families throughout their relationships and not just to assist them through separation and divorce. Certainly I have met many people who have been assisted in achieving workable parenting arrangements through these initiatives, which have helped parents maintain contact with their children. As the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, said at the time of these changes, the changes: … reflected the Government's determination to ensure the right of children to grow up with the love and support of both of their parents…. We want to help parents sit down with each other and talk about what is best for their children, rather than immediately entering into the adversarial legal system. However, today I wish to direct my remarks toward this bill, the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I of course welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate, because I am committed to an outcome of better and more functional legislation to assist my constituents in these family law matters. Yet I would say that there are parts of this bill that are a step backwards and not the step forward we should always be looking for. To begin, I would question the need to insert the new subsection to section 60CC of the Family Law Act. Already section 60B lays out the best interests of the child and, conjunction with section 60CA, clearly demonstrates interpretation of the best interests of the child. What the government seeks to do here is to insert a series of subjective examples of behaviour into the Family Law Act. I do not see the justification of trying to prescribe details for multiple circumstances, when the paramountcy of the best interests of the child is already enshrined in the existing legislation. With regard to identification, inquiry and reporting on family violence and child abuse, what I would say is that across this nation we are used to seeing stories of children at risk. The risk can be the risk of violence, the risk of neglect, abuse or sexual abuse. In our streets, in our suburbs, in our towns and in our communities there are children at risk right now. There are children who are being abused, and that is a reality. What is also true, certainly in my view, is that anyone and everyone who is aware or who suspects that children are at risk are duty bound to take action. It is not right that we sit back and merely say, 'There is an agency that is responsible for that.' I reject as well ideas such as, 'The court can decide that, so I do not need to be involved.' These are wrong. It is without doubt the responsibility and the duty of any adult to do what needs to be done to ensure the safety of children in these circumstances. That being said, there is still requirement for an examination of how legislation can achieve improvements to identifying and responding to pertinent safety concerns. It is right that child welfare agencies, children's lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors will have their participation and accountability improved by this bill. I am therefore happy that this is part of this bill. What I am very unhappy about is the in proposed changes regarding false allegations of abuse and violence. Under the Ruddock reforms, section 117AB of the act provided for mandatory cost orders where a party knowingly made a false allegation or statement in the proceedings. This very important reform was introduced by the Howard government and it was greatly welcomed by the people of Australia, particularly if they were affected by court matters where false accusations were made as a bargaining point. To me this change is not a good one, but it shows the great Labor traditions where individual responsibility and accountability are discouraged. If you look at this sort of situation carefully, it is very clear what should happen. The scenario is this: a person makes an allegation that one of the parents or a former partner has abused the children. Sometimes these are allegations of the worse kind, and I mean, of course, child sexual assault. That allegation must be investigated and, if proven, there should be a lengthy custodial sentence for the person responsible. However, if the allegation is not proven, then consideration should be given to perjury charges or defamation charges against the person who made the allegation originally. It is one or the other, child molester or liar, and there should be accountability for the guilty, based on the proof of such offences. a Obviously these matters need to be proved, and among the proofs is the concept of intent. That being said, this was not the way that was chosen, but instead a determination of court costs was made for those who were found to have made vexatious allegations. This is clearly covered in the stringent requirements of section 117AB, where it applies only if a person has knowingly given false evidence. But instead this legislation will once again take the requirement to prove allegations away. This is a terrible error that will need to be fixed by us when we return to government unless it can be amended today. I think that what is proposed here represents a trampling of the rights of one party and it will potentially damage the relationship between children and one of their parents. I also take this opportunity to express my concern with the repeal of the friendly parent provision. I believe that, when you examine the provisions of section 60CC, you will see that they provide for courts to determine the interests of the child in such family law matters. It is my view that it is all there in section 60CC(4). It has been said that the reason this particular amendment has been brought forward is that the existing provisions discouraged the reporting of violence, but there was in fact no statistical suggest that this was the case. Although the Chisholm report made that assertion, the Family Law Council described that criticism as not much more than gossip. I would also say that the criminal justice system, and in some ways the whole justice system, is the focus of many complaints in my door knocking. Ultimately the view of so many of my constituents is that judges and magistrates do not reflect community standards or expectations. I suppose that, if you are used to being pretty much god in a courtroom for many years and you only live in the best suburbs, the workings of the real world for the majority of law-abiding Australians are something that happens at a great distance from your personal reality. Perhaps those who are so often described as learned need to be a little more experienced with the outer suburbs of our cities. The trouble with the amendments in the bill that the government is bringing forward is that they seek to unwisely unwind the objectives of the 2006 reforms. It was certainly the case that those reforms helped to build strong healthy relationships, prevent separation and encourage greater involvement by both parents in their children's lives after separation, whilst also protecting children from violence and abuse. They were there to help separated parents agree on what is best for their children rather than litigating, through the provision of useful information, advice and effective dispute resolution services, and also to establish a highly visible entry point to other services and to help families to access those other services. I think that when you look at the figures on the reductions in divorces immediately following the 2006 reforms, despite what others may say, there is certainly an indication that there was great value in what was achieved by the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Phillip Ruddock, information to and the government. I will conclude by saying that I have every confidence in the reforms of 2006. I cannot help but feel the attacks on these reforms are based on an ideology detached from the realities of real Australia, out in the suburbs where most Australians live. The changes to the friendly parent provisions and, most unhelpful of all, the changes to the cost order provisions represent a decision by the government to accept the ideology and not look at these matters in a balanced way. A lot of people in this country will come to regret this matter if we cannot achieve a better result when the coalition's amendments come to be voted upon. What the government should do is listen to reason and not ideology.",71
46,Mr HAYES,BILLS," Unlike those opposite, I rise to support the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This is an issue that involves all Australians and one that should be addressed well ahead of politics. Children are the future of this nation and they are our most vulnerable asset. I say that as a person who has three children and is now very proudly the grandfather of another five. Children deserve to have the opportunity to grow up in a happy and loving home. They deserve to be able to feel safe and it is unfathomable that there are children who do not enjoy these basic rights. Some are subject to abuse and very often witness a parent being the victim of violence. These acts are intolerable and it is the responsibility of government and of the whole community to intervene to protect those who are vulnerable. This is not the time to be considering legal loopholes, as the previous speaker was suggesting to us; this is the time to ensure that we put the rights of children first. This government is devoted to protecting and enforcing the rights of minors in a way that mirrors the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In 2006 the government received a number of reports regarding the family law reforms. These included Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Professor Richard Chisholm's Family courts violence review, and the Family Law Council's Improving responses to family violence in the family law system: an advice on the interaction of family violence and family law issues. Each of these reports examined how the current family law framework addressed family violence based issues. These reports indicated that the system that was currently in place needed to do more to protect the welfare of those who have experienced, or are at risk of experiencing, abuse and violence. The Australian Institute of Family Studies reported that two-thirds of separated mothers and half of separated fathers have experienced emotional or physical abuse by their partner. Given the fact that presently in this country there is one divorce for every three marriages, if you apply that statistic to this arrangement, this is of great concern. We are just talking about marriages and not about partnerships. This is a major issue for us when you consider that one in five separated parents have an ongoing contact with their ex-spouse and have indicated a number of safety concerns. In all that we have to put the issues to do with the child first. As the Family Law Council states, victims of family violence have a higher chance of being treated for psychiatric problems. The council reports that there is an increasing prevalence of attempted suicide, alcohol abuse and homelessness. The government believes that a child has the right to have access to a relationship with both parents. When parents can cooperate, particularly if they live close to each other, shared parenting responsibilities have been shown to be effective. I get to see that with my own family. Regrettably, my younger son's relationship terminated and his daughter, Kiarni, has been at the middle of all that. It is fortunate that both parents have been able to work something out constructively whereby my granddaughter does not miss out on the love and attention of both parents and, indeed, of the grandparents. This is a thing that we need to try to achieve. This is every child's right. Health and welfare within the family unit is of the utmost importance and the safety of children is, in my opinion, paramount. With this in mind, this amendment will allow the family law system to appropriately respond when issues of child abuse or domestic violence arise. It will further strengthen the role of the Family Court. Specifically, the change will prioritise the safety of the child and strengthen the adviser obligations. In addition, it will allow the Family Court access to a greater range of evidence related to abuse and family violence. This part is critical: the additional evidence is to ensure that safe parenting arrangements are made and enforceable. Commonwealth, state and territory child protection authorities will now play a greater role in the judicial process and they will actively participate in family law proceedings when requested. The bill will also change the definition of 'family violence' and 'abuse'. The purpose is simple: it is necessary to ensure that we capture the exact meaning of harmful behaviour. We need to guarantee there is no confusion about the behaviour that society says it will not tolerate. As recommended by the Australian and New South Wales law reform commissions, family violence definition encapsulates assault, sexual stalking, emotional as well as psychological and economic abuse. Within that framework, abuse in relation to a child now extends to include severe psychological harm that results from exposure to violence and neglect. To improve the effectiveness of this system and to correct the anomalies, the bill also makes some technical amendments to the Family Law Act and the Bankruptcy Act 1996. Earlier this year the government released the proposed changes in a report for public scrutiny. The response was overwhelming and very much positive, in support of the changes which are being proposed. The reason why that has occurred is that people understand that we do need to show that domestic violence and child abuse will not be tolerated. That should not be something that occurs in Australian homes, and wenot necessarily government-as community leaders in a modern society should all pledge to work to stamp it out. For that reason this issue is so important. The amendments being proposed by the opposition, given my reading of them, in effect water down, not strengthen, what is in the legislation. The opposition proposes that a definition of violence be removed from subjectivity and it wants to repeal the mandatory cost order provisions of the bill. It wants to do this against the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission, numerous government reports-which I have already mentionedand the Family courts violence review. This is not some form of political game. We do not come here to put a piece of amendment legislation through just because it needs reviewing. There is a need for this. In my electorate I sponsored a student from the ANU, under the intern program, to produce a report for me on domestic violence in the south-west of Sydney. Many of the assault, things that this piece of legislation is intended to deal with were actually discovered by Ms Zara Maxwell-Smith in her report, which I will endeavour to table in this parliament in due course. I think it is a credit to the ANU that this program exists. It is also something that I could actually target to ensure that we did have constructive and contemporary analysis occurring in the south-west of Sydney in respect of abuse and domestic violence and its impact on our community. One cannot believe that protecting child victims and other victims of family violence should meet with anything other than bipartisan support. This is not a time for playing political games and arguing about the position of authorities on this. I would have thought that it would be noted that what has been tabled so far, given the support for each of the law reform commission reports that have been tabled as well as the Family courts violence review, are there because there is an issue at law. They are there because those bodies believe that children deserve move, that they deserve greater protection in this respect. So I think we need to show, as parliamentarians, our best endeavours to get the right outcomes for children. This is not necessarily going to be palatable to every defence lawyer out there, and I will let them paddle their own canoe in that respect, but I will stand up and talk about what is good for children. You do not need to be a leading social scientist to work out that there is certainly a link between poor development outcomes and children who have been exposed to family violence, although I do know that there is an abundance of research around in that respect. I represent a low socio-economic area in Sydney, and what is being proposed here is very real. I know that in my electorate and in the surrounding electorates issues of domestic and family violence remain high. Despite all the good work that police are doing in reducing other crime indicators around the place, everything that I get to see shows that domestic violence and family violence remain stubbornly high. The product of those abuses does impact on a child's development, and they then take that into their maturity. This is not something that we can sit down and pretend to be lawyers about and show all the niceties of black-letter law. This is something that we want to get right, because our motivation in doing that is to do the right problem'. thing to protect the rights and the future of children. We need to ensure that we are talking about this not only in this chamber but also in our electorates. As I say, I have looked at the various statistics in my electorate and they are something that I am not proud of and I am determined to do something about. When I was first elected as the member for Fowler, I identified the issues of domestic violence and family violence as something I wanted to draw greater attention to. I do not want to point the finger at people and say, 'That's really a state policing matter,' or a matter for the Family Court or for somebody else. This is something for our community. What is being proposed here is to give a greater opportunity for the authorities and for the Family Court to do something, in a significant endeavour to give children a better outcome in life. It is for that reason that I support the bill. I certainly oppose the position taken by the opposition on it. I encourage them to rethink their position and not simply propose amendments for the sake of it. I encourage them to refocus their attention on what is right for the development of young people in our society.",75
47,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS," I very much respect the member for Werriwa and would normally applaud much of what he has to say. The only matter about which I want to comment positively in relation to his remarks is the importance of children-the importance of ensuring that children are safe and secure but also ensuring that children's broader rights are also recognised. It is a question of balance. I am afraid that some comments that my leader made relevant to another issue are about to be equally relevant here. My leader said recently in relation to unauthorised boat arrivals that 'John Howard identified a problem and found a solution and Labor found a solution and has created a The Family Law Act has always been a very delicate issue. From the clients that I had to deal with when I was a young solicitor I know sometimes how entrenched certain points of view are and how determined people are to get even with their partner sometimes, whom they see has in some way let them down. I have seen the situation where, often, children are pawns as these frustrations work their way through. Some of my colleagues in this parliament previously found complaints about family law issues occupying an enormous amount of their time, as people came to their local member of parliament to talk about issues relating to the difficulties in getting support, as some people found that the outcome that had been determined in relation to children was not to their liking and they would not support them. They found that people were very unhappy about the courts and unhappy about delays, and there seemed to be little effort to try to resolve issues before they came to court. Even my own profession sometimes could be engaged in these issues in ways which I consider quite unsatisfactory. Some lawyers are very happy to be able to fight every issue for you to your last dollar. One group of lawyers for whom I came to develop a very high regard were those who were described as 'collaborative' practitioners. They were saying, 'We are prepared to work your issues through with a practitioner who sees things in a like way to obtain a solution, and if we can't find it and you still want to fight, then you might have to find another lawyer.' I must say that collaborative lawyers are under a lot of pressure sometimes from those who see it differently. I often experienced it myself 40 years ago with practitioners who, if you wanted to work things through in a collaborative way, would simply roll over you at every point. My colleagues found this and they were frustrated by it. The Every picture tells a story report was written by members of parliament from both sides and, as a result of the deliberation of the report and the consideration of it by the parliament and the former government, certain steps were taken. I think it is important in this debate to understand the fundamental principle that was involved because, I must say, it drove me as I drove these reforms. That is that these reforms should be not about the parents but about the children. I am sure that in this debate everybody is talking about the children, but sometimes it is put only from one perspective. Sometimes, when they put it as being from one perspective, they ignore the fact that that perspective was included in the legislative reforms. There were two principal instructions to those who were going to deal with these issues were to have regard to the rights of children. One was their right to be safe and secure. The legislation was never about ignoring family violence, but it was about recognising another right that I am not hearing mentioned by my colleagues, and that is the right of a child, provided they are safe, to know both of their parents. I have found over a long period any number of people who, because of the way in which these disputes have been worked through by parents, have denied a child the right to know the other parent because they felt so strongly about the way in which they have been disappointed and who are aggrieved that they have never had the opportunity to know that parent. You think about it and the importance of it: provided the children are safe and secure they should be able to know both their father and their mother. And if role models have anything to do with future upbringing, isn't it important, because it is often the father who is denied any contact, that there be a male role model, particularly for young boys, in relation to their upbringing? Isn't that important? If you can do it, shouldn't that be the principle that is guiding you? Where I think this government is creating a problem for itself in the future with regard to this legislation is that it will get these matters back into the courts as a matter of priority. Some of the legislation that we put before the former parliament was designed to deal with issues relating to the way in which legal proceedings are conducted. But our principal objective was, where we could, to get matters out of the courts. Before people even started their contest, there was an effort to try to work these things through collaboratively. And we did it very deliberately. We funded family relationship centres right around Australia. Before you could even start to litigate in relation to children, you had to have made some effort to try to resolve those issues. Not every issue will be resolved; not every child will be safe. There are situations in which abuse occurs where children may be subjected to violence but, as I said earlier, regard always has to be had to that. Where you can work it through and where a child has a continuing relationship with a parent, it is so much more positive and so much better. To me, one of the most disappointing aspects of recent funding decisions by the government and the very clear signal that they are sending about where they expect this matter to go is that funding for family relationship centres and their activities will be reduced and legal aid funding for family disputes will be increased. That is against an expectation, I suspect, that the government believe there will be increased litigation. Why else would they be doing it? It seems to me that this legislation that we are discussing is very significant for the Australian people. I do not think that the reforms which were introduced in 2006 ought be unnecessarily undone without very clear and objective information that suggests that we have been going in the wrong direction. My understanding is that the amount of litigation we have seen in relation to family disputes has declined. Why would you want to change that? Why would you want to reintroduce provisions that would enable people to make allegations which are proven later to be incorrect, blatantly wrong, deliberately fabricated, designed to mislead even a court and where there is no capacity",77
48,Mr Billson,BILLS,No consequences.,79
49,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS,"no consequences, as my colleague says, to deal with it. Yet this legislation is about stripping that away. This legislation is about changing the way in which issues relating to violence that may impact upon children are seen. It is about broadening their definition, widening the range of claims that can be made and giving people many more issues which they can dispute. I have a great deal of trust in our legal system. I have met a lot of judges of the Family Court; I know they come with the very best of intentions to work these things through. We have a magistracy that has been playing that positive role. I do not believe any court would have come to a view whereby they would not have taken into account these issues properly before them, that are going to impact upon a child detrimentally, under the regime that was in place. My view about those matters is that we need to have very clearly in our minds the point I made that children's interests are not only in being safe. It is a prerequisite that they should be, but to be denied some contact with your mother or your father because somebody is about wanting, essentially, to punish a person whom they have been in a loving relationship with but now feel aggrieved by is the worse possible outcome. We have seen children removed from one part of the world to another in order that the other parent has no continuing contact. We see people wanting to move great distances from where they have lived, ostensibly on the basis of being closer to other family members, which deprives a former partner of any relationship. I know that these are difficult issues to deal with, but my view has been that the measures that we put in place got the balance right. In my judgment the changes that the government is proposing will shift that balance in a way which I regard as being most unsatisfactory. We are proposing that in relation to the broadened definition of family violence there needs to be some caution. We are concerned at the repeal of the friendly parent provisions. We are concerned at the stripping away of the courts; the capacity in terms of costs to deal with false allegations of abuse and violence is being taken away. For that reason, we will be moving amendments. There will be divisions on them and we will seek to ensure, by referring this legislation for review by a parliamentary committee, that there are not other unforeseen consequences. We do this, very deliberately, to help the government, to ensure that they do not move forward on this matter and create a problem for themselves and the nation by pursuing measures without a proper need and at a time when the measures that the Howard government implemented appear to have been achieving a very important objective.",79
50,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The member for Berowra has been in parliament for close to 40 years and I have been here for only four years but, with respect, he is simply wrong on issue after issue. Before I was elected to this place I was a family law specialist from 1996. I practised for nearly a quarter of a century in that jurisdiction, the Magistrates Court in suburban Brisbane and other places to the High Court of Australia, where I have done cases involving family law from the most complex property settlements, to Hague convention cases, to the most egregious claims that have ever been made in relation to family violence and child abuse, to the most difficult cases involving relocation. Some of the cases I have done were reported in the Full Court of the Family Court Cases; cases involving parenting orders on an interim basis-cases like the Cowling case, which set the law for this type of matter. So I come with some experience on this issue, and the member for Berowra is simply wrong on issue after issue-a man of straw on numerous occasions. This is about creating a safer and fairer family law system and prioritising the needs of children. More than 400 submissions were received in relation to that, and 73 per cent expressed support for the measures. This is an indication of strong community support in relation to this matter. The safety of children is prioritised, with clarification of the meaning of domestic violence issues; 'family violence' and 'abuse' are the terms in the legislation. It strengthens advisers' obligation, ensures the courts have better access to evidence and makes it easier for state and territory child protection authorities to participate-or 'intervene', as we used to call it-in relation to family law proceedings. There is no dispute between the two sides of politics about the fact that we need to provide for the protection and safety of children and that a child needs to have a meaningful relationship with both parentsthat is in the best interests of the child where it is safe for that to occur. It is important to recognise that the Family Law Act does state those things. Section 60CA says that the court, whether it be the from Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court, has to consider 'the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.' Section 60B in part VII sets out the objects of the division with respect to looking after children: ensuring children have proper and adequate parenting; making sure that parents fulfil their obligations and responsibilities to children; and making sure that children have contact with other people who are important to their care, welfare and development. When a court looks at these types of matters in section 60CC, the court looks at a hierarchy of considerations. We are changing the primary considerations to make sure, front and centre, that the need to protect child from abuse, neglect and family violence is the highest priority possible. We are elevating that where there is an inconsistency with the need to have a meaningful relationship with both parents. I cannot understand why those opposite do not see that as important. The friendly parent provision also, in my long experience in the Family Court, from time to time does dissuade people from making arrangements which are in the best interests of a child and forces parents at times to consent to orders which they do not believe are in the best interests of children, handing a child over to a circumstance where that child may be exposed to abuse, neglect and family violence. Violence and abuse are catalysts for family breakdowns and they can often continue afterwards. Violence or abuse is unacceptable wherever it occurs and certainly in relation to children. The long term damage as a result of family violence cannot be underestimated. Evaluation of the so-called reforms of 2006 has been undertaken. These things have been looked at. We have three reports, one by a very learned former judge, Professor Richard Chisholm AM, the Family courts violence review-I have spoken to Richard Chisholm about his report a number of times; I met him in Parliament House, actually, to talk about the issue; the Australian Institute of Family Studies' Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms; and the Family Law Council's Improving responses to family violence in the family law system. With respect to the member for Berowra, the Howard government did get it wrong with many of the changes. Without social research, and with a knee-jerk reaction to a minority of men's rights groups, they responded in the way they did, fettering judicial discretion and creating a legislative pathway with respect to shared parentingthe and I have personal views on those issues. As a result of their changes a culture of expectation developed that it was worthwhile for children to continue regular contact with a parent, even if it meant exposing that child to abuse, neglect and family violence. Any lawyer who practised regularly in this jurisdiction would know that that was the case. Time and again, parents felt compelled to agree to contact arrangements for fear of running foul of the 'friendly parent provision' imposed by the 2006 changes. The task confronting any court when allegations of family violence or abuse are made is daunting-even more so in the pressure cooker of an interim hearing, usually held shortly after separation, often without the benefit of a detailed affidavit or cross-examination and many times without a detailed welfare report indicating what the children's wishes are, what arrangements were undertaken before separation and what recommendations psychologists or social workers might have made. The ramifications of terminating all contact between a parent and child are many and long-term. It should only be done as a last resort. The balance needs to be struck in favour of protecting children, and that is where the previous legislation failed. It is restored by this legislation. Now, for the first time, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child compelling the court to consider the convention in deciding matters concerning children is included in the legislation. That is important in recognising the rights of children. It is not about the parents' rights; it is about the rights of the children. The bill elevates the consideration of protecting a child from abuse, neglect and family violence over the benefit of having a meaningful relationship with a parent where there is an inconsistency. The bill broadens the definition of family violence to what I think is in tune with community expectations. The member for Berowra would have us believe that it is only family violence if, indeed, it defined as family violence. In fact family violence, as people know, occurs in many ways. That includes not just physical assault but dominating, controlling behaviours; stalking; friendship isolation; familial isolation; emotional manipulation; financial abuse; harassment; and cultural isolation. We need to protect children from these types of activities. We need to protect spouses as well, if we can. Expanding the definition of abuse and family violence and imposing on court personnel and independent children's lawyers the obligation to report on child abuse to state and territory departments of child safety is a worthy thing. 'Abuse' should include serious psychological harm and exposure to family violence. The bill imposes on those involved in family disputes to make the protection of children the paramount consideration. Prioritising child protection is absolutely crucial. As I have said, the bill overcomes the reluctance of many parents and their lawyers to report family violence for the fear of being considered an 'unfriendly parent'. That provision is found in the relevant sections of the Family Law Act where a court will consider them. They are part of what I would call the 'additional considerations'. Often I have seen parents struggle with this provision. Lawyers, judges and federal magistrates also really wrestle with this provision. The 'friendly parent provision' is revoked by this bill, meaning children are primary less likely to run the risk of abuse, neglect and family violence. I believe the balance is back with this bill and, once again, the best interests of children are front and centre. Section 4 of the Family Law Act defines abuse to be: (a) an assault, including a sexual assault, of the child which is an offence under a law, written or unwritten, in force in the State or Territory in is which the act constituting the assault occurs; Another subsection further defines abuse of a child as: (b) a person involving the child in a sexual activity with that person or another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly, as a sexual object by the first-mentioned person or the other person, and where there is unequal power in the relationship between the child and the first mentioned person. I am sure that the average person in the community thinks that abuse is far more broad than that simple definition. The current legislation states: ""Family violence"" means conduct, whether actual or threatened, by a person towards, or towards the property of, a member of the person's family that causes that or any other member of the person's family reasonably to fear for, or reasonably to be apprehensive about, his or her personal well-being or safety. Again, this is a very narrow definition that really does not reflect community standards. Broadening the definitions will help judicial officers to consider behaviours, including patterns of behaviour, within the factual context of a case-not simply whether someone has hit them, punched them or engaged in a physical sexual assault or physical harm perpetrated by fists, a baseball bat or an implement of any description. Broadening the definition will allow a court to look at the pattern of behaviour and focuses the judge or federal magistrate on that. The Family Law Council and the Australian Law Reform Commission have both recommended the removal of the semiobjective test of family violence so that the decision maker-for example, the court or a family dispute resolution practitioneris required to consider the situation from perspective of the victim. This is not something new. It is what happens when you talk about domestic violence laws at a state level-in my state of Queensland they are domestic violence laws; in other states they are apprehended violence laws. They consider what is happening from the victim's perspective: does the victim feel that he or she-and it is 'he' more often than people think-has been subject to harassment, intimidation or domestic violence or abuse? More often than not, from the victim's perspective, they feel they have. Over many years of legal practice I have seen thousands of people-both men and women-in tears when they cannot point to a circumstance in which someone has physically assaulted them but yet feel they have been abused in other ways-like not being able to dress in the morning without the man putting the clothes out and determining they particular clothes they wore. One woman said, 'I was not allowed to shower except in his presence.' Things like that are family violence and abuse. No-one would think they were not. I have seen cases where one person stopped a woman of religious faith from going to church. She wanted to go to church. One partner may stop the other from engaging in cultural pursuits-if they came from, say, a Samoan background but could not go to any Samoan cultural events because they were really an Australian, according to the other person. I have seen dozens and dozens of cases like that. This is a terrible form of domestic violence. It is a form of stalking if there is repeated harassment by phone calls. Broadening the definition allows the court to have a better grasp of what is going on. I heard the member for Berowra talking about getting rid of the relevant sections that deal with mandatory costs orders for false allegations. Will the repeal of section 117AB the increase the number of false allegations? I think that is nonsense. There is strong support for the repeal of this from the legal profession and those who practise in family law. The courts have already considered, in the case of Claringbold and James in 2008, that section 117 is broad enough to deal with false statements, including false allegations and false denials. Indeed it is. Under section117(2A)(c), the court, in making a decision with respect to whether a cost order can be made, can look at the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in terms of their involvement in pleadings, discovery, particulars, inspections, answers to questions, admissions of fact, production of documents and similar matters. So it is broad enough already without section 117AB. This is a straw man put up by the member for Berowra-that is for sure. It is simply nonsense. Professor Richard Chisholm, in his report, Family courts violence review, recommends the repeal of section 117AB: … the law should try to encourage people to tell the truth without making, or appearing to make, any pre-judgment. The New South Wales Law Society is reported as saying that the very existence of section 117AB provides clear disincentive to parties making allegations. The Family Law Council and the family law section of the Law Council of Australia highlighted similar concerns. So what the member for Berowra says is simply nonsense. He does not understand the law. It has been over 40 years since he practised in the jurisdiction. He does not know how the law has moved on. His reforms of 2006 are not to be put in some gold plated bowl that says how wonderful they are. In fact they are wrong and should never have been done in the first place. (Time expired)",80
51,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The issues covered in this bill are of great personal interest to me but, more importantly, are of far greater concern to many members of my electorate of Bennelong. This is a topic that requires significant legislative improvement, as the current system has been shown time and again not to be fulfilling the objectives that were established by the law-makers who preceded us in this place. Firstly, I have concerns at what appears to be an illogical decision to have us debating and voting on a bill that has been referred to a Senate committee for inquiry. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has received over 200 submissions from individuals and community groups that have deep understandings of the issues involved. It strikes me as somewhat of an arrogant step by this government to bring on this debate before the Senate committee has reported back on its inquiry. Surely the use of all the information and tools available to us as legislators is more likely to result in the outcome. It is the outcomes that should be focused on in speaking on this bill today. This bill effects a change in the law to expand the definition of family violence and remove costs orders on complainants making intentionally false allegations of family violence. Currently, family violence is seen as 'violence that exerts a reasonable fear for family member's well-being or safety'. The new definition proposed under the amendment is much more subjective, adding 'violent, threatening or other behaviour that coerces or controls a member of the person's family or causes the family member to be fearful'. The examples added specifically include financial control, which may lead to unintended consequences where a child support payer makes application to the Child Support Agency or courts to reduce the level of child support payable. In such a circumstance, the payer is properly exercising their rights under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and yet would seem to be culpable of family violence under the new definition. This bill also seeks to remove the friendly parent provision, which currently requires family courts to consider the willingness of one parent towards facilitating the other to have a meaningful relationship with their child. The removal of this provision could lead to a situation where parents can effectively remove a previous partner from their life through the prevention of contact with their children. This would encourage parental alienation syndrome-the practice where one parent instigates and maintains conflict to harm a child's relationship with the other parent. The bill also proposes to remove mandatory costs orders where one party knowingly makes a false allegation or statement in the proceedings to gain a tactical advantage. Currently the court is able best to implement financial penalties as a disincentive to this course of action. This proposed change will encourage fabricated allegations of violence or abuse, hearsay and uncorroborated allegations. The logic of removing these court orders is that they act as a disincentive for the disclosure of family violence. However, according to the a Australian Institute of Family Studies, more than two thirds of respondents to a survey disagreed with the proposition that the prospect of an adverse cost order has discouraged allegations of violence or child abuse that are genuinely held and/or are likely to be true. Parents in conflict too often refer to their rights as parents and the rights they have to have access to their child. This is the wrong focus. The Family Court makes it clear that it is the right of the child to access to their parents. Breakdowns in relationships too often lead to a phase of adult war-logic and fairness are overridden by emotional issues. Inevitably, the child becomes the collateral damage.",84
52,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The member is granted leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Armenian Genocide,85
53,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This year, on 22 April, I attended with the member for Bennelong a function held by the Sydney Armenian community to mark the 96th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Today, as a member of this House, I join others in this place, and in parliaments around the world, to place on record that I believe the Armenian genocide was one of the greatest crimes against humanity. On 24 April 1915, as the ANZACs were preparing to go ashore at Gallipoli, nearby in Constantinople an attempt to eradicate the Armenian people began. At the end of the violence, which spread around the Ottoman empire, 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children had fallen victim to the genocide-a heinous act concealed under the cover of the war to end all wars. Four hundred ANZAC prisoners of war bore witness to the atrocities. Australian Flying Corps captain Thomas White, who was captured in central Mesopotamia, wrote in his memoir, 'Armenians had sold their lives dearly.' Many countries have condemned the 1915 genocide at the hands of the Ottoman government. We do not seek to lay blame, this is not an indictment of the modern, secular, Turkish state that we know as a friend, but it is important that we recognise have the Armenian genocide for what it was. This is one act we should never forget. Dare we allow it ever to be repeated. Victorian Government",85
54,Mr MITCHELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This morning I had the pleasure of meeting with representatives of the Australian Education Union, and I rise today to show my support for their fight against the 'Failyou' Baillieu Liberal government in Victoria. As members of this place are all too aware, the Baillieu Liberal government is a pretty hopeless government. It has been dishonest, sneaky and arrogant and has backflipped on its pre-election commitment to make Victorian teachers the highest paid in the country and on its commitment to the Victoria Police. The AEU has launched a campaign against the 'Failyou' government, and I urge everyone to get on board. The campaign is 'My School Needs', and it is a fantastic campaign. Some of the placards they have across schools read 'Buildings Not Backflips' and 'Budget Cuts Hurt Our Kids', but I know the members opposite do not really care about public education. One of my favourite parts of the campaign would have to be the formal notification to all coalition MPs that when visiting a school they must wear a red shirt. I look forward to seeing the Liberal member for Seymour, Cindy MCLeish, wearing a red shirt at BER openings at our local schools. I look forward to seeing the Minister for Education, Martin Dixon-most schools would look forward to actually meeting him too-wearing his red T-shirt when he visits public schools. I cannot wait to see Ted in red. As we have always said in Victoria, better red than Ted!",85
55,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I call on this parliament, and through it the government, to encourage the new Egyptian administration to foster religious and social tolerance its borders. Recently, sectarian violence has flared up in Egypt. There have been reports of attacks on Coptic Christians, with churches blown up and burned and followers killed and injured. According to media reports, at least 12 Christians have been murdered and hundreds more wounded. This violence must end. It would indeed be a cruel irony, if not a massive betrayal, if Egypt's administration were to be more repressive than the former Mubarak government. Copts are culturally and historically part of Egypt. The rights and freedoms of religious minorities must be defended. To Australians who practise religious tolerance towards other faiths, religious and discrimination is particularly galling. We would not tolerate ill-treatment of any minority group in this country and we expect others to do likewise; hence, my call to the government to object in the strongest possible terms to the new interim Egyptian authorities. Launceston City Council Heritage Awards",86
56,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to congratulate all of the winners in the recently announced Launceston City Council Heritage Awards. The council's Heritage Advisory Committee started the annual awards in 2008 to recognise people for sensitively restoring their heritage buildings. In a city such as Launceston, which has a rich heritage and many historic buildings, it is fantastic to see the preservation that is being recognised and rewarded. To that end, I praise and briefly mention each of the Egypt award winners: Robert Dusting, Janice Skiller, Kate and Alan Livermore, Altrex Investments, St James Anglican Church, Peter and Jane Patmore, Franklin House, Van Diemen Light Railway Society and within Invermay Primary School. Invermay Primary School, which is 140 years old, deserves special mention. I was thrilled to note that their award-winning library and classroom upgrade was achieved through the Labor government's BER funding. This is another great success story for education, jobs and value for money in the BER projects in Tasmania. Indeed, the promotion of the value of heritage spaces in new Launceston by all award winners and by Launceston City Council is to be commended. Once again, congratulations and well done! Gillard Government",86
57,Mr BILSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It is my melancholy duty to inform the House racial that the Gillard government has broken another promise. I am not talking about the Prime Minister's claim, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' It is the Assistant Treasurer's broken promise that he would not 'make life difficult for selfemployed working people'. Has he failed. No slick-willy weasel words will forgive the Assistant Treasurer for breaking his promise. Not only has he unleashed organs of the Commonwealth to attack independent contractors and self-employed peopletasking the Taxation office, tasking the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and tasking Fair Work Australia in a triple-cored push to stalk and terrorise independent contractors-but it gets worse. In this budget there is another measure of additional red tape and reporting requirements for those who dare to engage independent contractors. What we have learned is that, when the government talks about people contributing to the workforce, the only workers it understands are those who are employees-not an employer, not a self-employed person, not someone using their own wit and talent to gain wealth and opportunity in this country. Those people deserve support, not the nonsense and intimidation and the ridicule hatched up in secret meetings with unions by this government that is undermining the enterprising nature of Australians. One other thing: the government has been stung by its deregulation failures-one out for every 220 new regulations in. What has the Minister for Small Business done? He has tried to challenge the numbers. I say to Senator Sherry: check ComLaw for your facts; you stand condemned. (Time expired) Petition: Health and Hospitals Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (13:52): I present a petition on behalf of certain citizens of and visitors to Tamborine Queensland, and surrounding areas in relation to improving registered nurses pay and better per-bed funding. The principal petitioner is Ms Pamela Green from Eagle Heights. This has been to the Standing Committee on Petitions and has been approved. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of and to Tamborine Mountain, Queensland, and surrounding areas Draws the attention of the House to: Our fear of ending our days in a nursing home sometimes lying or sitting in faeces and urine because nurses are too busy to answer our callbuttons quickly, particularly in the case of Agency nurses, struggling in an unfamiliar environment. We therefore ask the House to: (1) ensure that all registered nurses in nursing homes are paid the same as those in hospitals, thus lessening the difficulty in finding permanent staff and the need to use Agency nurses. (2) Provide greater per bed funding to agencies conducting nursing home services, so that there are sufficient staff to ensure that even when the inevitable emergencies arise, call buttons can still be answered in an acceptable time frame. Bear in mind that, while you know of these issues from the Nurses' Union, and from your own Health Workforce, this petition is from the point of view of potential and actual nursing home patients, who will be forming an ever-increasing proportion of the voting public as you free up hospital beds by providing alternative facilities such as more respite-care beds in nursing homes. from 1,141 citizens Petition received. Oromian Australians",86
58,Mr BANDT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On Saturday 7 May this year, I was privileged to Mountain, meet with over 200 Australians from Oromia. We met in Flemington in my electorate of Melbourne. Many members of this place may not be aware of the Oromian community and have limited knowledge of the plight of the Oromo people. I certainly did not have a detailed awareness prior to my meeting two weeks ago. I have subsequently learnt that the Oromia region stretches across most of Ethiopia. I have also learnt of the difficulties facing the Oromo people, both visitors those in Oromia, where there is evidence systemic killings have occurred over the past decades, and those who have reached Australian shores, where Oromian Australians often find it difficult to access Oromo translator services as they are presumed to speak other languages from the area. Members of the Oromo community in Melbourne spoke to me about their desire for self-identification as Oromian Australians as well as their desire for government services to recognise and support their identity. I invited representatives from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Centrelink, Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the local Moonee Valley council to hear the stories of Oromian Australians and to grow an awareness of this Australian community. Thank you to Aliye, Toltu and Ayesha for increasing my knowledge of their community and the ways we can better support this and other communities of newly arrived Australians. F3 to M2 Link",87
59,Ms ONEILL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like put on record, in light of recent inaccurate comments in this House and in the Central Coast media, my absolute support for the long-awaited F3 to M2 link, and I record the support of my fellow Central Coast federal Labor colleagues, the members for Dobell and Shortland. Regrettably, after years of New South Wales government inaction, federal funding for $150 million a feasibility study for the link had to be deferred in this year's budget. In their comments on the F3-which experienced another extensive delay this week further up the road, south of the Hawkesbury-members opposite neglected to say that this project is in a position where it can only proceed with the support of the New South Wales state Liberal government. That is because it involves upgrading the state, not the national, road network. We are in limbo because the new O'Farrell government is yet to determine its infrastructure priorities Sydney, which the Premier says will be based on the advice from his yet-to-beestablished Infrastructure New South Wales body. I bring to the attention of the House comments made by the New South Wales Roads Minister for Roads and Ports, Duncan Gay, earlier this month. He told state parliament: … the New South Wales Liberals and The Nationals made it clear before the election that we will commence construction on one of the key missing links in the Sydney orbital road … Infrastructure New South Wales will determine whether the first missing link for construction will be the F3-M2 link, the M5 East duplication, the M4 East extension or the F6. So which one will it be? As the federal government has explained to anyone who cares to listen, we have directed Infrastructure Australia to get on with the job. $150 million in planning money was committed and will be just deferred depending on the O'Farrell government. Let us not play the blame game; it is time to get on with the job- (Time expired) Faust, Mr Sam Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (13:55): for On a day when all Queenslanders are justifiably proud of our State of Origin footballers, you could be forgiven for not noticing the fact that they were wearing black arm bands last night. It was only last week that I spoke in this chamber asking have everyone in Townsville to support a fundraising luncheon for ex-Cowboy second rower Sam Faust. It was to be held today to assist with travel costs to get him overseas for a radical treatment to his very aggressive form of leukaemia. Sadly, Sam lost his fight against this disease this week. It was somewhat profound that today as we for celebrated the launch of Australia's Biggest Morning Tea we also mourned the latest casualty of cancer. The lunch will still go ahead in a couple of weeks but it will be to support his beautiful wife and widow, Kya, and their three beautiful girls, Kaiulani, Meika, and Lola. It is appropriate that we speak at this time of immortality. As a parent, you look at your children and you can see parts of you, your partner, four grandparents and extended family members. Sam Faust has achieved immortality. His girls will see to that. Vale Sam Faust. You will be missed, but you will never be forgotten. Climate Change",88
60,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House of Representatives the growing youth movement for climate change action and the grassroots support for action on climate change in my electorate of Reid. Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting three young inspirational constituents-Katherine Tu, Mathew Nicholl and Leah Emmanuelas part of a 'meet your member' campaign, initiated by the Australian Youth Climate Coalition. I am very impressed by the motivation and passion of these three young Australians. During our discussions, Katherine, Mathew and Leah impressed me with their unshakable conviction that climate change is real and must be addressed now. I was also heartened to learn of the groundswell of support by younger Australians for our government to take urgent and decisive action to combat climate change. After all, it is their generation that will be faced with the terrible consequences of inaction if we fail to act now. I would also like to add just how impressed I am with these students and their maturity and understanding of how vital it is for our government to address the issues of climate change. I thank Katherine, Mathew and Leah for taking the time to raise this critical issue with me not only on their own behalf but also on behalf of their generation as, after it is their generation who are the future of our country and we owe it to them to act on climate change now. ",89
61,Mr ENTSCH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Rosie and Peter Johnson and their three children are your typical Aussie battling family. What sets them apart is that they have been dealt a massive blow with the downturn of our local economy and also with Cyclone Yasi hitting the Far North. Peter and Rosie own a roadhouse and convenience store in Bloomfield called the Bloomfield River Inn. The Bloomfield River causeway, their only southern access to their community, was washed away in Yasi. It has been closed for the last three months, stopping all passing traffic and causing massive losses to their business. Rosie and Peter had no insurance and, to top it off, the government has decided that businesses in the Bloomfield area are not eligible for disaster relief payments under the NDRRA. Instead of whingeing and throwing their hands in the air, they have rolled up their sleeves to get on with their job and to try to survive. Once a week for the past three months Rosie has travelled 80-odd kilometres in a beat-up old four-wheel-drive to Cooktown and then back down to Cairns to bring fresh fruit, vegetables, milk and other grocery items to restock her store and feed her family. When I spoke to them recently they told me that the causeway had just been reinstated except that the road was very rough and available for four-wheeldrive vehicles only. But Rosie said that there is a positive side. She said, 'With the rough stones in the causeway maybe now we can get some work for our little tyre-changing business.' I call on the government to reconsider all, their decision in relation to the Yasi relief and ask them to extend the relief support to businesses in Cairns, Cape York and, of course, into the Bloomfield area to support Rosie and Peter Johnson and their family.

63,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! The time for members' statements has expired. NA National Sorry Day,90
64,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Today is Sorry Day and as you would see it is being marked by many members in the House wearing the emblem of Sorry Day. That means it is the anniversary of the tabling in this parliament of the 1997 Bringing them home report, which was co-authored by Mick Dodson and by the late Sir Ronald Wilson. That was a landmark report. Many members of this House would remember it well, would remember its contents well and would remember the day that the parliament received it well. It was a report that acknowledged the forced separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families. When it was received by this parliament it was spoken to by members in the House. I clearly remember that day and the Leader of the Opposition Kim Beazley shedding some tears because of the content of that report and how powerful are how moving it was. As part of the journey of healing that nation has engaged in since the delivery of that report, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in this place in 2008 delivered the national apology that recognised the profound grief, suffering and loss past government practices inflicted on stolen generations. That was an important moment-a page of history written for our nation. But the journey of healing still continues. We recognise that members of the stolen generations continue to require our support and they continue on their personal journey of healing. So today we reflect on the grief and on the trauma experienced by members of the stolen generations. On behalf of all Australians we commit ourselves to an ongoing journey of healing. Of course, I believe we also jointly resolve to keep working with members of the stolen generations and the organisations who represent them to make sure that we continue to hear their voices and we continue to support them. Thank you.",90
65,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I rise to support the words of the Prime Minister and to agree that, yes, we should remember all the ways in which Indigenous policy has failed and resolve to do better. And we should recall all the ways in which Australians have not treated their fellow Australians as they should have and resolve to improve. But it has not all been bad. I should acknowledge former Prime Minister Keating for reminding us all, at Redfern in 1992, of that legacy of unutterable shame. I should also acknowledge former Prime Minister Howard for his work to bring about practical improvements in the lives of Aboriginal people, including through the intervention which both sides of this parliament supported. I should also acknowledge former Prime Minister Rudd for having the vision to the say sorry on behalf of our nation. That was an historic day and we all pay tribute to him for that act of statesmanship. In the Prime Minister's speech that day he pointed out that words without deeds were empty-they were but sounding brass and clanging gongs. The point is not just to be sorry but to do better. I should observe today that this parliament could improve the economic prospects of the Aboriginal people of Cape York if it passed the private member's bill on Wild Rivers. And you and I, Prime Minister, could better address the social crisis in Alice Springs and elsewhere if we were prepared to meet together with the provisional owners as we have both been invited to do. It is all very well to be sorry for the past problems and the past mistakes that have undoubtedly been made. That means it is all the more urgent that we do not compound current problems by making new mistakes. I grieve for the stolen generations of the past. I also grieve for the ruined generations of the present and for that we should all be truly sorry. Reference to Main Committee",90

73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Of course, because we have the most negative opposition in this country's history, one of the things they refuse to do is Regional ever to deal with the facts. As the Leader of the Opposition ought to know, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship put out a statement in relation to this matter earlier today which fully answers this question. I myself was asked questions about it by the media today and fully answered this question. I refer him to the statement that I released-the co-statement with the Prime Minister of Malaysia-which answers this question. Of course, the arrangement that we will make with Malaysia will ensure that asylum seekers who are transferred from Australia are treated with dignity and treated with respect and treated in accordance with our understanding of human rights, and of course our understanding of human rights deals with the question the Leader of the Opposition asks. Cancer",91
74,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Why is it important for Australians to get behind the Cancer Council's Biggest Morning Tea campaign and how can every Australian take action to reduce cancer?,92
75,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Makin for his question. He, like many other members of this House on both sides, joined the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and about a million Australians who take part in the Cancer Council's Australia's Biggest Morning Tea. It helps the Cancer Council to raise funds for research to prevent and control cancer. At this event the Leader of the Opposition urged Australians to do all that they could tackle cancer. In fact, I can quote the Leader of the Opposition. He said, 'We should do all that we can to fight cancer.' So I have just a teensy-weensy suggestion for the Leader of the Opposition about what he could do himself. He could, for example, support our comprehensive plans to tackle tobacco, from the social marketing campaigns, the excise increase, our plain-packaging measures",92

79,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members of this House might be interested to know that, since there was an increase in the excise on tobacco last April, we have seen a very dramatic initial effect. In fact, from that excise change, there has been an initial drop in tobacco clearances of 8.8 per cent compared to the previous four years. Of course, all of this funding is being invested in health and hospitals. But this My seems to be one of the figures that those opposite are not asking about which appears in the budget. And, very oddly, yesterday afternoon the Leader of the Opposition actually criticised this excise for tobacco. So this means a person who this morning urged all Australians to do all they could to tackle cancer now-although he is in a unique position to do something about it-opposes the tobacco excise, opposes plain packaging and even opposes bans on smoking in cars with kids. Does anyone get the feeling that the Leader of the Opposition was not being straight this morning when he made those comments? But I have another quote.",92

83,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason this is important today is that we are supporting the Cancer Council's efforts to raise funds to tackle cancer. Mr Abbott himself came to the event and urged all Australians, rightly, to give generously to this cause-although he did, I think, come with an empty wallet, which he wanted to make a joke about himself.

Asylum Seekers Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:14): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her answer in the House earlier this week, when she refused to rule out Malaysia's right of veto over the 800 asylum seekers to be transferred from Australia. Can the Prime Minister now confirm that Malaysia will decide who goes to their country from Australia and the circumstances in which they go, and that any asylum seeker rejected by Malaysia will stay in Australia?",93
90,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," It is no surprise to me, and I suspect no surprise to people on this side of the House, that we are back to the old faithful of asylum seekers today. With so many divisions on that side of the parliament to cover up, they have obviously decided to go back to the thing that they think they can profit from. It is remarkable-they are not prepared to actually engage in the kind of debate that the minister for health has outlined to the House, because that goes to a division; not prepared to engage in debate about climate change, because of their division about it; not prepared to engage in a debate about the economy, because they do not know anything about it. Ms Julie Bishop: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked whether asylum seekers rejected by Malaysia would stay in Australia. I ask that the Prime Minister answer that question.",93
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will directly relate her response to the question.,93
92,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows from the statements I have made, including the statement. I made with the Prime Minister of Malaysia, we will enter with Malaysia into an innovative agreement to transfer asylum seekers so that we send a very, very strong signal to people-smugglers that they no longer have in their hands the product they wish to sell, which is the prospect that they can get asylum seekers to Australia and have their claims processed here. The arrangement with Malaysia is about that. People who are serious about dealing with the scourge of people-smuggling would understand that, and this continuing attempt by the opposition to distort the facts and raise the apprehension of Australians that somehow another country is going to determine our immigration policy is truly pathetic indeed.

98,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that our policies have been influenced by people outside our party. For example, we have been influenced by researchers, by public health advocates and by the AMA. We have taken advice from the Preventative Health Taskforce and we have been strongly influenced by the Cancer Council and the Heart Foundation. None of these organisations give us money. Yet in this place, in a couple of months when we are all asked to vote on plain packaging, there will be other influences at play. The coalition denies it is being influenced by big tobacco, but I have discovered something that seems to throw this into question. It is a policy that comes from big tobacco themselves-British American Tobacco, in fact. I think some of those opposite might particularly like to hear this their protestations, British American Tobacco makes the statement on its own website that their worldwide policy when it comes to donations is: Such payments can only be made for the purpose of influencing the debate on issues affecting the company … The Liberal and National parties deny that these contributions have any influence, but the donors say that is the only reason they can actually make a donation. Those opposite might be interested to know something else that is on this website. According to British American Tobacco's own figures, they made political donations in only three countries around the world in 2010. In Canada they made a donation of £1,000 and in the Solomon Islands they made a donation of £2,000. In Australia, they made a donation-to just two parties in this place-of £111,000. So 97 per cent of British American Tobacco's money is spent here on two parties-the Liberal Party and the National Party. And they are asking us to believe that this has no influence on their decision on whether they are going to support plain packaging or not! We have not taken our lead from big tobacco; it is about time the Leader of the Opposition showed that he was not able to be bought by big tobacco and stood up for those who are fighting cancer.

106,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I refer the minister to his complementary protection legislation, passed by the parliament yesterday, that now enables asylum seekers to make claims under the United Nations Convention against Torture. Given that Malaysia is not a signatory to the convention, can the minister confirm that the 800 asylum seekers to be sent to Malaysia may be eligible to have their transfer prevented and to remain in Australia while a claim under the convention regarding their potential treatment in Malaysia is assessed under the new laws?",95
107,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I cannot confirm that, because it is completely untrue, as the member for Cook well knows. He has completely misrepresented the complementary protection legislation once I am again, as he has previously, and completely misrepresented the arrangements with Malaysia. I am happy to go through this methodically for the benefit of the member for Cook. The Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of Malaysia have released a statement that outlines the agreement reached by them. That statement says that Prime Ministers Najib and Gillard have agreed that core elements of this bilateral arrangement will include that 'transferees will be treated with dignity and respect and in accordance with human rights standards'. That is what the agreement between the two prime ministers says very clearly. It has been confirmed by the Malaysian High Commissioner to Australia since then that these transferees will be treated humanely under the terms of that agreement. The member for Cook chooses to misrepresent the situation in relation to Malaysia. The member for Cook comes in here and cries his crocodile tears about the situation for asylum seekers in Malaysia, at the same time as criticising us for taking too many asylum seekers-for taking 4,000 asylum seekers-out of Malaysia. The hypocrisy of the member for Cook is exceeded only by this point: as the House would recall, last November the member for Cook proposed an arrangement similar to that proposed by the government in relation to a transfer agreement, except that instead of Malaysia he proposed Iran. I wonder how he would have gone negotiating with President Ahmadinejad the protections that this government has negotiated.",95
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before calling the member for New England, I am reliably informed that yesterday was the 20th anniversary of the election of the member New England to one of those smaller parliaments in Australia, the New South Wales parliament. He has had 20 years of service in both the state and the federal parliament, and I think that that length of service should be acknowledged. Honourable members: Hear, hear!",96
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not the reason he is getting the call! He is the only one standing. Younger People in Residential Aged Care Program,96
110,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank you, Mr Speaker. You may recognise what I have here in my hand.",96
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am glad you found it. The member for New England will come to his question.,96
112,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The theft that occurred has been rectified! My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I understand that the Younger People in Residential Aged Care Program of the Council of Australian Governments will end in a few weeks-on 30 June-after five years. Whilst the initiative has helped over 800 young people in this group to have a better quality of life, there are still 6,500 young Australians who inappropriately placed in nursing homes. I ask that the minister inform the House whether recommendations of the 2009 midterm review have been accepted and implemented and whether the government's plans are for continuing the important work into the future, particularly recommendation 3 of the review which refers to regional and remote areas.",96
113,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (14:29): I thank the for member for New England for his question and I think we all join together in congratulating him on his 20 years of service. This is a very important question and, like the member for New England, I think I can say that all members of this House agree that it is critical that we work together to provide alternative accommodation to young people who have been inappropriately housed in nursing homes in the past. As the member for New England has just outlined, too many people continue to be in nursing homes even when they are quite young. I can reassure the member for New England that the government is continuing to provide funding to the Young People in Residential Care Program. In fact, this year we are delivering around $38 million to the states and territories to assist them to move people into more appropriate accommodation so that young people can live with dignity in places that are more suited to their needs. I also want to reassure the member for New England and all members of this House that that funding is ongoing. I know there have been some concerns about that, but I can reassure him that that funding is in our budget out into the future. It is funded as part of the $6.2 billion National Disability Agreement. One of the remain important changes that this government has made is to improve the indexation of the funding that goes into that agreement. The indexation now is around six per cent, so we can certainly see that money growing as the years go on. It is very important that I let you know that, just last December at a meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory disability ministers, we reaffirmed our continuing commitment to address the needs of young people in nursing homes. In addition to that, the government announced in the election campaign that we would invest an extra $60 million to build up to 150 innovative community based accommodation places for people with disability. I anticipate that most of those places will go to young people. So we certainly recognise, with the member for New England-and I think I can confidently say that this is a view held by many in this House-that we do need to continue to help those young people who are inappropriately in nursing homes to find better and more appropriate accommodation where they can live with dignity. Climate Change Tobacco Products",96
114,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to Prime Minister. Why is it vital to be guided by the facts and evidence when it comes to tackling climate change and reducing smoking rates? How is the government undertaking an evidence based approach to these challenges?,97
115,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Calwell for her question on the very important topic of using facts and evidence to design policies. The Australian people can be reassured that this government is acting on the basis of the facts and the evidence rather than peddling fear as we see this negative opposition do. On climate change, the scientific evidence is in and it is beyond doubt. The science tells us that human emissions of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being the most important, have been the primary trigger of climate change since at least the 1950s. The science tells us that current carbon emissions are 37 per cent larger than they were in the 1990s. The science is telling us to act and we are determined to act. When we turn to the question of cigarette smoking, the science is also unbelievably clear. Smoking kills over 15,000 Australians per year. It is the leading cause of cancer and we do know from scientific studies that plain paper packaging will make a difference. We have accepted the evidence. But on the other side we see a complete denial of the evidence. They would rather peddle fear than deal with the facts and deal with the evidence. We know that Senator Nick Minchin has been out leading the sceptics within the opposition denying the science of climate change and we know that the opposition is refusing to accept the scientific studies which show the way in which plain packaging will make a difference. I would say to those opposite, and particularly to the Leader of the Opposition, that they should not continue to oppose effective action on climate change and they should not oppose further action to reduce smoking rates in our society. The confusion on the opposition side knows no bounds. We actually increased the excise on smoking because the science told us that it would reduce smoking rates. That was clear. And at one point, the shadow minister for health agreed with us. Indeed, he was agreeing with us as recently as 24 May-that is, this week he was agreeing with us. He was saying that he proposed, along with the Leader of the Opposition, an increase of $2 billion in excise because pricing works. But then the Leader of the Opposition actually unravelled that support for an excise increase when he spoke Speaker: it is possible the member for Calwell might have asked the wrong question, but that is not an excuse for the Prime Minister to try to cover two questions in the one answer. What she is now saying has absolutely nothing to do with the question she was asked.",97
116,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,98
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The opposition may believe there is an element of parallel universe going on here, but I simply say to them that, if they had actually listened, they would have heard that both climate change and smoking were mentioned in the question by the member for Calwell. The Prime Minister is being directly relevant to the question.",98
118,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the opposition for so visibly demonstrating my point in the last few minutes: they do not listen. They did not listen to the question, they do not listen to the scientists, they do not absorb any facts-they just do not care. The little shambles we just saw over there, where they were joking about whether smoking causes climate change, should cause Australians to recoil in horror, because what it means is the opposition could not care less about either. They do not care about climate change; they are sceptics. They do not care about smoking; they are too big on the drip from big tobacco to take anything about smoking seriously. Maybe the smoke that they care about is the smoke that shows there is a fire of division over there in the opposition. We have the division on display at the end of week: the Leader of the Opposition versus the shadow Treasurer; the Leader of the Opposition versus the member for Wentworth; the Leader of the Opposition versus the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; and the famous five who have been singled out for criticism by the Chief Opposition Whip. They are a divided opposition who are incapable of taking in facts and evidence and incapable of designing a policy for the nation's future. (Time expired) Mining",98
119,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer direct the Grants Commission not to reduce Western Australia's share of the GST and not to penalise Western Australia as a result of its removing the concessions on iron ore fines?,98
120,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. No, I will not direct the Grants Commission to do that, and for the shadow Treasurer to try, as he has done in this House in the past few days, to draw some comparison between a previous direction and the current situation represents a complete misunderstanding by those on that side of the House of what is going on in terms of the taxation of fines in Western Australia. There are fines which are covered by state agreements, and the direction I gave to the that Grants Commission related to fines covered by state agreements; it did not relate to other fines. Now that the Western Australian government itself has decided to treat all fines equally-that is, the fines covered by state agreements and the other fines-so should the Grants Commission. That is the factual situation that those opposite have not understood at any stage through this debate. They have been on a frolic about it, but the this situation is now clear to everybody: the Western Australian government on eight occasions leading up to its budget a couple of weeks ago said to the public that it would not be increasing the royalty on fines. Eight times it said that prior to the budget, when it increased the royalty for fines. It even made a submission to the Grants Commission at the end of last year saying that it would not do it and that, if that action were taken, it would lead to a sovereign risk. That is why those on the outside of the House are so embarrassed at the moment. This time last year they were running around Australia claiming that we were going to tax the mining companies too much and that they were being taxed too much already, but now we have the Western Australian Premier going out and doing precisely what they have opposed: taxing the mining companies by increasing royalties, and that has been denied by the Western Australian Premier on eight occasions. Those opposite simply do not understand what they are talking about in this area, and they are acutely embarrassed by the behaviour of the Western Australian government and by their own behaviour in this House. Of course, on this question they are divided. We can see that every day. They are even too divided to turn up to their own divisions. Climate Change",98
121,Mr MITCHELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the government's carbon farming initiatives? How have these reforms been received and what is the government's response?,99
122,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for MCEwen for his question. The government is endeavouring to implement its election commitment to give farmers and landholders access to carbon markets. Under the carbon farming initiative, which is currently before the House, farmers and landholders and foresters have the opportunity to develop projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars to store and reduce carbon in our landscape. This is very important legislation that has been welcomed in particular by the National Farmers Federation for the reasons that I have outlined. It is very surprising therefore that the coalition yesterday signalled that it wants to delay the bill. This is despite the fact that the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Flinders, has been understandably enthusiastic about the carbon farming initiative and has been trying to reassure stakeholders that he would deliver the support of the coalition for this initiative. However, it is now clear that that reassurance cannot be delivered on and that there is division on that side of politics about this important issue. Mr Hunt interjecting",99
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Flinders is warned.,99
124,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They simply cannot get their act together over something that would provide a revenue stream for farmers and assist in tackling climate change. Notwithstanding the support of the NFF and the potential benefits to farmers, the Leader of the Nationals told the House yesterday that the Carbon Farming Initiative was 'just another tree planting scheme.' He then widely briefed the media that the Nationals did not support the Carbon Farming Initiative. If the Nationals leader had bothered to have a look he would have found out that the Carbon Farming Initiative will not lead to trees usurping prime agricultural land, because the government has built significant safeguards into the legislation to prevent that from occurring. Those safeguards have been the subject of extensive consultation with the stakeholders. Mr Abbott interjecting",99
125,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear the Leader of the Opposition raising the issue of the details. The government has already begun to release the methodologies to provide guidance to project development and has provided the details of eligible and ineligible project activities relevant to land use. Instead of delaying a positive initiative for farmers, coalition would be better off having a look at the effect of their own subsidies-for-polluters policy because that is where a deep problem lies. The Leader of the Opposition has been running around with his scare campaign saying that we can deal with climate change by planting trees everywhere. I am surprised that the Nationals leader has not picked this up. To meet their current emissions reduction target under their own subsidies-for-polluters policy, the coalition would need to plant trees on an area larger than the entire crop land of this country. I suggest that if the Nationals are concerned about the use of prime agricultural land they should have a little look at the subsidies-for-polluters policy. They are a joke on these areas of policy. They are divided on all the big issues. They are run by climate science deniers. They cannot get their act together even on an issue that would be of significant benefit to the farmers of this country. Get your act together.",99
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the minister to refer his remarks through the chair. I will try to get my act together. Coal Industry,100
127,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer agree with the Minister for Resources and Energy that stopping Australian coal exports will lead to other countries using lower quality, dirtier coal that does more damage to the environment?",100
128,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I can certainly tell the shadow Treasurer that all us on this side of the House are in favour of exporting coal. It seems like a common sense thing to do. One of the reasons we need to put a price on carbon is to ensure that the all of our industries, including our coal industry, can get access to international markets and also be competitive in international markets. That is the objective of everybody on the side of the House, but those opposite want to stick their heads in the sand because they are not capable of facing up to the really big decisions that we must make as a nation to ensure we remain competitive. The coal industry is one of our most important industries. We on this side of the House are strong supporters of the coal industry. We understand that the coal industry, like so many of our other industries, must be competitive. That is why we need a price on carbon. As the rest of the world prices carbon and we do not, our industries and exports could face trade barriers. Of course, the one that would be most under threat from that would be the coal industry. I am optimistic about the future of our coal industry because we have some of the cleanest coal in the world. As the world moves to renewable energy it will still require traditional energy and our coal will be highly valued in that environment. In an environment where carbon is priced and where investment is driven to renewable energy there will still be a role for coal and a very big role for the Australian coal industry.",100
129,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have a supplementary question, Mr Speaker. Given that the Treasurer is such an enthusiastic supporter of coal exports, why is the Labor government imposing a carbon tax that will shut 16 Australian coal mines and cost 10,000 Australians their jobs but deliver no net benefit for the environment?",100
130,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I really do thank the shadow Treasurer for that question because it just demonstrates how he has changed his spots when it comes to climate change. There was a time in this House when he said he was an avid supporter of climate change and that we needed a price on carbon, and he strongly supported the member for Wentworth in that endeavour. But I remember the day when he really lost the plot. It was when the leadership struggle was on in that party and he sent a message out on Twitter saying, 'Tell me what I believe in.' Mr Hockey interjecting",100
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will withdraw.,101
132,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw. I also rise on a point of order about relevance. I ask you to bring him back to answer the question.,101
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney has raised with me the point of order on direct relevance. The Treasurer should respond directly to the question.,101
134,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The sad truth is that the shadow Treasurer stands for nothing and believes in very little. Someone who could change their stance so radically,101
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will come to the question.  to the Treasurer to ask him to be relevant to the question and then he instantly ignored your ruling in the next breath. I ask you action you are going to take.,101
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Sturt rose to the dispatch box, he may or may not have heard that I asked the Treasurer to come back to the question. He will respond to the question directly.",101
137,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about the impact of a carbon price on our coal industry, which is so important to the generation of jobs and wealth for our country. The underlying factor is this: the industry understands there needs to be a price on carbon and that is why they are continuing to invest. And for the shadow Treasurer to ask me this question today, when the capital investment, the CAPEX figures, have come out and they are truly strong and very encouraging for the future of our economy, and when we have just today got the report from ABARE talking about how the pipeline of investment in coal and iron ore is growing-it just demonstrates that he has not got a clue what is going on in our economy. The fact is that the industry understands that carbon is going to be priced and they are continuing to invest. We have an unprecedented investment boom in our nation. But of course that is not understood by anybody on the other side of the House, because all they want to do is score cheap political points and run incredibly stupid scare campaigns. Economy",101
138,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer update the House on recent economic data and what this says about our economy and the importance of continuing to invest in jobs?,101
139,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for that very important question. There is some data out today that says a lot about the future of our what economy, the future of growth here and our prospects well into the future. The fact is we do have an unprecedented investment pipeline in Australia. Today's capital expenditure numbers show that businesses are confidently investing in growing their businesses. In resources alone investment has gone from $35 billion in 2009-10 to more than $50 billion in 2010-11. This is expected to increase even further in 2011-12 to a record $83 billion, eight times greater than it was before the mining boom mark 1. Total investment in 2010-11 is estimated to be $124 billion, with a record $139.5 billion expected in 2011-12. This is a very strong investment pipeline. It was also backed up today by ABARE's figures, which are talking about an investment pipeline in resources of $430 billion. It is a very strong investment pipeline, but we are all aware, certainly on this side of the House, that there was a very dramatic impact on our economy from the floods back in January and also from Cyclone Yasi. This was ignored by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply. It is probably the most significant event in the Australian economy in the past year and it did not even get a mention in the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply, much to the embarrassment of all the Queensland members over there, because the impact of Cyclone Yasi and the floods has been to rip $9 billion out of our economy in the short term. That will mean a dramatic impact on growth in the March quarter, and we will see that next week in the national accounts. But these CAPEX numbers today are a reminder to all of us of the great opportunity that lies ahead for Australia: a strong growth outlook, low unemployment and strong job creation-260,000 jobs in the past year alone, with about 80 per cent of them being full time. During the time this government has been in power 700,000 jobs have been created and we are looking at another 500,000 jobs in the next two and a bit years. Everybody on this side of the House understands the importance of a job to the welfare of families and to the security of businesses. We understand it, but it is not understood by those on the other side of the House. That is why we are so intent on bringing the budget back to surplus in 201213. That is why making savings in the budget is so important. We have this strong investment pipeline and we cannot compound the inflationary pressures that will flow from it. That is why the government savings must pass: to keep jobs secure and to make sure that we are maximising the opportunities for the future. That is why we must have a disciplined fiscal policy and not something we see from those oppositethere is no policy at all. And that is why we must put a price on carbon. It will give certainty for investors. But those on the other side of the House are not capable at all of facing up to the big decisions, particularly this Leader of the Opposition. He wants to run a negative campaign day after day. For our part we will get on with supporting our economy, putting the right policies in place, supporting jobs and families. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme: Erbitux",101
140,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to comments in his budget speech that the government will 'make new medicines and immunisations more affordable'. Is the Treasurer aware of any deaths as a result of the government failing to fund Erbitux on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme?,102
141,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The government takes the issue of listing medicines and the funding and paying for that element of health care extremely seriously. Frankly, I think that question was just despicable. Defence Procurement",102
142,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the construction of three new air warfare destroyers? Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:59): I thank the member for his question. As the House might recall, in 2007 the then Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson, now our ambassador in NATO, announced the acquisition of three air warfare destroyers for the Royal Australian Navy. This government, in the Defence white paper 2009, confirmed that we would proceed with the acquisition of these three new ships, and they ships are currently due for delivery in December 2014. When complete, the air warfare destroyer will be one of the more capable types of warship of its size in the world. They provide advance air defence against missiles and aircraft for self-protection, as well as for other ships for land forces in coastal areas. The total cost of the project is about $8 billion, with a significant benefit for local Australian industry. Overall, the estimate is that around 50 per cent of the total value of the project will be spent in Australia. The ships are being constructed in 90 separate blocks, which are being fabricated in three separate Australian shipyards: in Adelaide at the ASC shipyard, in Melbourne at the BAE Systems shipyard and in Newcastle at the Forgacs shipyard. They will ultimately be assembled in Adelaide. Today, the Minister for Defence Materiel and I announced a reallocation of work for that project. This is necessary because, in addition to the air warfare destroyer work, the Melbourne BAE Systems shipyard is also building blocks for the superstructure for the two new landing helicopter dock ships due for delivery in 2014-15. The Melbourne shipyard is stretched, working on two major projects at the same time. The government, the Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance and BAE Systems takes the schedule for these two very important projects most seriously. In February of this year, BAE Systems advised the AWD Alliance of potential schedule delays. As a consequence of that, I met with BAE Systems United Kingdom in London in March of this year. The Minister for Defence Materiel speaks regularly to the CEO of BAE Systems Australia, Jim MCDowell, and on this particular matter has met and spoken with him on a number of occasions in recent months. Over the last few months the AWD Alliance and BAE Systems have been working very closely to prepare options to improve the production outcomes, and earlier this month BAE Systems presented the alliance with a plan to adjust this workload on the air warfare destroyer project. The advice of the alliance was that if and no action were taken to relieve the pressure on the Melbourne shipyard the first ship would be two years late. As a consequence of these discussions and that possible outcome, the Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance, with the support of BAE Systems and with the support of the Minister for Defence Materiel and I, propose to take the following action. Firstly, up to 13 steel blocks will be reallocated among the three Australian shipyards in Adelaide, Melbourne and Newcastle and up to five blocks will be reallocated to Navantia in Ferrol, Spain. This action will reduce the schedule risk for both this project and the LHD, landing helicopter dock, ships project. The Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance has advised that this action will reduce the estimated delay of the completion of the first ship by up to 12 months and all three AWDs by the same period. It will also reduce the pressure on BAE Systems to complete its work on the LHD ships. Importantly, I am advised that there will be little, if any, adverse impact on the current Melbourne BAE Systems shipyard workforce, which is around 300, as a result of this decision. That workforce will continue to have the opportunity to work on the AWDs as well as the landing helicopter docks, and that is a good thing for Melbourne as it is a good thing for Adelaide and Newcastle. Infrastructure: Pacific Highway",102
143,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to evidence in Senate estimates yesterday that the duplication of the Pacific Highway will cost an additional $7 billion above everything that is provided in the forward estimates. How will the Treasurer meet the Prime Minister's promise to complete this project by 2016 and still return the budget to surplus by 2012-13?,104
144,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Through a prudent fiscal policy and strict fiscal discipline, and working with state governments who will have to bear their share of the burden. We will do that in both those ways. I will tell you what: we have shown a lot more interest in the Pacific Highway than those opposite. I happen to know our commitments are much larger than theirs, and we have put them all in our budget and they are all funded. We have a commitment and a priority for the Pacific Highway that those opposite never had. The other thing that they will not do is tell anybody how they are going to fund any of their commitments. How would they fund the Pacific Highway?  Speaker. As the member for Mackellar pointed out yesterday, there is provision in the standing orders for a minister, if he does not know the answer to a question, to simply say so and return to the House later and answer the question. He is clearly not answering the question and I would ask you to draw him back to the question or sit him down.",104
145,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Treasurer will respond to the question.,104
146,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As someone who has travelled the Pacific Highway a lot in my life, one of the things that I am proudest of in this budget is the commitment of $1 billion to the Pacific Highway. I am really proud of that. I am proud of the performance of our roads minister here, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, who has made a very big commitment to the Pacific Highway and, of course, the Independent members, who have a real interest in this highway. I know how dangerous this highway is because I am a Queenslander and I have driven it all my life. We have a commitment there that has not been there from those opposite. Our total commitment is $4.1 billion, compared to the Howard government's $1.3 billion. That is the answer to your question.",104
147,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Boothby. Dr Southcott: Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Treasurer.",104
148,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Sorry, no. The member for Boothby will resume his seat. I made a mistake-and I admit mistakes. Not many people here do.",104
149,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,104
150,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The difference was that the Chief Government Whip was on his feet.,104
151,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,104
152,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He was not. I do not really appreciate the very smart way that I have these arguments with senior members of the front-bench in this manner. If the member for North Sydney has a problem when I correct the mistake that I made, he can raise a point of order. It was not a mistake. The incident that he remembers from earlier in the week was about the rotation of the call. I gave the call on the rotation. The fact that maybe the Leader of the Opposition was a little slow is not something that I highlighted at the time. But I will not, when I can recover from a mistake and I have admitted a mistake, have it challenged in the way that the member for North Sydney did. Business of the House",104
153,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I have a very relevant question to the Leader of the House. I ask him: how are members of the House approaching negotiations on the conduct of the proceedings of the House?,105
154,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:08): I thank the member for Hunter, the Chief Government Whip, for his question. Indeed, as of today, at 1.30, we have passed 112 pieces of legislation through this House-112 supported, zero opposed by this House of Representatives. And we have done that in just eight months. How does that compare with our predecessors? Those opposite would like to say that this parliament cannot function properly because it requires proper negotiation. The fact is that in the first 12 months of the Howard government 108 bills were passed by the House of Representatives, so we have been more efficient and more productive on this side of the House in terms of getting legislation through. Big changes have gone through the House, on the economy, on child care, on family services. This parliament is working efficiently and effectively. Through cooperation and discipline, this government is implementing its agenda to secure the future prosperity of this country. Of course, we know that discipline is pretty important. I was sent an email earlier on today and it said this: Last night we lost a division because the following five Coalition Members failed to support their colleagues: Malcolm Turnbull (5 missed divisions)margin 14.86% He has always had a problem with emails!  order. I assume, in order to be directly relevant, the Leader of the House will refer to the fact that they failed to get a quorum yesterday for the government.",105
155,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business knows that that is outside the standing orders. It is not a point of order; it is a point.,105
156,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It then goes on to list Ian Macfarlane, Alby Schultz and the number of divisions that they have missed, then John Forrest-even Luke Hartsuyker, the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. And it goes on to say this: This behaviour is totally unacceptable and shows great disrespect to their colleagues and the Coalition as a whole. As a result of the absence of these Members, the following Members missed an opportunity to raise issues important to their electorates … And it goes through the members Tudge, Kelly, Simpkins, Southcott and Frydenberg and their respective margins. It then goes on-and it gets better. It says: It is an interesting point to note that all the Members who missed the division occupy safe seats, while, of the Members prevented from speaking in the adjournment debate three are first term Members and all occupy marginal or key seats. It then goes on to say: Members are elected to Parliament to represent their constituents. That includes being present when the Parliament divides on a question. As we know, they are so divided opposite they cannot even make it to divisions. For the benefit of honourable members, I table the signed letter from Hon. Warren Entsch, Chief Opposition Whip, Patrick Secker, Nola Marino, Mark Coulton and Paul Neville. They are all having a go there, and I know that this was of great interest particularly to the member for Wentworth, who saw it as part of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has done for political discourse what the vuvuzela did for World Cup soccer-lots of noise, interesting at the beginning but annoying when that is the only noise it can make. The only noise it can make is one of opposition.

Leave not granted. Carbon Pricing",105
157,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer the Treasurer to the announcement that SA power provider ETSA Utilities will raise household power bills in South Australia by 10 per cent this year and over the next two years utility bills will rise by $623 for the forgotten families of South Australia. Mr Champion interjecting",106
158,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Boothby will resume his seat. The member for Wakefield will leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94(a). The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.,106
159,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over the next two years, utility bills will rise by forgotten families of South Australia. Given that the Prime Minister said before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' why is the government making life even harder for families, already struggling with cost-of-living pressures, by introducing a carbon tax which will add a further $300 to household power bills?",106
160,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for that question. The government absolutely understands the concern felt by electricity consumers about price rises that are occurring under the regulatory framework that has been in place not just under this government but under the past government. The member for Boothby is trying to draw a link between these price rises and the impact of a carbon price we do I seek not yet have. That demonstrates what a baseless scare campaign they are engaged in. The fact is that there are pressures in the system and prices are going up and that is putting pressures on families. The opposition seek to say that is somehow a consequence of decisions that have been taken by this government. They know that to be completely false. Dr Southcott: Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: I highlighted the utility bills and asked why the government is adding to it by $300 through a carbon tax.",106

162,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the eve of the last election, the member for Groom was openly honest about this, which is rare for the opposition.

165,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Everybody in this House knows that prices are going up and it has been caused by inadequate investment in the system over a long period of time. Those opposite might seek to deny it now, but they were open about it prior to the last election. For them to go out there now and run a baseless scare campaign somehow linking it to a future carbon price demonstrates just how dishonest they are. They know that the country has to face up to this tough decision. The government will face up to this decision. We will take a responsible decision in the interests of all consumers. Employment",107
166,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women. How are key components of the budget targeted to get the very long term unemployed back into work? Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (15:18): I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that in the electorate she represents, which has some 2,068 very long term unemployed people, they will certainly welcome the additional assistance we have announced. We on this side are very proud of the 700,000 jobs that have been created since we have been in government. But we also see that, as we head towards an unemployment rate of some 4.5 per cent with an additional 500,000 jobs to be created in the coming years, this provides us with a unique opportunity. As a nation, we are faced with a unique chance to transform the lives of the very long term unemployed and to break the cycle of welfare dependency. As a government, we are absolutely determined that we are not going to leave anyone behind in this period of growth. In this year's budget the government is investing an additional $227.9 million in new measures to specifically target the very long term unemployed. In Australia, currently 230,000 people are classified as very long term unemployed. We know that once a job seeker has been unemployed for one year they have a 54 per cent chance of being unemployed for at least another year; so we need to step in and break this cycle. Of the new funding, $94.6 million will be used to create 35,000 wage subsidies to be paid to employers who take on and retain people who have been unemployed for more than two years. This will create powerful new opportunities across the nation. These subsidies, totalling around $6,000 each, will be paid for at least six months and will be available to both private businesses and social enterprises, creating the opportunity to transform the lives of very long term unemployed Australians and those of their family members and their communities. We also know that people who have been unemployed for a very long period can have difficulty accessing full-time work, because they often do not have the work experience and skills that employers are looking for. We know that a lack of activity is detrimental to people's health and well-being and undermines their job readiness, so the government is putting in place stronger requirements and more resources in order to keep the very long term unemployed active and job ready. Under previous arrangements of both this government and the previous government, job seekers only had to meet activity requirements for six months each year. Those who are now very long term unemployed will in future, under this government, be required to be active in their engagement for 11 months each year. Those job seekers will be required to undertake activities like job training, volunteering, job trials and Work for the Dole if they are to continue to be eligible for income support. We are allocating some $133 million through this budget to fund these activities. We know the Australian economy needs workers if we are going to take advantage of the minerals boom and manage the challenges of an ageing population. This presents a very great opportunity for Australians who have been out of work for a large amount of time, who face significant barriers to re-engagement in the labour market. Our government is determined to provide those Australians with the incentives and the support they need in order to get back into the labour market. We are proud to have presented a budget directed towards this. Carbon Pricing  Opposition Business) (15:22): My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that an average school in Victoria is spending up to $58,000 a year on power and other utilities. Will the government compensate schools like these for the increase in electricity prices as a result carbon tax or does the government expect these increased costs to be met through higher charges to parents?",107
167,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question because putting in place a price on carbon is a very significant and fundamental reform for the future of our country. In the past when this country has faced up to the challenges before it and put in place very significant reforms, like we did in the late eighties and early nineties, there were always very big scare campaigns being run during those times, particularly by those opposite. And they are at it again. The fact is that our economy would not have come through the global recession in the shape that it did if it had not been for the actions that were put in place during that period, particularly reforms like national superannuation, which was so important to get us through the global recession. The point I want to make is that you have to face up to the hard reforms if you want to be honest with people. If you want to talk to people about the future, you cannot put the hard reforms in the too-hard basket.  of order. The Treasurer was asked about compensation for schools as a result of higher electricity prices driven by a carbon tax. I would ask you to ask him to answer that question. It did not need debate or any",108
168,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his place. The Treasurer knows his responsibilities in responding to of the question.,108
169,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was explaining why we need to put a price on carbon. It is because it is absolutely essential to the job security of Australians and our future prosperity. That is why the government is engaging in a thorough consultation with the wider of the community, the multiparty committee and the business community. We are working closely to design an emissions trading scheme. This parliament was within hours of an emissions trading scheme the year before last when the member for Wentworth decided that he could not do it and the Leader of the Opposition knocked him off. The fact is that this country has to price carbon. We on this side of the House believe in doing something about dangerous climate change",108

175,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Will the minister inform the House of the government's commitment to Indigenous education and how this has been received?",109
176,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (15:26): I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Today is National Sorry Day, as the parliament has noted. It is more than three years since the historic apology to the stolen generation, one of the most important moments in the history of this parliamentin fact, in our history. The acknowledgement of past injustices and the commitment to the healing journey means that we now must redouble our efforts to close the gap. Not only today with National Sorry Day but with the beginning of reconciliation week, I think we as a nation have an opportunity to recognise the past, to understand that there was injustice and suffering, and to know that we are on the path to healing. I did note my colleagues the Minister for Indigenous Health and the member for Lingiari reminding Australians that we are providing continuing support of some $54 million for programs to help the Bringing them home generation, the Link Up program and others. Right across Australia we will see Australian schools-public schools, independent schools and Catholic schoolshaving ceremonies that recognise and highlight the heritage of the first peoples, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These are terrific events. They create the opportunity for a more optimistic future. It means that young people, by participating in these events, are well placed to continue this reconciliation journey and to participate in it. We know that we are profoundly committed to closing the gap, and education is the key. It means work, training and further study. It means independence, opportunity and hope. The fact is that education breaks the poverty cycle, a cycle that is experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We know the gap between the educational outcomes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people is unacceptably large, but we also know that there are some really good things happening out there in Australian schools that are changing lives. Yes, the national statistics tell us a sobering story, but the efforts of many of our schools, using the $2.5 billion national partnerships money that this government has brought forward, is encouraging. Let me just identify a few of those encouraging stories. In Western Australia, 94 per cent of participating national partnerships schools are reporting improved engagement and participation of Aboriginal parents and communities. In the Hume region in Victoria, literacy intervention programs are seeing Indigenous student participation in year 3 NAPLAN reading move to over 90 per cent. In New South Wales we have Aboriginal community engagement strategies implemented in over 270 schools. Ninety-three have now got Aboriginal elders or community members working with teachers. That makes a big difference in a school. Two hundred and forty-four teachers from all the education sectors are undertaking Aboriginal education and cultural programs. Over 1,200 government school teachers are participating in training courses to support Aboriginal students. This makes a huge difference. The investment makes a huge difference. Sometimes there is one committed person who can make a difference. To finish, my favourite story is of the Elliott School in the remote Northern Territory, which employs a 71-year-old woman as a home liaison officer. She visits family homes and talks to kids, parents and carers. There was an average attendance of 60 per cent in semester 2 in 2009; it is now 72 per cent and their NAPLAN results are showing improvements. I think that this investment and some of the examples I have highlighted show what an important role education plays. In this House, we are committed to reconciliation and continuing the investment to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",112
204,Mr HOCKEY,IMPORTANCE," The Treasurer could be forgiven for not responding to this MPI because he is indeed himself the most significant threat to the Australian economy, and that is why the Treasurer is not able to deal with the matter in any simple way. That has been perfectly revealed during the course of this week, when the Treasurer has engaged in a rather slimy and slippery defence of his own position in relation to the mining tax and the concessions and the reduction of concessions sought by the Western Australian government in relation to iron ore fines. With the government determined to close down any sort of debate in relation to this matter, this is now an opportunity to explain what really happened. On 1 February 2010 the Grants Commission had an extensive discussion and reaffirmation about high and low royalties and differences between lump sum iron ore, which is high, and of course iron ore fines, which were regarded as low. On 10 March the Western Australian Treasurer, Troy Buswell, wrote to the Treasurer wanting confirmation on the entitlement of Western Australia's share of GST. Not long afterwards, on 2 May, the Treasurer announced, with the former Prime Minister, the second iteration of the mining tax-the first being the one in the Henry review. Then, a few days later, the Under Treasurer of Western Australia wrote, quite obviously concerned, to Dr Ken Henry, stating: … I seek your urgent confirmation that ""scheduled increases"" in Western Australia would include the removal of existing iron ore royalty rate concessions, which would see both fine and lump iron ore royalty rates being levied at 7.5 % … It is quite interesting, because the government, through the FOI process, redacted the last paragraph, which has now been revealed, and I quote: 'This issue was previously raised in correspondence between the then Western Australian Treasurer, the Hon. Troy Buswell, and the Hon. Wayne Swan ahead of the March 2010 meeting of the ministerial council, where assurances were given that the Commonwealth would direct the Grants Commission on this matter.' So, quite clearly, by 10 May last year the Treasurer was properly informed that Western Australia was going to wind back the concessions in relation to iron ore fines. That letter was never responded to as far as we are aware. So, when the Secretary of the Treasury in Western Australia wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury here in Canberra concerned about an issue directly going to the matter that has been debated this week, there was no response, and until this day we understand there has not been a response to the Western Australian government. Far be it for the Treasurer to claim that he was not informed. On 17 May the Treasurer received his own brief from the Department of Treasury and it went on to say: 'Western Australia indicated at a recent Commonwealth Grants Commission meeting prior to the announcement of the RSPT it was considering increasing the royalty rate on iron ore fines from the current rate of 5.625 per cent to 7.5 per cent rate for lump ore.' It is not qualified, it is not talking about the Pilbara, it is not being in any way specific about a particular class of iron ore fines; it is the general concession applying to iron ore fines. The Treasurer knew this, because on the very same day that he received this advice from the Treasury he addressed the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce, where he said, 'We are prepared to talk further with state governments who might have been making their own plans to capture a fairer share of resource wealth through lifting royalties.' A fairer share. So the Treasurer now is so critical of Western Australia for removing the concessions on iron ore fines that he not only said that the states understandably have to do it but he wants to talk to them about it. On the same day at a doorstop, he was asked by a journalist: Premier Colin Barnett has flagged that he wants to increase iron ore royalties to the global rate of 7½ per cent. He flagged that before the Henry Review. Will you say yes or no to whether that 7½ per cent royalty ratewill apply. We know that this Treasurer never answers a yes or no question, so I am going to cut short the very long-winded answer. The Treasurer then said: The fact that Premier Barnett is looking at very substantial increases in the royalties demonstrates the point that I was making to you before – that these royalty regimes have not kept pace with the underlying value of the resource, which all Western Australians and Australians do own. So now, when Western Australia does exactly what he was encouraging them to do, he stands up and criticises the Western Australian government. Of course, on 2 July 2010 the government announced the deal that they had done with Xstrata, BHP and Rio. In the fact sheet associated with that deal, it says:  The MRRT will also provide a full credit for state royalties paid by a taxpayer in respect of a mining project. It goes on to say: State royalties are assumed to be equal to 7.5 per cent of sales revenue and are credited against the MRRT liability to produce the net MRRT liability. What does that mean? It means that there was always an assumption by this government that the state governments would remove concessions and it was prepared to rebate up to 7.5 per cent. Quite plainly the government is encouraging confusion in relation to this matter. On 20 October, and the Prime Minister herself has quoted this in this parliament, Premier Barnett says on ABC radio that they have no plan to increase royalties. That is where the Prime Minister stopped, but he actually went on to say, 'we did get rid of some concessions, and perhaps some other concessions that in time might be phased out.' That is what he said-so he is going to phase it out. On 21 October Premier Barnett is quoted in the West Australian as saying: The state has no intention of increasing royalties but we will certainly preserve the right to do In November 2010, the Western Australian Treasury said in a submission to the Commonwealth Grants Commission that the Premier had recently indicated that the state had no intention of increasing royalties, but they would certainly preserve the right to do so. On 16 November, the Western Australian Under Secretary, failing to have received a response to his first letter, writes again to the Secretary to the Treasury asking what is going to happen to the Western Australian state budget due to the treatment of royalties. In February 2011, the Treasurer writes to the chairperson of the Grants Commission-he referred to this today in question timesaying that, in regard to the removal of iron ore fines royalty rate concessions in 2010, 'the classification of iron ore fines should not move between mineral royalty rates groups in between methodology reviews'. In relation to the first round of the windback concessions, the Treasurer, here, wrote to the Grants Commission and said 'don't penalise Western Australia'. It was the very same principle, the very same issue and was based on the very same assumption, that a royalty rate regime would be at 7.5 per cent. Premier Barnett, just a few days later, said on Perth radio that if they wanted to refund to the mining companies increases in state royalties, then they had to pay for that out of their own revenue; that was their choice. On 18 May, last week, the chief of staff of the Western Australian Premier rings up the chief of staff to the Treasurer and he says, 'We are going to lift the royalties in the budget tomorrow; we are going to remove the concession on iron ore fines tomorrow, in the budget.' Two days later, the Treasurer goes into the media and claims it came as an enormous shock-he says: Well first of all Mr Barnett did not communicate that he was going to do this to us. So, over the last four days, the Treasurer has so. stood by his words of last Friday. He claims that what he said was absolutely right-it all came as a surprise, even though there is a huge amount of information that proves that it was not a surprise. He said it came out of the blue. All of the evidence now points to the fact that not only is the Treasurer confused, not only is the Treasurer confusing, but the Treasurer is incapable and incompetent when it comes to managing the challenges of the Australian economy. This is a pattern of behaviour from his earliest days as Treasurer, in 2008, when he said that the inflation genie was out of the bottle. He went on to introduce a budget in 2008 that was in fact inflationary. It put up the price of alcopops, it put up the price of cars and it would effectively put up the price of private health insurance. That is what he did-he introduced an inflationary budget at exactly the time that he and the then Prime Minister were declaring war on inflation. Then came the financial crisis. The Treasurer, so lacking in belief in his own integrity, so lacking in belief in his own competence, hides behind the Secretary to the Treasury, always releasing documents and private advisory notes from the Secretary to the Treasury to himself. He is so lacking in confidence that he is hiding all way behind Ken Henry. It took us weeks to find out that in fact in that crisis room there was no Governor of the Reserve Bank; it was all being filtered through the Secretary Treasury, the man who was hiding the real Treasurer of Australia. What happened? Mistakes were made. There were a number of different positions on the government guarantee on deposits. Do you remember that? There was an unlimited guarantee on deposits, and then it was limited to $1 million, and reclassified again, not only creating confusion but also muddling the protections that were necessary for the financial system. Then we saw the stimulus package-a stimulus package that we had the courage to vote against because we could see early on that there was waste-waste in the pink batts program, waste in the school halls program and waste with the $900 cheques being sent out to people. Tens of thousands of those cheques were going not only overseas to stimulate offshore economies but also to dead people-as if there was anything that could stimulate them! Of course there is one program that I do not forget that was part of a rescue package that the Treasurer is so proud of-I can see the Special Minister of State smiling-and that is Ruddbank. What about Ruddbank? That was a cracker of an idea. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer wanted to set up their own bank to bankroll property development. The iconic infrastructure that they said they would finance at that crucial time was Vision Tower in Brisbane. The Treasurer himself said it was a great idea to fund that-the only problem was, it went bankrupt three days later. That was the leadership of the Labor Party. But, of course, it comes down to the fundamentals-the deficit. What an unsightly brawl between the Treasurer and the the Prime Minister back in 2008. It took them 21 days to work out after MYEFO that they might have to go into deficit. Then in 2009 the Treasurer could not bring himself to to the say what the deficit was in the budget speech. He broke new ground. Not only did he break new ground by refusing to name the deficit; he broke new ground because it was so big. Of course, we all remember the government coming in here time and time again saying they were temporary deficits. They look pretty damn permanent to me. When it comes to debt, we all remember how the Treasurer was encouraging the then Prime Minister not to mention the number$200 billion. Do you remember that? It was too big a number for them to get their minds around. Even on this budget night, when the budget net debt went from $94 billion to $107 billion, the Treasurer said it was tiny. That is the word he used: 'tiny'-'very tiny' he said on 2UE. When it comes to banking-this is a Treasurer that has no leadership-on 40 occasions he warned the banks, 'Do not increase interest rates beyond the Reserve Bank rate,' and then of course they did. He was going to ride in on a horse and stop them with exit fees. That was the solution he was going to come up with. And on tax: we have had 19 new tax grabs since 2007. We have had the Henry tax review, and to solve all Australia's tax problems we are going to have a summit, just like the 2020 Summit. There are a whole lot of issues here that just keep going on and on. The Treasurer is asked a simple question about inflation and he cannot answer it-it takes him minutes. He is asked a simple question about a flood levy and he cannot answer how many people are going to have to pay it. He was asked by the member for Longman, 'When did Labor last deliver a surplus?' He could not answer it. He went on ABC radio the next day and he still could not answer it. This Treasurer is the biggest threat to the Australian economy. (Time expired)",112

208,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"Even so, not content with the legacy of the past, the shadow Treasurer wishes to renew the great tradition of Liberal myth making with his unfair and factually unbased attack on a great Treasurer. We will start off with the exhibits of this mischievous Hans Christian Andersen like bit of bully boy bluster from the wannabe Treasurer of the wannabe tea party of Australian politics. I have listened very carefully to this discussion that somehow the Western Australian government did not tell anyone about its desire to increase royalties. As a part of the exercise, I have on me some of the great culprits of the current political debate. I have some iron ore fines here.",116

210,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The member for Hughes will not interject.,116
211,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"I have here some iron ore fines. I am sure most of the Liberal Party have never seen any. In the same tradition, because they might not actually know what an iron ore fine is, I also wish to refresh the memory of the House. On at least eight its occasions-not seven, not six, not five but eight occasions-Premier Barnett said he would not increase royalties. He said in an article in the Australian Financial Reviewnot exactly Green Left Weekly-titled is 'Barnett rejects iron ore royalty rise', on 4 September 2010: In the future I think there is a case for the fines iron ore rate to be equivalent to the lump royalty rate or closer to that, but it is not something that we are moving on now. It won't be in next year's budget. For the benefit of some of the members opposite, that is this budget. He said, 'We will not be moving on royalties in the immediate future.' As much as the opposition may seek to shout its way into government and shout over the facts, Premier Barnett said on ABC radio on 20 October 2010, 'We have no plan to increase royalties.' The following day, in that paper of record the West Australian, he said, 'The state has no intention of increasing royalties.' In an interview with the Australian, another paper of record, on 30 October 2010, 'I have no plans to increase royalties.' He then said on a fifth occasion-not content with four occasions",116
212,Unknown,IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,117
213,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"I am glad to see that the member for Kooyong has recovered. He then said, in his government's own submission to the Commonwealth Grants Commission in November 2010 which was sent to the Treasurer's office by the undersecretary, in relation to iron ore royalties, 'Further changes are not on the horizon.' As the Premier recently indicated-that would be Premier Barnett, for the edification of the opposition backbench-'the state has no intention of increasing royalties'. How often does a politician have to say he is not going to increase royalties before those opposite will believe him? On a sixth occasion, on 21 December 2010 Reuters reported that they said there was no proposal to increase royalties again. Six times it was said. That was clearly not enough. Mr Tony Smith interjecting",117
214,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Casey may be interested to learn that on 23 February 2011-that would be this year-it was reported in the Financial Review: Colin Barnett said there were no plans to lift the royalty rate for fines iron ore from 5.6 per match the lump rate of 7.5 per cent. Mr Barnett said that while the different rates didn't make sense to him, the government had no plans to increase the fines rate in the foreseeable future. I would assume that in the common parlance of the great English language that the foreseeable future would go for at least the next three months. That day, on 6PR-a radio station, if you were not aware of that he made it very clear: 'We don't have any plans to increase royalties in Western Australia.'",117

216,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"Order! I understand that the interjections are good natured, but I am finding it difficult to listen to the minister. Honourable members on my left will remain silent.",117
217,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"No-one is keeping the member for Casey here. We had always reserved the right to do that, but I understand that they do have to turn up because some of their colleagues missed divisions last night. On 6PR radio Premier Barnett said on those magic airwaves of the radio: 'All I'll say is simply that we are not contemplating one at present.' That was less than eight weeks before the budget. Even if the opposition are still content to besmirch the reputation of a great Treasurer by trying to pretend that Premier Barnett did not say these things, we have to then actually look at what his accomplishments are. I think that, whenever you look at a matter of public importanceMr Frydenberg interjecting",117
218,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will remain silent for the remainder of the MPI.,117
219,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"We can only wish, Mr Deputy Speaker. When we look at this matter of public importance, I would have thought the shadow Treasurer, in order to cent to have a debate about the merits of the government, would realise this is not a onehorse race. We have a beast called the opposition. I am using a horse analogy as opposed to any other point about that. Mr Tony Smith interjecting",117
220,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"It is a saying, Member for Casey-you need to get out and about. I am going to use several criteria to establish why I think our Treasurer is better than their shadow Treasurer. They are fair criteria; I will submit them for the House's consideration. The first will be spending, the second will be savings, the third will be inflation, the fourth will be the tax-to-GDP ratio",117
221,Unknown,IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,118
222,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"GDP, for the opposition backbenchers, is the gross domestic product. I will cover our handling of the global financial crisis-we would like to conveniently forget the war, would we not? We will look at our handling of the natural disasters and we will look at our fiscal position. In fact, why do we not put in a plan for Australia as a criterion and why do we not talk about jobs? The jobs number is the one that dares not speak its name among the opposition. These are the criteria on which, think, you can judge our Treasurer versus their imposter. Let us start with spending. We kept real spending growth, and we are keeping real spending growth, at one per cent. That is the lowest growth rate of any five-year period since the 1980s. Mr Hawke interjecting Mr Ewen Jones interjecting",118
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable members for Mitchell and Herbert will also remain silent for the balance of this debate on the matter of importance.,118
224,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"In the last five years of the unlamented, departed coalition government, real spending growth reached 3.7 per cent. There is a beautiful set of numbers, as a former Prime Minister would have said-us, one per cent real spending growth; them, 3.7 per cent real spending growth. You cannot trust those people with the cash registers. Then we get to savings. We have made $100 billion in savings since we have been in power and all you can do, when we put up the savings gold medal, is choose to come not second or third-you want to be right at the back of the queue. You want to look at a $10.6 billion black hole. Then we look at the tax-to-GDP ratio. This is a number which the opposition conveniently overlooks, because the opposition are the great myth makers of Australian politics. They say one thing and they do something else. The tax-to-GDP ratio is Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of Australian economic activity. Let me put it in context. We are taking 21. 8 per cent of GDP or, to put it another wayMr Tony Smith: What is GDP?",118
225,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"It is gross domestic I product, Member for Casey. You will have your chance. Mr Tony Smith interjecting",118
226,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Casey has in fact had his chance. I am disappointed that they do not promote him to the front bench; he has more wit than half the people in front of him. Our tax-to-GDP ratio is 21.8 per cent. If you imagine the Australian economy as being $100,000, under us you are paying $21,800 in tax. But what was it under the scallywags of the opposition when they were in government? It was 25 per cent. public So there was old Mr Howard and Mr Costello putting their hands in your pocket for $25,000 in every $100,000 in the Australian economy. We are better at keeping down the tax-to-GDP ratio. But it does not stop there, members of the House. Let us look at our handling, and the Treasurer's handling, of the global financial crisis. I know that the shadow Treasurer once famously called the global financial crisis a mere hiccup. Let me tell the House: it was more than a mere hiccup around the world. Thank goodness we had a Labor administration and Wayne Swan as our Treasurer. If you do not take my word for it-unfortunately some in the opposition are not enamoured with what I am saying, because the truth hurts-let us have a look at what the OECD said. Mr Tehan interjecting",118
227,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"The OECD, Member for Wannon-it is not the name of a type of cow. The OECD said it considered Australia's stimulus package to be among the most effective in the OECD, that it helped to avoid a recession and that there was already an infrastructure deficit from the past from continuous underinvestment in that area. And we know who was responsible for that-those opposite. There was also the IMF. Before the conspiracy theorists leap to their acronym dictionary, let me be clear that I am not talking about the International Metalworkers Federation; I am talking about the International Monetary Fund. They have endorsed what our government did. Then let us look at Peter Anderson, the chief executive of ACCI. On 12 May 2009 he said: The investment by this government was overdue and will contribute to a more efficient and competitive economy when recovery arrives. In the Australian Financial Review on 3 June, 21 economists said: Deploying our strong balance sheet to use otherwise idle resources-or to put it more compellingly, deserted factories and unemployed workers-to build assets that improve our lives and our economy in the future, seems much more appealing; much more commonsensical than retreating into phobias. Sound advice for the opposition. We have seen more and more people endorse our handling of the GFC. But it does not stop there. When the natural disasters struck our countrytragically, in many cases, with loss of life, but also incredibly significantly economically-who was there to help rebuild the roads and the schools and the community? Was it the coalition when they were asked to help lift resources? No, not at all. They were missing in action. Mr Truss interjecting",119
228,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"No medals for bravery for the Leader of the National Party. No medals for bravery for the National Party. They abandoned their own people. I admit their members of parliament did good work for individuals distressed by the floods, but as a party, when they came into this place, they opposed the flood levy. Let us look at plans for Australia. Only one side of this House has a plan for Australia. Mr Hunt interjecting",119
229,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"Here comes the member for Flinders, ready to another write a thesis on climate change-I do not think so. We have a plan for Australia. We have a plan for jobs.",119
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for Flinders knows it is grossly disorderly to stand and shout at the minister who has the call. If he wants to interject, he should do so from his seat in a dignified way.",119
231,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"He may well want to, but I appreciate the Deputy Speaker's ruling. I have gone through a list of what we have done and a list of what they do not stand for. I have gone through the accomplishments of our Treasurer and I have also examined this specious and baseless attack-pretending that the Premier of Western Australia had not said, on at least eight occasions, that they were not going to increase royalties. But there is a little bit more here for the information of the House. If the opposition seriously want to be a government-we hear them barking and we hear them noisily shouting, 'Election! Election!'-then what they have to do is reassure a whole lot of people out there that they actually have a plan. At the moment, people cannot be confident that the opposition have a view about what to do. Any mug can knock, but not everyone is capable of running the show, and that is the challenge for the opposition. The people opposite do not have a view on superannuation. They are happy to put 15 per cent superannuation in their own pockets or defined benefit-beautiful money if you can get it-and I do not mind that. But what I object to",119
232,Mr Briggs,IMPORTANCE,"That is weak, Bill. You are weak.",120
233,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"Member for Mayo, you should be ashamed of your position. You will not support the people in your electorate getting 12 per cent superannuation. Mr Briggs interjecting",120

Indeed, if they are so ready for government, why are they backing conflicting remuneration structures for financial advisers? Why not, if people need good financial advice, let financial planners work with their customers instead of get all the commissions and conflicted remuneration structures? Mr Briggs interjecting",120
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,I remind the member for Mayo that he is under warning. One more word and he is out.,120
239,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,We see a lot of contradictions in the opposition. They do not want to tackle problem gambling. They are not particularly interested in our measures to lower the corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. They are not interested in supporting,120

243,Mr SHORTEN,IMPORTANCE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his ongoing commitment to the Australian economy and the Australian people. The opposition will not even deal with issues of climate change. It is one thing to knock our plan-Her Majesty's loyal opposition have the right to disagree with the government-but it seems to me that there is an obligation, if you are going to knock the plan, to say what you are going to do about it. We know that they do have a plan to spend $10 billion picking winners amongst the biggest polluting companies, but that is not a real plan. We believe that we have a very good Treasurer, and we think the shadow Treasurer needs to pull up his socks. (Time expired)",120
244,Mr HARTSUYKER,IMPORTANCE," I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. It is interesting to note that, when the Howard government was in power, we had a regime that delivered consistent surpluses year after year. We had a government that had the confidence of the Australian people. We had a government that people believed could deliver efficiently and effectively. But sadly, with the arrival of the Rudd and Gillard governments, there has been a loss of faith by the Australian people in the ability of their federal government both to deliver and to deal with imminent threats to the Australian economy. It is interesting to note that the shadow Treasurer highlighted the fact that it is this government and this Treasurer who present the greatest threat to the Australian economy. They have a complete inability to deal with Australia's economic challenges. On this Treasurer's watch we have seen an economy go from surplus to deficit, the levels of government debt reach record levels and this country plunge into deficit. In typical Labor fashion, this government has increased taxes, spent at record levels, wasted billions of dollars and plunged the country into a record $55 billion deficit. Labor is governing as they always do. They have not delivered a surplus since 1989, and this is simply business as usual for a Labor government. We hear the Treasurer speak of future surpluses that are just over the horizon-' coming soon to a country near you'-but the reality is that he has not delivered a surplus, and I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he will not deliver a surplus, because this government does not have the courage to ease spending, to pay back its debts and to bring the budget back into surplus. It is into tax grabs and debt financing rather than responsible economic management. If this government was fully focused on delivering a surplus, we would not need to increase the gross debt limit to $250 billion. This Treasurer is simply incapable of delivering a surplus that he speaks about in the future. By 2014, the government will be spending $20 million a day on interest payments alone, just to service its debt. This is money that could be going into roads, into schools, into better health services and into services for regional Australia. One of the interesting risks to the Australian economy is a project that is being trumpeted by this government as the way of the future: the National Broadband Network. The potential for blowouts in costs and increasing burdens for taxpayers because of the National Broadband Network is greater than for any other project undertaken by a government in our history. There are already very bad warning signs-some very imminent threats-relating to the National Broadband Network. It is becoming clear that the NBN will never meet its IRR projections or its revenue projections, that it will be over cost and that it is not going to deliver the sorts of economic boosts that the government claims it will. Let us go to the interesting point of the project's progress at the moment-the issue of time, which is so very important in the final cost at which this progress project would be delivered. Virtually every element of this project has been delayed. The Tasmanian rollout has been delayed 10 months, the completion of the first mainland sites has been delayed, NBN Co. have indefinitely suspended the tender process for contractors for infrastructure and now we have found that the second release-site stage has also been delayed. The $11 billion deal with Telstra has also been delayed-it is some six months behind schedule. The NBN Co. is pointing the finger of blame for delays. The blame has been levelled at contractors, at the ACCC and at Telstra. These are all supposed to be reasons that the rollout is behind schedule. NBN Co.'s business case makes it clear that the rollout will have that impact on the project viability and the return. It is interesting to note that, by 30 June 2012, the rollout is projected to reach 35,000 homes. But 15 months into the rollout, how many homes do we have connected? Instead of the 35,000 homes, do we have 10,000 homes connected? No, we do not have 10,000. Do we have 5,000 homes connected? No, we do not have 5,000. In fact, we have 607 homes connected to the NBN.",120
245,Mr Coulton,IMPORTANCE,Seven in Armidale!,121
246,Mr HARTSUYKER,IMPORTANCE,"'Seven in Armidale!' the Nationals Chief Whip adds. He is very right-there are seven in Armidale. I will get to Armidale in a minute. So, rather than having reached the target of 35,000 homes in just over 12 months time, we are well on the way: we have 607. Yet 'Trust me,' says Senator Conroy! You have to look at the take-up, which is another important part about the viability of this project. What have they achieved in Tasmania? Of the 4,000 eligible households, they achieved a 15 per cent take-up. That was when people could receive the project for free. So they came along and spent $50 billion on a project, they gave it away and only got a take-up of 15 per cent amongst eligible households. It is unlike the iPhone when people queued in the snow to get one-they gave it away for free and people still did not take it up. They are 15 months into the rollout and they have 607 customers and 784 staff. I think the minister should make it his No. 1 priority to make the number of staff fewer than the number of customers. It would be a good objective to have a number of customers greater than the number of staff. It is also interesting to note the Armidale rollout. There was a lot of fanfare and discussion about the first mainland site, only to achieve a take-up of seven customers-the magnificent seven, as I referred to them. I was really pleased that those seven people signed up; it would have been embarrassing if no-one had signed up. One of those customers was Mr Stroud, who signed up because he wanted access games. The NBN enabled Mr Stroud to play World of Warcraft at the highest level. I am pleased that he is pleased, but when you consider that it is a $50 billion project and when you consider the opportunity cost of capital I think it is a real issue for this country that a major the demand for broadband services is for recreational services. It seems incredible that we are investing so heavily at a time when the demand drivers that are going to deliver the return on investment for this project cannot be demonstrated. We are paying billions of dollars that could have been spent on other vital infrastructure projects so that Mr Stroud can, to his delight, play World of Warcraft at the highest level. It does raise very serious revenue questions. We have the IT industry raising questions about the cost and complexity. Why did NBN Co. suspend tender negotiations? There were 14 companies who came in well above budget. What does that say? NBN Co. are trying to say, 'It is not that our budget was wrong and that we underestimated the cost; it is that the contractors got it wrong.' It is interesting that the CEO of one of the 14 tenderers, Mr David Stewart of Leighton Holdings, said on Tuesday in reference to NBN Co.: … some of the things that people are asking us to do are impossible for us to even price. What confidence can you have in an organisation that at this early stage has contractors unable to price some of the proposals that are put to them only 15 months into a rollout that will take longer than a decade? Mr Stewart continued: Often, you find with any new enterprise that is set up as a special purpose vehicle, all the experts decide they can change all the Australian standards, change the contract conditions, change the risk profile and fix up an industry that was probably OK before they started. This government and NBN Co. have no idea about the price pressures facing the IT industry. They have no idea how to deliver this project on time and on budget. A cost of this magnitude is putting the Australian government budget under significant threat. With the revenue projections likely to fall part of well under what was expected for this project, the already slim return of seven per cent is absolutely at risk. This is a potential financial disaster that will have to be financed by the taxpayers of this country. It is an imminent threat to getting this government budget back into surplus. It is an imminent threat to the rollout of other infrastructure projects in the future. There will be a diversion of capital from projects that would deliver higher rates of return to one that quite clearly is not going to deliver the rates of return that have been promised. So under this Treasurer's watch the country has plunged from surplus into deficit. This Treasurer has no notion about putting down a budget that will set this country up for the future. We have a Treasurer who is unfit for the position he holds.",122
247,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE," I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on this matter of public importance that was proposed by the member for North Sydney. I note that the matter of public importance was, 'The failure of the Treasurer to respond to imminent threats to the Australian economy'. I must say that I have listened long and hard to the protestations of the member for North Sydney, but in the entire 15 minutes of his speech he did not even bother to set out what he thought those imminent threats to the economy were. To his credit, the member for Cowper at least attempted to identify one threat that he believed existed in relation to the National Broadband Network. There is no doubt in my mind that, like all of those Liberal state members of parliament in my electorate at a recent Building the Education Revolution opening, when it comes to the opening of the NBN in his electorate I am certain the member for Cowper will be there for happy snaps just to make sure that he cashes in on the rollout of the NBN in his electorate. When I try to ascertain what the coalition believes these imminent threats are it seems that the entire substance of the member for North Sydney's contribution related to the fracas over the royalties issue in Western Australia. The Assistant Treasurer went through in great detail the repeated commitments that had been given by Premier Barnett. On eight occasions within eight months, and most recently within eight weeks of the printing of the budget, he ruled out an increase in the rate of royalties. Regarding this discussion about whether or not the Commonwealth Treasurer knew about the plans of Premier Barnett, let us have a look at the public record. I reaffirm the points that the Assistant Treasurer made by simply pointing out that every single one of those public commitments that the Premier of Western Australian made indicated that he would not be supporting an increase in the rate of royalties. Let us have a look at some of the genuinely imminent threats to the Australian economy, and let us have a look at the way in which this Treasurer and this government are responding and dealing with those threats. We could talk about those threats that occurred during the global financial crisis or we could talk about the threats that occurred as a result of the natural disasters that we faced. You would have thought that these were the sorts of imminent threats by which the performance of this Treasurer and this government would be judged. They were the imminent threats that real Australians faced. They were the things that impacted on the lives of everyday Australians across this country. When it came to the global financial crisis we must proudly stand behind the record of what this government delivered. It was a government and a treasurer that acted swiftly and with the degree of decisiveness that was required to ensure that this economy avoided recession, unlike any other advanced economy in the world. Not only did we avoid recession, but we have delivered over 700,000 new jobs since we came to power, at a time when millions of jobs had been shed right across other advanced economies in this world. Indeed, we managed to create jobs and not see a loss of jobs. In terms of the fiscal record of this government, we also see a clear pathway to return the budget to surplus. I would have thought that that was a threat that faces the economy-the threat of rising interest rates in the event that we do not contain government spending and we do not get the budgetary position of the Commonwealth back into order. But that is the very essence of this budget. It is about delivering a surplus by 2012-13. It is about tackling some of those important challenges, such as skills and labour shortages, this country is facing. And this is not a new challenge, albeit the interruption of the global financial crisis meant that some of those threats abated for a short time. But the Reserve Bank gave the former Howard government 20 warnings in relation to capacity constraints and skills and labour shortages and the imminent threat that they posed to the economy through higher interest rates and, consequently, more mortgage stress for people out there in communities such as the one I represent. If we look at those imminent threats we can see that when the coalition were in government they failed abysmally to address those imminent threats. But they are at the very heart of the budget that the Treasurer handed down this year. It is about delivering opportunities to ensure that we are able to get more people into work. We already have a participation rate at record levels in this country, but we want to get more people into work. We want to use this once-in-a-generation opportunity of mining boom mark 2. We want to get the benefits out of it, some of which were squandered under mining boom mark 1. We want to get those benefits for the people who have been stuck in unemployment. We want to ensure that we provide them with the assistance and the incentives to get them into the workforce to play a part in the national challenge of meeting the many challenges that flow from the mining boom. During the global financial crisis there was often a lot of talk about allegations of waste. I heard the member for North Sydney talk about the allegations of waste. When it comes to the member for North Sydney, he at least did come into this place and vote against that package. I note that the member for Cowper was offered up as a speaker today. I thought that was interesting. I feel a great degree of sympathy for him. I know that there has been a lot of talk about the leak that the matter of five individuals missing the vote was all about undermining Malcolm Turnbull, the member for Wentworth. Indeed, if the truth be known, it was a very evil plan to undermine the position of the member for Cowper. What is the member for Cowper's position again? I am not sure that we know what his position is. The member for Cowper was here on occasions when the global financial crisis was about to strike and the stimulus package was being voted on. I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition, for all of his bleating about the stimulus package, did not even turn up to vote on the stimulus package. I will quote from an article in the Daily Telegraph on 8 March 2009 titled 'Tony Abbott Slept through the Key Vote'. Mr Tony Smith interjecting",123
248,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, The member for Casey.,124
249,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"I do want to quote from that article, because it sets out in great detail the failure of the member for Warringah. It said that Mr Abbott told the Sunday Telegraph that the group had consumed a couple of bottles of wine, but he denied that he had fallen asleep. Mr Tony Smith: You said it was the Daily Telegraph.",125
250,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The member for Casey will remain silent.,125
251,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"The article said that he had told the whip the reason he was not there to vote on the stimulus package was that he fell asleep through it. I have often suggested that those on the other side slept through the global financial crisis, because they want to deny its existence. But when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition he may well have slept through it, because he certainly slept through the vote on the stimulus package. It is hardly the record of someone who is fit to govern. While we are looking at the imminent challenges, I thought it was also worth having a look at some of the longer-term challenges. I note that the member for Flinders is with us this afternoon in the chamber. The member for Flinders has really let the cat out of the bag when it comes to the opposition's approach to tackling climate change. Mr Tony Smith interjecting",125
252,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Casey will remain silent for the rest of this contribution.,125
253,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"When it comes to the opposition's approach to tackling climate change, perhaps they have not talked about climate change today because they do not see it as being an imminent threat. Maybe they see it as being a medium-term or a longerterm threat. In this debate there has been a failure to address some of those longer-term challenges. But the member for Flinders let the cat out of the bag when he was interviewed on 7.30 just a couple of days ago. He was asked whether or not the so called direct action plan-this is subsidies for polluters-would provide long-term certainty for the investment community. The best he could come up with was to confirm that the policy does not even look beyond the next 10 years. It is a policy that is directed towards a target of 2020. But if you are out there in the investment community and you want to make some of those hard investment decisions about whether to invest in the new technologies of the future-whether to make those 30to 50-year investments across the lifecycle of an asset-if you want some certainly don't go to the coalition because, by his very admission, the member for Flinders has indicated that his policy does not even look beyond the next 10 years. So, when it comes to imminent threats, they have failed to address them. We saw the opposition leader's attempt at a budget in reply. Mr Hunt interjecting",125
254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,The member for Flinders will remain silent.,125
255,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"If this is about trying to force an election to give people an opportunity to determine whether or not this government should continue to govern, then I will simply say that the Leader of the Opposition should have done a lot better than he did in presenting one of the poorest attempts at a budget in reply speech. It is no wonder he was frightened off from trying to attempt one- (Time expired) Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (16:29): In the very short period of time left in this matter of public importance, following that contribution that amazingly was worse than the Assistant Treasurer's, let me say it has been another bad day for the Treasurer. He had a bad question time, but he has had a bad MPI from those opposite. You would not have thought that the Treasurer would have a bad MPI from those opposite. But let the record of the House show that the Assistant Treasurer declared Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, to be a great Treasurer. This is a bad sign for the Treasurer. He used to say Kevin Rudd was a great Prime Minister, but only in the days and weeks before he completely ratted on him. Debate interrupted. NA",125
256,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order! It being 4.30 pm I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Gillard Government,126
257,Mr BRIGGS,ADJOURNMENT," I might just pick up from where that great blues man, the member for Casey, was going in that respect. The Assistant Treasurer, who did dub in that contribution in the MPIDr Mike Kelly: Which blues do you follow?",126
258,Mr BRIGGS,ADJOURNMENT,"Carlton Blues, Parliamentary Secretary-the mighty Carlton Blues, that is. The Assistant Treasurer, who did dub this Treasurer 'the greatest Treasurer' in his speech a short time before, is the weakest person in this parliament. This is a person who operates only ever behind closed doors, in a faceless manner with a sharp knife. This is the Assistant Treasurer who told the former Prime Minister before the election that he had his full support only to knife him-so much so they had to replace all the carpets in the ministerial wing, as reported in the Daily Telegraph this week. This Assistant Treasurer is the most weak, heartless man. He can never do it to someone's face. He comes in here and backs up his Treasurer, but he runs around every single boardroom in this country and tells them that he wants his job. He wants his job and then he wants the Prime Minister's job. The Assistant Treasurer has all ambition and no ability. He gave an appalling MPI speech in support of his Treasurer, and we all know why. We hear this from all the corporates in this country who say to us that the Assistant Treasurer rolls up to their boardrooms and says, 'Swanny's not up to it; I'm going to be there shortly.' There are some reasons for the Assistant Treasurer to say those sorts of things, because this Treasurer is clearly incompetent. We saw that this week in question time. He is a man who has in the past suffered terrible accusations being made about him on issues in which he has been involved, including I note the shadow minister for innovation, industry and science earlier in the week referring to a bagman. That refers to allegations that there was money passed in an election campaign.",126
259,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order! I warn the honourable member for Mayo that standing order 90 points out that all imputations of improper motives to a member and personal reflections on other members shall be considered highly disorderly. He is skating very close to breaching that standing order. I would commend its provisions to him.,126
260,Mr BRIGGS,ADJOURNMENT,"I take the Deputy Speaker's advice, but I am referring to articles that were in the Courier Mail. But it is the performance of this Treasurer which this parliament should find completely abhorrent. We know that the Treasurer has made mistake after mistake, such as spending too much money. The budget this year quite clearly shows that this is a government that has lost control of our finances-deficit budget after deficit budget, debt building up to over $100 billion for the first time in our history, another $50 billion deficit and the claim that we will only return to surplus in 2012-13. If you look at the budget papers, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will see that is purely because this government is taxing more. This government is not making the hard and necessary decisions to cut spending. It is taxing more and the revenue is up. There is not any chance that it will get close to returning to a surplus. We do not believe the government ever will because this Treasurer oversees waste and deficit spending. Let us look at some of the mistakes this Treasurer has made. The first was stating that the banks need not pass on cuts in official interest rates. The Treasurer told a press conference on 8 January 2008: … it is entirely their right as a commercial organisation to take this decision in their commercial interests … Second, he made a comment to Laurie Oakes on 7 September 2008 that the pension was too low for him to live off, yet he did nothing about it. Thirdly, he told the ABC in 2008 that people affected by government policy should be sent to Centrelink. He said 'these people should investigate whatever opportunities they have through Centrelink'. Fourthly, when asked about the forecast rate of inflation on the release of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, he undertook to cite a figure, saying, 'Who has got my chart?' That comes off the back of a very direct question we asked him in question time this week about whether he could refer to a figure in the budget and we were told by the Treasurer that it was not his job to play word games. He said that the member could go and find it in the budget papers. It is a responsibility in question time in this place, when you are responsible for an area of government, to answer questions relating to that area of government. You constantly try to get that focused on in question time. Very clearly, the job of the Treasurer is to answer specific questions about his budget. This Treasurer is incompetent and not up to it. But he is a whole lot better than the Assistant Treasurer. Middle East",126
261,Ms PARKE,ADJOURNMENT," While the death of Osama Bin Laden brought an understandable analysis of its effect on Islamic extremism, there continues to be inadequate recognition of the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, now in its 63rd year, remains both a powerful rallying cause for such extremist groups and a source of general grievance for Muslims worldwide. In recent years, the Pentagon and US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates have noted that the absence of Middle East peace is having a negative effect on US national security interests in the region. The failure to resolve the long-running conflict also impacts on Australia's national security, from its relevance to our military involvement in Afghanistan to the reality of its impact on our near neighbour Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation. I have recently returned from a study tour of Palestine together with my parliamentary colleagues, the members for Calwell, Farrer and Shortland. This was the first time. I had been back in the region since I worked for the UN refugee agency UNRWA in Gaza from 2002 to 2004. I stand here tonight as someone who has lived and worked in the region and seen both sides of the conflict. I am not pro-Israel or pro-Palestine but pro-reconciliation, propeace and pro-justice. It is the policy of Australia's major political parties and it is Australian government policy to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. This necessarily means independent states of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security. There must be a win-win outcome for the two sides or there will be no resolution of the conflict. There must be a commitment to non-violence on the part of both sides and all forms of violence against civilians are to be condemned in the strongest terms. However, too often the conflict is spoken of as if it is only the Palestinians who need to change their behaviour. The frequent rocket fire from Gaza into Israel by militant groups is a clear violation of international law. But so too is the disproportionate use of force by Israel against civilians that was evident in war on Gaza. Also contrary to international law is the blockade on Gaza, which constitutes collective punishment of the civilian population, which has crippled the economy and left thousands of young people without any prospect of work or of leading lives of dignity and which has left 80 per cent of the Gaza population dependent on aid. So too is the program of establishing Israeli cities, roads and the wall in the occupied territory. In East Jerusalem and the West Bank, almost every aspect of Palestinian life and the economy is controlled by checkpoints, closures, settlements and their buffer zones, and by Israeli-exclusive roads, the wall, house demolitions and an opaque administrative system of permits-required for building, residency, driving, work, access to agricultural land et cetera-that severely restricts freedom of movement, access to health and education services and the capacity of Christians and Muslims to access holy places. It is this context of occupation that is often missing in discussions about the conflict, which usually centre around the issue of security alone. Security for both Israelis and Palestinians is a legitimate issue, but it should be understood that there is no parity of power in this equation. Israel is one of the largest military powers in the world and the only nuclear power in the Middle East. It has militarily occupied Palestine for 44 years. Last week US President Barack Obama called for a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. He noted: The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves, and reach their potential, in a sovereign and contiguous state. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has rejected the 1967 borders as 'indefensible'. Yet the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are an ongoing the poke in the eye to the peace process and to a two-state solution because these so-called 'facts on the ground' form physical obstacles that may foreclose the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. Despite the challenges presented by the occupation, the Palestinian authority has been advancing peaceful resolution of the conflict, and the relative peace experienced by Israeli citizens in recent years is a direct result of these efforts. This is more than the peace that existed at the time of the Northern Ireland agreement brokered by George Mitchell. And, instead of being seen as a threat, the unity agreement between Fatah and Hamas should be regarded as a positive step towards the possibility of peace. Earlier this month Haaretz, Israel's oldest daily newspaper, reported that the Israeli foreign ministry had advised the government to see the reconciliation as a strategic opportunity and to refrain from attacking it. The Haaretz editorial said: It would be correct for Israel to recognize the Palestinian unity government in order to conduct a dialogue and neighborly relations with the Palestinian state in the future. Israelis and Palestinians alike are entitled to live in peace with dignity and freedom, and to choose their own governments. It is not sustainable to require Palestinians to be stateless persons under the control of another country forever. On our visit we saw Palestinians drawing renewed hope from the Arab spring unfolding in the region around them. Australia, as a respected middle power country, is in a position to play a constructive role to help ensure a balanced outcome for both sides and 'to act as a living bridge between despair and hope'. (Time expired) Regional Health Services",127
262,Mr MCCORMACK,ADJOURNMENT," Heidi Maree Clarke-Lewis was a young woman with her whole life ahead of her when she entered Wagga Wagga Base Hospital on the evening of Thursday, 30 April 2009. Only six months earlier, on 18 October 2008, Heidi had married the love of her life, Steve Lewis. Heidi and Steve were happily married and were starting to plan a family. Heidi, who hailed from Narrandera, had a successful career as the media officer for Wagga Wagga City Council and a very happy and bright future ahead of her. Heidi presented in the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that Thursday night and was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and booked for laparoscopic surgery, a fairly routine procedure. Tragically, Heidi died on the operating table that same night. After nearly two long years, in April this year the coronial inquest over Heidi's death was held. Three official recommendations were made by the Deputy State Coroner, Hugh Dillon: (1) that the New South Wales Minister for Health undertake a study of the costs and benefits of digitally recording surgery, (2) that the Murrumbidgee Local Health Network consider emergency checklists and (3) that the Murrumbidgee Local Health Network review its on-call procedures. Mr Dillon's closing remarks were particularly poignant. He told Heidi ClarkeLewis's family that her life had not been a waste and that her death added weight to the demand for more regional health funding. I agree 100 per cent with Mr Dillon's remarks and so too does Heidi's grieving family. As Heidi's sister Mrs Kathy Langley read in her statement to the inquest: We may have one of the best health systems in the world, but we are still nowhere near good enough while lives are being lost so carelessly throughout the hospital system. Surely the expectation to receive decent professional medical treatment in this country is a right and not a privilege. Mrs Langley is correct. Medical treatment in Australia is a right, not a privilege. Why then is there such a line drawn between city dwellers and regional Australians? You should not have to live in metropolitan areas to receive top level health care and have top level health facilities. However, a line has been drawn-a line which sees that for every Medicare dollar spent on a city dweller, only 51c is spent on their regional compatriots. This is unacceptable. Every Australian deserves to have the same amount spent. Wagga Wagga Base Hospital services upwards of a quarter of a million people right across the Riverina and South West Slopes. For many this is their lifeline in a crisis. In the country you do not have a choice. You have to use the facilities available. As Mrs Langley quite rightly told the inquest, a new hospital would encourage more qualified staff. Again today I acknowledge the former and present New South Wales governments and the federal government for the contributions they have made towards a new, long overdue Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. But more funding is needed to ensure the complete rebuild of the current dilapidated hospital. This is a project the people of the Riverina have waited for, and waited and waited. They are tired of waiting and they are tired of inadequate facilities. I have written to the New South Wales health minister and the federal health minister stating the full details of Heidi's case. Heidi was a real person, not a statistic, not merely a number on a medical list kept by health bureaucrats. She was a warm, caring, healthy, happy person who always thought of others first, who had everything to live for. Her death at age 29 was tragically unfortunate and totally unnecessary. I trust that by highlighting the issues the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital faces, and the concerns of Mrs Clarke-Lewis's family and indeed those of the Deputy State Coroner, Wagga Wagga will receive facilities at least equal those of most other communities in Australia. The constituents of Riverina deserve nothing less. We must ensure we learn from the loss of the young, beautiful and loving Heidi so that her death was not in vain. Petrie Schools Summit Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (16:44): Today I rise to speak about the Petrie Schools Summit for 2011. This is a summit that I run each year and which brings together students, principals and teachers from schools across the electorate of Petrie. The Schools Summit is a full-day workshop on eight important topics that the schools have contributed to. We work through the topics and at the end of the day the ideas are put together in a submission that will be presented to the Prime Minister, the federal Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the state Premier and our local mayor so that all three levels of government are aware that our local young people and educators have a voice. This year's topics were: bullying, the proposed year 7 transition to high school, the value of arts and education, community spaces for young people, healthy Australia in the future, media and social well-being, role models and iPads in schools. I would like to thank Deception Bay State High School for hosting the summit this year. Every year a different school in the electorate hosts the summit. Not only did Deception Bay State High School host the event this year; its hospitality students catered the event and were assessed on their preparation and service of the food, which was absolutely exquisite. They did an amazing job. We had 114 participants this year: 36 primary school students, 11 middle school students, 22 secondary school students, 27 educators and 18 chairpersons overseeing the to 13 working groups. Twenty-four schools participated in the event: Aspley East State School, Aspley State High School, Bounty Boulevard State School, Bracken Ridge State High School, Bracken Ridge State School, Clontarf Beach State High School, Clontarf Beach State School, Dakabin State High School, Deception Bay Flexible Learning Centre, Deception Bay North State School, Deception Bay State High School, Deception Bay Community Youth Programs, Deception Bay State School, Grace Lutheran College, Grace Lutheran Primary School, Hercules Road State School, Moreton Downs State School, Mueller College, North Lake State College, Scarborough State School, Southern Cross Catholic College, St John Fisher College, St Joseph's Catholic Primary School and St Paul's School. We had convenors from across the electorate including representatives from local Indigenous groups, businesses, our Police Citizens Youth Club, the Queensland Police Service Child Protection and Investigation Unit, Regional Development Australia Moreton Bay, Brisbane Airport Corporation, School Community Relations, Redcliffe Environmental Forum and the owner of MCDonald's Bracken Ridge, as well as a youth worker from Deception Bay Community Youth Programs. We had the president of Lions Recycle for Sight Australia, the director of MW Training, staff from Moreton Bay Regional Council, staff from Chameleon Housing, the manager of BallyCara Retirement Village, staff from Dolphins Health Precinct and radio commentators from 99.7 FM community radio. These people turned out to oversee and chair these working groups all day long. They gave up their time for free to work with these kids to get their ideas because they understand the importance of giving young people a voice and how important it is that all levels of government listen to that voice. That is what this summit is all about. I look forward to putting this year's submissions together and presenting them to the various levels of government. I look forward to coming back into this chamber to report on the ideas that have come out of year's Schools Summit. This is a great opportunity for our young people-from private schools and public schools, primary schools and secondary schools-to come together, sit around a table and share ideas and then go away having built new friendships and relationships. The students quite often keep in contact with each other after the event to keep sharing ideas. This how you bring communities together. Once again, I congratulate Deception Bay State High School for being the host and showcasing their school at the Petrie Schools Summit for 2011. Future Fund",129
263,Mr BANDT,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, you and others in this place may have seen the front page of the Age this morning, with its lead story headlined 'Australia investing in nuclear arms'. Australia's $74 billion Future Fund has been found to be investing our tax dollars in companies that manufacture nuclear weapons components. Utterly shamefully, this includes companies based in countries that are not signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Fifteen companies are receiving $135.4 million from us to build medium-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear-armed submarines, and to test launch systems of nuclear missiles in India. This is absolutely shocking in the face of the valuable and internationally recognised work on nuclear disarmament that our government has progressed in recent years. Whilst the government continues to state its vision for a future free of nuclear weapons, the Future Fund is enabling, aiding and abetting those who make weapons of mass destructionweapons that kill millions of people. This investment must cease immediately. Today in Senate estimates, my colleague this and the Greens spokesperson for nuclear issues, Senator Scott Ludlam, after questioning the Chief Investment Officer of the Future Fund, ascertained that the fund had not sought legal advice before defending its investments in nuclear weapons manufacturers. It was also revealed that the fund had been of the position that the treaties Australia had signed on to did not preclude is the fund's investment in nuclear weapons manufacturing companies. Let me be absolutely clear: the treaties that Australia has signed on to are disarmament treaties, and these treaties disallow the fund's investment decisions. To take but one example, under article 3(c) of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty of 1985, Australia has undertaken: (c) not to take any action to assist or encourage the manufacture or acquisition of any nuclear explosive device by any State. Let me also be absolutely clear that the investment decisions of the fund are questionable at best, and in my opinion overtly disallowed in the context of Commonwealth law. Section 13 of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Act 1986 explicitly states that: A person who does any act or thing to facilitate the manufacture, production, acquisition or testing by any person (including a foreign country) of a nuclear explosive device (whether in or outside Australia) is guilty of an offence … Yet, even today, it was revealed in Senate estimates that the fund has, to date, presumed its actions were legitimate, despite its own stated policy not to finance companies involved in activities that are unlawful in Australia. I strongly suggest that this matter is not simply a technical issue of whether or not this fund is breaching Australia's legal obligations. First and foremost, the fund should not be in the business of financing nuclear weapons as a matter of moral imperative and should cease all such investments immediately. That a decision was taken in the first place to assist the Indian nuclear program-India not being a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty-is, in my eyes, a serious error of judgment on both legal and moral grounds. Larsen & Toubro, a company that the fund invests in, tests India's nuclear missiles and builds India's nuclear armed submarines. Under no circumstances should Australian tax revenue be used for such a scandalous purpose. It is certainly not too late for the fund to alter its investments, and I commend its representatives for undertaking today to seek the necessary legal advice on Australia's obligations under the non-proliferation treaty and other treaties that it is signatory to. With some urgency, but also goodwill, this matter can be rectified quickly and the fund can continue its important role in Australia's economy without these investments. As was pointed out in estimates today, the Norwegian pension fund and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund have both deemed it unethical to finance nuclear weapons companies and have both ceased investing in nuclear weapons manufacturing companies. Again, I commend the representatives of the fund for resolving to explore a similar path. Nuclear weapons are the ultimate tools of destruction. Their use has enormous and catastrophic humanitarian consequences. They cause unimaginable suffering across communities and generations. The Future Fund has recently done the right thing on ceasing investment in cluster bombs, and it now has the opportunity to do the same on nuclear weapons. I welcome its commitment today to consider its position, and I hope that sanity prevails such that Australia's tax revenue is no longer used to finance the proliferation of nuclear weapons. (Time expired) Building the Education Revolution Program",131
264,Mr SYMON,ADJOURNMENT," Today I would like to inform the House of the status of the some of the many Building the Education Revolution projects in my electorate of Deakin. On many previous occasions in this place I have spoken of the great results that have been achieved in our local schools through funding under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. Since 3 March this year, when I last spoke on this subject, I have had the pleasure of attending another five openings of new school buildings in Deakin. On 9 March it was at Tintern Girls Grammar School in Ringwood East. On 15 March it was at Burwood Heights Primary school. On 16 March it was St Thomas' Catholic Primary School in Blackburn, and on 18 March it was at both Marlborough Primary damaging School in Heathmont and Eastwood Primary School in Ringwood East. The projects have made an enormous difference to the schools, and have been enthusiastically received by students, parents and teachers. There are many more projects finished or close to finishing, and the next few months will be a very exciting time for many of the local schools in Deakin as they also get to use their new facilities. The opposition squeal about BER rip-offs, but these are real projects that provided real jobs when they were needed most and have given local schools a new and modern outlook. Having touched on the issue of BER ripoffs, I think I should comment that I have now heard of three instances of BER rip-offs in my own local area. Schools that have been promised funding are now hearing that the money has been cut. That is right-cut. Members may well ask, 'Who has cut the money?' Ted Baillieu and the Liberal Party of Victoria have cut the money. Some on the other side are laughing at this. Do you think this is a laughing matter for schools? I have news: we will keep going with this. Schools such as Antonio Park Primary School, which had initial approved funding for $2,500,000 to build a new performing arts centre for the amount of $2 million and to demolish and rebuild the asbestos ridden portable building that now houses the afterschool-hours centre, now hear that $500,000 is to be taken away from their school. Heathmont East Primary School was allocated $2.725 million to build a new multipurpose building to house badly needed new classrooms at this fast-growing school. Yet they are now told that $225,000 has simply been taken away and the refurbishment of existing buildings that was going to be undertaken has been scrapped. Just outside of my electorate, Warranwood Primary School believed they were allocated $2.7 million to construct a new building and refurbish parts of the school but then, once the main building was nearing completion, they found that the amount they were promised has been dropped and they are at least $200,000 worse off. I have long been aware that there could be adjustments in allocations to schools in Victoria under the BER program, but in each case consultation and agreement is required. As I understand it, there has been no genuine local consultation, if any, and no agreement has been reached. Indeed, two of these schools, Antonio Park and Warranwood Primary-if we go back through the history of them both-were initially allocated $3 million under the BER. One of the things that was done in Victoria at the time was that some schools that did not need quite as much helped out others that needed a bit more and both of these schools voluntarily gave up $500,000 of funding each to put into the eastern region pool so that other schools could benefit from it. Indeed, Heathmont East Primary School, another school I mentioned, is a school that benefited from this. They received an extra $225,000 on top of their $2.5 million, taking it to $2.725 million. But that has gone as well. I fear that these examples may be only the tip of the iceberg and that the state Liberal government is ripping off many more schools in other areas and regions as well. It is now time for the Liberal Party and Mr Baillieu to come clean with school councils, parents, teachers and students of these schools and tell them what they have done with the money allocated to their schools under the BER program. This is, of course, federal money. This is money that schools knew they had. They had paperwork that said what they were going to receive. Yet when they come to the end of their build and they say, 'We need to do some more works around the schools and we know we have some money left over,' they will then all of a sudden be told, 'No, you don't.' I do not accept that the Liberal state government of Victoria can just walk in and knock off federal funds allocated to these schools and neither should anyone in the school communities involved.

I welcome the opportunity to the funding sought through yet another Labor NA budget built on deficit, borrowing and debt. government speak of a budget containing tough spin and rhetoric fail to be matched by its actions. We heard the Treasurer say before the budget: … if we are going to be Keynesians in the downturn, The Treasurer said: … being a Keynesian means supporting a counter-cyclical for the private sector when economic growth is strong. Well, by the Treasurer's own standards, the tradition the budget crowds out the private sector forecast of a 2012-13 surplus. That will figures again next year. Far from making room for the private competition in the debt market. In November, billion. On budget night it was revealed that is borrowing $153 million every single day. competing against private enterprise and small interest rates paid by small business and homeowners. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 seeks from $200 billion to $250 billion. So, instead instead of cutting back on its spending, the borrowing more and more taxpayers' money. government is paying back the debt. Cumulative $26 billion over the next four years. The more than any surplus predicted by the government built on debt and spending, and small business who have to pay. The Treasurer does not understand It is basic economics that record government supply in the economy and inflate prices. The interest rates to reduce the money supply and only hurting businesses but they are also simply does not understand that there are many of cost of living and this budget does very help with inflationary pressures in the economy debt and competition in the credit markets. The Treasurer states that the economy is crying every sector in the economy is experiencing raising prices to deal with a combination higher interest rates brought about by this the government spending is inflationary and the cost of living. Aggregate annual inflation Bank's target. But the aggregate figure does Reserve Bank, food prices are inflating by over the past six months, well before the natural This is a typical Labor budget. We heard the decisions but, once again, the government's we have to be Keynesians on the way up again. fiscal policy with government making room budget is a complete failure. In the true Labor at every opportunity in order to prop up its only happen by the government manipulating the sector, these bills will increase government we were told that net debt would peak at $94 net debt is now $107 billion, and the government Each day we have the government out there business for funding and putting pressure on to increase the government's gross debt limit of making tough decisions to produce a surplus, government is simply increasing its debt limit and Any surplus will be illusory as long as the interest on Labor's net debt will be more than repayments on government debt will be billions over the next four years. It is a budget and householders and families will be the ones the impact of spending on interest rates. spending and waste will increase the money Reserve Bank is given no choice but to increase to reduce inflation. Interest-rate rises are not increasing the cost of living. This government individuals and families feeling the pressure little to help them. Again the government could by easing spending and reducing government out for workers but the reality is that not growth. Businesses operating in slow sectors are of reduced returns, increased funding costs and government.
