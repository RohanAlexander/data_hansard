1,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"A day OT two ago, the honourable member for'Brisbane asked, on behalf of the honourable member for Macquarie, if inquiries could be made into complaints by lads employed . in the Bathurst Railway ""Workshops in reference to the conditions under which they have to drill. The reply with which I have been furnished is as follows: The Commandant, 2nd Military District, reported that a complaint was received from one trainee employed at the Bathurst Railway Workshops. This trainee stated that insufficient time was allowed to permit him to appear on parade at the proper time. The case has been investigated, and the Commandant states that ho will consult with the Railway Commissioners in the matter. FEDERAL CAPITAL WATER . SUPPLYANDSEWERAG E.",4
2,Mr STORY,Unknown,Will the Minister for Home and Territories lay on the table the report of Mr 0. E . Oliver on the water supply and sewerage scheme for Canberra ?,4
3,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The report is a long one, and would .cost a lot to print. As the estimates of expenditure in connection with the' Capital have been largely cut down, I have thought it best not to lay the report on the table, but I shall be glad to let honourable members see it . SOLDIERS' RATIONS .",4
4,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"As butter is a wholesome and nourishing food, will the Assistant Minister for Defence arrange for that article of diet being supplied to the men in camp! . Mr GROOM - The honourable member for Nepean has asked a similar question. He wishes to know whether the New Zealand scale of rations cannot be adopted. It is true that New .Zealanders get butter and condensed milk, but the Australian soldier is on the whole better off than the New Zealand soldier. . Both prior to embarkation are paid 5s. a day, but after embarkation the Australian soldier gets 6s. a day, of which Is. is deferred pay, and the New Zealand, soldier gets only 5s. per day, of which 3s. are deferred pay. At the present time the Australian dietary is on a liberal scale, and more than is absolutely necessary for the requirements of the men. In certain camps soldiers are obtaining condensed milk as an "" in lieu "" ration.",4
5,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Why do they not get it in all the camps? Mr GROOM . « - It is open to them to do so, but were the Government to give as an extra..the New Zealand rationof 2 oz. of butter, and an eighth of at in of condensed milk per man, the cost for 30,000 men would be £375 a day, and if 4 oz. of butter were given, £625"" a .day. Our dietary scale is a liberal one, and as "" in lieu "" rations can be given, it is not considered'advisable to alter it . ORDER OF BUSINESS .",4
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Will the Prime M i nister say what is to be the order of business today?,4
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The first business will be the delivery of the Budget statement by the Treasurer. Afterwards the Assistant Minister for Defence will move the second reading of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill , and the Minister for Home and' Territories will move the second reading of the Naturalization Bill . Finally, the Publio Service Bill will be dealt with. The War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill will not be proceeded with until tomorrow. REFUSAL TO LO AD STEAMER . - COST OF LIVING .",4
8,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the of the country. steamer Houtmann, has left the port Melbourne for foreign parts half empty because the wharf labourers refused load her?",5
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not know second 'whether the steamer has left yet, but have been informed that the wharf living labourers* decline to load her, or, I '.stand, to coal her. In this port the wharf labourers and the stevedores belong to two distinct unions, both of which belong to the same federation - The stevedores it was then. assist in loading on, the ship itself, while the wharf labourers are employed on the wharf. It is the latter who have declined to load this vessel. stevedores are ready to work. received a quasi-official report circumstances, and I am getting a full report, which I shall make available to-. morrow. I Bhall then state the policy of the Government in regard to the matter. partment?",5
10,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Is it not alleged reason the wharf labourers are taking the action the Prime Minister has referred to, is the high prices charged for I desire also to-know whether the Governmember-rment have considered the question of the high cost of living, and what is their policy in regard thereto?",5
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is true that the reason put forward as a pretext by ' the wharf labourers for their refusal to handle cargo is that the exporta^ tion of this wheat or flour might somo effect on the price of bread. - representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation waited urjon me as a deputaister tion yesterday, and' I then put forward 'certain facte which they made' no attempt to refute. Those facte were very clear, and a complete answer to any of the stateIs ments made by the wharf labourers, who are, I am perfectly sure, the dupes signing and cunning men in our toral midst- . Mr MATHEWS - Why not say that it is tax! German gold? Mr HUGHE'S - I am not alluding the honourable member. The facts show conclusively that 'bread is sold in Australia at a lower .rate than in any one of the belligerent countries-that bread is little, if any, higher in price than it was in pre-war days-and that there 'is no room for rigging t i e market in regard to wheat and flour, because this is all, or practically all, vested in the Government The industry is under of the control of the Government, and the whole of the receipts therefrom go through to the channel of the Government direct into the pockets of the producers. . As to the part of the question, the policy of I the Government in regard to the cost of is precisely the same as that of the underGovernment of which the honourable member for Capricornia was a member. The cost of bread is exactly the same now as . DYSENTERY REMEDIES .",5
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"On Priday, the 3rd The instant, Mr Finlayson, for Mr Nicholls, I have asked the Minister representing the Minof the ister for Defence, upon noticeFor what reason waa the offer of Mr. Niel Featherstone for the free use of his dysentery remedies refused by the Defence Dethat the The reply then given wasInquiries are being made, and the honourable member will be informed as soon as possible. . food? I am now able'to inform the honourable The position is that Mr Featherstone has been asked to furnish the nature and particulars of his specific to enable an opinion to be arrived at. it is not the practice of the Department,. I may add,, to experiment on soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force. have UNIFORM ROLLS ANDTAXATIO N Some FORMS.",5
13,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,Does the Prime Minrecognise the great inconvenience existing in the present duplication of election rolls and land and income tax returns for the Commonwealth and State? it the intention of the Government to introduce legislation this session for the of depurpose of providing-(a ) uniform elecrolls; (5) uniform returns for income tax; (c)' uniform returns for land,5
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government does to recognise the great inconvenience caused .by the present duplication of electoral rolls and land and income tax returns. The Government, through its representatives, at the .last Premiers' Conference arranged for the preparation of one roll for State and Commonwealth, and one ret u r n for Commonwealth and State in come taxes. This alteration is being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and the delay is not to be - attributed either to this or the State Governments. It is purely a question of machinery; and the various Taxation Departments, Commonwealth and State, have the matter in hand. PRECAUTIO NS AGAINSTPLAGUE . ister",5
15,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the published deaths in India of 6,000,000 of people from plague, will the Government, bearing in mind the myriads of mice in festing the various States, instruct all their surgical and medical Departments to collaborate with the State medical Departments to take adequate precautions against the introduction of plague rodents from the East?",6
16,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Yes . WAR - TI ME PROFITS TAX ASSESSMENT EILL .,6
17,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of the Treasurer's invitation to honprable members to give due notice of any amendments they desire to move in the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill , I desire to know whether, the righb honourable gentleman himself will give us due notice of any amendments he proposes ?",6
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes , I shall be very glad to do so. AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL PORCE. TRANSFERS : TUBERCULOSIS IN CAMPS : LAND EOR RETURNED SOLDIERS.",6
19,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"What is the reason that soldiers in camp are allowed to transfer to the artillery, seeing that .infantry are required at the Front, and that the departure of artillery from Australia seems a very remote contingency ?",6
20,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I am not aware of any reason; but I shall make inquiries and in f o rm the honourable member.,6
21,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Seeing that the health of the people of the Commonwealth is of paramount, importance, will the Prime Minister immediately communicate with the Premiers of the various States in order to ascertain' what action, if any, the State Governments are taking with a view to the reduction of tuberculosis in camp 1 >",6
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall,, of course, take whatever action is necessary to deal with this matter,. but I "" cannot help observing that, as we have already had a reference to the plague, and I now am asked about tuberculosis, it is evident we shall have to amend the Litany and pray, "" From plague, tuberculosis, and the Opposition, good Lord, deliver us!""",6
23,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Is the Prime M in aware of any reason for the refusal of the Queensland Government to join in the scheme for making financial provision for the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, as agreed, by the Commonwealth Government at the Premiers' Conference held in January last.",6
24,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes , I am aware of the reason. The reason put forward by Mr Hunter, acting on behalf of the Queensland Government, was that the proposal involved an undue interference with the rights of the States, and that, therefore, he was unable to recommend, its adoption by his Government. I do not agree with that view, but that was the reason given. ARMY RECRUITS. MEDICAL INSPECTION.",6
25,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Wit h reference to the statement made last Thursday week by the honourable member for Brisbane that it had ""been announced in the press that a Select Committee had been appointed to inquire into the medical inspection of recruits for the' Army, I now desire to intimate that a cablegram has been despatched to the Imperial Government, requesting that copies of the report be forwarded to Australia. CONSUMPTION OF HONEY.",6
26,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In view of the extension of apiculture, will the Prime Minister endeavour to make available for the export' of honey portion of the limited shipping space available, and also seek to popularize the use of honey in camps in Australia, as is done in America and elsewhere 1",6
27,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I assume that the honourable member refers to a statement made yesterday by a deputation which. waited upon me. I shall endeavour to do what) he has suggested. MAILS TO EUROPE.,6
28,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"H as the Postmaster-General considered the desirability of sending Australian letters by way of San Francisco, and thence under the American .flag to England?",7
29,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Department is , making usb of every available avenue in order to continue as well as practicable the mail service between Australia arid Europe. COST OF LIVING . PRICE FIXING-QUEENSLAND - MEAT",7
30,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister inform the House when the Government propose to attempt to reduce the high cost of living?,7
31,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The fact has probably escaped the honourable member's attention that the Government have been directing their attention to that matter for a considerable time. honourable member is not aware that maximum prices are fixed for a number of commodities, amongst them being the staple products upon which the people live. Prices are fixed for flour, wheat and its by-products, sugar, butter, and rabbits. Of course, all these things are beneath the honourable gentleman's notice. Mr . TUDOR - Does the Government propose to regulate the price of meat, the increase in which exceeds that of any of the other commodities he has mentioned ? Mr HUGHES:-The honourable gentleman will remember what he did in regard to this matter during the time he was in office. I am sure that you, sir, would be only too glad to afford the House an opportunity of hearing from the honourable member what he did, so that we might go and do likewise. The honourable member knows perfectly well .what has been the position in regard to meat, and he is as well acquainted as any man with the many difficulties in connection with the regulation of its price. It is practically impossible to regulate the price of meat unless we regulate the price of cattle on the hoof. I know of no way - and in this regard I sit at the feet of the honourable member-of compelling a man to raise stock except at such nrices as will pay him, nor do I know of any means by which human nature can be so changed as to immolate itself and sell in any market other than the . . best. The workers will not do so, and honourable members of the Opposition would be the first to blame them if they did. I would, at any rate. The man who grows meat is no less a producer than the man who works on the wharf. What we have to do, if possible, is to hold the scales evenly between all sections of society. I invite honourable members sitting in Opposition, and also those people outside who are seeking to mislead the unfortunate men who are compelled to work on the wharfs for their living, to pull this chestnut out of the fire, to explain: how the price "" of EMBARGO. living-meanin g thereby the prices of wheat, flour, sugar, butter, rabbits, and so forth-ca n be reduced below its present level, except by the exploitation of the man who produces those commodities, and who works, at least, as hard as any other person in the community.  taken any steps to have the embargo Probably the placed by a Labour Government on the export of beef and mutton from Queensland removed t ",7
32,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The embargo which was formerly in existence has .been removed, arid I do not think that any honourable member opposite would defend the imposition of iti.",7
33,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Will the Prime M i nister have investigations made into the accuracy of statements that have. been made that stock and station agents in Melbourne and elsewhere are limiting the supplies of stock to the market every week in order to keep up the price of meat?,7
34,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall be pleased to make inquiries into the operation of any rings or arrangements that have a tendency to exploit the public, or to create an artificial scarcity. Every honourable member, no matter on whab side of the House he sits, is elected tb see that all sorts ""and conditions of men get a fair deal. I am perfectly persuaded that honourable members opposite will not say that the man who grows meat has hot the right to get a fair, return for his labour. On the other hand, no honourable member on this side will say-certainly , I do not say-that any one has the right to create an artificial scarcitiy and fill his pockets at the exT pense of both the consumer and the producer. I shall make inquiries in order to expose such conduct, and if it is found that certain persons are acting as stated, I shall take steps to see that they are punished.  aware that the Queensland Government are preventing f at cattle from passing to other parts of Australia owing to the fact that beef cattle are affected by the tick pest, which is an imaginary complaint?",7
35,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have a great reverence for "" t i c k ,"" as have most men who have known adversity, but i l am not aware to what extent the Government of Queensland are using the tick danger as a means of preventing the movement of cattle southwards. I am sure that the honourable member for Calare would not sugfest that the precautions which are necessary to prevent the spread of such a very serious disease should not be taken. On the other hand, I quite agree with him that it should not be made a pretext for other action. However, I shall make in quiries into the matter.  Minister know that most of the f at cattle and sheep are sold in the paddocks in country districts, and not in. saleyards, as alleged by the honourable member for Maribyrnong? Therefore, the stock and station agents have nothing whatever. to do with the increase in prices. Mr SPEAKER:-Order ! The honourable member must not debate the matter.",8
36,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I confess that I know nothing of the manner in which sheep and cattle are sold. I know thab in New South Wales they are sold in the yards at Homebush, and I suppose the same conditions prevail in Victoria. I presume thati stock are sent down to saleyards in order to suit the interests of the seller. I can hardly conceive that stock and station agents as such, unless they are the owners of the sheep or cattle, can withhold them from the market. » MILITARYPAY OFFICE.",8
37,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask a question in reference to a case that has just been brought Under my notice, viz.: - The wife of ex-Sergeant Wood, with 722 days' service with the Australian I m perial Force, died on the -29th A p r i l , leaving two children, but no money reached those children from the Pay Office until yesterday,- when *- sum of £ 9 ""15s. was paid._ My question is whether the officer in the Department who was guilty of leaving these orphans without means of support will be punished, and whether steps will be taken to prevent such a thing occurring again?",8
38,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall have inquiries made in to ' the matter immediately.,8
39,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"I ask the Honorary Minister whether the Departmental Commission appointed to inquire into the workings of the Pay Oflice at Victoria Barracks has finished its deliberations, and when its report will be made' available to honourable, members ?",8
40,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If the honourable member will repeat his question tomorrow, I shall have inquiries made in the meantime. YOUTHFUL RECRUIT PUNISHED.",8
41,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Is the Honorary Minister aware that there is a youth sixteen years of age undergoing twenty-one days' confinement in the Bendigo camp ? He enlisted when he was fifteen years of age, and any one should have seen that he was not eighteen years old. Will the Honorary Minister have inquiries made with a view to releasing this ' ' criminal'' ?",8
42,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall have inquiries made into the matter, and if the honourable member will repeat his question tomorrow, I will endeavour to furnish him with an answer. SMALL ARMS FACTORY. PLANT AND OUTPUIT.",8
43,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Did the contract entered into between the Couunonwealth Government and Messrs. Pratt and Whitney, New South Wales, for the supply of necessary plant, for the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, provide that the plant should turn out a rifle interchangeable in all its parts with tha rifle then approved and in use by the British Government? 2. Is the rifle now being made at Lithgow interchangeable with that now approved and in use by the British Government? 3. Is the number of rifles now being turned out at Lithgow equal to the stipulated and proved capacity of the original plant, plus that estimated from the plant since added, allowing for the double shift of workmen employed? 4. Have statements 'showing the annual expenditure and output of the factory been presented, and what year is covered by the statement last presented? 5. Can the cost to the Commonwealth of. each finished rifle be ascertained statement. If so, what is the cost?",8
44,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Yes. 2. Yes, but a slight alteration would be required before the ammunition now used in France could be effectively used. Steps have been initiated to alter the Australian rifles accordingly. 3. Owing to reasons not connected with the plant the number of rifles now being turned out is not equal to the stipulated capacity for increases of plant and double shift. , - 4. Yes. The statement for the year ended 30th June, 1916, will shortly be presented Parliament. 5. Yes. For the year 1915-1916 the actual cost per rifle was £7 17s. 8d. AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE.

The number of members of the Ausmade. tralian Imperial Force who have been sentenced to the death penally? 3. The number of cases where the death penalty'has been carried into effect?",9
46,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The compilation of the information asked for would involve reference to the awards Commanding OfBcers from the the war, and in the absence of proper records ' in the early part of the war it would not be possible to'arrive at any accurate result. compile a record of Commanding Officers' awards abroad, the individual records of over 300,000 men would have to be searched.' statistics of this kind are collated. 2 and 3. Some sentences of death have passed, but none have been executed. CONCENTRATION CAMPS. INTERNMENT OF ENEMY SUBJECTS.",9
47,Mr EINLAYSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister for upon notice I. How many personsare at present interned in ce^w.ntration camps in Australia? : i . 2. How many of these were-(a. ) born in Australia, ('&) born in enemy countries, (c) born in the territory of the Allies, (d) born from such in neutral territory? 3. Will the Government consider the advisability of separating the Australian-born into the ternees from the others? 4. Will the Minister cause an investigation to be made as to whether the general conditions and arrangements of the concentration camps in the sighting are satisfactory?",9
48,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as foi-low:1. On the 1st July, 1917, 5,411 men, besides . allowing 101 women and children at Bourke. 2. Interned persons are not classified according to birthplace, but according to nationality. to Information aa to birthplaces could be compiled only by examining the record of each person, which would involve a gTeat amount of work and no result of any value to the Department of Defence. 3. Consideration is at present being given"" to this matter, and instructions have been issued for the preparation of plans and an estiof cost. The separation of the Australian-born internees will involve a re-arrangement of the present buts at the Holdsworthy Camp. A decision will be given as soon as the necessary particulars are to hand. 4. The Minister has at various times sent special officers to inquire and report, and he that the general conditions and arrangements at the concentration camps are satisfactory.

52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Approximately, 18 per cent, on total amount of direct labour and material charges. No engineering work was carried out at the New Pier, all such work being done by separate agreement. 2. In 1016, the average overhead charges were 46 per cent, on direct labour and 10 per cent, on direct material charges. At Cockatoo Island all, engineering work required on transports is done at the yard. This work, involves heavier overhead charges than ordinary fitting work.

Many disadvantages result from such delay, and successful effort has been madeto lay the Estimates for 1917-18 before' Parliament at this early date after the close of the financial year.

To get a complete view of the Commonwealth finances, it is necessary not only to look at the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which has just been referred to, but also at the expenditure out of Loan Funds. The policy of paying for permanent works out of Loan Funds, which has been hitherto followed to some extent by the Commonwealth, and is followed by ail the States, was not adhered to in the financial year 1916-17. ' In the present financial year, however, it is proposed to pay out of loan for works, which axe detailed in the Estimates, and which are estimated to cost £2,742,725 .

It is hoped and' believed that the co-operation of the States will be secured, and that . in future taxpayers will be relieved. It is the intention of the Government to urge the State Governments to adopt the Federal Income Tax Act as their own, and to authorize the Commonwealth Taxato tion Department to collect the State taxes at rates fixed by the State Governments. The Conference of officers adopted uniI n the pre- form definitions for ""improved value,"" "" value of improvements,"" and "" unimproved value,"" the definitions agreed upon being those which appear in the' Federal Land Tax Assessment Act. Approval by the various Legislatures will enable Federal and State land tax to be levied on common values"", settled by one authority. Transfer of Part of Unexpended London .Balances. ' For some years it has been the practice of the Treasury, when goods year, is are ordered in Great Britain, to set aside money in order to pay for the goods when 1915-1916 is delivered. The money was transferred from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the credit of a Trust Account known as had no direct the "" London Liabilities Account,"" The result is that money is carried forward from year to year, because in some cases many months-and even years-elaps e between the time when the money is set aside and the time of payment for the goods. The usual practice is to meet expenditure out of current revenue, and this is followed by the Commonwealth in relation to expenditure within Australia. . Under existing circumstances there is neither reason nor necessity for storing up money to meet payments in London long before it is required. The balance of moneys lying in the ""London Liabilities Account"" on 31st March, 1917, was £4,591,776, and of this £2,925,291 belonged to the Consolidated Revenue. The proposed transfer to the Consolidated Revenue Fund is £825,355. Expenditure out of Revenue, not In cluding War. The total expenditure out of Revenue, not including war, is estimated at £24,174,481 in 1917-1918, including £1,257,617 for new works. The actual expenditure last year was £26,526,026, including £4,301,530 for new works. A more useful comparison may be made by omitting payments to"" the States, new works, and (for last year) the repayment to the Australian Notes Fund. will remain what may be called the expenditure on ordinary services, and the position isOrdinary ServicesEstimate 1917-18 Actual 1016-17 Increase ..

It may, however, be said that while as much economy as is reasonable has been exercised, it has not' been considered advisable to sacrifice efficiency or to act inconsiderately towards the employees of the Government.

Total expenditure on account of the war .. 212,741,509 Included in the estimate of expenditure - out of loan in 1917-18 is an amount of £26,000,000, which is due to the British Government. Most of the expenditure on the Australian Imperial Eorce is made direct by the Australian Govermnent, but in addition very heavy expenditure is made by the British Government, principally for the maintenance of the troops at the Front, and the supply to them of munitions. The estimated expenditure by the British Government in respect of the Australian Imperial Force, from the commencement up to 30th June, 1917, was £28,500,000, and up to 30th June, 1918, it is estimated that a further amount of £29,750,000 will be required. The Commonwealth bad repaid £5,000,000 up to 30th June, 1917, and since that date is paying £3,500,000 more, at the rate of £500,000 a week. The British Government has been generous in this matter, and has not even suggested that payment should be made; but, of' course, it is in-' tended that, as soon as possible, the indebtedness shall be reduced. The payment to the British Government is dependent upon several contingencies, chiefly relating to the overseas sale of Australian produce, and the raising of sufficient amounts of loan in Australia. Included in the estimate of expenditure out of War Loan are an amount of £2,850,000 for advances to the States for Sir John Forrest. the construction and erection of silos for wheat storage, and an amount of £2,000,000 to be advanced to the States for the purpose of settling returned £ soldiers on the land. This £2,000,000, and the £1,000,000 to be provided for general repatriation purposes out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, make, in all, £3,000,000, which it is estimated will be sufficient to meet the expenditure on re189,045,757 patriation during 1917-18. Expenditure out of Loan for Works. The proposed expenditure for 1917-18 on works to be paid for out of loan may be 214,880,673 summarized as follows:2,139,164 £ Naval Bases, Works, and Establishments ... 050,000 Acetate of Lime Factory 53,403 General Arsenal 200.000 Perth General Post Office, towards cost 45,000 Contribution under River Murray Waters Act 1915 90,000 Commonwealth Bailways 676,161 Conduits and laying wires underground 270,811 Construction of Fleet 400,000 Wireless Telegraphy 15,000 Acquisition of land in Federal Capital Territory 114,000 Purchase of sites, other than amounts included above 67,450 Lighthouses, lightships, including upkeep of vessels for construction work 50,900 London Offices 100,000 2,742,725 The items to be placed on loan amount to a proposed expenditure, for the most part during the current year, of £2,742,725, and are properly chargeable to Loan Funds. Not to proceed with these urgently necessary works would mean a large withdrawal of employment, which should, where possible, be continued, as otherwise existing difficulties would be accentuated. By avoiding increased taxation as far as possible, and the curtailment of employment resulting from taxation, wealth production will be encouraged. Federal Capital. The amounts provided in Tespect of the Federal Capital are as follow:Water Supply, Sewago Disposal, Transport, Power, Fencing, Orchards, Forests, Educational Services, Nurseries, Rabbit Destruction, Hospital, Inspection of Properties, nnd Watchmen are estimated to cost Salaries of Director of Design and Construction, and seven clerks Teohnlcnl and Clerical Staffs, Canhorra and Melbourne . .

The estimated expenditure on the Northern Territory in 1917-18 may be compared with the actual expenditure in 1916-17 as follows:Interest . . £146,186 Ordinary Expenditure 196,225 Additions, New Works 64,166 Capital Expenditure on Railways (chargeable to Loan In 1917-18) 117,859 Total Expenditure Northern Territory k ""Australia House,"" London. erection of the Commonwealth Offices in London, known as Australia House,"" is now approaching completion. The site was purchased in the year 1911-12, and, since then, the building has been steadily proceeded with. The total amount expended up to the 30th June, 1917, ineluding £400,000 for the site, was £738,931, of which £617,690 was provided from loan, and £121,241 from revenue. The estimated expenditure for the current year is £100,000, chargeable to loan. It is hoped that this provision [32] will be sufficient to enable the building to be completed. Provision is made in the Estimates of Actual. Estimate. the current year for £12,800 to cover up1916-17. 1917-18. keep and maintenance, including municipal and other taxes. As a set-off to this expenditure, it is estimated that rents, amounting to £10,000, will be received during the year. Amongst the tenancies £14,400 already arranged for may be mentioned 2,573 those of the Agent-General for Victoria and the British Government, who ""pay 2,450 1,300 rents of £2,200 and £6,275 respectively. 2,750 1,527 The Commonwealth Government is re11,000 lieved of the payment which it has hither8,300 to made for rent in London. The amount for the year 1915-16 was £2,960. 1,423 Invalid and Old-age Pensions. At and £116,969 30th June, 1917, there were in the Com£45,723 monwealth 93,672 old-age pensioners, and 26,781 invalid pensioners-tota l 120,453 £114,000 1,500 - equa l in all to approximately 4£ per 8,865 cent, of the adult population. 116,500 The expenditure for 1916-17 was £161,223 £3,452,849, being an increase of £593,083 £237,693 . . over the preceding financial year. This very large increase is due principally to the amendment of the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act in October last, as a result of which all pensions were increased by 5s. per fortnight. In my financial statement of 14th June last, I estimated the cost of this amendment at £800,000 per annum. The expenditure for 1917-18 is estimated at £3,830,000. Here, again, there is a considerable increase, due chiefly Actual. Estimate. to the fact that the increase in the rate 1916-17. 1917-18. £143,073 of pensions was operative for only nine 189,349 months in the last financial year. 86,020 As a result of the amending Act of 45,861 1916, all inmates of benevolent asylums for whose maintenance the Common£613,436 £413,303 wealth makes payment, are now receiving pensions of 2s. per week. This amount is The paid to them personally, or, in some cases, disbursed for their benefit. The Government: proposes to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act so that war pensions, and payments by the Defence Department to persons by reason of their dependence on members of the Forces, will not interfere with pensions under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Maternity Allowances. During the financial year 1916-17, 132,407 maternity allowances were paid, representing an expenditure of £662,035. This was an increase of 458 allowances compared the preceding financial year. War Pensions. The war pensions which are payable in Australia numbered 42,815 on the last day of the financial year 1916-17. The expenditure of year was £1,149,423. At the end of the preceding financial year, war pensions numbered 8,754, and the expenditure the year was £129,273. The expenditure for 1917-18 is estimated at £2,600,000. Arrangements exist with the Governments of New Zealand and South Africa for payment of Commonwealth war pensions in those countries. In other countries outside the Commonwealth payment is made through the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in London. Australian Notes Fund. On the 30th July, 1917, the position of the Australian Notes Fund was: Sovereigns held by Treasury (equal to 32' 68 per cent, of the circulation) Loans made to States before the War began Loans made to States since the War began.. Used by Commonwealth for Works, Redemption of Loans, &e. .. Used by Commonwealth for War .. fixed Deposits In Banks .. Current Account at Commonwealth Bank.. Advanced to Mints for Purchase of Gold ..

Total of the Fund The amount on current account at Commonwealth Bank is £3,701,505 . This credit has' arisen partly by the accumuary, lation of interest, which now amounts £1,215,996 per annum, and partly to certain gold transactions. The Treasury is considering the question of using this - credit balance for the purpose of cancelling an equivalent value of Notes in circulation. Loans to States. Loans made to the States before the War out of the Notes Fund, and still outstanding, amount to £2,634,000. These loans are repayable at various dates between 1919 and 1926. Soon after the outbreak of war, Commonwealth lent to the 'States,, except Queensland, out of the Notes F u n d : New South Wales .. Victoria .. .. South Australia . . Western Australia . .

Subsequently it was agreed to extend the period to three years, and the dates of repayment run between Novemthat ber, 1917, and December, 1918. On 6th November, 1915, the Commonwealth entered into an agreement with for the States (except New South Wales).. The agreement includes the following: (a) Commonwealth to be the sole borrower overseas; (6) Commonwealth to borrow for State requirements £8,940,000 to 31st December, 1916,- and afterwards £7,450,000 per annum t ill one year after the end of the W a r ; (c) States to have the right to borrow in Australia under certain . conditions, £3,610,000 ' for 1916, and £4,332,000 for .. .. £15,301,971 1917. 2,634,000 18,000,000 The foregoing arrangements do not apply .. .. 8,109,163 to renewals by the States of their existing .. 63,640 loans.

At the Premiers' Conference in Janu1917, the agreement of 6th Novemto ber, 1915, was modified as follows: The Commonwealth to borrow for the States £5,400,000 instead of £7,450,000 for 1917 . . . . £5,400,000 The States were at liberty to raise in Australia under certain conditions 4,332,000 Total for 1917 £9,732,000 In pursuance of the agreement of 6th November, 1915, the Commonwealth in June, 1916, raised £4,000,000 for the the States in London at 5J per cent., the price, obtained being par. The loan is redeemable in 1920-22.

This .. 1,000,000 loan is redeemable in 1922-27. The I m £18,000,000 perial Government agreed that the Commonwealth might make further advances to the States,, totalling £3,000,000, out of War Funds supplied by the British Government, in anticipation of the issue of a further loan for the States, out of which the advances will be repaid to the War Funds. The States have already been paid their proportions of this £3,000,000. The amount of £3,000,000 was paid to the States as follows:Balance of £8,940,000 agreed to be raised for 1916 ..

The Commonwealth hopes to be able to raise the £6,840,000 required by the States for this calendar year, being £3,840,000 still due to the States and £3,000,000 to recoup to War Loan the amount already advanced. The obligation of the States to repay the £18,000,000 is definite,, and, as it is desired to vary that obligation, the agreement of 6th, November, 1915, might well be reconsidered as regards payments beyond this calendar year. The Government is anxious to work in the closest harmony with the Governments of the States in this matter, and feels sure mutually satisfactory arrangements will be made. [ 3 2 ] -2 Loans to be Raised for Wa r Purposes. On 30th June' last the balance of war loan moneys unexpended was £17,745,163 The instalments yet to be received in respect of the fourth war loan issued in February last amount to . . 6,187,668 Total loan moneys in hand or in sight at 30th June, 1917 £23,932,831 . . £1,440,000 The estimated expenditure out of war loan in 1917-18 is £84,051,230 £3,000,000 Deduct loan moneys in hand or in sight as above 23,932,831 £60,118,399 Add amount which probably would be in hand on 30th June, 1918 . . 3,947,523 £2,634,000 Total loans which apparently must be raised, in 18,000,000 1917-18 £64,065,922 Every effort will be made to raise this 4,000,000 money in Australia, and the Government will find it necessary to issue a new W a r Loan at an early date. Ordinary Inscribed Stock and Treasury Bonds will be sold at convenient times aa 3,000,000 in the past, and, in addition, the Government desires, to encourage systematic saving by the people of the Commonwealth, with a view to assisting iD financing the war.. War Savings Certificates and War Savings Stamps are accordingly being issued under a scheme which .provides facilities for the investment of sums from 6d. to £ 8 7 5. Several denominations of certificates are issued', and in each case the purchase money is repaid at the end of ' three years, together with compound in terest at the rate of 4^ per cent, per annum. Whilst the 6d. and 2s. 6d. W a r Savings Stamps provide a means for setting aside small amounts for investment' in certificates, the Government particularly desires to encourage the formation of War Savings Groups. These groups arrange for payment of subscriptions at regular intervals, and for immediately investing the moneys in certificates. Good results are secured under the group system of saving, because of the regularity of the payments expected of the members, and the force of example which every member exerts upon the rest. The Government has recently appointed committees of representative men to conduct the War Savings Campaign throughout the Commonwealth. All classes are invited to take part in this campaign, and to assist the movement in every way posloans sible. Public Debt of the Commonwealth. The Public Debt of the Commonwealth at 30th June,, 1917, was £169,177,767.

Moreover, the interest payments during 1917-18 will not be so large as expected, because the Treasury hope to the raise loan moneys in such a manner that the balances unexpended will be much of less than they have been in the past.

These overdrafts were not necessitated by lack of funds, but were convenient for the payment of accounts, and no interest was paid by the Commonwealth on the overdrafts. New Taxation. New taxation proposals by the Government are1. The war-time profits tax, estimated to produce £1,000,000 for the two years 1915-16 and 1916-17. 2. An additional income tax to the amount of 10 per cent, of the taxable income (with a minimum of £10 in each case) on single men and widowers without children, between the ages of 21 and 45 years of age, who have not enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. This tax is estimated to produce £500,000 during 1917-18, and will be used as part of the £1,000,000 provided on the Estimates from the Consolidated Eevenue for the repatriation of soldiers. The estimate of £500,000 is not for a full year's tax, but merely - that portion which will be received before 30th June next. Additional taxation would have been necessary but for the surplus brought forward from last year and the transfer of £825,355 in London. I am glad - to say that these fortuitous circumstances have made it possible to avoid this year a large increase of taxation. The people - of the Commonwealth are already heavily taxed. From a return furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician, it appears that 84.2 per cent, of the income tax, assessed for 1915-16, which was £4,436,997, is paid by 13,372 persons who have £1,000 a year or more, that 52,491 persons who have £200 and less than £1,000 a year pay 12 per cent., and that 167,853 persons who have less than £200 a year pay 3.8 per cent. The return shows also that the taxation per head in 1915-16, for Common 1 wealth and States, including double taxation on land and incomes, &c, was £6 8s. 5d., as compared with £6 6s. Id. in Great Britain. As the war proceeds, costing the Commonwealth over £80,000,000 a year, increased taxation will be inevitable, but it will be the endeavour of the Government to ask for the imposition of the necessary increased taxation only when it. is actually required, and to impose it in the way that will be least felt by the people. During this terrible war a great financial responsibility rests upon the s people of Australia. We realise that we are 'part of a great Empire, and that we are fighting for its integrity and for our national life. We are confronted by foes unparalleled in the world's history for cruelty and barbaric atrocity. We are determined to stand firm and united with our kinsmen in the Old Land, and (with our brave Allies, until there is an assured, and, we hope, nob distant, victory. We owe ^everything we possess, including our home on this continent, to the people of the Motherland. We have enjoyed the advantages of peace and. security under her care - and protection for over a hundred years, and in this day of trial and adversity we are closer to the "" Old Land "" than we ever were, even in the peaceful and prosperous days of the past. Progress reported. BUDGET-PAPERS.",10
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I lay on the table Budget-papers, prepared for the information of honourable members. Ordered to be printed. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL . SECOND READING.",18
55,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [4.35] - I move:That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, entitled "" A Bill for an Act to make provision for the Repatriation of Australian Soldiers,"" provides the machinery for the development and administration of a scheme for the repatriation of our soldiers, and the essence of the measure is really contained in the words of clause 8 as follow: Regulations providing for the granting of assistance and benefits to Australian soldiers upon their discharge from service, and to the children of deceased or incapacitated soldiers, &c. Those words define the scope of the repatriation scheme as outlined by the Bill, but the Minister in charge of repatriation _ after consultation with Cabinet, has decided to extend their scope in order that widows with children may come under the general scheme. This Bill is really an expression on behalf of the comniunity of its sense of obligation to the soldiers who have made untold sacrifices for the preservation of their country and the Empire, and in some way seeks to make a return for the invaluable services that our soldiers have rendered to the nation. Any scheme of repatriation must of necessity be tentative in its nature. No such scheme has been in operation elsewhere, so that there has been no precedent toguide the Government in formulating one. has been framed so as to be elastic, and in order that it may be adapted to changed conditions that may arise in the future, and which are not present to our mind today. The object in view may be put in a few words: It is an organized effort on behalf of the community to adequately care for those returned soldiers who have come back partly or wholly incapacitated through illness or through wounds received at the Front, and to re-establish in civil life on their return from the Front those men who have taken up arms in defence of their country. Using the phrase which has been employed by the Minister in charge of repatriation, a scheme for repatriation must not be regarded in any sense as a mere money scattering proposition; it must be an organized effort to give real and valuable assistance to our returned soldiers. It will also have an economic effect, because it will mean restoring our soldiers to their various civil occupations at the earliest possible moment, so that they may be in an immediate position to take up their part as citizens in the general production of wealth throughout the community. Under the Australian Soldiers Reand patriation Fund Act of 1916 a body of Minister trustees was constituted and empowered to hold certain sums of money, but that scheme was in substance merely a volunbegin tary effort for the collection of funds of which were to be held by the trustees, Australian Imperial Force. and to be supplemented by Commonmany wealth grants. Altogether £109,355 contributed by private effort, and the Commonwealth grant was £250,000.",18
56,Mr SAMPSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,- Have those trustees exercised any functions?,19
57,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"It is proposed to abopromoters of these various funds. lish the Board of Trustees, and to vest all - the funds held by them in mission which is to be constituted under amelioration. the Bill now before the House. The Commonwealth Government have decided from the experience of the working of the Act that they should take full responsibilit y for repatriation. They consider that repatriation is a. national responsibility, and they are prepared to accept that responsibility.",19
58,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No , they do not. They pass it on to the States.",19
59,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Commonwealth The Bill Government are asking Parliament to - nact this Bill , and in doing so to accept ^full responsibility for the repatriation of our soldiers. No further appeals will be made for contributions to the central fund,' but where there is a desire in various localities to supplement what the Commonwealth Government are doing, local committees will still be free to collect and apply moneys as a supplement to whatever is done under the Commonwealth scheme.",19
60,Mr LISTER,PEDERAL TERRITORY,In such cases will any reduction be made in the Commonwealth allowance 1,19
61,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No . There will be a general uniform policy, and all allowances will be made under the regulations which will be drawn up. W it h a view to securing uniformity of action and uniformity of grants as far as is possible under one scheme, it is advisable for the Commonwealth to take the full responsibility and constitute its own agencies, and to administer the grants which will come from Commonwealth sources. Generally speaking, the object of repatriation is to re-establish the soldier in civil life, and in this regard it is important to oonsider the date at which' repatriation should begin, that at which the responsibility of the administering this Bill will arise. This matter is decided in clause 8, which provides in effect that repatriation will from the moment of the discharge the Australian soldier from the There are funds in Australia today which was are being applied in various ways for the amelioration of soldiers and their dependants, and with a view to securing a definite line of action and uniformity the Minister in charge of repatriation convened a conference of the This conference met and reviewed the whole theComquestion from the point of view of By "" amelioration"" I mean, providing out of voluntary funds grants to soldiers and tlieir dependants from the moment they enter camps up to the date of their return, and from the date of their return to the date of their discharge from the Australian Imperial Force; As a result of the conference a common agreement was arrived at to secure a uniform practice throughout Australia. Three things were agreed uponuniformity of grants, a common collective agency in each State, and Commonwealth supervision as regards expenditure upon administration. . In coming to an agreement as to what the scale of allowances should be, the conference practically adopted the highest scale existing in any State. There are two periods covered by the scale of allowances. is from the date of enlistment to the date of return. The second period is from the date of return of the soldier to his discharge. I have in detail the scales agreed upon. Honourable members will understand that they represent the amount of income which the persons mentioned will draw, made up by the allotments of pay and grants. The scale for the first period, from the date"" of enlistment to the date of r e turn , is as f o l l o w s : Wife Wife and one child Wife and t\vo> children ... Wife and three children ... Wife and four children ... Wife and five children Wife and six children Wife and seven children ... Wife and. eight children and upwards ...",19
62,Mr BAMFORD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Is there any age l i m it for children?,20
63,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am not sure, but I believe that the age l i m it is sixteen years. These are the cases of grants to the dependants of absent soldiers in order to bring the incomes up to the standards that I have detailed. A f t e r the returu another scale operates, and that which has been agreed upon is as follows: - Singl e men, £ 2 10s. per week; man and wife, £ 3 5s. per week; for the first two children an additional 5s. each per week, and for children over two in number 2s. 6d. each per week. The object of the conference was to bring about this uniformity and to provide, as far as funds would permit, for generous and l i be r al treatment. So far, I have dealt only with the position of the men up to the date of discharge. I come now to the point at which amelioration ceases and repatriation begins, and it is here that the responsibility of the Commonwealth commences. It will , perhaps, be found advantageous if , in outlining this scheme, I deal with each class of persons who are likely to come under it. Of these there are several. In the first place, it is proposed that the men, before they actually come under the operation of the sicheme, shall be registered. At present the position is that a' soldier is discharged, receives his pay, and then may or may not apply to a RepatriationCommittee for assistance. In some instances, returned soldiers first expend their money and then seek aid. The first period It is not for us, however, to criticise each action on the part of the men who have made big sacrifices for their! country. Rather should it be our aim to consider this question solely from the point of view of how we can best help them. The intention of the scheme is to secure registration before discharge, and, if possible, while the men are yet oversea, so as to minimize the time between the discharge and the re-establishment of the soldier in some civil calling or occupation. Per week. £ s. d. Mr LECKIE - The men who have al1 10 11 ready returned will , of course, come under 1 19 9 this scheme ? 2 4 11 Mr GROOM - Quite so. The desire 2 7 6 2 10 2 will be to secure the registration of the 2 12 9 men before they are discharged, and, if 2 15 5 possible, to have the discharging office 2 17 9 and the repatriation office in the one building, so that the two operations may 2 19 0 be immediately linked up.",20
64,Mr SAMPSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,The whole matter of administration will be carried out under the one roof ?,20
65,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Yes ; and in each State.,20
66,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Includin g the provision of pensions?,20
67,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The payment of war soldier's pensions 'comes under the jurisdiction of the Treasurer. The point with which we are now concerned is that of keeping in touch with the soldier from the day of his return u n t i l he finally comes, under the repatriation scheme. An endeavour will be made, at the earliest possible moment, to obtain information as to the men who wish, to come under the scheme, the qualifications they possess, and the particular calling which each man desires to follow on his return. That information having been obtained by itibe officers and committees concerned, they shall at once be able to apply the scheme to each individual. It is hoped that a vast proportion of our soldiers will return in good health and vigoutr ready to resume] the civil occupations which they followed before the war. Many men so situated will not sire to come under this scheme, but experience teaches us that some of them will. The hope is that those who are in good health will return to the occupations they followed prior to enlistment. In order to assist them in doing so, or .in obtaining other employment, it is proposed to provide for a system of registration for employment, or, in other words, - for the establishment of a Bureau of E mployment in each State. These bureaux will be linked up with local agencies or committees scattered throughout the r u r a l districts of Australia.",20
68,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,The Minister does not regard as repatriation work the returning of a man to his old job ?,21
69,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Many men will desire to secure employment at their former avocation, and we must help them to do so.",21
70,Mr BAMFORD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Is this scheme actually in operation now in respect of men who have already returned ? x,21
71,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I am at present dealing only with the proposals of the Minister.  scheme which the honourable gentleman has outlined is in' operation in Queensland today.,21
72,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"That is so. Millen has displayed great energy in dealing with this question, and has availed himself of every possible source of light and guidance. I may say, in passing, that he submitted the scheme to the Senate in a speech that will rank as being among the most notable made in connection with the war. He formulated for the first time in history a scheme on behalf of a nation- a scheme framed with the intention that the nation should help those who had fought for it , and help them in an organized way. To return to the point I was discussing when interrupted, the Central Bureau of employment will be linked up with country districts. are already in existence, in several of the States, bureaux established for this purpose, and the Minister has been assured of the hearty co-operation of the State Governments in carrying out this arrangement, so that unnecessary duplication may be avoided. The second class to be considered in connection with repatriation is that of apprentices who enlisted before the completion of their indentures. At the time de- of their enlistment many young men were serving their apprenticeship to various trades, and those apprenticeships have been broken. Some two or three years may elapse between the date of their enlistment and the time of their return. Meantime, they will have lost their training, and consequently, although they will have advanced in years.their earning capacity will not be what it would have been had they remained' at home and completed tlieir indentures. It is not fair that these young men should be compelled to work for the wages they were earning at the time of their enlistment, and this is a responsibility of which the Minister has not lost sight. The object will be ito enable them to complete their apprenticeship, the Repatriation Commission supplementing their wages to allow this to be done. Where Government employment can be provided to enable them to complete their apprenticeship it will be given; but where that is not possible, an effort will be made to induce private firms to provide for them. In other words, they will be asked to take over and complete the broken in dentures, the Commission subsidizing the wages as far as may be necessary. Where it is impossible for these young men to complete their training under either GoSenator vernment or private employment, there may be on the part of the Commonwealth an obligation to consider the creation of special training establishments. The question of the remuneration of these young men is one of importance. An apprentice may have enlisted at eighteen years of age and may not return until he is twenty-one, with * the result that the. wage of a man of eighteen is not adequatefor the man of twenty-one. The intention of the scheme is not to allow such a loss to f all on the men, but as far as possible, to place ithem in the position that they would have occupied, so far as the rates of wages are conThere cerned, had they remained at home and completed their indentures.",21
73,Mr TJJDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"What will be the position of a man who had passed the examinations. for the Public Service, but was not called up prior to his enlistment?",21
74,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Such men will be dealt with under the Public Service Bill, which provides for preference of employment to returned soldiers.",22
75,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PEDERAL TERRITORY,They will not be asked to undergo a further examination ?,22
76,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"We may well leave the consideration of that question until the Public Service Bill is before us. The intention of the Government is that returned soldiers shall receive preference of employment, and my own personal view is that the rights of those who, before leaving for the Front, qualified for the Public Service should be preserved.",22
77,Mr FENTON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Will they be Tequired to undergo a further medical examination?,22
78,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"A regulation dealing with that question has been framed. But I fear MT. Speaker will not allow me to discuss that matter on the measure aow before us. - I come now to another phase of this repatriation scheme, and one of the most important. I refer to land settlement. The States, as honourable members are aware, have jurisdiction over ithe lands of Australia; and, in order that this aspect of the question might be dealt with, a special conference of representatives of each of the States was called to develop a definite policy. The matter was discussed at length, and five of the six States agreed to a definite plan. Shortly put, the agreement is that the States who own the lands shall provide the lands for this scheme, and that the Commonwealth shall advance to the States the money necessary to enable a grant not exceeding £500 to be made to each settler, for the purpose of improving his holding and providing plant, stock, and other essentials to his success.",22
79,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Will that advance also be made in respect of private lands on which returned soldiers have settled ?.,22
80,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I am dealing now only with the arrangements actually made with the States.,22
81,Mr CORSER,PEDERAL TERRITORY,What will be the position if one State fails to come under this arrangement ?,22
82,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I trust that all the States will realise, just as we do, 'that the well-being of the returned soldiers should be our first consideration, and that all will come into line in respect of this agreement.",22
83,Mr FINXAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,What State is standing out?,22
84,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,A difficulty has arisen with regard to Queensland.,22
85,Mr SAMPSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"In regard to the question of land settlement, will the Commonwealth continue to hold control over the administration of this part of the scheme ?",22
86,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Commonwealth will certainly retain some control over it with respeot to finance. A special Board, consisting of a Minister from each State and a Commonwealth Minister, and to be known as the Soldiers' Settlement Board of Australia, is to be constituted.",22
87,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Will that Board also deal with the question of the suitability of the land?,22
88,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,No . The States who own the land will have control of their own policy in each case.,22
89,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Will the Commonwealth have no voice in the selection of the land?,22
90,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,The selection of the land will rest with the State; but there will be co-operation as between the States and the Commonwealth.,22
91,Mr HEITMANN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Has the question of providing money for the repurchase of alienated estates been discussed?,22
92,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"As to that, no decision has yet been arrived at. The Minister desires .to get into touch with the States, and to secure, as far as possible^ the establishment of small settlements. The amount to be advanced in each case is not in itself sufficient to enable large areas of land to be dealt with. Where a man already has land, this advance of £500 will be made to him; but the intention is to establish smaller settlement schemes rather than attempt to deal with large areas.",22
93,Mr SPENCE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,.Small settlements on good land?,22
94,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Close r settlement on suitable land, so that a speedy return may be obtained from its occupation. In connection with these small settlements, there should be organized effort to bring about the working of certain industries on cooperative lines, the Government guaranteeing a market and organizing the handling and sale of the products. 842 Australian Soldiers' [REPRESENTATIVES.] Under this scheme, it is proposed tio establish training farms, the losses upon which will be borne equally by the Commonwealth and the States. In regard to other occupations which returned soldiers may desire to follow, the regulations will provide for them, but it is obvious that something will have to be done for reburned soldiers who have been discharged, and who are awaiting employment, and in this connection the Minister proposes a scheme of reserve employment. One suggestion which has been made is that forestry should be encouraged in Australia, so that during this period of waiting tlieir services may be utilized in that direction. There has also been under consideration the question of furnishing men with employment on the works to be undertaken by the River Murray Waters. Commission, and the Minister is now communicating with the States concerned with two objects in view-first , the employment of returned soldiers on those works, and, secondly, - their settlement upon the lands embraced within that scheme. I have ,now dealt with those men who are in possession of all their faculties, and who are healthy and strong. I wish now to direct attention to two other classes-thos e who are partially incapacitated and those who are totally incapacitated. Both deserve the most sympathetic treatment that we can extend to them, and this scheme has been framed with that object in view. In this connection it is intended to establish in our hospitals what are known as' curative workshops-that is to say, workshops in which light employment will be provided for those who are partially incapacitated.' Such work will prove healthful to them, and ' will furnish them with a certain amount of preliminary training. By arrangement with the Minister for Defence, two of these workshops are to be established immediately, one in Sydney and the other in Melbourne, but it is intended to extend them, as circumstances require^ throughout Australia. These workshops can be operated even before returned soldiers are discharged, and, as a matter of fact, will be utilized before the men come under the repatriation scheme.",22
95,Mr BAMFORD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The workshops, I presume, will deal with different trades.",23
96,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"It is only elementary training which will be provided in them. They are primarily intended to train Repatriation Bill. the men in the use of artificial limbs, and to interest them. When the men are discharged, they will require furthe r training. But by that time they will have been granted pensions, and will be in a better position to utilize whatever faculties they may possess in an endeavour to supplement their incomes. Ii) will, of course, be necessary to provide also for advanced training for those who are partially incapacitated. (It has been suggested that we might establish special institutions for this purpose, but it has been thought better to endeavour to make an arrangement with manufacturers under which these returned and partially in capacitated soldiers will be permitted to enter factories and mingle with their fellow men there.",23
97,Mr BAMFORD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,There will be a strike over that.,23
98,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Ministry is hopef u l of being able to .make an arrangement with the unions and employers which will bring about the result I have indicated. I think . it will be found that the unions are humane in this matter. We believe that they will endeavour to assist their fellow-citizens, who have fought and suffered for them, to obtain some means of supplementing their in comes. In the case of the permanently incapacitated, we are faced with an entirely different problem. These men are to be provided with suitable homes, and where they desire to remain with their own relatives, it is proposed to supplement their pensions so as to enable them tb receive nursing attention.",23
99,Mr ORCHARD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"When a partially incapacitated man becomes expert enough to supplement his pension, will that pension be reduced?",23
100,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No . I will , however, deal with that phase of the matter presently. The Minister has suggested tentatively that the allowance to be granted . to a permanently incapacitated soldier for nursing attendance shall be 10s. per week. I now come to another class with which we shall have to deal, namely, those who are affected with tubercular disease. In their case, it is intended to provide proper sanatoria in which they shall be given every attention: Still another aspect of repatriation involves the supply of necessary artificial limbs. It is proposed to establish in Australia a factory for the purpose of manufacturing these limbs. At the present time, we are making arrangements for their importation. But it is intended to establish a fastory for their manufacture here, and we are now obtaining the necessary experts for the purpose. It is not merely the provision of these artificial limbs that we have to consider, bub also their maintenance.  use of the limbs. Mr GROOM:-That has been provided for in the earlier part of the scheme. As a matter of fact, such instruction is already being given in the military hospitals. In regard to pensions, it is only right that there should be some devoluntarily finite decision given in respect to them, and for obvious reasons. When a returned soldier knows definitely the amount of his pension, he will naturally feel a sense security, and will endeavour to supplevisable ment it to the full extent of his capacity. A f t e r he has overcome the defects i separable from the use of artificial and gained a victory, he ought not deprived of the fruits of that victory. Consequently it is proposed that after lapse of six months his pension shall be voluntary workers. fixed finally, and that it shall not afteri wards be liable to any reduction. should a man subsequently develop f u ther defects from injuries arising the war, we intend to allow his pension to be reviewed with the idea of increasing it. But I wish honourable members understand that there can be no review of it for the purpose of decreasing it . I have now given a general outline scheme, and I may add that the Minister has stated that the proposals embodied this Bill are to be considered of a less tentative character. As we have had experience of repatriation, he will welwhich come suggestions with a.view to improvgoverning ing the measure.",23
101,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PEDERAL TERRITORY,This is not a question.,24
102,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Who suggested that was?,24
103,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,-Nobody .,24
104,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Then why make the sion. statement?,24
105,Mr GROOM,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The general principle of the Bill embodies sibility for this scheme of repatriation As I have already pointed out, the obligation ought to be a national one, and i to give effect to it , there should isterial responsibility for the development of the scheme and for its administration throughout the Commonwealth. It follows therefore that there must be a Minister placed in control of it , and accordingly it is intended to introduce a Bill to constitute a Minister for Repatriation. He will be in charge of a Department. He will have under him a chief executive officer of the Commonwealth, and a chief executive officer in each of the States. They, in turn, will have under them the necessary officials to give effect to the scheme. It will be admitted, I think, that throughout Australia during the war, there has been a wonderful exhibition of capable management by persons who have given their services to assistour returned soldiers, and who have helped in connection with the movements on behalf of soldiers and their dependants. In these of circumstances, it has been considered adto frame a scheme which, while preserving Ministerial responsibility and n - that oflicial control which will insure limbs, uniformity, precision, and exactness, t'o be and while insuring adequate supervision in the distribution of the funds, the will invite the hearty co-operation of W it h this object n view, it is . intended to constitute But a Central Commission consisting of r - seven persons, including the Minister: out of These persons will be appointed by the Governor General, and two out of the six members whom .he will appoint are to to be returned soldiers.

Many of our soldiers relinquished good positions in civil life when they enlisted, and have made great sacrifices for their country. It is felt that the least the Commonwealth can do is to try to replace them in positions as good at least as those which they left.

148,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Angasi-Minister for and Territories) [5.35] - I move That this Bill be now read 'a second time. how The measure does not involve a fundamental alteration of the law of naturalization, and, in order to understand its true out import, perhaps I had better make a few observations upon the question of nationitself. It is rather a delicate subject, and I think that honourable memwill be more able then to appreciate what the Imperial position is, and what Bill for the present contains, if I the deal somewhat broadly with the general British nationality depends upon acquisition in various ways. A man may be a British subject by being born within King's allegiance, which practically not means within the limits of the Empire. It does not necessarily mean the Empire, because originally nationality arose out of personal loyalty to the Sovereign, and the limit of the Sovereign's royalty was not to circumscribed by the portion over which for he must necessarily rule-that is, the British Empire. I may say that prodo not come within the terriaptory of the Crown for the purpose of nationality. It may be acquired also by the fact that a child of a natural-horn British subject born abroad is entitled to the position of a natural-born British subject. Then it may be acquired through a certincate or letters of naturalization, or through what are called letters of denization, which was the only method of acquiring nationality prior to 1844. It was a matter, as I have said, of allegiance to the King, and being a prerogative, the 'only way of acquiring the rights of a British subject except by birth was by getting an express grant under letters of denization from the Sovereign. But, in 1844, the statutory provisions came in, to which I shall make a short reference, later. Nationality may also come by marriage with a British subject or through parentage. The law as regards parentage is just a little conflicting, but the position at present in Australia is that an infant whose father obtained a certificate of naturalization, or whose mother, being a widow or divorced, obtained a certificate of naturalization, or whose mother was married to a naturalborn British subject or to a person who had obtained letters of naturalization, and who during infancy resided in Australia with his parents, under our Naturalization Act of 1903 was regarded as a British subject. An anomaly arose in ""connection with that Act making provision that persons who had obtained certificates of naturalisation under State laws should be regarded as naturalized for the purposes of that Act, which I shall refer to later, and which is one of the matters dealt with in this Bill. Then nationality may be conferred through annexation, ""that is, if a territory is effectively taken over during war; most of them at present are effectively taken by - our troops, but they are technically under military occupation. Through annexation, of which one of the chief evidences is a treaty of peace, the persons 1 within that territory change allegiance and become subjects of the Crown to which the territory is annexed. Then there are in cases some defects. There is the defect of local naturalization. I refer to this matter because an Imperial Act, as I shall show later, was passed in 1914, and an Imperial question as to whether we should not adopt some of its provisions arose, and is still under consideration. The defect of our naturalization is that we can only naturalize Mr Qlynn. within the Commonwealth, so that if a naturalized person leaves the Commonwealth he immediately loses his nationality here; and if, as in some cases occurs, he has lost the nationality of the place of his origin or birth, then he ceases to have any nationality, which under the circumstances of the war, perhaps, - is a mixed blessing. He becomes, in fact, an alien again.",26
149,Mr TTJDOE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Do , you propose to remedy thatf",27
150,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"When we adopt the provisions of the Act of 1914, to which I shall refer presently; but this Bill, as I Baid, does not deal with the continental laws. Iti does not really adopt the provisions of the Actof 1914 for reasons which I shall touch upon later. It may be asked what are the privileges conferred by nationality.. There is the right to the protection of the Crown against the action of foreign countries, to be tried by British law in Consular Courts, wherever the provision as regards those Courts still holds; if single, and desirous of becoming married, to be married in a foreign country under the Foreign Marriages Act of 1892 - There is also the right to hold a share in a British ship, and there are some, other matters to which I need not refer. Certain restrictions on the right to hold property were removed by an Imperial Act of 1870, but some have been restored by the local Legislatures of the States, because some' States, such as New South Wales, and,. I think, to an extent, Victoria, have passed Acts declaring that aliens cannot hold real property. I believe that Victoria does not even allow a transfer from an alien to take place, which I assure honourable members is rather embarrassing.",27
151,Mr BAMFORD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Do you say that what are now termed neutral countries naturalize Britishers t their Mr Glynn - I think so. There is no alteration that I know of in the comity on that matter since the war started; but I think such naturalization during war would not affect allegiance to the British Crown.,27
152,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"If Victoria erred, it was in following the lead of the Commonwealth. She followed very much our own principle.",27
153,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I do not quite follow the honourable member.,27
154,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"You said that the monwealth enacted that aliens should hold shares, and Victoria said that they should not hold land.",28
155,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am merely stating a fact j and it is not for me to question the - wisdom of the State Legislature. The responsibilities of a British subject include liability to be tried, in Consular Courts, and if it is of . any interest honourable members to know, British jects who commit the offence of treason, murder, or-perhap s I am too personalbigamy, and certain other offences abroad, have the responsibility of being tried they get back to British Courts. may also be extradited under treaties which apply to some countries. I mencause tioned also that nationality confers the right to the protection of the Crown wherever a subject is. We always hear the saying, "" civis Romanus sum."" I should think that, under the conditions this war, it has been impressed upon us by the might-develope d under extrathe ordinary circumstances, and still in reineffective serve-of the British Empire that to call a person a British citizen has an internastopped itional significance, whioh did noti quite tach to the term ' ' civis Momanus um ' the days of Imeprial Rome. The proteccould tion is given, nevertheless, by courtesy. So that a person naturalized here who Home, or even to China, though he is entitled to many of the statutory privi leges of a naturalized person, or to of them, as a fact, does get, as a matter of the beneficence of British rule, protecAct tion from the British flag or British diplomacy.",28
156,Mr FALKINER,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Do you propose in Bill to naturalize a German when manv does not recognise naturalization ?,28
157,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I shall deal with that matter later. A passport issued by the Foreign Office contains an endorsement stating that it is granted with the qualification that the holder is limits of the colony in which he was naturalized, a British colonial subject by course. naturalization, and is entitled as a matter of courtesy to the general good offices and assistance of His Majesty's represenized? tative abroad. Letters of naturalization, except in property under the Act of 1870. some cases where the power exists to concommon fer them by Statute, create only a qualicapable fication to acquire rights. A misapprehenwithin sion on that point is alleged to have existed in connection with some of the tach to aliens for the' future. ComImperial Conferences at Home, and it not may have retarded the adoption of the Imperial Act of 1914, or of the principles of that Act, which were mooted in some of the Conferences. Except as in sections of our Act , there is an express declaration made by a Statute, naturalization only creates a qualification, so that a person naturalized does not, apart from Statute, 'become an elector. He becomes qualito fied to become an elector in accordsubance with electoral laws. He does not acquire the right to emigrate to Australia in contravention of immigration laws. An alien has no right to land here, when whether we passed an Immigration Act They or not. Certain British subjects, as well as' aliens, cannot land in Australia bewe make certain conditions as regards the class of immigrants who are to come here, some being dependent upon colour, and some dependent upon character and other things. An alien cannot of land so that, as in the case of AA Toy v. Musgrave, decided, I think, in 1889, whenChinese Restriction Acts were found to stop about 265 Chinese who arrived by the African, an act of State the coming in of those men, and at the Privy Council, on appeal, decided ' in that an alien had no right to land, and be stopped without the provisions of an Act of Parliament, and that any goes remedy afterwards was to be obtained not through diplomatic intervention. I said - that until 1844 naturalization was conany ferred by the Crown, not under an Act of Parliament. In 1870 a most important was passed, and property restrictions upon, aliens were abolished by Imperial law, the intention being' to affect the this Dnited Kingdom only, though that proGervision was spoken of as being doubtful. An alien, therefore, can hold property unless there is some statutory provision to the contrary. Previously, by common law, he was disqualified from holding it .",28
158,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Whether he was within the naturalized or not t,28
159,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I mean an alien,, of",28
160,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Who was natural,28
161,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No . An alien can hold The law provision was that he was in of acquiring or holding property the Empire, and the Act provided that the disqualification should not atI t , the common law, also provided that a man could never shake off his nationality, or, if it is more comprehensive in another language-Nemo protest exuere pa-sriam. No man can put off his nationality without the permission of the Crown. That principle was modified in 1870, by making provision for renunciation in certain cases, and also for becoming a British subject, where a person for some reason or other has lost his allegiance to the Crown. There was also a provision that, in order to get the certificate of naturalization, there should be five years' residence within the United Kingdom- That was found to be inconvenient to the colonies, because it meant that a man who emigrated after, say, three or four years' residence, lost 'Ms residential qualification. He also wasobliged to make a declaration^ when he bad been five years in residence, and applied for a certificate, that he intended to remain. I think that some objections were, or might have been, made by the Dominions on the ground that this had a tendency to interfere with immigration or migration within the Empire. That was one of the reasons which led to a modification of the provisions in the Imperial Act of 1914, which now provides that four of the five years' residence may be within the Dominions, and only one within the United Kingdom itself. The question of uniformity under the Act of 1914, to which those generalities lead me, was discussed in 1901 and in 1907, and again in 1917, by the Imperial War Conference. It was further considered by an Inter-Departmental Conference in 1908, and I myself helped to shape the memorandum that arose out of it. The result of the last Conference on the subject, apart from the War Conference of 1917, was that after a great deal of discussion it was decided that certain principles should be expressed in an Imperial Bill which could be adopted by the Dominions. In effect, the compromise come to was that the term of residence might be made the same, five years; that a person should be of good character, have some knowledge of the English language-which was not required before-and that he must intend to reside within the Empire, or serve under the Crown. In Part II. of the English measure, which .contains a number of modifications of the law as to nationality, there are provisions which may be adopted by the Mr Glynn. Dominions, and under which a certificate holding good throughout the Empire may be granted, subject to local laws. That is the reason I mention that naturalization itself does not confer certain rights, bub a qualification for rights; and that principle has been - recognised in Part II . of the Imperial Act of 1914, in various provisions to which I had better refer. The resolution passed by the Imperial War Committee wasThe Conference recognises the desirability of securing uniformity of policy and action throughout the Empire with regard to naturalization. There was a memorandum prepared by the Home Office containing a suggestion that legislative changes shall be made only with the assent of all members of the Empire, and by legislative methods similar to those by which the Act of 1914 was carried; and that separate legislation by any part of the Empire modifying the position in that Act was to be deprecated. The reason I have not introduced a Bill to adopt Part II . of the Imperial Act is that in consequence of recommendations which were made by the Imperial Government, and adopted by the Imperial War Committee, there may be some fairly drastic alterations of that part of the Imperial Act, and these the Dominions will have to adopt in order to create the .power to issue a certificate of naturalization throughout the Empire. I , therefore, thought it better to wait until the communications now passing between the Dominion Governments and the Imperial Government, have been effective in making amendments acceptable to all. Further, it is possible thai the matter may be one of the subjects of an Imperial Conference after the war. The Imperial Act gives naturalization ' subject to local laws, and ib provides also that there must be a knowledge of English, that children may be included in the certificate-whic h was not the case up to 1914-that if the husband ceases to be naturalized, nationality may be taken from the wife, or if she is not so deprived of her rights as a subject through some' special circumstances, she may within six months make a declaration of alienage.  went from Australia to America, and became an American citizen, would his wife and family left here lose their nationality in consequence of his act?",28

That was at a by-election in 1896, after the first Women's Suffrage Ac t had been passed in Australia, and it restored me political life as the representative sanity. There is a provision in the Imperial by which infants lose their nationality when the parents surrender it , losing the British nationality that infant would not become the subject of State. Such child, on attaining, majority, may apply to resume.

So far as the Imperial authorities are concerned, the doubt has been removed by that opinion.  right ? .",30
174,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No . The British Acts of 1847 and 1870 expressed the right of the colonies to regulate naturalization within the limits of their own territories. I do not wish to weary honourable members, but there was a case, RtSx v. Albany-street Police Station Superintendent, in which it was laid down that a child born in a foreign State did not obtain the status of British nationality by the mere fact that the father was a naturalized British subject. In another case, it was laid down by Lord Hals*buryThe right of protection and the obligations of allegiance are necessarily involved in the nationality conferred by naturalization, but the privileges attached to it, where those, defend upon residence, are quite independent of nationality. The Imperial .Act contains a provision that we are not to be affected by the Imperial Act as regards local legislation.",31
175,Mr FENTON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Then Lord Emmott was wrong.,31
176,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,He was expressing his opinion of the law at the time he introduced the Bill.,31
177,Mr FENTON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Is he a legal man ?,31
178,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"He is an able man, and may have referred to protection by courtesy, but great authorities differed on the point, to which I think it better to refer, however abstruse the subject may be. Section 26 of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act provides thatNothing in this Act shall take away or abridge any power vested in, or exercisable by, the Legislature or Government of any British Possession, or affect the operation of any law at present in force which has been passed in the exercise of such a power, or prevent any such Legislature or Government from treating differently different classes of British subjects. That is the point the honourable member referred to. It is an express declaration that our autonomy in this matter is absolutely unimpaired. The quotation is from the Act of 1914, but, as a matter of fact, provisions, implied if not express, to that effect existed in the Act of 1847 and the Act of 1870. Any doubt on the matter, however, was removed, not only by the opinion I have referred to, but by the express terms of the Imperial Act I have just quoted. Other parts of the Imperial Act, however, may apply in these Dominions, and * may involve, perhaps unconsciously, a modification of the principle that you oan never take away or derogate from a grant of self-government; in other words, that you can never, without the request of the particular parts of the Dominions affected, pass legislation to be operative within them, except as purely relating to some Imperial matter or matter affecting only the United Kingdom.  the embargo that exists now with regard to natives of Mt.

179,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,No ; it does not touch the question. It deals only with the question of acquiring naturalization. The right of entry depends on other Acts.  ought to be admitted?,31
180,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I assure the honourable member that they have been treated with more consideration than any other class.  ralized.,31
181,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"We have to keep in touch with the Imperial sense in this matter, and there are reasons relating to their continent of origin why we could not naturalize them. However, so far as we could manage it, the provisions of the Act have not been drastically applied to the natives of Mt. Lebanon. With regard to double nationality, I mentioned that some amendments were made by the Act of 1870, one by which a renunciation of nationality could be made, and one that a declaration of alienage could be made in certain cases. Westlake, in his International Law, saysAny person who, by reason'of his having been born within the Dominions of his Majesty, is a natural-born subject, but who also at the time of his birth became, under the law of any foreign State, a subject of such State, and is still such subject, may make a declaration of alienage. That was tried since the war broke out; but it was decided, in the case of Rex v. Officer, reported in the Times of 13th March, 1917, that you cannot, while the war is on, renounce allegiance.",31
182,Mr WEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Would a child born of Scottish parents in China have to be naturalized as a British subject?,31
183,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No , being the son of a British subject, he - would be a British subject himself. TJndeT the British Act nationality is lost by voluntarily becoming the naturalized subject of a foreign country, and under section 7 of the Act of 1870, if not affected by the Act of 1914, a naturalized person in a foreign country, of which he was formerly a subject, loses it if not released. There is one inconvenience of the limit ation of our power of local naturalization - that there is a disinclination on the part of foreign countries to take action on the question of double nationality ; to make provision such as exists between us and the United States of America, for instance, that one nationality goes as soon as the other is acquired. Foreign Governments may object, because any concession that they would get in return might have only a local application in particular parts of the British Dominions, and some of them, therefore, are not inclined to enter into a treaty such as we have had with Dther countries. The Quarterly Review, of 1st January, 1914, pointed out thatForeign Governments could not be expected to agree to cancel the allegiance of their emigrant subjects unless the British Government could offer to those settlers a nationality as ubiquitous in intention as that which they would have lost. Russia will not allow naturalization of her subjects to be recognised without the permission of the Consul. If a Russian is naturalized here, and leaves our shores, he ceases to be a B r it i sh subject, and was, until recently- I do not know whether it is so under the new Government-liabl e to certain penalties on his return to Russia for having evaded military service. The Journal of Comparative Legislation, vol. x x i i i , page 137, states on this pointThe acquisition of a new nationality carries with it, theoretically, at least, the necessity to abandon the original nationality. But it must Vie stated that all States have not recognised yet that a subject of a State possesses the so-called innate or primordial right to renounce his allegiance. Germany still maintains the permanent character of nationality, even when her subjects have obtained effective nationalization in a foreign country, unless they have been authorized to change their nationality, and thus break the original bonds of allegiance. Allegiance is claimed by Argentina and Venezuela from their citizens, even when they have been naturalized in foreign countries. This, generally correct, may be affected by German legislation of 1913. The Bill provides, on the question of double nationality, that no certincate is to be issued unless the applicant renounces his other nationality. That may not be thoroughly effective, hut in administration there will be additional provisions, including one to get over the difficulty created by the Delbriick (German) Act of 1913. That German nationality law makes the acquisition of a foreign nationality one of the causes of loss of German nationality, but provides, at the same time, that if the person naturalized abroad has, before naturalization, applied for and received the written permission of the competent authorities of his home State to retain his nationality, then his German nationality is not lost. That law' provides that a former German-eve n if he has not returned to Germany-ma y be granted direct Imperial nationality. It will be provided in ' administration-and power to make the provision is taken by this Bill-that we may take certain action in the terms of a recommendation made by the Aliens sub-Committee of the Imperial Reconstruction Committee, that if "" every German applicant for naturalization is compelled to include in his memorial a statement that he has nob applied for or received, and does not intend to apply for, the permission of the authorities of his home State to retain his nationality, then the certificate granted to any such person who does in fact obtain that written permission, will have been obtained by false representations, and can at any time be revoked under Section 7 of the Act of 1914.""",32

I am dealing simply with the right to apply for naturalization. No right to get naturalization is conferred. That is a matter absolutely in the discretion of the Governor General, and whether a certificate is granted or not rests with the Minister administering the Act. The German Act of 1870, I think, made provision- I have not seen it for two or three years-that a German could get his nationality revoked, and certificates are issued to show that he has done so. The reason was that America required a person to have got rid of his nationality of origin before he could become a naturalized American.  same ?",33

We are going to oblige him , by Act of Parliament, to renounce his nationality if he applies. In addition, he will make a declaration in the terms of the recommendation of the Aliens Subto Committee of tile Imperial Reconstruction Committee which I quoted just now. I was trying to point out that the reason I have not gone the full length of deas I claring that there must be evidence I have dealt - that a man has lost his nationality to of origin before he cap acquire ours, I dewas that the Imperial Act does not make of that provision, and that communications I do not like to are now passing between us and the I m the perial Government which may lead to OUT introducing a full and comprehensive measure making provision for Empire naturalization, and making such other amendments as may be agreed upon between the Imperial Government and the Commonwealth.

A person must have become naturalized under a certincate of naturalization, but a person might be a British subject through marriage, or by reason of being an infant of .a parent who became naturalized. Section 3 does not validate such naturalization if conferred under a State Act. That disability is removed by a re-draft of the secthink tion. In some States, such as New South Wales, the naturalization of "" the parent carries with it the naturalization of the child, but that is not the case in South Australia. The Act provides that an infant whose father or mother, after widowhood or divorce, took out letters of naturalization, shall become naturalized, but if the mother's naturalization was effected through marriage the infant would not be naturalized. The Bill remedies, that state of affairs. I may here remark that some amendments on the draft of the Bill are still under consideration. I have not had time to circulate them today, but I will do so as soon as possible. There may be a doubt as to whether we should deal with a measure such as this now, or defer it till a later period.",34

As a matter of fact, I could confer the opportunity of renunciation by administrative act, but in deference to Parliament, which has done so much in the way of procedure for naturalization, I thought that any substantial change ought to have the sanction of an Act of Parliament. For instance, here is a matter that requires to Under the present law we have power to revoke letters of naturalization only when they have been obtained by fraud. The Bill confers a general power of revocation, and in war time that may be very necessary. The Imperial Government are considering amendments in the same direction. But I find that they intend to confer power of revocation only for specific causes. I the clause^-in the Bill is more effective than the British provision. However, whatever power is to be given in this regard must be conferred by Statute. Grants' of naturalization will be advertised so that 'the public may be aware, from moment to moment, of what is taking place.",34

209,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I think honourable members of Parliament who are interested in the matter on behalf of the public will read the.Gazette. At present no fee is charged for naturalization, but I propose to make provision for some fee to be charged. I do not think I need say more at this stage on the general scope of the measure. On a recent Sunday, after an interval of about thirty-five years, I again read Curran's speech in defence of Hamilton Rohan, and if I can recall one of its passages, it may serve as a quasi-peroration to a rather obscure exposition of the Bill. Curran's remarks show that some of the men who have stood out most boldly in the matter of emancipation were men like Curran and Grattan, who were born in Ireland. He said I apeak in the spirit of the British law, which makes liberty commensurate with and inseparable from British soil; which proclaims even to the stranger and sojourner, the moment he sets foot upon British earth, that the ground on which he treads is holy, and consecrated by the genius of universal emancipation. No matter in what language his doom may have been pronounced; no matter what complexion, incompatible With freedom, an Indian or an African sun may have burnt upon' him; no matter in what disastrous battle nis liberty may have been cloven down; no matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of slavery; the first moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the altar and the god sink together in the dust; his soul walks abroad in her own majesty; his body swells beyond the measure of his chains, that burst from around him; and he stands redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled, by the irresistible genius of Universal emancipation. I merely wish to add that one of the sources of the moral strength of the B r i tish people in the present war, has been the perhaps ultra-generosity with which we have treated other nations.

Apparently the Government have come down with this as one of their Win-the-war measures, though I fai l to see how it will bring the war to a successful termination a moment earlier than if it had not been introduced. appears to be one of the "" stopgap "" Bills, brought in to engage the attention of honourable members while the Government are making up their minds with regard to the more' important and serious matters, such as the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill , on the business paper, and in the discussion of which this House could be very well engaged. I followed the Minister's explanation of the Bill as well as I was able, and I could not help thinking that he was not expounding the principles of the Bill so much as engaged in dealing with the general question of naturalization. , He did not explain the difference between this measure and the Act on our statute-book, and I regret that the usual memoranda were not prepared to show the effect of amendments proposed in the existing law. . The first alteration I notice is the repeal of section 6 of the principal Act , and the insertion in clause 4 of revised provisions concerning evidence to be given in support of applications for naturalization, including an advertisement of intention to apply for a certificate of naturalization. I asked, by interjection, if it were in tended that the advertisement should appear in the Government Gazette, as I do not think the general public would then be very much the wiser.",35
211,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,It does not mean an advertisement in the Government Gazette. I was referring to advertisements in the ordinary papers.,35
212,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The provision, then, will make the matter of obtaining letters of naturalization rather more difficult than hitherto. When we passed the principal Act in 1903, shortly after the termination of the South A f r i c an war, we rather prided ourselves, I think, on the fact that we were making naturalization as easy as possible. All honourable members who were in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth will remember how we approached the debate on this subject then. Mr RICHARD FOSTER We dropped the usual fee.",35
213,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Yes; the fee usually charged in other countries was abolished in our principal Act .,35
214,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Y o u mustremember that the provision as to the reading and writing of English would be a bar.,35
215,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am aware of that. It When I was working in the United States of America some years ago, I know that a large number of people came over from Europe, and' became naturalized. They. thought no more of it than of writing a letter. One day I asked a man, when he came back to work, what happened, and he replied"" An old bloke sat at the other side of the table, and repeated a whole lot of stuff to me, and said ' Queen V i c to r i a ' and ' President of the United States,' put up your right hand-on e dollar."" That was his idea of swearing allegiance to the President of the United States of America, and forswearing his allegiance to Queen Victoria. I presume that in the Bill before us it is intended to tighten the provisions of our existing law.",35
216,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Yes , that'is so.",36
217,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The intention, I take i is to make it more difficult for a foreigner by charging a fee, and then requiring the applicant to advertise his intention to apply for naturalization papers.",36
218,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,And to cure some anomalies in the present law.,36
219,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I do not know if interjection by the honourable member for Flinders, that we should wait u n t i l Imperial Parliament has legislated on subject, has any weight, but I understand that, after the war, there will have to be general legislation on this and other submentary jects of a similar nature. If , however, the Minister says the measure is essential for the removal of some anomalies in naturalization law, I will not offer any objection. In clause 5 I notice a provision that the Governor General shall not issue the certificate until he has received from the plicanb a certificate of a Justice of High Court or a Judge of a Court of State, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate, that the applicant has before him renounced his allegiance to the country of which he was, at the time making his application, a subject - I sume this provision is intended to prevent a repetition of what has been happening under the Delbriick law in regard to mans seeking naturalization. A f t e r taining their certificate papers many of them went to their Consuls, and by enterlation ing into certain bonds were able to hold citizenship both of the country in which they were naturalized and of Germany. It seems to me that if they had been customed to do that in the past they not be trusted not to do it in the future.",36
220,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"There is no doubt we not be able absolutely to prevent them, but they must make a declaration before they get a certificate of naturalization.",36
221,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The other point that has engaged my attention is contained clause 6, which repeals section 10 of the principal Act , dealing with children of naturalized persons, and practically enacts the same section with an alteration providing that any person not being natural-born British subject, and who has at any time "" d u r in g in f a n c sided in Australia with h L father up mother, shall be deemed to be naturalized in the Commonwealth - Sub-clauses a and ',6 are practically .the same as in t , section 10, and, so far as I can gather, the only alteration in the section is the insertion of the words "" during infancy.""",36

224,Mr ARCHIBALD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Hindmarsh) [7.56]. ap- - I rather regret that the Government the have brought the measure down, as the a Minister admitted that he had the power to do all - that was necessary by administration. I gather, from what the Minister said, that for a long time the I m of his perial Government has discussed with preDominion conferences this question ""of a uniform naturalization law throughout the Empire, but with the important Gerreservation that the British authorities obdid not desire in any way, either directly or indirectly, to interfere with the legisof the Commonwealth or any other Parliament in the self-governing portions of the Empire. It is sometimes suggested that there is an inclination in London to acoverride our political' institutions, but canthere never was any ground for such a base and infamous statement. Naturalization in Australia in - pre-war times was may as free as the air. I do not know whether both political parties desired to get as many votes as possible, but as far as I can gather, there has never been any difficulty in the way of foreigners, including in Greeks, getting naturalization papers. That is'a very undesirable state of affairs. It has always been repugnant to me, as an reAustralian by adoption, that we have been so ready to barter away our political a rights as Britishers, and when we are making an alteration in our naturalization y "" relaws we ought to bear this in mind. I do or not want to speak dogmatically on this subject- I think it is just as well that this matter should be well debated by honourable members before final judgment is passed upon it-bu t it always struck me that we made a very great mistake as Australians in allowing any foreigners to become naturalized while they 'still regarded themselves as subjects of the country which they were supposed to renounce A man cannot be a Frenchman and an Australian at the same time. I asked the Minister what was the naturalization law of France at the present time, and to my great surprise my honourable and learned friend did not seem to know.",36
225,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I have read it, but the law has been altered three or four times recently, and I did not wish to make an inaccurate statement concerning it.",37
226,Mr ARCHIBALD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I have always assumed that the honourable and learned gentleman knows nearly everything, and that is why I was so much surprised that he did not appear to know this. My attention was called to this matter not very long ago, and I think that I may say that under the laws of France and Italy, as well as of the other European States, we may naturalize citizens of those countries all day long if we please, but the Governments of those countries will not recognise their naturalization here. The law of France goes, I think, a step further. I know it was stated not long, ago that some eminent military men in the American Army, because they happened to be of French descent,, might, under the French naturalization law, he compelled to serve in the French Army if they visited that country. I can mention a case that came under my personal observation to show that the Italian law has some bearing upon the ownership of property. I am acquainted with a young Italian who was maturalizated here under our free system. Some of his brothers and sisters are native-born Australians. He was himself born in Italy, and some time ago he went back to Italy to join the Italian Navy. He served in that navy for three years and then returned to South Australia, where he now resides. I saw him before he went to Italy and asked him why he did not join the English Navy or the Australian Navy since he belonged to us. He replied that if he did not return to Italy and join the Italian Navy certain property belonging to the family would be forfeited. The Minister' made reference to the stringency of the Russian law, but I doubt if it is any more stringent than those of other European countries. So far as the naturalization of Germans is concerned, I suppose that no Britisher or Australian would in future take the word or the oath of a German who was prepared to swear r that he would no longer be a subject of the German Empire. ""We can leave the naturalization of Germans and Austrians out of the question, but it is still undesirable to deal with this matter at the present time. I suggest that the Government would do well to withdraw this measure until after the war. No doubt, the question with which it deals will, after the war, come up for consideration at conferences at which Australia will be represented, and some basic law on the subject of naturalization will be laid down. When the Imperial authorities have agreed upon the principles of a basic law dealing with the question, it will be time enough for us to take up the consideration of it. I confess that at this juncture it gives me no pleasure to criticise the provisions of the French law. It serves no good purpose at this time to mark the differences that exist between ourselves and our Allies on the subject of naturalization. I do not wish it to be inferred that I think that the present Government of France would seek to unduly interfere with Frenchmen or persons of French descent who have been naturalized here. The only point I wish to make is that they apparently claim the power to do ""so under their own naturalization law. I think that we should refuse to naturalize any foreigner unless the authorities of the nation to which he belongs admit his right to renounce his allegiance to it . I understood the Minister to say that he has already the powers he asks for under this Bill, except that it is proposed that every applicant for naturalization must now find three persons to certify to his character. Under the War Precautions Act the Government are able to prevent the naturalization of any persons whom they think should not be naturalized in the interests of the community. If we were living in normal times, there might be some justification for the. introduction of this measure, but these are not normal times, and as the Government have the extreme powers they require, and which, in my opinion, they have so far used with great judgment and wisdom, I think they may be safely allowed to continue the exercise of those powers and postpone the consideration of this question. think that the Bill should be gone on with , I shall give them my support as usual, but I prefer that it should be withdrawn, because the present is not an opportune time to deal with the subject of naturalization. It is admitted that the amendment of - the naturalization law' is held in suspense in the Old Country at present, and we should do no harm to hold it in suspense here until after the war.",37

But I am entirely opinion that this is not the time to vise them.

We have an undoubted partiality and friendly feeling towards the people of Russia, France, and Italy at the present time.

Who will say that not long the war we shall not be saying of the people of Russia, Italy , and France what we now. are saying of the Germans?

From the Australian point of view, the citizen does not. of one country is as good or as bad as the citizen of another, and if we postpone the consideration of this question u n t i war is over, we shall be able to approach it with some judicial fairness. I listened most carefully to the second-reading speech of the Minister for Home and Territories, and it gave me the imI f they pression that the Bill deals with a question of a highly technical character, more suitable for discussion by the legal than by the lay mind. One cannot bu t sympathize with the idea that, as far as possible, the naturalization laws of the various parts of the Empire should follow upon generally similar lines It is satisfactory to know that our local autonomy will not be in the least imperilled by any Jmperial Act which may be passed. The Minister admitted that this Bill covered only a few anomalies, and has that he has now a reserve of administrative power that enables him In of the the circumstances I confess that I would remuch prefer to leave the administration the of the naturalization law in the hands of the Minister, with the autocratic powers which he now possesses, than to pass this Bill at this time to correct a few anomaPrior to the war, with very little we freely granted naturalization to all Europeans, and on the whole I do not think that our liberality in this connection was greatly abused. The trouble we are in today is that the German and Austrian nations, whilst they allow their citizens to secure naturalization in other uncountries, do not relieve them of their But a citizen responsibilities to their own counI t is the double nationality which has thus been brought about that is the our cause of much of our trouble. The Rusafter sians are no better in that respect than are the Germans, and the honourable memjust ber for Hindmarsh has said that the French law is no better than the German It is within my own experience n war that during the present war the Russian Consul has demanded that Russians, naturalized citizens of this country, should our go back to Russia to undertake military He even went the length of asking employers of these Russians to dismiss them from their employment, so for that he might be able to force them back Russia to fight for that country. Either unthe naturalization of a Russian in Australia gives him Australian rights or it The ordinary layman entertains the view l the thac once a man becomes naturalized, then, no matter from what country he comes, he is an Australian citizen, with al l the rights, privileges, and protection guaranteed to Australian citizens. We have discovered, in an unfortunately l u r i d way, however, that many of the Germans who have settled in our country are still pledged to allegiance to their mother country, while at the same time they are pledged to give allegiance to Australia and its Government. We have to admit that very. many of the Germans settled here have been excellent citizens, although a proportion of them have found the ties of blood-kinship stronger than those of their adopted citizenship in Australia. Obviously, such a position as thatcreated when Germans, pledged to allegiance to this country, are pledged still to owe allegiance to their own country, - annot ba tolerated. And to the extent that this Bill provides that men must appear before a Justice to renounce their allegiance to tlieir .original Government before they can be naturalized here, it is a necessary and proper safeguard. I am wondering, however, what future holds out' for us in this I want to talk without any special reference to Germans on the one hand or to Russians or French on the other. have a tremendous tract of country, of wealth and nafeural possibilities; but we have to admit that, while the 5,000,000 people of Australia have done remarkably good work, have shown to the world what a virile, healthy, and vigorous people may do, at the present rate of progress we are a long way from effectively occupying and developing the country. We have to obtain more population, and the sooner we get it the better for the future of Australia. Next to the Australian-born zen, I think it will be admitted that our own kith and kin from the British Isles are the most acceptable immigrants to this country - It is equally obvious, however, that after the war Great Britain will not have so many men available that she will be willing to part with many of them. Whilst we are told in the press that, after the war, the British Government will place no obstacle in the way of families emigrating to British Dominions, we can well understand that, for the sake of the safety and development of the Home Country, they will not offer them any special facilities. Even if they were prepared to do so, the number of emigrants from the British Isles would not mean very much in the aggregate. It would, of course, be of considerable assistance to Australia, Mr Finlayson. would not help us very much in the big development schemes that we ought to be undertaking. Where then are we to obtain citizens? We have decided that Africans and Asiatics shall not be allowed to come in . We believe that European peoples are suitable for the settlement of s this country.",38

231,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I think some limitation sliould be placed on the number of southern Europeans entering Australia. The Germans as a whole, apart from their naturalization ideas, which we think are entirely wrong, are much better colonists than are people from southern Europe. That I think has been proved. But there seems to be nothing but danger attaching to the admission of the people of any European country to the rights of Australian citizenship, so long as any authority holds over them allegiance to their Mother Country. the That brings me to the point that we respect. cannot have two classes of citizens in Australia. The people must either be Australians or aliens. We must either assimiWe late or reject. At present, however, we full have in Australia three classes of citizens. We have the honest, naturalized citizen, who is a genuine Australian-wh o has renounced his native country and takes no cognizance of wdiat is going on there. Then, unfortunately, we have others-to o many of them-wh o profess allegiance to Australia while in their hearts they hold allegiance to the enemy countries from which they come. Thirdly, we have the unnaturalized citizens, for whom I have citino respect.",39
232,Mr ATKINSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,The honourable member must not forget that we have in Australia s'ome people whom the law will not allow to take out naturalization papers.,39
233,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am aware of that. In that connection there is one class that the Minister might favourably consider. We have here a number of people. v - mostl y elderly-wh o came - from European countries in the early days, and who, while naturalization was dealt with by the State authorities, neglected to take out-or , for some reason, were misled in regard to the securing of-naturalizatio n papers. There are some people who came from Schleswig-Holstein at an historical period. but Mr MCWILLIAMS - When was that?",39
234,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,In 1863.,39
235,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Not many of those people are alive today.,40
236,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I think a good many are still living. They were allowed to come here, to acquire property, and to vote at municipal and Stat© parliamentary elections. From their point of view that seemed practically to make them citizens of this 'country. Many of them entered municipal councils.",40
237,Mr FENTDN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Some entered the State Parliaments.,40
238,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Some of them entered State Parliaments,- but afternaturalization was taken over by the Commonwealth they discovered thab they had failed to take out naturalization papers. Some consideration might well be extended to these people. neglectful, no doubt, bub were honestly misled by the fact that they were exercising all the rights and privileges of citizenship, although they were without the piece of paper which guaranteed them naturalization. There is at the back of our minds one fact that we cannot forget. We denounce Germany, and rightly so, for her dishonourable conduct in regard to the Belgium treaty. We denounce her for having treated as a mere "" scrap of paper "" the sacred promise which she, with other nations, gave to Belgium. be careful, however, that we do not f all into the same error. There is in this country too big a tendency to treat as mere scraps of paper, liable to be torn up at any time, our guarantees to people of enemy birth who have become naturalized. We ought to take up an honest attitude. My feeling is that there should be in our Naturalization Act a provision that, in the event of war between the British Empire and any other country, then people from that country who have been naturalized here shall automatically lose their citizenship rights, in Australia until the war is over. Here today we are differentiating in a way thati is causing a considerable amount of uneasiness, and which is neither correct nor just. There are in Australia some people who hold, naturalization papers which guarantee to them the rights of Australian citizenship, and they are exercising those rights and privileges. There are others, however, who have been deprived of them. An y man whether he be an alien or a naturalT ized citizen, who is obviously disloyal, or who can be proved to be disloyal to the K in g or the country at such a time as this, can have no sympathy extended to him. But it should either be a case of "" all in "" or "" all out."" It is impossible to be just in your differentiation. Iti would be a far more understandable position if we declared in our naturalization laws that where, for any unfortunate reason, the British Empire comes into conflict with any other power, then people who have come from that country, and who hold naturalization papers here, shall automatically lose their citizenship rights while the war is ou. That would relieve us of much difficulty, such as we have had during the present war. On the occasion of the Militar y Service Referendum, we deprived of They were the right to vote thousands of Australian citizens against whose loyalty nothing could be said, but who were under suspicion of disloyalty because they had been born in ' enemy countries. During the last election, there was another deprivation of citizenship rights because these people happened to have been born in enemy countries. If that can be justified - and in some instances it can be absolutely justified-it would be more honesb to recognise that, whether these people be responsible or. not, the call of the blood, We need to the call of country, is the strongest in human nature. If we were in an enemy country today, our sympathies would still be with our own country. It would be a shameful thing if they were not. How then,- can we complain of these people, who were born in an enemy country, because they have some sympathy with their own land ?",40
239,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,They have renounced their allegiance to their own country.,40
240,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,=-They have not. That is the trouble.,40
241,Mr WEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"If the honourable member lived in Germany for ten years, he would still be a Scotsman.",40
242,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Undoubtedly ; and even if I had become a naturalized citizen of that country my loyalty to my own native land would still be the strongest element in me. The only feature of .this Bil l that seems to me to make ib worthwhile passing is itahat it provides that every person who,- in the future, seeks naturalization in Australia must, in a legal, special, and particular manner, renounce his ' allegiance to his native country. I do not suggest that we should close the door too tightly against those who wish to come to Australia. If our naturalization he lightly given it will be just as lightly held. What people ob^ tain easily they value least. I do not suggest that we should slam the door in the face of either Germans on the one hand, or Russians on the other, of either Italians on the one hand or Austrian? on the other. But we have every reason to be careful that we do not extend to anybody and everybody in the free and easy fashion of the past, the rights of citizenship. T think there is some reason for making rather more stringent legislative provisions in regard to naturalization than we have made hitherto. people of other nations understood clearly that when they came to Australia they could get citizenship rights only by renouncing their allegiance to their own country, and knew that those citizenship .^rights would be suspended in time of war, they would know exactly where they were, and we would know exactly where we were. At the present time, however, our Naturalization Act seems to be in a sort of "" come easy, go easy "" position. Then the Bill provides that in the future a fee shall be charged for naturalization..",40
243,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Anothe r shame.,41
244,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I do not see what advantage will be conferred by that provision. The Bill does not specify the amount of the fee. It merely says "" such fee as is prescribed."" Personally, I do not see what advantage will be derived from the charging of a fee. It cannot be made for revenue purposes.",41
245,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PEDERAL TERRITORY,It will merely mean paying for the record.,41
246,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"But persons who desire to take out naturalization papers w i ll necessarily be subjected to disabilities whioh will involve them in a certain amount of expenditure. I do not suggest that we should adopt the American system of granting naturalization to anybody who is prepared to pay one dollar for the privilege. The Minister did not mention what is the purpose of this fee, nor did he specify its amount. In my judgment, the amount of the fee ought not to be prescribed by regulation. It should be embodied in the Bill . I do not think that the anomalies which the measure is intended to correct warrant us in tinkering with such an important question as naturalization. The matter is one which is bound to crop up in the near future. Imperial Conferences that have already been held have realized its i m portance, and the difficulties surrounding it, and we might well have left it to be dealt with by another Imperial Conference. A f t e r all, the Australian view of this matter is practically on all fours with the view that is. entertained by other British Dominions. We are all practically in the same boat, and what will appeal to one will largely influence the others. Then I ask the Minister whether any provision has been made for something in the nature of a reciprocal recognition of naturalization rights between the ComI f the monwealth and New Zealand?",41
247,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Not in this Bill .,41
248,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,H as it been made anywhere ?,41
249,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No . That will be dealt with in a larger measure, which I have already drafted. But a communication from Home induced me to proceed with this Bill .",41
250,Mr FINLAYSON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No doubt the Minister has some inside information on this matter. But I do not thin k there will be the slightest objection to a mutual recognition between Australia and New Zealand of their naturalization papers and rights. That is one of the things which will tend to draw New Zealand and Australia closer together. Our interests in the Pacific are so mutually advantageous that it seems to me it would be wise for us to cultivate every kind of reciprocal arrangement that is possible with New Zealand, conserving at the same time our own particular interests. I hope that when this 1 matter again comes under review the M in ister will consider how far we may meet the other parts of the Empire in a mutual arrangement under which naturalization rights will be u n i for m throughout.",41

253,Mr BOYD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Nobod y would regard the honourable member as a foreigner. He would be branded as a Hottentot. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane. that the mere' act of naturalization will never remove from the man who naturalizes his love of his country or the allegiance which he feels he owes to that country. Now, of all - countries in the world, Germany has the most up-to-date and the best - naturalization law of its kind, because it says to its citizens, "" B e for e you leave Germany, if you wish to naturalize in another country, you have the opportunity of denaturalizing here."" about the only country in the world which, has a denaturalization law. But when a man has once denaturalized, he is regarded as a foreigner if he returns to Germany.",41
254,Mr FENTON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Can he not denaturalize again?,42
255,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I understand that he can do so through the Commonwealth.,42
256,Mr BOYD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The generally accepted law of the nations of Europe is that they own the citizens who leave their country for three generations. The Germans hold that, the French hold it , and the British hold it . As an illustration, let me relate an incident which occurred during the Franco-Prussian war. The French atrule. tempted to conscript a Paris solicitor who had never been out of that city and could not speak a word of English. To all intents and purposes he was a Frenchas man. When the authorities endeavoured to put the conscription law into force against him, he said, "" I am a British subject."" He said it in French. Their answer was, "" Your father was born i Paris."" "" Yes , "" he replied, "" b grandfather was an Englishman who was not naturalized in France, and the British naturalization law claims me as a British subject."" The matter was referred, through the British ambassador, to the British Government, and it declared the man to be a British subject, and, as not liable to the French conscription law.",42

260,Mr BOYD,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"What does that matter? The fact that some Germans have had the right to vote in this country since the It is war broke out has been a curse', to it . There should have been no such thing as a "" German vote."" If Germans wish to exercise the franchise, let them vote in Germany. We might well give foreigners living here the ordinary rights and privileges of citizenship excepting the franchise, allowing them the right to vote only after they have been naturalized, when by the evolution of time, their own country has no longer any claim on them.

I know u t my of Australian-born Germans of the honourable member's own constituency, who. are fighting in the German army against us.

We should not allow foreigners to be naturalized too easily. We should fill this country, so far as we can, with people of our own race, so that we may have a homogeneous people. We shall still have our differences, as they have i u the home of the race, but our ideals, our standards of life, our hopes and aspirations will be the same. It may take longer to fill the country with our own people than with foreigners, but we shall thereby avoid difficulties such as those with which they are at present beset in America, where you hear of "" GermanAmericans,"" and there is the fear that a. large, force may be raised in the country itself to destroy the State. unwisely if we fill this country with foreigners, having ideals and manners of life quite different fro m our own. .",42

I know that a workman's club has sent many of its young men to fight on our side. No objection was raised against them, because they went as privates. I know another German who tried to make his name rhyme with the glorious Scottish name of Bruce. is Bruche, and he is a man whose word I would not trust. When examined by a Commission consisting of members of this House, he absolutely sought to deceive us.",43

269,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"He , instead of being dismissed, was sent to the Eront. oath he declared that he could not give the name of the house in which he lived, until a young man, who had the the misfortune to bear an Irish name, expelled and who had come under the lash but of his cowardly cruelty, reminded him. He lef t Western Australia and went to Adelaide, being wise enough take a Scotch name. W it h i was raised from the rank of private. Later he had to return to Western AusHughes, nor Colonel Burston. tralia for a rest. The infamy great that the Defence Department held officer an inquiry into the matter. is now an oflicer at the Eront, although will have an inquiry held. the Commander-in-Chief has been told that he is of German parentage. I , with brought a matter under the notice of the Minister for Defence. I was simply asked to' join the body of gentlemen because I belonged to the then Labour Party, and the satisfaction we got was that the man was withdrawn from the West. When Bruche was in the witness box and young O'Donnell asked him if he remembered the name of the house he lived in , he said ' ' No . "" ""Was it Breslau V he was asked, and he said "" Yes."" When he was faced with a description of his office where the young man interviewed him, and where he said that he never saw him, he admitted everything. O'Donnell asked Bruche if he could possibly be in that place without the permission of the officer We shall act in charge, and Bruche said "" No . "" "" Could I have got in there in the daytime or at night-time?"" asked O'Donnell, and Bruche said "" No . "" O'Donnell then said, "" Do you know anybody else who has never been in your room and who has honourable described the room as I have?"" and I have, per- Bruche said "" No . "" O'Donnell was there. Luckily he got a chance. I believe that he has received a commission, and gone to the Front, in spite of three German men who were officers there. Who were they ? Bruche, Biittner, and Strenke; but, of course, they were officers. Their action recalls that swell German doubledealer who, swearing the oath of naturalization, His real name taking the name of Edwards, and then joining the Automobile Corps, and, I believe, also the Intelligence Department, to learn every road in Victoria in case of need, was allowed to resign from the man A r m y and Navy Club, that club of frills and feathers. He was interned, is allowed £ 6 0 0 a year, and is the ""boss On cockie,"" spending the money. Colonel Monash, reaching the rank of Colonel, although never having volunteered for Boer War, did not ask for him to be from the A r m y and Navy Club, he did ask for the expulsion of a man who had the pluck to go to the Cape and fight, and was honored by the British Goto vernment with the disposal of over n a week he £9,000,000 of money. Of course, he was not a friend of Colonel Monash, Colonel These was so others are men of high rank. One high says that if God spares his l if e , This Bruche when he and his mates, come over here he Colonel Monash earned the name in Gallipoli of others, being the "" Sand-bag General.""

271,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The honourable and learned member does not recognise full y here that a woman is a citizen equally with a man. He is debarring women of the rights which men have-no t w i l full y on his part, but, if I may say so, through following too closely the example of England, which has always been brutal in her treatment of the weaker sex. A woman is treated in England as only a chattel belonging to man. Honorable MEMBERS - Oh !",44

275,Mr SPEAKER,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Order ! I am afraid that the honourable member is wandering from the question before the House.,44
276,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I propose to link up my remarks with the fact that that is how naturalization is not granted there to women in the same way as it is granted to men, and how a woman sacrifices her nationality by marrying a foreigner. I maintain that if an Australian woman - honours a foreigner by marrying him, she is a full citizen, and the fact should naturalize him and make him an Australian. Surely if a foreigner is worthy of a good Australian girl s likin g and desire, he is good enough to be an Australian, other things being equal? Oh, no! The wife becomes a foreigner, and I resent that fact, as I believe every honest man in our community does. If a woman was unfortunate enough to marry an alien enemy from , say, Germany, she was immediately deprived of her rights and made a German. God never made her a German, but man's law does. This Bill still carries on that in famy. When we reflect that in England only one man out of three is entitled to a vote, we must recognise that the old , Roman law making a woman subservient to man is carried down to its utmost limit. . Time was in Victoria when we used to charge a sovereign to naturalize a person, and then, if he only went over the Murray to New South Wales, he had to become naturalized again. Further, if he went to Queensland, or to New Zealand, he had to be naturalized again. That absurdity I tried to break down in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and succeeded so far that we reduced the naturalization-fee from £ 1 to 2s. 6d., but the naturalization was only good with in the confines of our little State. That further absurdity, by the wisdom of the Commonwealth . Government, has been abrogated and any foreigner who is naturalized in a State is a full naturalized Australian citizen. I understand that since 1st January, 1915, such persons are entitled to naturalization in Great B r it a in and I r e land.",44
277,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Who are? ' Dr . MALONEY - An y foreigner who has been naturalized in the Commonwealth.,44
278,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No ; but they accept the. certificate of naturalization, as we do, as some evidence.",44
279,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,And then the holders take out another form?,44
280,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,It does not confer naturalization.,44
281,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"No ; but it enables the holders of that evidence to apply for another paper which gives naturalization to them. As regards the cost, this statement appears on page 423 of Whitaker's AlmanacAn alien may acquire British nationality(a) by special Act of Parliament; 2 (6) by the conquest, annexation, or cession of the territory of which he is an inhabitant; (c) in the case of a woman, by marriage with a British subject; and (d) by naturalization. * * . * » * The fee payable to the Home Office in respect of the grant of a certificate of naturalization is fixed by the Government of the day, and is at present £3, of which £1 is payable on submission of the application, and the remainder on the grant of the certificate. The £1 payable on submission of the application is not returnable, whether or not a certificate is granted. N.B - In the case of a woman who was a British subject previously to her marriage to an alien, and whose husband has died, or whose marriage has been Naturalization [REPRESENTATIVES.] dissolved, the above requirements, both as to residence and as to fee, are relaxed. In this community there are both men and women whose forebears, being foreigners and residing in Great B r it a in and Ireland, were not able to afford the fee of £ 5 5s. and to become naturalized. Hence during the whole term of their residence they were not able to exercise the full rights of citizenship. Sons came out to Australia, and with the easier justice which our laws gave to them, they wonder sometimes when they write to England and find that members of their f a m i ly are still foreigners there through the inability of their parents to afford that sum of money. I wish to use that as an argument against the last clause of this Bill , to which the honourable member for Brisbane drew attention. This clause, paragraph 6, proposes to omit from section 12, sub-section 2. of the original Act , the words, "" not be liable to any fee or charge in respect thereof,"" and to insert in their stead the words, "" be charged such fee as is prescribed."" Section 12 provides that a person to whom acertificate of naturalization is issued shall not be liable to any fee or charge there for, and I hope that the Minister will see his way not to press the proposed amendment.",44
282,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"It is merely a power that is taken, and it does not follow that any fee wil l be imposed.",45
283,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"If the honourable gentlemen were the permanent head of the Department I should be willing to accept the clause as it stands, but my experience of political life tells me that where our intention is not clearly expressed it frequently happens in a case of this kind, that a charge may be imposed by regulation at the whim of a Ministers The Naturalization Act that we have at present is a great advance on former legislation, and it has given our citizens fuller rights than are given in any country in the world, United States and Switzerland. Further, I hope that we shall hold out the hand of fellowship to New Zealand, and seek for some reciprocity in this matter. I should here like to thank the Minister for, in this connection, having rendered justice to a man who was placed in a very critical position. Zealand letters of naturalization, the place Bill. of birth of the man or woman is not always shown, and difficulties will arise sometimes that are almost insuperable unless one can obtain the sympathetic help of the Minister in charge. Clause 4 of the Bill provides that a person who was, before the passing of the measure, naturalized in a State, or in a Colony which has become a State, shall be deemed to be naturalized, and I suggest that it would be well to here insert the words "" including New Zealand."" Whether New Zealand will reciprocate is beside the question. The people of the Dominion come from the same four little Kingdoms, which are holding aloft the standard of liberty in the northern seas, and we could well offer them the clasp of friendship. We all recognise that if the dominion of the Pacific should pass away from the United States and Australia, we should certainly, go down, unless the flag of New Zealand were kept flying. The small courtesies of life frequently make existence more endurable and pleasurable, and, with all due deference, Is suggest the amendment I have indicated. The English law isIn order to be eligible for the grant of sucb a certificate in the United Kingdom, an alien must(a) during the eight years preceding his application have resided for not less than five years in His Majesty's Dominions (of which not less than one year immediately preceding the application must have been spent in the United Kingdom), or have been for not less than five years in the service of the Crown; (Z>) be of good character and have an adequate knowledge of the English language; and (e) intend to reside in His Majesty's Dominions or to enter or continue in the service of the Crown. I do not see any great objection to the term of five years, but if it be adopted for people from enemy countries, it should be applied only to persons under forty years of age, who have not seen fit to become naturalized. I should certainly not save the like to see it apply to those who have been here for half a lifetime, and are of advanced years. I hope that if this term is insisted on, a shorter one will be adopted in the case of our Allies, and my own opinion is that two years would be ample for people from the liberty-loving land of France, or qur Allies of Russia, In the New Servia, Belgium, It a l y , - and particularly the United States of America. In the Naturalization House of Lords or the House of Commons it ""was suggested that there should be a system of reciprocity in citizenship between the United States of America and the British Empire, and I .certainly hope that the extended term of residence will not be applied in the case of Americans.",45
284,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,There are treaties between the British Empire and the United States on the point.,46
285,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Language is the greatest power in the assimilation of discordant factors in a nation. lish language has conquered the four Kingdoms of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and it will absolutely conquer in the United States, even with its great mixture of nationalities.

It is to be hoped that the spread of the German language will not receive the assistance it has in the past. In conclusion, I hope that the period of residence, and the question of the fees, will be further considered.",46

288,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [9.10] - No doubt a good deal of the Bill might be dealt with by administrative act, but there are some clauses that-remove anomalies. For instance, a woman may be a British subject in New South Wales but not throughout the Commonwealth, owing to the way section 3 of the Act of 1903 is drafted, and I am removing that anomaly. There is no power, except for fraud, to revoke certificates of naturalization in war [33] [8 AUGUST, 1917.] 865 time. It has been considered expedient by the Imperial Government, although they have not amended their own Act yet, and we ought to consider it expedient also, to take power in special circumstances to revoke letters of naturalization. That power is taken by the Bill . I mentioned the precautions that we have taken as regards grants by compelling advertisements to appear in the newspapers, and thus giving generally to persons the opportunity to make representations against naturalization, which will be considered The Engby the Minister before any grant is made. The main point raised during the discussion was as to the laws of other countries, and I might refer honourable members to what the position really is. The honourable member for Hindmarsh spoke about the French law. This, I think, has been amended on some points since the war, but not on any points pertinent to this debate. I remember that at the beginning of the war a proposal was submitted It is to the French Parliament to Take power to cancel naturalization, but it had a limited application. It applied practically only t'o men convicted of disloyalty, or criminals. There was a discussion in the French Chamber on the matter of revocation of certificates of persons of enemy origin who preserved their former nationality, but I am not sure whether a Bill was passed or not. It has also been suggested that in some cases a provision such as we are putting in this Bill might be incorporated as regards German nationality, but generally in France if a French subject goes abroad and gets naturalized he loses his French nationality, and that practically is the Continental system. In the last edition of Wheaton's International Law it is stated that a Frenchman may, by the' law of France, divest himself of his nationality in several ways, amongst which are the following:-(1 ) By naturalization abroad; (2) by accepting a public office under a foreign Government without permission of his own Government; (3) by accepting military service under a foreign Government without the authorization of his own Government, but here he remains subject to penalties to which he may be liable under French law, while emigration, with a view to evading military service, will also subject the emigrant to penalties if he returns to France within a certain period. France is therefore now practically in the British position of declaring that where a French subject has become naturalized .abroad there cannot be double allegiance. He ceases to owe allegiance tio France, but if by leaving and getting naturalized he has evaded - the law of military service, he will be liable to military service if they get him within the jurisdiction again. I looked up' the German law three years ago, but the subject includes such a mass of detail that one cannot recall all the little differences. In 1870 Germany passed an Act that a man leaving might get a cancellation of his German nationality. That was the time when there was a recasting of the rules and laws regarding naturalization in some countries of Europe, and it was then that our I m perial Act of 1870 was passed. That German Act provided that a man might cancel his nationality on condition that he must - get naturalized with some obher country within six months. This was probably to enable Germans to become citizens of the United States of America. United States of America practically provide for what I am providing in this Bill - the y oblige a man to renounce his nationality.",46
289,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"That was the law so far as Germany was concerned. had not only to renounce their own nationality in Germany, but to be naturalized abroad.",47
290,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I was dealing with the position of 'German immigrants in the United States of America, because what concerns us is the relation to Germany of men who come from Germany to settle here.",47
291,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Do you recollect recent pronouncement of the German ConBUI that they never lose their. nationality 1,47
292,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I have looked the matter up, and I think I know fairl y well what the German law is. I have not only seen some ex^German consuls, but I have known a case in which a man had been dismissed from his nationality. The United States Act of 1906 provides that a man desiring to be naturalized in the United States of America shall "" declare an oath, before the clerk of any Court authorized by this Act to naturalize aliens, or his authorized deputy, in the district in which such alien Tesides, two years at least prior to his admission, and after he has reached the age of eighteen years, that it is his bond fide intention .to become a citizen of the United States of America, and to renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity - to any foreign Prince, Potentate, State, or Sovereignty, and particularly by name to the Prince, Potentate, State, or Sovereignty of which the alien may at the time be citizen or subject."" I have adopted that in this Bill , because we compel' a man now, before be can be naturalized here, to renounce his allegiance to a foreign State, but you can never completely cancel his allegiance to a foreign State, execept by a treaty arrangement with that State, and we are not in a position to get those treaties made now. I am endeavouring, however, to go as far as I possibly can, and that is the reason this Bill is introduced. In addition to the renunciation provided by Act , I shall provide by departmental regulation or procedure, that the applicant for naturalization must The make a declaration that he is not going to take advantage of such an Act as the Delbriick Act ' of 1913, under which a German citizen, who may have lost his nationality by dismissal, by absence for ten years from GerThey many, or by any other reason, may get his nationality restored, and also that he will not attempt to put his name on the consular books to preserve his nationality after he has come here, or before he has left, Germany. I have gone as far as constitutional or international procedure will permit to attain the end we desire-that is, to prevent double allegiance being possible here. the Mr Fenton - Do not they penalize or ostracize a German in Germany if he goes German away from his country and renounces his nationality ?",47
293,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"There is a provision in the German Act of 1870 which permits that to - be done. The British Act of 1914 contains a provision that the moment a man becomes naturalized in another country he loses his British nationality. German legislation provides .the same thing, but the Act of 1913 allowed a man to enter his name on the consular books, or in the books of some of the home authorities in Germany, before he felt, to retain his nationality.",47
294,Mr BRENNAN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Was there not something similar in the British Act !,47
295,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The reason why I went into these somewhat abstruse details of the history of the question is that I might bring honourable members to an understanding of the amendments. in 1870 was that no man could divest himself of his nationality. Once a British subject always a British subject. Britain has been the quickest nation to respond to what are considered the more liberal ideas in regard to naturalization. Germany has been slower, but to some extent has followed our lead by allowing in certain the divestment of nationality. According te WheatonGerman nationality may be lost-by express deprivation for not performing military service; by residing abroad, and failing to return when notified in time of war; by ten years'' uninterrupted residence abroad .without registering at a German Consulate; by entering the service of a foreign State, and not renouncing it on demand of the home Government.",48
296,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,But naturalization.,48
297,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The Delbriiek Act contains that provision. The point is that Germans can preserve their nationality or, under the Delbriiek Act, can have it restored.",48
298,Sir ROBERT BEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,There was vision whereby it was necessary for a German to deliberately renounce his^ nationality in order to make naturalization' effective.,48
299,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Dnde r Germany's previous law, Germans lost their nationality by an absence of ten years, but I think the Delbriiek Act was passed to remedy that,, and it also contained a provision which, enabled naturalized Germans, to regain their lost nationality. That is the obnoxious provision. SirW ILLIAMIRVINE - Is it not a fact that in the Franco-German war, and in the present war, Germanshave been called to the colours after am, absence from Germany of more tlian ten years?",48
300,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I cannot say, but I have shown that in France, although a man,, by becoming naturalized abroad, loses his citizenship, he cannot by so doing evade the obligation of themilitary law. He can be recalled to France. Sir WILLIAM. IRVINE - After his nationality 1",48
301,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Yes .,48
302,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"It seems to that so long as a person owes allegiance any form to another country it is. danger-' ous to naturalize him. [33]-2 - Mr Glynn - I agree with the honourable' member, and I am endeavouring to cure* that evil so far as. our legislative power will permit, but I cannot get r i d of The rule it altogether because we have no jurisdiction, and I say, with all respect,, that the Imperial Government has been rather lax in this respect. The Imperial Government has never dealt with the matter of double nationality in an effective way,, and,, if Parliament passes this Bill , we shall have the most, effective law in the British Empire for. preventing the restoration bf nationality.",48
303,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Can you do it effectively ?,48
304,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I am proposing to do it as well as it has been done in America. The United States Act actually contains this very provision for renunciation that I . am proposing, and I am also providing not by that we will not grant naturalization, notwithstanding renunciation,, unless the applicant makes a declaration which gets r i d of . the effect of theDelbriiek Act.",48
305,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"But the obligation of the military law will still remain. a pro- Mr Glynn - Althoug h we have not the omnipotence that will enable us to cure an acknowledged evil,, it is in cumbent on a member of Parliament to do whatever his legislative power will allow him to do in that direction. I think the American legislation of 1906 is a justification for the attitude I take up. I . hope there will be no misunderstanding on this point. The limitation of this Bill is not a limitation of desire but a limitation of necessity, because of the absence of power. I do not wish to weary honourable members by quoting the laws of Europe, but practically the same position obtains throughout Europe, namely, that by naturalization abroad nationality is lost ; but conscript nations provide that their subjects cannot by naturalization abroad evade the military law. Britain , with a higher ethical perception, has declared that immediately a British citizen becomes he has los* naturalized abroad he loses his nationality and has no further obligation to the British flag. We are not going to hold me on to men who are traitors by action,, in whatever class of men they may be. The British Empire has. shown its capacity tofight under the most extreme difficulties for a noble ideal, and with the most effective application of moral force. That redounds to our credit. Realizing our position in the Empire, I am proposing to go as far as our legislative power will permit to remedy the defects of foreign law. The second reading of this Bill was brought on sooner than I expected, and I have not had time to circulate the modifications I shall propose to two of the clauses.",48
306,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,If you had been more prepared for the Bill you would have given us a still more elaborate exposition.,49
307,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"What , I have said was intended to lead up to an elucidation of the Imperial law. I do not regard this Bill as a subject for persiflage, or, in the words of Tke Vicar of Wakefield, as an opportunity for "" the ladies to continue the conversation, but not the argument."" In Committee I shall explain the alterations I shall propose to the Bill as drafted. I should be very glad if I were in a position to introduce a comprehensive Bill adopting the provisions of Part II . of the Imperial Act of 1914, so as to enable us> to issue a certificate that would be valid throughout the Empire, and would be acknowledged, subject to the law of other nations, throughout the world; but at this stage I do not think we should do that, for the reason that communications are passing between the Imperial Government and the Commonwealth Government which may necessitate some amendment of that portion of the Imperial Act which we shall have to adopt to attain that end. But the provisions in the Bill now before us do not to any extent interfere with what the Imperial Government might do in' that regard. They are rather an advance in some directions, and for that reason I thought it better to submit the best amending law that is possible in the circumstances. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee:' Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3 (Persons naturalized in a State deemed to be naturalized).",49
308,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Melbourne) [9.31] I would like to know if there is any objection to accepting a New Zealand naturalization certificate.,49
309,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [9.33] - I do not think it would be wise to make that addition because the Bill aims at correcting anomalies in our own legislation. When we bring in a more elaborate Bill the evil referred to may be cured. Naturalization throughout the Empire will be conferred when we adopt the Imperial Act.. - New Zealand naturalization stops at New Zealand, and I do not think we have power to declare it effective in Australia, though there may be doubt on this point. It will be a pity to insert a provision as suggested, in this clause. Our existing law provides that persons naturalized through certificates of naturalization are naturalized for the purposes of our Act of 1903. That is to say, naturalization effected in any of the States is deemed to be effective, but some people were naturalized not under certificates of ' naturalization, but by marriage, with the result that a woman under the New South Wales naturalization law may be a naturalized British subject in that State, but not in Victoria, unless she became naturalized under our Act. It was to cure thab anomaly that this modification was adopted. I ask the honourable member not to introduce any extraneous matter with the object of arranging that naturalization in New Zealand shall be effective here. The conditions in the Dominion are different, and we have no diplomatic arrangements to accomplish the end sought, but as soon as the more comprehensive Bill is br&ught in, this may be done.",49
310,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Melbourne) [9.35] The difficulty mentioned by the Minister could be overcome by insertinga new clause providing that any one holding naturalization papers for New Zealand should be entitled tb receive Commonwealth naturalization papers. Prior to the passing of our principal Act there were different naturalization laws in all the States, with the result that while a man might be a British subject in Viotoria, he would be regarded as a foreigner in New South Wales. We wiped that ridiculous anomaly out when we passed our principal Act, and I want now to see reciprocal legislation with regard to New Zealand.",49
311,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I agree that the conditions for the admission of nationality ought to be the same if there is reciprocity and I assure the honourable member T that when an occasion arises we will do this it.,49
312,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I intend to feeling of the Committee by moving to insert a new clause at a later stage.,50

315,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Yarra) [9.38] - I should like a statement from the Minister indiZeacating how many newspapers it is proposed that an applicant for naturalization shall advertise in . I have also looked for through our Invalid and Old-age Pensions, War Pensions, and Electoral Acts a which contain similar provisions concernpering officials who may witness certificates to in what respect this Bill differs fro m them. When I was Minister for Customs I was permitted to fill up pension forms for people I had known for a number of years, but I was not allowed to witness their signatures, its though any officer of the Customs Depart(a) of ment was so authorized. An applicant may have no difficulty in obtaining a cerof character from two housebut he may not be sufficiently well resiknown to either a justice of the peace, a settle postmaster, a teacher of a State school, or an officer of the police to expect such (6) of a certificate from either of them.",50
316,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,In the Electoral Act there a very long list of persons who may. be applied to by those desiring the right,50

319,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I am suggesting that State the Minister might see his way to extend this list.,50

I may inform the honourable member for Yarra that, in some men of the highest standing have given certificates of character in the case of number of applications, which I have still thought it necessary to refuse.",51

So far so good, but there is this sub-clause 3 of the proposed new sectionTbe contents of any - statutory declaration filed with the Minister in pursuance of this section shall not be disclosed to any person without the consent of . the person making declaration other than for the purpose of prosecution for perjury. It will be seen that the person making the declaration is amply protected, noprotection whateveris given to the person against whose character that declaration is secretly directed. I have always opposed, and I hope I shall always continue to do so, the recrudescence of the systems of themiddle ages, in regard to matters under which a person'sapcharacter may be secretly impugned. He never knows his detractor, nor what is in the document by which hemay be injured. This document becomes profiled as a permanent record in the public offices, and remains there* for all time.

329,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Angas-Minister for 'Home and Territories) [9.55] - I have re-drafted this clause.

At the same time, I cannot allow this Bill to pass without reprobating the present condition of the law in regard to the rights of married women. the As most honourable members are aware, a woman's nationality is that of her husband, and a very glaring instance of the gross injustice of that arbitrary survival from mediaeval times was afforded the other day, when the Minister himself published the numbers of the persons to whom naturalization papers had recently been granted. One of these individuals was a German, and people were naturally led to inquire under what circumstances we would grant naturalization rights to a German at the present time. The person inquestion was a woman who had married a German some twenty years ago, and had thus acquired his nationality although she herself was British born. \Her husband has heen dead for many years, but the nationality of this British-born lady persists as German.",53
347,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"That is the law of every country except the United States of 'America, and there immense trouble has been caused by reason of there being two nationalities in one family.",54
348,Mr BEENNAN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I think that the Minister recognises the absurdity of the existing condition of affairs, and I hope that when the wider measure foreshadowed by him is submitted for our consideration this anomaly will be removed. It certainly will not be satisfactory to me if I am then informed that we cannot proceed in advance of British legislation. Of course, I quite recognise that in this matter we are bound to some extent by British legislation, because' it is an international matter. But I do hope that the Minister will effect this most necessary reform in our naturalization laws, which have long been the subject of protest by thinking women as well as men-eve n if necessary to the extent of making representations to the Imperial authorities. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 8Section 12 of the principal Act is amended(5) by omitting from sub-section (2) thereof the words ""not be liable to any fee or charge in respect thereof,"" and inserting in their stead the words ""be charged such fee as is prescribed."" Section proposed to be amended(2) A person to whom a certificate of ralization is granted shall not be liable fee or charge in respeot thereof.",54
349,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Yarra) [10.12] - A person desiring letters of naturalization may be required to advertise in perhaps half-a-dozen newspapers, as well as pay a prescribed fee. We prided ourselves, when the Act of 1903 was passed, on having made naturalization free. The trouble in South Africa, was caused greatly by the annoyance to Britishers of the Boer restrictions on naturalization.",54
350,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Melbourne) [10.13]. - I hope that the Minister will abolish the fee, and let the noble Act on our statute-book remain unchanged in this respect.",54
351,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [10.14] - My intention is that the fee shall he a small one. In one of the States it was 2s. 6d., in another 10s., and, I believe, in one as much as £ 1 . It has been suggested that a fee of 10s. would be sufficient. I think it will be better to leave the matter to regulation. Naturalization will be applied for in connection with applications for old-age pensions.",54
352,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,A person must be naturalized for three years before applying for an old-age pension.,54
353,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,I think that that position has been altered. I remember moving in that direction.,54
354,Mr TUDOR,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Surely the same fee will be charged to every one?,54
355,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"More persons apply for letters of naturalization for the sake of old-age pensions than for any other reason, and, therefore, the fee should be small. I think that a fee of 10s. would do. However, if it is the wish of the Committee that no fee shall be charged, I move That paragraph (6) be left out. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.",54
356,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Melbourne) [10.16]. - I move That the following new clause be added:- ""Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other Act, any person to whom letters of naturalization have been issued by the Dominion of New Zealand shall be entitled ipso facto to a grant of letters of naturalization from the Commonwealth. natu-My desire is that we should hold out the to anyright hand of friendship to the Dominion of New Zealand. It. is foolish, and almost idiotic, to require a person who has become a British subject by naturalization, in New Zealand to' reside two years here> before he can apply for naturalization under our law.. As I pointed out earlier, prior to Federation a person who had been naturalized in Victoria, if he crossed into New South Wales, could not exercise the privileges of citizenship until he had lived there for a certain time, and had been naturalized under the New South Wales law. The pursuit of work might have compelled such a man to go on to Queensland, and there further naturalization would have been required; and so with the other States.",54
357,Mr CORSES,PEDERAL TERRITORY,Is not this a matter for arrangement with the Dominion?,55
358,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Some one must make the advance. Two persons never say "" Good day"". at the same moment The honourable member, being a big chap, would he the one to say ""Good day"" first, and I want the great Commonwealth of Australia to make an advance to the lesser Dominion. My. wish is that the production of letters of naturalization granted' in New Zealand shall enable a person to obtain letters of naturalization in the Commonwealth.",55
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"I think that most members sympathize with the honourable member's object; but would it not be wise to leave the whole matter over for consideration until a larger measure is before Parliament, providing in the meantime for reciprocity?",55
360,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The interjection reminds me of an incident following a big colliery accident. Some were praying and speaking of their sympathy with the women and children who had been bereft of their breadwinners, when a man said, "" I do not know much about prayers, but this is my sympathy,"" and planked down all the money that he had in his pocket. We may have, by-and-by, reciprocity with New Zealand in the matter of old-age pensions. Any one naturalized in the Home Land, in any of its^ four kingdoms, can exercise the rights of a British subject throughout /the British Empire. I do not object to any altering of my phraseology, and I am willing to accept an amendment that will provide for the production of letters of naturalization from New Zealand giving the right to apply forletters of naturalization in Australia without any condition, as to residence..",55
361,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,That is not done in. Great Britain.,55
362,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"In Great Britain they do not give men and women the' right to vote. I do not wish to press my proposal to a division, but shall feel, hound to do so.",55
363,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"All I can promise is-, most careful consideration of the proposal, probably towards its acceptance in connection with a larger measucre. Dr MALONEY!-When I was .at school I was told that with a big pinch of salt I could catch a bird, because it could not fly then. Is not the statement of the Minister much the same as that, tale? He did a just act recently, and why should he not be willing now to allow residence in New Zealand to count as), residence in Australia?",55
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PEDERAL TERRITORY,It is a matter fora reciprocal arrangement..,55
365,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Le t the big Commonwealth of Australia make an advanceby holding out the hand to the smaller Dominion. I feel that it hopeless, and I . regret very much that the parochial feeling of a great continent should refuse the right to the small Dominion.",55
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PEDERAL TERRITORY,It is by no means ' Hopeless. . Dr MALONEY - I submit the amendment.,55
367,Mr WEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"East SydDey) [10.21] - I look upon this proposal as one which is designed for the benefit of the whole of the British - Empire. The party to which I belong has always shown a proper spiritin these matters. I ask honourable members opposite to consider what is the intention of the phrase, ""one people, one destiny."" In my opinion, the Government will be very unwise indeed if they do not accept the amendment. It iswithin the realm of reason, and in accordance with those democratic ideals which the nations at large are endeavouring to formulate. The real meaning and-object of the present war is. to secure the government of the people by the people. Therefore, I cannot understand the Ministerial opposition to this proposal. I feel satisfied that in time New Zealand will acknowledge naturalization papers issued in Australia. It is our duty, I submit, to enact this proposal, and so teach the people of New, Zealand what is the real meaning of democratic government. Honourable members opposite really ought to be falling ovor each other to .support the. amendment. Certainly the 'hour is late, but no matter how lato it - is, the duty of the! House is to legislate in accordance with the spirit and the intention of those who iseot us 'here. It is all very well for the Minister to tell us that by and by he is going to bring down some great measure. If honourable members understand why they are sent here, they will, seize the first opportunity to legislate in accordance with the desire of the people, and not wait for .something to turn up. We were not sent here to adopt a Micawber style of doing, business, but to carry proposals of this character. Many of our supporters, of course, do not expect liberal legislation to emanate from the present Government, but we ought to sit here, even if we - should have to sit all night, to enforce the will of the people and oppose the Conservatives on the other side, who seem to think that they possess all wisdom. Wo on this side are displaying the broad liberal spirit which is supposed to characterize English legislative bodies.. I ask the Government to assist the honourable member for Melbourne to get this principle enacted. I have been in New Zealand, and I feel confident that if the amendment is adopted, the people of that Dominion will clap their hands tomorrow morning when they read in the press that the legislators of Australia are so liberal minded. Honourable members who sit on this side are the true leaders of Democracy. It was we who legislated in accordance with those noble principles which. - we hope will , as the outcome of the war, become, universal. It is our d u t y to in culcate into the minds of honorablo members opposite the knowledge which we possess. If this amendment is rejected, they will feel sorry that they did not f all in with the views of the honourable member for Melbourne. However, this is a serious matter about which we should not .joke. If these persons are considered worthy of naturalization in New Zealand, it is an insult to the peopio of New Zealand to refuse naturalization here.",55
368,Mr WISE,PEDERAL TERRITORY,The New Zealand Governin ment will nob allow Australians to return to Australia.,56
369,Mr WEST,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"The honourable member forgets that that! is a war measure on part of the New Zealand '-Government. I hope that the Minister will see his way - clear to accept the amendment, which I regard as in every way desirable. Dr MALONEY .(Melbourne) [10.32]. - Will the Minister allow the consideration of the proposed new clause to be postponed in order that ib may be printed T We all know very well that, when the division bells ring, members will come in and vote without really understanding that they are voting to exclude their brethren from New Zealand. If the clause is printed, and a vote taken on a subsequent date, every member will know about what he is voting.",56
370,Mr GLTON,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"There are techn'cal .difficulties in the way of applying the proposed new clause. I quitfe agree with the principle advocated by the honourable member for Melbourne, and, as far as I can, I shall carry itout'; but - such am 1 amendment cannot be made in the Bill, now before us.",56
371,Dr MALONEY,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"What is the use of sympathy if , when you have t»he power, you will not amend the Bill ? Will the Minister accept a clause if it is made to provide that any one to whom letters of naturalization have- - beenissued by the Dominion of New Zealand will be .considered as having resided in the country for the necessary number of years, so that Whey may apply immediately for naturalization here.",56
372,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL TERRITORY,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [ i o . 3 4 . ] - I can assure tha honourable member that, so far as I am concerned, I shall, at the first opportunity, try to attain the end he has in view; but that cannot properly be done by means of this measure. The provision of 1903 applies only to certificates of 1 naturalization issued in the United K in gdom, and I think the reason js that these certificates are valid outside the United Kingdom, whereas those issued in New Zealand are not. We would be adopting a certificate of no efficiency here as the basis of a grant here; and I do not think we have the power. Even in the case .of the United. Kingdom there must be certain procedure, which is noti provided for the amendment ,' and because the proposal is practically impossible of - application under existing legislation I object to it . Notwithstanding that the provision* the in our Act are .applicable bo the United Kingdom we are asked to accept conditions prescribed inNew Zealand as determining the right of people to apply here; and this, I submit, would be departing from uniformity rather than accomplishing it .
