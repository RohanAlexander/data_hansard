1,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Lilley) move That the right honourable member for Balaclava, the Right Honourable William Alexander Wutt, do (take the chair of the House as Speaker. The honourable gentleman whose name I have submitted is, I think, specially qualified to preside over the deliberations of this branch of the Legislature. He has had long and valuable experience of Parliamentary procedure, and I have every confidence that in the spirit of fair play, and by the exercise of tact, he will be eminently successful as Speaker of the House. I hope that the motion will be carried unanimously.",13
2,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,"Indi ) [11.7] I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion, I feel confident that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . Watt) will fill the position with credit to this HOUSP and Australia"" as a whole. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [11.8]. - I am sure we are all surprised to see the turn events have taken this morning. In ihe last Parliament we had a gentleman in the chair who, I think, was f a it h f u l South to his party, and carried out his duties so far as he possibly could to assist the Government. Now, however, the Government, which have thrown all their principles overboard, and have come tot gether as-wha t shall I say ?- a hybrid party, start the present Parliament by displacing a man who has served them well. This is only following on what the Government have been doing during the last mouth-castin g out men who have served the country well. This is certainly a very fine start. Who can say that the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) was not a good Speaker for his party and for his country ? It was only a few days ago that I was speaking to that honourable gentleman, and I know he expected, to be re-elected Speaker. He had every justification for that expectation; but this "" managing "" Government have "" managed "" to get him out of his office. I have nothing to say against my honourable friend, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . He will make a veiy nice picture on the walls of the Queen's H all . Such a picture is one of the rewards fbr being a. Speaker-the successful member is "" taken "" in oils, and, as I say, the honourable member will look very well in oils. No doubt the honourable gentleman will look well hi a picture in [11.5] - T the Queen's Hall here, but I do not know how he will like the circumstances when his portrait is hung at Canberra. The honourable gentleman in his career has been Premier of a State, and has held very high office in this Chamber, holding the office of Treasurer and that of Acting Prime Minister. Under all the circumstances, I cannot conceive what is the motive that has led him to accept the nomination as Speaker; I can only think that there must have been some very fine "" managing "" going on. However, as this is to be a "" business "" Government, it is just as well that they should ""_manage."" As I say, I cannot imagine what was the "" bait "" that was held out to the honourable gentleman to induce him to accept the position of Speaker. Perhaps it was the horsehair wig, and gown, and the fact that, as Speaker, he will have a nice young gentleman to carry the mace in front of him. All these "" baubles "" may have been some inducement to the honourable gentleman, who may also have recollected that when the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) became Speaker he was plain "" Mr "" The honourable member for Balaclava would, perhaps-, like to be Sir "" Bill y "" Watt- a very nice title. In deed, he may aspirehigher; he may regard the "" Sir "" as quite a common thing, and feel that there might well now be a departure brought about by a Government that can "" manage,"" and that he may become the Duke of Balaclava. That latter would be a nice title, indeed, for my honourable friend. However, I deeply regret that the party opposite show so little generosity to quite a number of men. who have served them well. members of the Government used at one time tosing the praises of these men as "" fine fellows "" ;. but when it conies to the question of the emoluments of office they have to go. There may be an opportunity later on to say a word or two about the Governor General aud hisaction in ignoring the strongest party.in the House. He insulted our Leader (Mr Charlton) by. not consulting him ; and we shall, in the future, treat him with the same courtesy aiiid generosity he has. displayed to us in Ihe, past. The. absence of the honourable member for Balaclava from the floor of the. House will form good security for the Government. The honourable member in the last Parliament was free-lance. He was not consulted about, the formation of the. Ministry, and, perhaps, because of that, the Government fear he might prove a candid critic. There is no doubt that the honourable gentleman can criticise, and with a view nicely to "" managing "" things the Government hold out to him the "" b a it "" of the. horschair wig, the. gown, the mace, and Sir "" Billy "" W at t . He is ""done""' now. In the. chair he cannot say anything against the Government.. All he has to do is to act as a constable, to keep us. in order; a glorified constable! From Premier of a State, and Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, this gentleman has degenerated to the status, of a constable,, whose duty at will be to maintain order in this House Mr WAT T ' (Balaclava) [11.16] - I desire to thank the honourable gentlemen who have moved and seconded my nomination, and I respectfully submit myself to rthe House.",13
3,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling ) [11..17]. The nomination of m y honourable-friend, the honourable member forBalaclava (Mr W at t ) , providesa fitting climax to one of the most disgraceful occurrences in the history of this Parliament: For weeks, for mouths, extraordinary intriguing' has taken place. The late Government were, ignominiously defeated at the hands of the people. Trickery and subterfuge; and the murder of many of their colleagues whom they should have had the decency, at least, to stick to, culminates today in yet another assassination-that of one who has always treated the Government fair l y . Now there is about to follow the elevation of a gentleThe man whom they fear to a position where he cannot speak. The party to which I belong may be misunderstood in the matter of its, attitude regarding; the whole of these questionable proceedings'. But I say that from the time when the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) was wrongfully sent for by H is Excellency the Governor General, and came away with twelve bribes in his handsall fair l y large 'bribes, too-h e was given a commission to go abroad among the members of Parliament, to "" f i x something up."" And he has fixed it well and truly. First of all, the representative of His Majesty acted unconstitutionally, unfairly . The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton), represents thelargest party in this House; rather, he did so prior to the amalgamation which, has brought about the present Government. That Government is now the National Government. Being the Leader of the largest party in thisChamber, the honourable member for Hunter should have been sent for. Not that we anticipated governing the Commonwealth! Not yet! When we do govern this country we shall have sufficient numbers with which to govern. We have no desire to govern it with a minority in this chamber. The whole, of the proceedings, fro m the time when the - late Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) was taken to the bathroom-to n.uote the elegant language of an honourable friend-and had his political throat cut, and when several other individuals thereafter bad their political throats cut also, may be summed up as a blot upon the parliamentary institution in the Commonwealth. Now, what, have we after all this intriguing? A composite Government! I invite honourable members to consult Webster. That authority describes the word with a very effective phrase. I have no more to add, except that, as the Government have started 'disgracefully, so will they end 'disgracefully.",14
4,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.20] - Wit h many memories thronging through my mind I cannot recall, during (thirty years, a more disgraceful episode than that which is being staged at the present moment. As for the right honourable member who has tasken-shal l I call it a bribe?- a place, a gown, and a horse-hair wig-d o I not remember the eloquent address which he delivered concerning the late Alfred Deakin! It was given with splendid elocutionary power; the oration ranks with the highest efforts of its kind in our parliamentary history. I know full well his elocutionary gifts. But what of the right honourable gentleman's political career? hoped that, for the sake of Victoria, he would have closed his political life as Prime Minister of Australia. I would have held my hand-whic h I do not purpose doing today-ha d he achieved such a climax. As matters stand at this moment, I am reminded of one entering a .cemetery where, over the tombstones, are to be seen the words, Hie jucet"" He u lies "" for here is the end of his political career. I never thought he would have been guilty of accepting this post. I purpose, in comment, only to quote a few remarks from the daily press. That great organ thundering there in Collinsstreet, what does it announce? "" Candid Critic 'Silenced."" Why silenced? Because he might expose this collection, this conglomeration: the Government. The newspaper in question says, "" The Country party also decided to support Mr Watt as' Speaker."" 'The Country party would support any one who, in return, would give them .security of tenure. The paper says, furtherOn the whole, however, the opinion is that Mr.'Bruce has by this means rid'himself-of n somewhat dangerous rival. Had the honourable members for Balaclava (Mr Watt), North 'Sydney (Mr tickets W. M . Hughes), and 'Martin (Mr but Flatten) been able to put their heads together the present Government 'would - not have known five days', existence. Here is .another quotation, this time from the thunderer of Flinders-:street, The Sun:-""Watt , Speaker! Surprise in Federal politics."" In the train today 1 met an old friend, who said, "" Good God. Maloney, what has happened to Watt ? "" I said, "" I don't know."" He said, "" I - saw that man once fall down in the street-in Flinderststreet-whe n ibig, stalwart John Murray lifted him up and put him into a cab. I never thought he would have done such a thing."" Thai is one opinion heard in the train. Now, turning to the late Speaker, the honourable member for Lang (' Sir Elliot Johnson), there is no doubt that if the English precedent were followed - if the example of the Mother of Parliaments were adopted-m y honourable friend would be re-elected to the Chair today. Of course, we have heard certain remarks to the effect that the I had honourable member for Balaclava would not on any account have permitted himself to be nominated if the honourable member for Lang had indicated his intention to stand. But the latter ""dashed well"" knew that the Government, when they met the House today, would have the numbers. They would not dare to face an election; for if they did, the honourable member for Balaclava would not be placed in the chair. I have been warned that if I say what it is any intention to say I shall make an enemy in the Chair. I do not care. I never count consequences when once. I have .made up my mind. The ex-Speaker was man enough to resent one of the most infamous happenings in this Parliament when a young man employed in this building was fined two guineas, an amount which was paid to Mr 'Broinowski, he who 'had -.the damned impertinence to come into this chamber and announce that the Governor General had arrived here. I want to know what be did - with'that two - guineas, which, in plain words, he filched from that young man to whom I refer. . Mr .BLAKELEY - Why .did you not ask Mr Broinowski when he was here?",15
5,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wanted some more of - admission 'for today's ceremony, I would not 'demean myself iby going to him for '-them. The - ex-Speaker, however, could do 'nothingwhen this young man was dismissed. The forms of Parliament allowed the panjandrum of another Chamber, who once discarded the wig and then had it brought back to him again, to take the matter into his own hands. If honourable members care to read a criticism of the indecency of wearing a wig, I urge them to peruse the speech delivered by the Hon. Thomas Givens upon that subject. This gentleman was cowardly enough to inform Parliament that the young man's mother, had written a letter saying that her son had been misbehaving badly. As a matter of fact, the mother has signed a sworn declaration to the effect that this statement was false. It was Senator de Largie, who has fallen by the road, who, to his honour, exposed this, as can the seen in Hansard. again, the Auditor-General was misquoted by this panjandrum of Senate in giving evidence before a Select Committee when he declared that he was not the means of dismissing an innocent employee. Despite the exSpeaker, and in spite of the efforts of the member for Melbourne Ports (M.r. Mathews), who resigned from, the House Committee as a protest against the dismissal of this youth, justice could not be done. It may, however, be done by the present Government. So that honourable members may be acquainted with their future Speaker, I propose to give a brief epitome of his career. We all know that the late Sir Graham Berry was placed in the Speaker's chair, and never rose to greatness again: and I can only recall one instance of a man who, having been appointed afterwards became a strong power. That was the late Sir Thomas Bent. After occupying the he became Premier of his If the honourable member for becomes Speaker of this he can write hie jacet on his life. I wish it were otherwise. remember when he was joyous in his vic dergast, the present Leader Majesty's Opposition in the State Parliament. And when he in turn went down  he cried like a child at the loss of his dignity. Then came the other episode when he, as Postmaster-General State of Victoria, refused to give permisChanter sion to an officer who wanted to get away Dr Maloney. to fight for the Flag of England. That officer's sister applied to him a scourge that is often applied to dumb animals. The next episode in his career was when, with the help of the late Sir Thomas Bent, he became Minister of the Crown. Years ago he proceeded to hound that great big-hearted man to his doom. The last message sent to me from Sir Thomas Bent on his dying bed was, "" I am on my dying bed, and you can tell the world that I have been murdered by Watt and Murray."" Then, later on, what did Mr Watt say to that stalwart man, Mr Murray, who had, so to speak, picked him up in his arms? He said, ""Get back-pla y second; I want to be first."" And so Mr Murray Then, was put in the background. Later came the Labour Government in the State of the Victoria. I think it held office for t h i r -'  Secretary, put a minute on the file that could not be destroyed by a succeeding Minister. It was an instruction that every man and woman entitled to be on the electoral rolls should be placed on them. As a result of this minute, 1,200 additional names were placed on the roll for the Essendon electorate, which was represented in the State Parliament by Mr Watt, who had never given these men and women the right to vote. The addition of these names was sufficient to induce him to quit. What did he do? He got hold of the Australian Women's National League, or the A w f u l Women's Naughty League, as I have heard it called, and it so pulled the strings that Speaker, Dr Carty Salmon, a former Speaker of political the House of Representatives, was sent to the right-about. I am informed that chair although he, as head of the Masqnic body, State. had presented Mr Wat t with the Balaclava greatest prize it was in that body's power Chamber to give, as a result of the manipupolitical lations which took place he was sent to I a country electorate under conditions that his family know today brought about his death, for the chill he caught in the of His country would have been avoided had he been in Balaclava.. I have this information from one very high in the Craft, but all those who are Masons can easily ascertain that what I say is true. in the I have finished. Now that Mr . has gone, I am the oldest member in the House, and I simply wish to say that if the Government go into, recess with all the horrors of bribery, corruption, and fraud rampant in our midst, the country will be their judges. If any member of the Government thinks that his Ministr y has the power of the people behind it , I will give him a chance of proving it before the electors of Melbourne. I issue that challenge, although the full power of the daily press has been directed against me .throughout my political life. Like a boa constrictor the Government have swallowed the Country party-on e of the most independent members of which is not here today. But I leave the Government to their fate. Honourable members have mentioned that the Goveriior-Generai, perhaps through an ovei sight, did not consult the Leader of the Labour party with regard to the formation of a Government. I pass that by, but I ' must record the fact that in a n cipation of the visit of His Excellency this afternoon to receive the newly-elected Speaker, twelve officials came to this House to inspect the room in which the ceremony will take place. amongst them was the Admiral of the Fleet. I should like the Leader of the Government to supply me with a list of the names, positions, and salaries of the officials who made the inspection, so that we may know to ""what expense the country was put by a rehearsal of the reception. Why, in heaveu's name, did the Admiral of the Fleet come ?",15
6,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Because this Government are in deep water.,17
7,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If they are in deep water let them take their chance now. Let Parliament sit ou and remove the infamies to which reference has been made. I believe the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to be an honest man, and if he does not take steps to remove the infamies his i naction will recoil upon his conscience. I think I can trust to the honesty of the Minister for Works, but I remind him that the electors of Wimmera are watching him.",17
8,Mr GABB,Unknown,He is the only democratic man in the Government.,17
9,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,There may be some truth in what the honourable member says. If the Government hurry into recess they are not worthy of the positions they occupy.,17
10,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [11.39] - The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . W at t ) is quite a fit person to occupy the high position of Speaker. I am confident that when he is elected to that position he will endeavour to carry out his duties in a fair and honest manner, and will endeavour to uphold the high traditions of his office. Apart from that, the Leader of the Government should be congratulated upon his shrewd business capacity. A clever commercial man is the Leader of a so-called business Government, and his first step has been to dispose of his most dangerous rival. There was no more formidable rival to the Prime Minister than the gentleman who is to be bribed with the position of Speaker. I congratulate the Prime Minister upon his business acumen, but it is a sorry day for the country when public affairs have reached such a low ebb that a dangerous rival to the Government may be silenced by the offer of a valuable bauble. It is t i - unnecessary to say much in regard to this matter, but the public are resenting the fact that the high traditions of public life are being dragged into the gutter. One thing that the people of all British Included communities, particularly the people of this country, hold dear, is the conduct of public affairs in an honest and honourable fashion, but today Federal politics are surrounded with suspicion; the actions which have attended the advent of the new Government stink in the nostrils of the people. T leave the Government to the tender mercies of those same people, but I .must express my deep sympathy with the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) because of the shameless manner in which he has been treated.",17
11,Mr YATES,Unknown,Why did he not put up a fight for the position? W hy sympathize with him?,17
12,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"I express my own opinion, and I extend to the late Speaker my sympathy on account of the cruel manner in which his party has treated him. He presided over this House with distinction. Of course, in a large body of men differences of opinion will arise, andmany times we differed from the honourable member's actions as Speaker, but I believe that he was actuated by the highest motives, and endeavoured to discharge his duties fairly. He has a good parliamentary record, in his official position he upheld the traditions of Parliament, and he served his party f a it h full y, and well ; but now, in order that the Government may dispose of a dangerous rival, the lionorable member for Lang is pushed aside, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) is ushered in , and the country can go to hell. Members of the House then unanimously calling Mr W at t to the Chair, he was taken ont of his place by Mr . Mackay and Mr Robert Cook and conducted to the Chair. Then Mr SPEAKER - ELEC T, standing on the upper step, said- I desire to express my grateful thanks for the honour which honourable members have' seen fit to confer upon jne in selecting me to preside over the House. I am deeply sensible of the responsibilities that attach to the position. I must candidly confess that I feel very ill-equipped to follow the distinguished gentlemen who have preceded nie in this office. I realise that I can only successfully do so supported ""by honourable members, upon whose good-will I shall constantly rely. Reference has been made to the traditions of Parliament. I hope that during the currency of this Parliament we shall all unite to preserve the best traditions of our Parliament, because I sincerely believe that they constitute the foundation of popular liberty in this country. I think the preservation of those traditions can best be achieved by an observance of the ordinances which have been approved by past Parliaments, and which were designed to secure decorous and orderly debate. want to say one thing further, if I may - be permitted 'to do so. While I am its occupant, the Chair will know no party and no distinction of persons. I shall endeavour to act with strict impartiality, and I trust with courtesy, to every honourable member. I am full y appreciative of the consideration which the House has shown to me, and in return I shall, - to the best of my ability, endeavour to f a it h full y discharge the duties of high office which have been laid upon -- Mr Bruce (Flinders-Prime Minissurprising ter) [11;""47] - Mr Speaker, I desire - congratulate you upon the honourable and eminent office that you 'wil l now be 'called upon to f ill . The position Speaker requires in its occupant a - bination of attributes which is very selthat - dom found, but 'which, I think, in your case, is abundantly present. Your long experience as a member of this House and of .the Legislature of the 'State of Victoria, both as a private member and as a Minister, has qualified you in an unusual degree to fill the position that you now occupy. You will be the custodian of the rights and privileges of this House, and I think every honourable member is confident that you will maintain for them all the rights and privileges appertaining to Parliaments throughout the British . Empire. In the conduct of the business of the House, I can assure you that you will have the loyal support of the Government, who will ever try to aid you in the difficult task you are now undertaking. I am sure that all memibers of the House will bow to your ruling, and will support you in endeavouring to see that our deliberations are carried on in accordance with the ibest if I am traditions of Parliament. In that feeling honourable members are strengthened by the 'knoiwiledge of your experience, judgment, and impartiality. I not only .congratulate you, but I think I .should congratulate the House ou having you in the high and honourable position of Speaker.",17
13,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter ) [11/49] Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition I desire to congratulate you on your election to the highest position in the g if t of the House. I feel sure that you will worthily uphold the high standard set - by your predecessors in presiding over the I deliberations of this .Chamber. Honourable members of the Opposition will accord you every assistance'they possibly can in carrying out your very responsible and exacting - duties. I feel sure that you will act with strict impartiality, and, if you do that, you w i ll have the assistance of every member of this ""Chamber.",18
14,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [11.50] - I the have one reason in particular for rising me; to speak at this juncture. The world is full of surprises, but nothing was more - to myself than to hear that to - you, Mr Speaker, had been offered and had accepted your present position. ' It is not for me to examine any of the reaof sons that lie beneath the surface. I have comknown you for many years, 'and I know whatever task you - have undertfafcen you have discharged to the best of your abiliity. I . have no. doubt that you will occupy your present position in such a way that fairness: and justice will be meted out to all honourable "" members, irrespective of party. I rose not merely to congratulate you upon .your elevation to! the Speakership, but to congratulate you: also upon the fact: that the duties now devolving upon you will be less onerous than they were in the last Parliament, in which three separate parties participated in. the-debates. Carrying my mind back to the election of the Speaker in the last Parliament, I recall the fact that the occupant of the chair was congratulated by the head of the Government and by the Leader of the Opposition. Then there ap1 peared another gentleman, who let it be known that there was a new party in Parliament, a party pure and undefiled before God, that was going to set an example to other parties in this country. Leader of the third party also rose to congratulate the Speaker; and the reason why his party wished to add its congratulations was not so much because of its overflowing friendship towards the new Speaker, as 'because it desired to convey to Parliament, and to the country, the fact that a third clearlydefined party had' come into existence on the floor of this House. At the present moment, however, there is nobody to speak onbehalf of this party. If it ever was a separate entity, on the present occasion there is, unfortunately, no one to speak on its behalf, except the Leader of the Nationalist Government of this country. I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, that henceforth you will have, not three partiest to deal with, but only two. Reference-has been made to the fact that the precedents of this Chamber are somewhat different from those of the Mother of Parliaments. We are informed, by the press that in the House of Commons it is'the usual practice to have the Speaker elected unanimously and to permit the previous occupant of the position to retire. I congratulate you that in this respect the precedentsof the Old Country have been followed with exactitude in the present case. There have been aunanimous election and a voluntary retirement. There has, however, been one slight difference; in that the voluntary retirement has taken the form of self-extermination in preference to being exterminated publicly by the forty-seven different entities in the present composite Government. I congratulate you upon your election, and I hope that if I ever go astray in debate you will temper justice with mercy. I do not ask you to be impartial on all occasions, but to show some mercy to your old friends and associates. Whatever reasons prompted the Government in supporting your candidature for the Speakership,. I have not the slighest doubt that you will carry out your duties with special ability, and that your sense of fairness will not be less than the ability you have shown throughout your life. Mr .SPEAKER (Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt) - I desire very earnestly to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and the honourable member for The Bourke (Mr Anstey) for their kind congratulations. I shall endeavour to prove worthy of the respect of the House. None of us, happily, is. infallible; if it were so, life would scarcely be worth living. I assume that misunderstandings may arise between the Chair andhonorable members on the floor of the House which mutual forbearance alone can remove or prevent. "" Give and take "" is a very good motto for deliberative assemblies, and I'am sure it will not be absent from the ninth Australian Parliament. Many old familiar faces have vanished from this Chamber, and whilst we bow cheerfully to the sovereign decision of the electors, older members cannot help feeling a comrade's regret for those who fell in the recent battle. Many new members are with us, perhaps more than usual after a' general election, and to them. I may be allowed to say that, as representatives of the people, they will find aready welcome here. The presiding officers and the staff of the HOHSP will, I . am sure, do what they can to lighten the initial difficulties which seem to be inseparable fromparliamentary life and procedure. T am grateful to honourable members for their kind congratulations, and I can only say that I shall endeavour to deserve the merit and esteem that honourable members have been good enough to express.

I must first express thanks, Mr Speaker, for the cordiality of the reception which honourable members have given, me. I take it that the demonstration, may looked upon as the usual thing in the of a new member making his maiden effort. I feci that I am just upon the .brink of my first plunge, and I trust the water will not he too cold. One never can tell, of course; but I am comthe forted and. fortified in the knowledge' that all the older members of Parliament present have themselves taken their initial plunge'; they .have certainly borne tip under the ordeal, and are topolicies day, looking fairly well. tioned': that it might be cold water into.' which I amabout to plunge, gether, but' I am not' at all sure that it may be hot. That, however,, will be for future to discover. I regard the complidifficulty ment, which, has 'been paid to myself being called upon to move the resoupon lution, not as a personal matter, but aa an honour to the constituency which I represent. I feel that it is indeed tribute to t,he electorate, of Bendigo. :",25

57,Mr HURRY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Thos e interjections lead-nae naturallyto-say; a* few words concerning the formerhonorablemember for Bendigo, the. late Prime Minister (Mr . W. M . Hughes). Speaking as. a soldier, and for. thesoldiers of Australia^ I am the bound to say that we can never forget the Gowhat the right honourable gentleman and have done for us this from the inception of ""his term of office as Prime Minister to recent days. The p.m. right, lionorable gentleman's war record was.a splendid, onej and I emphasize that no man in Australia can forget it , although a good many' are in danger of : L doing so. I .congratulate the new Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) upon hawing atto His tainedto sohigh and responsible a post. be I have no doubt that he will most worthily retain it . I congratulate him, further, upon the success-of the task which he.has the Parrecently been called upon to perform-.",26
58,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,But did not the honor1 able gentleman promise to follow his. late,26
59,Mr KURRY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I understand that, in terjections are disorderly. If I am wrong I trust that I shall be pardoned, for. I have not yet had an opportunity to suffibe ciently acquaint myself with the forms case and procedure of the House. Honourable members on this side, at any rate> congratulate the Prime Minister upon havthat ing achieved what was widely considered to be. an impossible job. He has brought Farmers' and the Nationalist parties together, and'has formed a Government which appears to give promise of permanency. We ardently hope so, and have good reason' - to be thankful. The of the two - parties were so nearly I menalike that, when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) got tothey found that there was, in not deed, so little outstanding between their the viewsthat they were able, without much to for m a new Government. in In congratulating the Prime Minister his achievement, I take the opportunity to congratulate also my old school and his - namely, Melbourne a Grammar-upo n having been able to produce a second Prime Minister to The schools of this country, andourpublic schools in .particular, have set fine examples to our sons; they have ever maintained the highest ideals. We welcome the Country party to this new alliance with us. We believe that its outcome will .mean stable governmentsettled government, at all events, for some time to come"". We know that there have b<jen .many jealousies between the Country and Nationalist parties, but we believe that with mutual forbearance and generous .consideration any such difficulties as may possibly 'Crop up oan 'be overcome. I take it that I shall not be expected to make a very long speech, because, after afll, 'the speech of H is Excellency was not a very long one. Certainly it was not as Jong as I had expected, and I feel sure that T. shall correctly estimate the feelings of honourable members if I make my own remarks correspondingly brief. We hope to see quite a number of things brought about before the Government go out of office. We are looking forward to a very considerable f u r the r development of Australia. We trust that such expansion will occur during the regime of the new Government, and I am confident that if we all pull together some very good national legislation will have been put into effect. One of the main points which must eome up for consideration at the proposed conference between the representatives of fthe Commonwealth and Stages - is that of immigration. Considerable 'care will"" have - to he exercised., .however. Federation has very little land of its own - upon - which settlers'can the closely placed. ""Wie are' bound, therefore, to make r&he necessary arrangements with the 'States, which hold the land. The only way in which we, for our part, can render effective help will - be in - financing the States. When 'we regard the vastness of this aeon try and consider its powers of productivity, .and when we remember its proximity to certain teeming peoples of the ""East, we feel that our only chance of keeping Australia white-or , perhaps, of keeping it-at all-lie s in the direction of a 'great access of population. Motherland has an overflowing population, and .she is only too ready to send her.surplus people to us. Moreover, she has'millions of .money for investment in new lands; and there is - no - better place than this to which the Imperial Government could send new settlers and direct money for national investment. I trust that the people who come out to the Commonwealth will not be of that type which gravitates inevitably to the cities, but will 'be very 'ready and willin g oo settle on the land and become prosperous producers. There should' bo a wonderful future for Australia, if and when we secure a ten times greater population. We would then be producing enormously, and we would be required to considerably extend both our local ancl our overseas markets. All these factors must receive the closest consideration. I trust that the outcome of the proposed conference will be to provide successful working arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. 'The question of duplication of ""Stateand 'Commonwealth activities is another which 'has been exercising the public mind. I need not refer to all 'the duplications, but will mention as an example those in the realms of income and land tax, gathering. The taxpayer likes nothing less than the task of making up a multiplicity of returns; it is no wonder that the average man is ever ready to consign all the various tax-gathering officials to the utmost depths. The sooner this unreasonable and unecessary duplication is ended, the better for everybody. Our public debt is considerable, but when we regard our vast resources we should not be fearful. If we maintain our sinking f u n d , and if we can look The forward to Teasonahly good seasons, we ought, with decent financing, to - be able to rub out OVLV liabilities in a comparatively little while. The matter of our finances must be very closely examined by the Government, and consideration should .be given, not only to our financial relations with the States, but with the Motherland also. I have been pleased to read of the splendid arrangement which the Victorian Premier has just been able to make in London with respect to a loan for '-this State. His sucoess may be taken .as a happy augury for the Gommcrn-weiattli authority should it be required to borr.ow Our again 'before long - Mr .Lawson's success indicates that there is uuboonnded confidence in Great Britain regarding ;the fluture - of Australia,. I have he en onuch struck during the past few days by ithe character of .several addresses which the Prime Minister has given in various parts of the Commonwealth. The right honourable gentleman has pleaded for unity and for a national outlook. We should do all that we canto foster those ideals to the utmost. Honourable members will remember that when our soldiers reached the other side of the world they made a great reputation for Australia. In speaking of soldiers, I refer not merely to captains, majors, or even generals, of whom, there are a few in this Parliament, but to the ordinary privates, who enlisted to the number of about 300,000, of whom 60,000, unfortunately, left their bones the other side of the world. What was the spirit that animated those men 1 Was it not the spirit of Australia-the spirit which our Prime Minister wishes the people of Australia to display at the present time ? These men did not go abroad merely because they wanted to fight, but because they wanted Australia to come out on top. They possessed the national spirit of Australia, and it was that alone which enabled them to overcome the great difficulties which they had to face. When we think cf the awful weather they had to endure, and the heavy packs, rifles, and picks which they had to carry, we must admit that nothing short cf an inspiration like that could have been the foundation of their endurance. If we could only translate that spirit into our present-day activities in Australia, we could not go f ar wrong. If we could only get together a little more, get r i d of the imaginary barriers that now separate us, sink our differences, and work for the benefit, not of a particular section of the people, but of the whole of Australia, we would not need to have any fear but that we would be able to lift this splendid country of ours into the very front rank of the nations.",26
60,Mr R GREEN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Richmond) [5.17] It is indeed with an enormous amount of pleasure that I rise to second the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. Although I am full y cognisant of my own shortcomings as a speaker on ordinary occasions, the task of making my first speech in this House is particularly difficult. The only fact which encouraged me in accepting the honour that was offered to me was that I knew I could rely upon the forbearance and tolerationof the older members towards one who has just come among them. Although possibly after a few moments they may be somewhat bored; for they then will be kept busy forming their estimate of the calibre of new-comers. I can give them the cheering news that I shall be very brief. That, I have been given to understand, is essential. The first thing that strikes me particularly, as an Australian of the fourth generation, is the very important fact that every member of the Cabinet is Australian-born. Although I am aware that much has been done for Australia in the past by our forbears, it is gratifying to on know that we have now got beyond the swaddling-clothes stage. We have men in this country who were born, reared, and educated in it , and have absorbed into, their very bones the spirit of Australia. These are the men who will carry on. In saying that, I make no reflection on any persons who have come to this country and were not born here, but it is of great in terest to know, and it is better for Australia, that her own sons should govern this country. Particularly noteworthy.' also, is the fact that the two leaders of the Ministry are both returned soldiers. That fact should give relurned soldiers' generally an expectation of things to come. These two leaders have shown their willingness to serve their country overseas, and to give, if Ihe necessity should arise, their very lives for it . Now they have returned to Australia, and are in the legislative halls, where they will give of their best to their country in another way, by bringing their great mental capabilities, which no one can deny they possess, to bear upon the great problems confronting us at the present time, when the war has not ceased to worry us. Although there may be divergencies of opinion between honourable members sitting on the Government side of the House-difference s on questions of detail, and sometimes on larger and more important matters - s t ill they are only differences of viewpoint. Take, for instance, Parliament House. If one looked at it from Springstreet one would get an entirely different view-point from that which would be obtained if one looked at it from the back. The central fact would remain, however, that it would still be Parliament House, and the difference would merely be a difference of view-point and of attitude, of. rnind. I think that every honourable member of the House, wherever he sits, is agreed upon the big central fact that Parliament must govern and legislate for the benefit of this country as a whole and for the prosperity of its citizens, whether they be old or young, rich or poor, city dwellers or men and women out-backthose sturdy pioneers who are battling still to make this country what it should be the finest on God's earth. We can do that for this Australia of ours, and it should be done. I may mention one way in which we can help the people out-back. The Postmaster General's Department can give, and I am sure will give, increased facilities for phonic and telegraphic communication. .That Department can also assist .the settler out-back in many other ways. A question that must be taken up is decentralization. It has been a. phrase, a "" plank "" in the pla'tforms of political parties for many years past. I am sure the time will come when decentralization will no longer be a party joss or merely an abstract phrase, but will become something definite and tangible. Instead of decentralization being a mere formal expression of policy, we want it to be an actuality. During the life of this Parliament, honourable members will have an opportunity of discussing the subdivision of Australia, and deciding upon decentralization in whatever way they think fit. Incidentally, there will be the question of the creation of now States. Decentralization must he made an accomplished fact, and no longer allowed to remain just a phrase in the platforms of the various political parties. Another way in which those out-back can be helped is in the stabilization of our various primary industries, whether they exist for the production of butter, sugar, wheat, or anything else - In the near future, no doubt, sugar will be discussed in this House. This great industry cannot be allowed to languish. It means much to Australia, and it must be helped, along with the fruit and other industries that depend upon it, ahd, at the same time, the interests of the consumers must not be lost sight of. An endeavour should be made to give a fair deal to all, and I am sure that this House, in its collective wisdom, will find a means of doing so. [2] I also wish to refer to a small incident that occurred this morning. It may have been only a lapsus linguae on the part of you, Mr Speaker, when you referred to "" two parties "" in this House. There are three parties iii this House, and two of them have seen fit, in their wisdom, to enter into a partnership. Each party, however, is separate and distinct. Something had to be done to enable the government of the country to.be carried on, and the two parties entered into a partnership for that purpose, just as two men might enter into a partnership for carrying on any business. Each party, just as each man in a partnership business, is separate tele- and distinct from the other. The Country party and the Nationalist party are working together for the ultimate benefit of Australia, irrespective of what may be said to the contrary. I could not allow an opportunity to pass without stressing the fact that the Country party, although its members have gone into the composite Ministry with the best of intentions, in the hope of being able to do something in collaboration with our friends to carry on the government of the country, is still a free and distinct entity. As our Leader has said, we can retire, if necessary, with our lines of communication intact. I have the honour to represent a constituency that has often been called "" the garden of Australia."" I am sure it will come as a very great surprise to honourable members to know that the bulk of that constituency- I refer to the more populous areas of it-is absolutely unconnected in any way by rail with the rest of Australia.",28
61,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,That is a State matter.,29
62,Mr R GREEN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Exactly; but I mention it, as I wish this House to understand why I have stressed the need for consideration being shown, to the people in rural areas. Their needs must be looked after. They have been too long neglected. They have been put of f , and have been foolish enough time after time to accept promises made by time-serving politicians who spoke withtheir tongues in their cheeks. Those are the reasons why I bring forward these particular matters. Whatever its origin, anything for the benefit of Australia, anything that will do good to the men and women out-back, will receive mj hearty support. ""When my time of usefulness in this Chamber is finished, I hope T shall be able to go out and say,-as the late Mr Justice Pring said in Sydney, "" I hav.e done my duty; no man could do.more; no man should do less."" 0 Debate (on motion - by Mr Charlton) adjourned. CHAIRMAN OF .COMMITTEES.  is my pleasure and privilege to move That the honourable member for Herbert, the Hon. Frederick William Bamford, appointed Chairman of Committees of this House. Elected to the first Parliament of Commonwealth, the honourable member, still in the full - possession of physical and mental faculties, is, by reason of age and continuous memberber ship, the ""father of the House."" He has held high office under the Crown, and been connected with many parliamentary activities. For a decade past he has Temporary - Chairman of Committees, Denison and for a 'time was Acting Speaker. I 'believe it will be acknowledged that ing that time he carried out his duties to the House without hias and in a manner satisfactory in every way to the members of the various Parliaments.

64,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Batman) [5.34] - I move That the honourable jnembor for Denison, the Hon. David John O'Keefe, be appointed Chairman of Committees of this House. The honourable member, in*, the course of a long and honourable political career in another place, has gained the advantage of a .rich experience in the discharge of the duties of Chairman of Committees, and I think .that in every respect, both t personal and political, his appointment to a similar position in this House would be a success. The carrying of my motion be .would have the further effect of convincing a sceptical public that there is no suggestion-of ""partisanship or party in the the appointment of the men who are to preside over the deliberations - of this his House and its Committees. I have no personal objection to the honourable memfor Herbert, but I have strong political objections to him,, as he knows, and has that objection is shared by many of my fellow members. But on the broad been ground that the honourable member for is the better fitted by experience and capacity to fill the position of Chairdurman of Committees, I submit my motion MT. MAHONY (Dalley) [5.36] - I second the nomination of the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe). I have no desire to reflect upon the candidature of the honourable member for Herbert, but I believe that the honourable member for Denison has proved himself apbetter qualified to hold the position of Chairman of Committees. He has been in public life for very many years, and has held some high and responsible positions. His actions have proved him to be a fair-minded man who may be to relied upon - to carry out the duties of - Chairman in a proper manner. "" Mr .SPEAKER (Rt - Hon. . W. A .

It is a great honour for any man to be appointed to preside over the deliberations of this National Assembly, and I regard my appointment as a compliment, not only to' myself, but . also to_ my electorate, and incidentally to the State of Queensland. I am following in office a man who had long experience in the chair, and I hope that my own experience in a temporary capacity will be useful to me.

I again thank the House for the honour which it has done me.",31
68,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I rise to make a personal explanation. The honourable member fior Herbert (Mr Bamford) in his concludingr remarks cast a grave reflection upon me.

COMMONWEALTH BANK : BOARD CONTROL - QUEENSLANP INDUSTRY : SUGAR AGREEMENT . Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",32
72,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Hunter) [5.46] - I have received from the secretary of a public meeting which was held at Parkstreet, Sydney, on ithe evening of the 18th instant, the following resolution, a copy - of which has been forwarded to the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and the leaders of all political parties in this House. The speakersat the meeting were Messrs. J. A. Wright and J. M . Scott, and the motion, which was carried without opposition, on a show of hands, reads as follows:This meeting of citizens emphatically objects to the proposal of the Federal Government to create a Board of Control for our Commonwealth Bank, and looks at the suggestion as disloyal to Australia and as a treacherous attempt engineered by overseas diplomacy to hamper the Governor of our Bank in his great, work of financing Australia, into a powerful nation. We are well aware that the cause of Australia's small population is solely due to the deliberate restrictive finance practised by the private banking companies here, under London's instructions, and the abroad by these banks of our citizens' money .placed with thorn, in order to finance London; .and we suggest to Dr Earle Page and his colleagues that a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into the overseas control of the banking companies here: and we also suggest that the whole of the private banking be brought under the domination of our great Commonwealth Bank, and that these institutions 'be compelled to finance our secondary industries. We suggest that a Board of Control., be created in each country centre to dominate the private banks to force the financing of our country towns and secondary in dustries in the country to the extent of the bank deposits in each centre (banks nowadays I finance our country less than 25 por cent, of the deposits). The increased country finance will cause a flow of desirable people from abroad to participate in our Australian prosperity and our empty spaces will automatically increase in population. We claim that the key to Australian development and local patriotism is in the banking business. An analysis of the financial juggle called "" Bor"" rowing in London"" will prove that Australia received neither credit, goods, nor money in return for our bonds placed in London,"" and that the so-called public debt due to London is really a banking debt due from London to Australia, and that our country has 'been financing the British Isles and about one-third of the world since 1851",32
73,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Capricornia) [5.50] Before the House adjourns I wish, as a OF representative of one of the sugar-growing SUGAR districts of Queensland, to record my emphatic protest against the indifference shown by the present, as well as the late, Administration towards the great sugar industry of that State. During the recent Federal election campaign all kinds of promises were made by Nationalist candidates in the northern State, and some were to the effect that if .they were returned there would be a renewal of the existing sugar agreement. We find, however, that the present, composite Ministry, which embraces the whole of the anti-Labour forces in this Parliament, is hurrying into recess without doing anything to bring about a renewal of .the agreement. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford), and the honourable member for Wide Bay, when seeking re-election, definitely promised the, sugar-growers of Queensland that it would be renewed.. The' only indication we have had as to the intentions of the Government regarding .the sugar industry is to be found in this morning's issue of 'the Melbourne newspapers, in which we have the statement thatshipment Mr Bruce informed members that it had been decided to refer the question of the import duty on sugar to a special tribunal that would recommend the fixing of a price that) would be fair to all parties concerned. We have heard before of promises of that kind. This statement on the part of the Prime Minister means nothing. shelving the question. The present sugar agreement will expire on 30th June'next, and the sugar-growers of Queensland have a right to expect from the Government a definite pronouncement on the subject. They are entitled to expect that the pledges that were given to them during the recent campaign will be honoured. I do not intend in this motion for the adjournment of the House to dwell at length on this matter. I shall deal with it more full y at a later, date, but I wish at this, the first opportunity, to enter my protest against the inaction of the Government. In order to show that I am not indulging in mere general statements, I shall quote what the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) said when he was wooing the electors of Wide Bay, amongst whom there are many sugar growers, and appealing to them for their votes. The honourable member, speaking at Nambour,- said, as reported in the Brisbane Daily Mail of 29th November lastTf the Nationalist GovciMimnnt is returned to power"" further sugar proposals will lie submitted, and I feel - confident that the existing sugar agreement will be renewed. In view of this statement, the sugar growers in the honourable member's electorate naturally expectthat the Government will renew the present sugar agreement. The honourable member for Wide Bay was not alone in giving that definite promise. The honourable member for Herbert, I am told, telegraphed to scores of centres in his electorate telling the people that if he wore elected there would be a renewal of the present sugar agreement, and that he would at once move to that effect.",32
74,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,The honourable member is in error.,33
75,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I have not come unprepared to substantiate my statement - concerning the honourable member. shall give the House my authority f o j it , and there are in the gallery at the present moment representatives of the United Cane-growers Association who will bear me out.",33
76,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,I said that if thn Nationalist party were returned there would be a renewal of the agreement.,33
77,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"I - shall quote from a letter addressed to the editor of the Brisbane Daily Telegraph by Mr W . B . Biggs, of Proserpine^ on 19th January It is last, the statements that were made by the honourable member. The letter .is as follows: NATIONALISTS AND SUGAR. To the Editor- Sir,-In view of the assertion that it was doubtful if Queensland favoured a continuance of the sugar agreement, and taking into consideration the result of the Queensland elections, I wish to make it quite clear that the Nationalists' candidates of Queensland all pledged themselves to a contimvuu'c of the agreement,' which was in direct opposition to the policy of the Nationalist party, as given by MrHughes. The following were put to Mr Bamford at his election meeting at Proserpine by me:Q. Are you in favour pf the continuance of the sugar agreementF- Mr Bamford Yes, for a further term of five years. Q. In the event of your party, as a party, refusing to voto for same, will you cross the floor and vote against them?Mr Bamford - Yes , I will; and, further, when I am returned I will pledge myself to make it my business, at the first opportunity, to bring the extension of the agreement before the House, as it will give me the opportunity to put the acid on the Country and Labour parties, and prove their sincerity to the sugar growers. I appeal to the House to say whether the honourable member has honoured that definite promise which he made to the canegrowers of the Proserpine district when he was appealing for their votes. The letter continuesMr Bamford expressed himself us being dubious about the latter about the sincerity of the Country party and the Labour party in regard to the renewal of the sugar agreementAs one in the industry, I trust' you will publish the above, so as to make the position clear - Yours , &c, W. B. Bioos. Proserpine, 19th January. That letter puts the position clearly from one in the industry, and shows that, the people of Queensland during the recent I Federal campaign were misled by ""Nationalist candidates, some of whom won the election by telling the people that if they were returned there would be a renewal of the present sugar agreement. We should look at this very importantquestion of sugar from, an Australian, and not from a parochial, stand-point. It is a great national question, and .with it is interwoven that of the White Australia policy, which is of vast concern to the whole continent. We havei n Ausshall tralia, approximately J., 149,000 square miles of territory within the tropics, we must foster the great sugar-growing industry, which is the only one that will enable us to settle the people there. The present Government has not clone the fair thing by the sugar-growers of Queensland, but I appeal even at this late hour to the Prime Minister to give the fullest consideration to requests for a renewal of the present agreement - which will be made to him in the course of the next few days. The sugar industry of Queensland is worth £9.500.000 to the people - It gives ployment to 22.000 persons, and a sum £6.000.00 0 per annum is paid in wages connection with it - Some 4,000 men from be renewed. Victoria and other States go to Queensment, land every year and gain there.a living in the industry, and keep their .wives and familiesin New South Walesand Victoria. Furthermore,, while hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of - machinery Due from the southern States are sold throughout the sugar districts of Queensland J the southern foundries benefit. In view of these facts it cannot be said that the industry helps only theSbate of Queenspersonal - explanation. land. It helps thewholeof AustraliaI n the northern part of the continent, where the mining and cattle industries are languishing, Ave should foster the great sugar industry. It is the duty of the sent Government, even at this late hour, to endeavour to live up to the promises made by honourable members opposite when they were seeking, by,. I fear, false pretences, to secure the votes of the people of Queensland. Later-on I shall discuss the sugar industry in detail. At this juncture I do not intend to detain the House. I hope, in the course of my speeches in this be able to place before-honourable members opposite sufficient facts to convince them-, as well as the people of the southern parts of Australia, that the sugar-growers Queensland have a jusb claim. people of Australia had been called upon during the period 1915-1921 to pav world's parity for their sugar it would have cost them £12,000,000 more than they actually had to pay. ",33
78,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"It is not rubbish. I do not wish to delay the House, but, in view of the honourable member's interjection, quote figures I have obtained from, a well-authenticated source as to the price and of sugar in Australia., and the world's parity during the period to which I have referred.
