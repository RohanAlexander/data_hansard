NA Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",17
1,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," The safety of our community and the security of our nation must always be paramount considerations for every member of this parliament. We in Labor have proved, both in government and in opposition, that we always place national security ahead of partisan politics. The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 is the 16th substantive national security bill introduced over the last five years. I will address the specific reasons for Labor's support of this assistance and access bill shortly, and I will also explain a number of our concerns and the solutions we have insisted on to address those concerns. But, before I turn to those specific matters, I will first say a little about the general approach that I and the Labor opposition have been taking to national security matters. First, we start from the premise that our security agencies and our law enforcement bodies, to the extent that they are involved in national security matters, must be given the powers and resources they need to keep our community safe and our nation secure. Second, we believe that national security laws that encroach on the rights and freedoms of Australians must always be necessary and proportionate to the threats being faced. Third, Labor holds that, with the granting of new powers, we must also establish new oversight and transparency mechanisms designed to ensure these powers are used for the purpose for which they are granted and in a manner that ensures ongoing accountability for their exercise. And the fourth basic principle guiding our approach is that national security laws conferring extraordinary new powers should treat those powers as extraordinary rather than as the new normal. These principles are often challenging to apply, but we put a great deal of time and energy into rigorously analysing every national security bill that is presented against these principles. We do this because we understand that in conferring new powers to protect our nation's security it's vital that we do not compromise the very freedoms and way of life that we're seeking to protect. This means that in keeping Australians safe we also seek to uphold the rights and freedoms that we as a democratic society hold dear and that generations of Australians have fought to protect. No deranged or hate-filled terrorists can take those freedoms and rights from us. Only an Australian government that has given into fear-to the terror that is by definition the primary weapon of the terrorist-has the power to do that. We must also always be aware that, while the laws we pass can be part of the solution to national security threats, if they are improperly designed those laws can become part of the problem, because our agencies can do their critical work only if they have a good relationship-a relationship of trustwith the community they are protecting. This has been shown time and time again with terrorism offences in particular when the vital information to stop terrorist events comes to our agencies from within the community. David Kilcullen is one of Australia's most accomplished counterterrorism experts. I've quoted him before, but I think the warning he provides is worth repeating today. Mr Kilcullen was a senior officer in the Australian defence forces. He went on to advise on counterterrorism at the most senior levels of the United Kingdom and United States governments and military, working as the chief strategist in the office of the coordinator of counterterrorism at the US state department as well as special adviser to US General David Petraeus in Iraq. Writing about the challenge of confronting terrorism in 2015, Mr Kilcullen warned about the impossibility of making a democratic society entirely safe through the imposition of ever-increasing counterterrorism laws. He wrote: … a truly effective domestic defensive strategy would turn (indeed, has already gone a long way to transforming) our societies into police states.  A purely defensive stance, if it is to prevent terrorist attacks from within and without, would have to include some or all of the following: perimeter defences on all major public (and many private) buildings, restrictions on access to public spaces, intrusive powers of search, arrest and seizure, larger and more heavily armed police forces, with more permissive rules for use of lethal force, intensive investigations of individuals' thoughts, words and actions, citizen surveillance … Mr Kilcullen's list goes on at some length, concluding with: … the need for a raft of limitations to freedom of expression and assembly. It would also, of course, impose limitations on international trade and require increased state spending-essentially a 'terrorism tax'. Mr Kilcullen then warns: … accepting these impositions as permanent, and developing them to the level at which they could actually-in their own right, as the centrepiece of a counterterrorism strategy-protect against the atomised, self-radicalised terrorist threat of tomorrow, would amount to destroying society in order to save it. While the new powers that will be conferred by this bill will be used for both counterterrorism and police work, I believe that the warning Mr Kilcullen sounds remains entirely relevant. I turn now to the access bill itself. The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 was introduced into the parliament on 20 September 2018. Without specifying a reporting date and without any suggestion that it was urgent for the inquiry to be concluded by the end of the year, the Attorney General referred the access bill to the committee on the same day. Although the government claimed that it had consulted widely on the access bill before its introduction into the parliament, the public consultation was very short, especially for such a lengthy and complicated bill, running as it does to some 175 pages. An exposure draft of the bill was published on 14 August and submissions closed on 10 September 2018. Disappointingly, it became apparent over the course of the inquiry conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that many affected organisations were hardly consulted at all before 14 August, including, extraordinarily, the government's own Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In fact, the inspector-general and the Ombudsman told the committee that they found out about the exposure draft of this bill from media reports. A number of Australian companies also indicated to the committee that either they were not consulted by the Morrison government or, alternatively, if they had been consulted, when they had made submissions they were essentially ignored. The committee heard compelling evidence that in the form the government introduced this bill to the parliament it could well do more harm than good. Specifically, as presented to this House, the bill could, among other things, pose a significant risk to Australia's national security, jeopardise security cooperation with the United States and create unnecessary risks to Australian businesses and, in particular, local technology exporters. I will briefly expand now on each of those three key risks. First, there's the risk to national security. Encryption plays an essential role in protecting Australia's digital infrastructure. It protects everything from an individual's iPhone to the electricity and telecommunications grids and banking and mass transit systems. As Cisco put it in one of the committee's public hearings: … it is hard to overstate the importance of strong encryption, not only to the delivery of e-commerce and message functions but also to the protection of critical systems. These systems include computer controlled systems that deliver food, water, transportation services, health, telecommunications and government services. Key to the concerns about the risk that the access bill could pose to national security is the uncertainty over whether the use of the new powers in the bill could lead to the creation of a backdoor-a weakness that may be applied to just one device, for example, but which could also weaken the security of other devices that use the same system. In the face of overwhelming evidence from many submitters to the committee's inquiry, the government has remained adamant that the access bill could not lead to the creation of backdoors. The government says that this is because there is a provision in the bill that prevents providers from being forced to implement any kind of systemic weakness into a form of electronic protection. But that term is not defined in the access bill, and this has led to confusion about what it even means. Without an appropriate definition of 'systemic weakness' and improved safeguards, a range of stakeholders have said that there is a real risk that the new powers in the access bill could make Australians less safe-and even threaten national security-by weakening the encryption that protects critical infrastructure. Such weaknesses could be exploited by malicious actors, such as terrorists, serious criminals and state-sponsored hackers. This could mean malicious actors disabling telecommunications networks or the national electricity grid. It could mean hackers stealing money from the bank accounts of innocent Australians or compromising the confidentiality of investigations being conducted by Australian law enforcement agencies. The Director-General of Security has assured the intelligence committee and the Australian people that his agency has no intention of using the new powers in the access bill to require a provider to do anything that could jeopardise the security of innocent Australians.  The issue of inserting an appropriate definition of 'systemic weakness' into the legislation has been a major issue of disagreement between Labor and the government that we are continuing to work to resolve, even now. The concern that the access bill could, in fact, pose a risk to Australia's national security was echoed by representatives of Senetas Corporation during a public hearing on 30 November 2018. Senetas is a leading provider of encryption technology, and, as its chairman explained to the committee, it is responsible for securing the systems of Australian law enforcement agencies; royal commissions, including the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse; a number of Australian banks; and our defence forces. The chairman of Senetas told the committee that, in its current form, the access bill: … compromises the security of citizens, businesses and governments because there will be weaker cybersecurity practices. It will be easier for cybercriminals, terrorists, to target systems and be able to break into those systems … The fact that the government, and the Liberal members of the committee, were a week ago proposing to just ignore the evidence of Senetas-the entity responsible for protecting many of Australia's most critical systems from malicious hackers-was of great concern to Labor. Fortunately, after the government declared last week that they would cease working with Labor on a joint report in the intelligence committee addressing these problems, on Monday the government backed down from this reckless course and returned to the negotiating table. Since then, we've been able to agree on a number of significant amendments to this bill to address the most significant concerns that have been raised. I will turn to the risk to security cooperation with the United States. Another key concern raised by a number of submitters in the public hearings on this bill-and, apparently, not even thought of by the government as they prepared and then tabled this bill-was whether it could prejudice Australia's future security cooperation with the United States. A number of submitters drew the committee's attention to the potential problems the access bill could cause for compliance with the US Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, the CLOUD Act, which was enacted in March of this year. Under the US CLOUD Act, it's possible for Australia to enter into a bilateral agreement with the United States to allow Australian agencies to request the data of non-US persons-like WhatsApp messages sent by or to a terrorist subject-from Australian technology companies directly. This would enable Australian agencies to bypass the existing requirement of making such requests via the US Department of Justice, which can take many months to process. Just to be clear: at the moment, we have mutual legal assistance treaty arrangements with the United States where our agencies, in a cumbersome system that's been in place for many years, can make a request for telecommunications data via those mutual legal assistance treaty processes, but it can take months, and sometimes more than a year, for the data that has been requested to be produced. That's why the US CLOUD Act, passed by the congress in March of this year, offers a tremendous prospect of much, much quicker access for Australian police forces, and for Australian intelligence agencies, to simply make the request, using the CLOUD Act processes, that would go directly to a telecommunications service provider that is based in the United States. And, provided-and this is the basis of the CLOUD Act processes-that the request did not relate to a US citizen and related to foreign-from the point of view of the United States-law enforcement processes, the request will be able to dealt with in a matter of days, rather than the many months that presently afflict our agencies in terms of this cooperation with the United States. But the significance of this is that, in order to enter into an agreement with United States under the CLOUD Act, the US Attorney-General must certify, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, that the foreign government affords: … robust substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties … If such a certificate is issued, congress is able to object to any such certification within 90 days. The vast majority of submitters argued that the access bill in its current form-that is, in the form in which it was presented, unthinkingly apparently, by the government to this parliament-does not afford robust, substantive and procedural protections. As such, Labor members of the intelligence committee were very concerned that unless it is significantly amended the access bill could imperil Australia's chances of entering into a CLOUD Act agreement with the United States. Moreover, even if Australia were already party to a bilateral agreement with the United States under the CLOUD Act, Stanford University cybersecurity and cryptography fellow Riana Pfefferkorn said to the intelligence committee: Absent some clearer authority and better judicial oversight of technical capability notices and technical assistance notices, I'm not sure that such a notice would be eligible to be served at all through any agreement under the Cloud Act on US providers directly. This evidence, which until this week appears simply to have been ignored by the government, was presented to the committee during a public hearing on 16 November 2018, just before the Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime Minister were calling on the committee to accelerate its inquiry. It's important that Australia be able to take advantage of this vital new mechanism provided by the United States. In order to put the Australian government in the best position to do so, the committee requires further  evidence from experts on the CLOUD Act. While the committee has addressed in its recommendations some of the matters that could undermine Australia's capacity to cooperate with the United States under the CLOUD Act, further work on this critical matter is one of the reasons for Labor's insistence that the committee should continue its inquiry into this bill. It is absolutely vital that this bill, which will be the domestic legislation of Australia from the point of view of the United States authorities, conforms to what the United States regards as robust, substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties, and that in turn will need to take account of what is known as Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in the United States, a key feature of which is judicial warrants. What the United States and the United States authorities are always looking for in domestic legislation is judicial oversight and judicial warrants authorising compulsive processes. At present, this bill does not contain that form of judicial oversight or judicial warrants. I turn to the risk to Australian business. Numerous submitters to the intelligence committee said the access bill in its current form could force Australian technology businesses to move offshore. This could threaten over $3 billion in Australian exports and cost thousands of Australian jobs. Remarkably, it has become painfully clear over the course of the committee's inquiry that the government barely considered these issues before the Minister for Home Affairs introduced the access bill into the parliament on 20 September. By way of example, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association, the Australian Information Industry Association and the Communications Alliance have told the committee: The proposed legislation, through its mere existence, will make Australian exports of IT and communications products and services, or even every Australian website, subject to the same concerns by overseas governments and organisations that recently moved the Australian government to ban certain vendors from supplying hardware for Australia's future 5G networks. Therefore, the draft bill poses a real risk for the IT communications export industry, which Austrade values at AU$3.2 billion for 2016-17 and this figure does not include the value of other exports enabled by Australian websites, IT and communications products. Collectively, those organisations who gave that evidence to the intelligence committee represent the interests of tens of thousands of Australian businesses, including small and medium sized companies. The committee also received direct submissions from small and medium sized Australian companies who were concerned that the access bill in its current form would make them less competitive in the global technology market, and the committee has heard from at least two Australian companies that may be forced to move their operations offshore if the government gets its way. Other companies have said that it could lead to job losses. Senetas, for example, has told the committee that it may no longer be able to manufacture in Australia if the access bill were to pass in its current form and that this could result in the loss of 200 jobs. It's not just established businesses that may be affected. The Victorian government's start-up agency, LaunchVic, told the intelligence committee that the access bill could hamper the ability of local start-ups to develop their products in Australia, attract customers and investment and create jobs. In response to questions by members of the intelligence committee, the Department of Home Affairs confirmed that no report was commissioned on the impact the access bill could have on local industry and there had been no direct engagement with the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science during development of the access bill. Once again we have fought to improve the bill to deal with the most significant of the many concerns raised in this regard. Labor has been consulting with industry and civil society stakeholders both through the committee's process and outside. We have negotiated with the government to give effect to their core concerns. While there are significant outstanding issues, the compromise that Labor has reached with the government will deliver security and enforcement agencies the powers they say they need over the Christmas period and will ensure adequate oversight and safeguards to prevent unintended consequences while enabling continuing scrutiny of the bill into 2019. Labor members of the committee were prepared to undertake the course of action that they have taken in reaching agreement on the consensus report that was tabled in the parliament yesterday only because of the government's undertaking that the committee will continue its inquiry into the bill into 2019 and that a separate statutory review will be undertaken by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor within 18 months of the legislation coming into effect. These separate processes provide an opportunity to resolve our ongoing concerns about the bill with the assistance of industry experts and civil liberties groups while also upholding our responsibility to keep Australians safe. Labor members of the intelligence committee have sought and obtained recommendations in the PJCIS report. If these recommendations are translated into amendments brought to this House or the Senate by the government then those amendments will address many of the core concerns raised by Labor and stakeholders. It is to be noted that the committee will undertake further inquiry immediately after any legislation is passed and that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor will do so shortly thereafter.  'Systemic weakness' related concerns are to be addressed by amendments that define and clarify the term 'systemic weakness' and also amendments that clarify that technical capability notices cannot be used to create a systemic weakness. Other concerns which will need to be addressed through amendments include the ability for a provider to disclose details of a technical capability notice except to the extent that doing so would compromise an investigation. That point is one of particular significance to industry and to all users of the internet, which is an open system but would cease to be an open system if particular fixes were required to be kept secret. A further point that will need to be attended to in the amendments is authorisation of a technical capability notice requiring the approval of both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Communications. Further matters to be dealt with in the amendments include that a designated communications provider which has concerns about a technical capability notice will be able to request a binding assessment of whether or not it would indeed create a systemic weakness, whether the requirements are reasonable and proportionate, whether compliance is practically and technically feasible and whether the notice is the least intrusive measure that would still achieve the objective. Two persons, a technical expert and a non-serving judge, would be jointly appointed to conduct the assessment, and their report would have to be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security in the case of ASIO and to the Commonwealth Ombudsman in the case of the Australian Federal Police. This essentially means that any request to a provider that might create a systemic weakness would be subject to a merit review style process. The inadequacy of the oversight and safeguards arrangements provided in the bill produced to this parliament by the government will also be addressed by amendments that will include strengthening the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security's oversight of the powers. This would include explicit notification and reporting requirements when issuing varying, extending or revoking a notice or request, and limits on the exercise of the powers, including extending the prohibition on systemic weakness to voluntary notices, ensuring that decisionmakers consider necessity and intrusion on innocent third parties when they issue a notice. There will also be provision for defences for IGIS officials and clear information-sharing provisions. The amendments will include, also in this oversight context, establishing clear authority for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to inspect and gather information on the exercise of these powers by the Australian Federal Police, ACIC, and state and territory interception agencies. The amendments in relation to the Commonwealth Ombudsman will include notification requirements and information-sharing provisions which would complement the inspection activities of state and territory oversight bodies. The Australian Federal Police will also be required to approve any stateand territory-initiated technical assistance notices, and must apply the same criteria and go through the same decision-making processes as would apply if the Australian Federal Police were the original issuing authorities. As honourable members would have gathered by now, this is a large piece of legislation of considerable complexity. In response to the government's demand that consideration of it through the intelligence committee be accelerated, the Labor members of that committee-and the Labor Party as a whole in this place-have assisted in that process. The government produced draft amendments to Labor early this morning. It's anticipated that those amendments will be moved in the Senate. On that basis, I commend the bill to this House for passage in this House-I say again on the basis that the amendments encompassing the recommendations of the intelligence committee will be moved in the Senate. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (10:02): I'd firstly like to acknowledge the particularly fine contribution of the shadow Attorney-General to this process. This speech lays down a great foundation for the debate that will proceed now. Obviously, I also want to pay tribute to the shadow Attorney-General and his staff, who've effectively done the work of the department in providing the wherewithal by which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has addressed and handled all of the legislation that has been brought before it. With that foundation having been laid by the shadow Attorney-General, I would like to just take a step back and perhaps contextualise some of this debate we're going to have on this particular legislation. Before people speak and, perhaps, comment by Twitter or by email to MPs on this bill, I would urge them to read the shadow Attorney-General's speech to make sure they are properly informed about what it is that will be in the public space and discussed in relation to this legislation. There is no question that the core of this legislation is a threat that has been growing over the years to this nation and to the world in general. We have faced a unique period of increased threat but also of exponential growth in technology that provides challenges to our agencies-there is no question about that. The work of the committee has been unprecedented over these last few years in dealing with the volume of legislation and measures that seek to address those threats. It has highlighted issues of the resourcing of the committee and how the committee operates.  Firstly, I pay tribute to the fact that this committee works in an exceptionally bipartisan way. It is a serious committee; I would argue that it's probably the most important committee of this House. Both sides usually take care in the selection of members of that committee. We have had great collaboration within that committee, with the members that have been serving on it, through this period. I particularly pay tribute to the chair, with whom we've all had the great experience of working through this period of dealing, effectively, with groundbreaking legislation, internationally, which traverses whole new legal and technical concepts. The chair and the committee have worked through a modus operandi which has been very effective. It does take time, and it needs to take time, to work through those issues. The whole point of this parliament and the whole point of a committee like this is to have contestability of policy. We are able to hold public hearings and private hearings to tease out all of the dimensions of what is at stake. Having been on the other side of this desk, I have worked through those processes myself. Particularly in the lead-up to the 2000 Olympics, the reforms to part IIIAAA of the Defence Act happened in this space. They were very complicated and difficult, and traversed issues and concerns about civil liberties and the rest. That coordination process that I was involved in then took three years. Coordination across departments and consultation with stakeholders are absolutely essential in these processes. In response to the nature of heightened threats, we have seen, obviously, truncated processes in the legislation, which we have dealt with, and that presents great difficulty in drafting this legislation properly and in consultation, so it has really fallen to the committee, the secretariat and the shadow Attorney-General to repair quite a lot of legislation that has come to us in quite a rough state. It just emphasises the need to give the committee due regard, due process and due time to work through those issues. In this context, we have accepted the advice that we have had from the agencies, and I want to thank them for their work in informing the committee. I'm particularly grateful for the in-depth technical assistance that was provided to us by ASIO and the briefings that we received over in ASIO's headquarters. There is no question that the issue of encryption is a really serious one for our agencies. We're in a new world now where things and capabilities that used to be the preserve of states are now quite ubiquitous. You've got kids in bedrooms who are able to develop encryption apps following instructions on the internet. There are specific aspects of that about which, obviously, we are constrained. We are not able to go into them in detail in the public space because of the nature of these issues and the briefings that we've received, but I think the public should be reassured that the committee and Labor on that committee have prosecuted the case effectively in relation to the civil liberties issues that are presented by that. We have also taken great cognisance, as the shadow Attorney-General has mentioned, of the issues that have been raised in relation to commercial impacts and security impacts. One of the things that has guided me in my time working in security affairs is that sometimes the road to hell is paved with good intentions. That's why we need to work through these things carefully. The Attorney-General has been working with us very well through these processes since he became the Attorney-General. I know that he's under the constraints of working within the cabinet framework and that there are sometimes dynamics that happen in cabinet frameworks, but the problem that we have had in this process has been the truncation. Within the committee we came to an agreement, we believed, on how that might be managed. This was not a question of Labor trying to force measures to deal with this issue of cutting short the committee's processes. There were coalition members' suggestions that we adopted on how that might be managed because they had equal concerns about the evidence that we received about the security risks and, of course, the commercial risks posed by the bill. My focus is really on the safety of Australians and the security risks that were highlighted. The problem there is that we need the ability to test that evidence, to properly get informed about that evidence and then to propose measures that might address it effectively. The areas that we were particularly concerned in, I think, crossed the spectrum of the members of that committee. Was this issue of the systemic weakness problem, because of the evidence that we received about that, opening up and exposing lots of systems that regulate our transport systems, our banking systems-every system, these days, that is dependent on protected networks? So that was of concern, and it needed to be tested. But mostly we needed to come up with a proper definition of 'systemic weakness', and that's going to be a huge challenge. This is a broad concept that will be very difficult to nail down effectively in a regulatory mechanism. However, we have greater comfort in how that will be managed from the fact that we now have an additional mechanism, through the committee working through these suggestions and processes, to have an independent assessment done, which a company can refer to where it has issues of concern about being forced to a requirement, under a technical capability notice, to engage in unlocking some of these aspects of what it does. So it can go to that independent mechanism, which is going to be composed of a judge and a technical expert, and, importantly, the  decision of that independent mechanism will be binding. So there's a fair degree of comfort in that, but there is more work that needs to be done in relation to this definitional issue. Of course, the shadow Attorney-General mentioned the challenge of the processes under the CLOUD Act. People need to step back from the legal detail here. The evidence that we received indicated that there would be a real question-a real challenge-to negotiations Australia is currently involved into come within that CLOUD Act framework, which the UK is also processing through. The challenge with coming under the CLOUD Actwhich enables us to truncate processes of getting access to data, which is essential for our agencies-relates to US conditions on probity. The UK are moving through that process well because, for example, they have judicial warrants in place for the systems that they have. So we need to just test that evidence. We need to get to the bottom of that and then work out ways around it if necessary. What I'm happy about is that the measure that the committee, across coalition and Labor members, suggestedthat we have an interim bill-is effectively where we're at. We're going to have a bill that enables our agencies to deal with what was presented to us as a period of heightened alert and to just deal generally with managing the threat challenge they have around this technical barrier. But, at the same time, we are going to see the committee continue its process of refining what will no doubt be a significantly improved piece of legislation when that process is complete. We have had something like 17 bills presented to this committee, and Labor has worked to offer over 300 recommendations in relation to those items of legislation, which have all been adopted in that process. Through the input of all the members of the committee in those processes, we have seen the end product that comes out of the bottom of the funnel being better. Every single time, it has been a better piece of legislation. So allowing the committee to continue its process of analysis, of testing this evidence and of coming forward with recommendations will no doubt refine and improve this legislation and address any issues that emerge, and we will have the benefit of some experience with it as well. Additionally, the INSLM, the independent monitor of our security legislation, will conduct a statutory review after the 18-month period is complete. To have that extra independent oversight is critical as well. We have been served well by INSLMs in the past who have done a great job in that space, such as Bret Walker. So those are important facts to be aware of and that the community can be reassured about. We have continuing concerns about how this will play out and how this bill will operate. Of course, there are the concerns of the community. It's one of those rare situations where you have civil liberty concerns and industry concerns being raised from completely different perspectives-a conflation of concerns wrapped up in this bill. Of course, those commercial issues are very important. The evidence that we received in the committee highlighted some risks of an order of magnitude that cannot be ignored; we cannot simply brush those aside. They relate, in addition to the way those large IT companies operate, to the way that Australian companies participate in that global space. So it's something that we must test as well. We need detailed review of that commercial impact and how that might be managed and dealt with. Certainly I know that we can't just make a blanket complaint about the way Silicon Valley operates in the way the Minister for Home Affairs did. A lot of those companies actually got their start in life through assistance from DARPA and the CIA, which are providing fantastic contributions in the security space. Companies like Palantir, for example, effectively vectored Osama bin Laden's location. We need to work with these companies and capabilities, not ruin relationships with them or prevent Australia from accessing and dealing with those companies, which is one of the risks that are involved in a process like this. There is another issue, of course, that I should deal with-and I know that there are other elements that the shadow minister went to in terms of the probity concerns. We were really supported well by and benefited from the evidence presented by the IGIS, Margaret Stone, who is a very, very capable person with a very capable team. Through all of these processes and all this legislation, she has provided incredibly valuable input. The role that she and her team perform in giving the community comfort about the way our security agencies operate-she is completely embedded in that process-is critically important and has been critically beneficial to all the legislation and how these agencies operate. Any recommendations or suggestions she makes must be taken very seriously. We must be reassured about how this legislation operates in the way she does business, and certainly that is so for the Ombudsman as well, and we're reassured that that will be taken seriously by the Attorney General. In conclusion, though, I must draw my final comments to unhelpful sideline comments from the member for Hume and from the finance minister, in the Senate. Those sorts of comments were extreme and grossly offensive not only to Labor but to me and the member for Solomon personally. I have spent 30 years of my life deeply immersed in the security affairs of this nation. I've watched friends lost and killed in operations against terrorists.  I've washed the blood of friends from my uniform. And I won't be told by a member of this House that I am 'running a protection racket for terrorists'. That was grossly offensive and was not a contribution to this debate. I understand that, in the heat of politics, you sometimes say things off the top of your head. But I would request that the member for Hume come into this House and make an apology to the members of the Labor Party and personally to the two members of that party who have served our nation in uniform against that terrorist threat. We have entered into this space in all goodwill and in full endeavour to get this job done.",17
2,Mr BANDT,BILLS," The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 will make Australians less secure. It will threaten our tech industry, and it attacks our civil liberties. This now opens up a door into people's private communication with each other. I'm talking not just about messaging services where you want to keep your messaging confidential but about communications that we all have with our banks and with people that we buy things from over the internet. All of this now is going to be required to be able to be unlocked and looked at by government agencies and by others. The problem is that, once you create a door into what are otherwise encrypted and secure communications, you do not know who's going to be able to access that key. This is why, in other countries, when they've looked at legislation like this, they've said no. They've said that the threat of saying that secure communication is no longer secure outweighs any arguments-any security-related arguments, any arguments about law and order-that there might be to allow people to go and snoop on that kind of communication. It's a very simple proposition: once you introduce a weakness and you require by law the introduction of a weakness into otherwise secure communication, you lose control over who can exploit that weakness. It beggars belief that there is, somehow, some suggestion from the government or from the opposition that: 'It's okay; we're putting in protections about not allowing systemic weaknesses.' And I'll come to that in a moment, and I'll come to these hastily circulated amendments that we're being asked to consider immediately and on the fly-I'll come to all of that in a moment. But the basic principle is there's no such thing as requiring companies to be able to create a key that unlocks secure communication that doesn't also create a systemic weakness. Of course it does. Once you go down that road and introduce not only a back door but, in some instances, a front door, which the government says can now be opened and can be walked into to look at otherwise secure communication-whether it's between people having secure and confidential messages because you want to keep things private, or whether it's what you buy online, or whether it's between you and your bank, or between financial institutions-and once you say, 'You've got to create that key and allow the door to be opened,' anyone can walk through it. That is a fundamental problem with this bill, and it's why other countries have decided not to go down this road. This bill says that government and government agencies can, at first instance, go to technology companies, communication companies, Telstra, internet providers and the like, and say, 'We want you to assist by handing over some information about communication between a couple of people.' But it does more than that; it doesn't just say, 'We'd like you to be able to assist us and hand that information over'-that's called a 'technical assistance request'. The bill goes further and creates things called 'technical capability requests', which say, 'We want you to actively change your software-your product-to include a way in.' So, if you as the service provider-for example, the people who run WhatsApp-don't actually know what the information is that's passing between two people, or between a person and a bank, or between two business entities-which is, in many instances, the case; the people who run the app may not know what's being said between two people, because it's encrypted-then the bill says, 'You've got to change it so that there's a way in, so that you can know what it is, and you can find out that information, and you can hand it over to us.' It's because of that that this bill has managed to raise the ire of people who are concerned about civil liberties. And, for a Liberal government-they should just change their name and junk the word 'liberal', because 'liberal' is completely gone now from anything that they stand for; completely gone. The civil liberties groups are saying, 'Well, hang on; this actually poses a significant threat'-not only because people might want to keep communication confidential but also because, now, even if you never use a confidential messaging app in your life, you presume that the information between you and your bank, or about your online shopping, will be kept confidential. Well, you can no longer presume that, because there is every chance that whoever you're engaging with may have been served with one of these notices and required to include a back door or an open front door into the communication that you're having. Not only are civil liberties groups saying, 'Hang on, there's a reason other countries haven't done this. It's because this is going to mean, in many respects, the end of privacy'-but the tech industry has also said, 'If Australia is now going to be the place where, when you develop software, you've got to include weaknesses in it, then why would people develop their software in Australia? Why wouldn't they go to the other countries where you don't have to have these in-built back doors or front doors that anyone can walk through?'-and not just government agencies but wrongdoers and evildoers as well. You're opening that door.  And they're saying, 'If Australia has to go down this road, why would people continue to develop software in Australia?' These are very, very important questions, and, as we deal with updated technology and what it means to keep Australians safe, they are questions that require the utmost thorough consideration. But what have we got? We've got a bill where people from across the spectrum are lining up and saying: 'Hang on. There are big red flags here. Go slowly.' Instead what is happening, as is usually the case on the last day of sitting in this place, is all of a sudden there are these urgent things that can't wait. Legislation that could have been dealt with six months ago, and gone through the proper process, is now being pushed through the parliament. We're told by the opposition: 'It's okay. We fixed it. Trust us. We've had a closed door meeting with the government. We've reached a bunch of agreements. Trust us. We've completely fixed it.' Well, pardon me. Fifty pages of amendments were circulated about 10 minutes ago and we were told: 'It's okay. We've all fixed it.' People say: 'No, hang on. I'm not prepared to take you on face value, because we've seen this before.' We were told, 'Don't worry, if we pass legislation in this place allowing agencies to access metadata there's only going to be a handful of requests. It'll be alright. It's okay. We've got some concessions. We fixed it.' There has been a significant amount of debate online about this. Dane Pratzky made a good point-remember this promise? 'When the metadata collection laws were passed in 2015 the government said only a limited number of agencies would use them. Now reports suggest that even local councils are using these powers to the tune of 350,000 requests a year.' So pardon us, but we're not prepared to accept on face value this idea that somehow you've fixed it. They said, 'We fixed it, because we have forced the government to accept a definition of ""systemic weakness"".' In the time that's available to me I've got to page 5 of these 50 pages. 'Systemic weakness', as defined in these proposed amendments, is: … a weakness that affects a whole class of technology, but does not include a weakness that is selectively introduced to one or more target technologies that are connected with a particular person. You could imagine that there's basically a group of people-people under 18 or people in Victoria-all of a sudden now under this proposal. Does that now not count as a systemic weakness, if you say: 'I'm just introducing a backdoor into your app for a particular group of particular people. It's only them that we're going to spy on'? Who knows? Probably. What does it mean by 'a whole class of technology'? Does that mean a particular app? What if a particular app is operating in a particular state or with a particular group of people, are they exempt? Who knows? It still doesn't deal with the fundamental point that I raised before, which is that, once you open that door, you create a systemic weakness. Why are we in this situation? We're in this situation because a few days ago the Labor Party showed a bit of spine on this. They were applauded, and rightly so. The Labor Party said: 'We're not going to be bullied into passing something because the government says, ""There's a rush before Christmas."" If the government want particular laws before Christmas, we'll give them those, but not the broader suite.' Well, that didn't last very long. What we're seeing here is a repeat of every time that the Liberals bowl up something that threatens people's liberty and security-as long as they put the stamp 'national security' on the front of it, Labor falls into line. It doesn't matter what threat it has to our industry, what threat it has to our security or what threat it has to our safety Labor will do it. Justin Warren put it well on Twitter: If you want @AustralianLabor to pass a law, just scribble ""National Security"" on it somewhere in crayon. That pretty much sums up exactly what we've seen here. Or the way Greg Jericho put it: In 10 years the LNP will propose everyone having a tracking microchip inserted in their arm, the ALP will protest and then agree to legislation that has it inserted into people's legs instead and they'll say how wonderfully they have improved the bill. That summarises exactly what has happened here as well. We've got these amendments that come in and maintain the fundamental problems with the bill. They will now mean that Australia will become a place that people will start avoiding when it comes to developing their tech industry, which is why there are comments online. Adam Chalmers said online: if the #aabill passes I just won't be able to work in Australia :(I have an ethical obligation to users of my software not to expose their data. Breaking all their crypto/security is just a non-starter. That is the situation that people are going to find themselves in. I think everyone in the country wants to know that we in this parliament are doing everything we can to keep people safe and that our laws are updated to deal with changes in technology, but they also want to know that the right balance is being struck. One of the ways that you ensure that is by doing this carefully, not rushing it through the week before parliament is due to rise, when you  haven't bothered to progress it through the parliament through the usual processes in the last six months, but instead saying, 'We are going to have proper scrutiny and the capacity to deal with this,' which is why Mike Cannon-Brookes said online: Whatever you feel about the #AABill in Australia, I agree with the @thelawcouncil that rushing such complex legislation through in days is reckless. At the least, these unprecedented laws need far more expert scrutiny & debate. He is dead right. It may not have dawned upon Liberal and Labor, but no one party has a majority in this House or in the Senate. Why is that? It is because people across the country are saying, 'We do not agree with your having absolute power, cooking up backroom deals and then asking the rest of us to just accept on face value that it's all going to be okay, because we've been down that road before and we've seen what happens.' We are now in a power-sharing parliament in large part because the Australian people want to shine a bit of daylight and sunlight on the decisions that are being made in this place. They want third voices like the Greens to hold the others to account, especially when it comes to making sure that people are secure online and that people's liberties and privacy are protected online. You don't seem to have got the message, walking in here and saying: 'There are a bunch of amendments. Just trust us. It will all get through. It's alright, we've cooked up this deal. Don't worry.' No, that is not the way you deal with an issue as important as this. This bill should not be proceeding today. This bill should be put to the proper scrutiny and a proper test to ensure that it doesn't affect our industry, our safety and our liberties. If the government seriously needed additional powers to deal with things over the Christmas break, they would have come and asked us six months ago. Instead this is rushed legislation, a bad Liberal-Labor deal that is going to make people less secure online. (Time expired)",24
3,Mr WATTS,BILLS," The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 before the House today is one with the most serious of stakes and it is a bill that the Morrison government has abjectly failed to treat with the gravity that it deserves. It involves policy decisions with the gravest of consequences. It concerns the tools available for our law enforcement and security agencies to ensure the safety of Australians in the face of threats like terrorism and child abuse and it also deals with the tools that Australians use in their everyday lives to protect the security and privacy of their data when using the internet. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security had been treating these issues with the seriousness which they deserve. We should pay some attention to the chronology here: 18 months ago, Malcolm Turnbull, in his infamous 'war on maths' speech, told Australia that the threat of terrorist networks going dark was urgent and that the government proposed to introduce legislation of the kind which we see before parliament today. They did nothing. They subsequently said they would introduce a bill to deal with this in the first quarter of 2018. We saw nothing until September of this year. Then the PJCIS gets the referral and starts doing the substantive, serious, sober work of review, in the national interest, that we know the PJCIS provides this chamber, only for the Minister for Home Affairs to lob into the middle of it and say, 'This is now a matter of urgency.' Those of us in this House who are not members of the committee but who followed the public hearings that they were undertaking saw a very high quality of interrogation of the issues at hand. I put on the record my thanks and regard for the shadow Attorney-General, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Eden Monaro, Senator MCAllister and in particular the committee deputy chair, my friend the member for Holt. Labor always tries to work constructively, on a bipartisan basis, with all members of parliament on national security issues. National security ought to be about keeping Australians safe and preserving the freedoms that we enjoy in a democratic society, not doing harm to your political opponents. The PJCIS has been an institution in our democracy that has lived up to this principle-a place where proposals can be rigorously interrogated in the national interest and where members from both sides of politics can work constructively together on improving these proposals. There are plenty of cynics who will roll their eyes at this-I get that-but, as a party of government, Labor members have to confront the reality that the decisions that we make in this place on these issues have very real consequences; they have human consequences. Regrettably, my own city experienced a terrorist incident during the conduct of this inquiry. As a member of parliament, I attended Sisto Malaspina's state funeral while the committee did its work. Similarly, as someone who spent a not insignificant period of my time before coming to this place working in an Australian telecommunications company, I gained some appreciation of the seriousness and the prevalence of online child exploitation and the important work that law enforcement agencies, and those who assist them in private sector companies, play in identifying and prosecuting paedophiles. These are not imaginary threats. They are not made up, and they are not abstract. They involve real human beings. They involve crimes that destroy people's lives, and the public rightly expects governments to treat them seriously. Despite the government's transparent politicisation of national security and law enforcement through this process, this desperate politicisation, they have done this. Some repugnant things have been said in this debate.  Members opposite should reflect on the repugnant claims and behaviour we've seen during debate on this bill. Australian democracy is not held in high regard by people outside this building. Indeed, it is held in contempt. Despite this, we treat our democracy very poorly in this building. The trashing of the PJCIS as a bipartisan institution, the debased attacks on the motives and integrity on this side of the chamber-they're accusing people of wanting to assist terrorists and paedophiles-merely for exercising our responsibility as parliamentarians to scrutinise complex government proposals in the national interest has hurt the public's regard for our democracy. Those of us who have gone into public service because we believe in the importance of our democratic institutions have the highest obligation to treat these democratic institutions with respect and not to behave in a way that feeds public cynicism towards them. Those opposite ought to spend the Christmas recess reflecting on that in the leadup to the next federal election. That said, I am pleased that the government came back to the negotiating table within the PJCIS process. I want to say a little bit about the context for this bill and the way that we approach it on the Labor side. I understand that there are some on the left of politics who philosophically object to any form of online surveillance. I respect that view and I acknowledge it-it is one that citizens are entitled to hold-but I have never agreed with it. I have not agreed with it as a member of parliament and did not agree with it when I was working in a major telco. Telcos assist law enforcement with their work and have done so for decades. That's not a new thing. Phone tapstelecommunications interception-play an important role in shutting down all name of criminal syndicates. But this principle-the idea that the private sector ought to help, when appropriate, in law enforcement-is a starting point for a conversation about what's possible and what is sensible to do. It is not a conclusion on this bill. And a big problem with the public debate over this bill has been the government, ministers and MPs saying one thing about the effect of this bill while our security agencies and, indeed, even the Home Affairs department have said quite contradictory things in front of the PJCIS and in front of specialist forums dealing with these issues. For example, in a podcast published just this week, Adam Ingle, of Australia's Department of Home Affairs, said to the Crypto 2018 workshop on encryption and surveillance: 'I know some of you may have heard our Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull'-a little bit out of date; it was from a speech from some time ago-'say that the laws of mathematics don't apply in Australia. They very much do. And this legislation reflects that. We don't want to undermine security. We don't want to undermine the laws of mathematics.' Lots of talk from government ministers about this bill has implied that it is a way of breaking strong encryption and about accessing messages delivered via encryption. Despite this, security agencies and technical experts from ASD and AFP who appeared in front of the PJCIS insisted that this was not their intent. Indeed, in hearings on this bill, officials said that this bill would preclude them from requesting a technical assistance notice that provided for a key escrow regime, a regime where the encryption keys for communications are held by some third party in being able to be accessed by government. It ruled out an assistance notice that required an entity to weaken the level of encryption, simplifying the mathematical models that underpin encryption between communications. At conferences, it said that this bill would not allow a technical assistance notice that required password rate limits to be lowered. The bill doesn't allow for a decryption capability to be imposed. These are substantive provisions in this bill that do not reflect the public comments of government. Let me be clear on another point in this respect: because of these constraints, there will be situations in which this bill is not able to facilitate the access to communications that is desired by law enforcement agencies. It just won't be possible. It's not a total solution to this idea of going dark. Anyone who claims that is crazy. That in itself, though, is not a reason to not do what we can. We can do sensible things. I also want to point out, in the face of some of the online commentary, that this is not a bill about introducing some kind of mass online surveillance regime. As the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security confirmed in its submission to the PJCIS process, warrant processes are unchanged by the access and assistance provisions: … 317ZH(1) provides that a technical assistance notice or a technical capability notice has no effect to the extent, if any, that it would require a designated communications provider to do an act or a thing that would require a warrant or an authorisation under certain Acts. That is, any law of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory. If you are not a subject of law enforcement inquiries, you are not going to have to worry about being a target of this bill. If you are not a security threat, as identified by ASIO, you are not going to have to be worried about being a target of the bill. Indeed, these provisions can't require Silicon Valley firms to provide data that they have themselves to our law enforcement and security agencies. This bill doesn't resolve, and may even make more difficult, the mutual legal assistance treaties and the CLOUD Act problems in us accessing data from these providers overseas. In this bill, we can only access information from the targets of these warrants. This bill is not about 'Donald Trump reading your emails', as Senator Steele-John has suggested, nor is it about putting spyware into everyone's devices or spying on unions, as some people have suggested to me. This is a targeted regime that gives ministers the power  to issue notices. In this context, the role before the PJCIS was to ensure that the decision-making ability from the responsible ministers, in assisting issuing these notices, did the right thing, made the right decision and enabled providers to assist with things that were sensible but didn't enable assistance notices that caused wider harm. This is where we come to the provisions in the bill around preventing the installation of a so-called back door. A back door doesn't mean anything in a technical sense. This bill provides for a preclusion on the issuance of these notices where it may create a systemic weakness. This is a complex issue. It is a hard thing to judge even in the technical community. People argue about what a systemic weakness is. Unfortunately, the bill, as originally introduced, provided no definition for this at all. I'm pleased that the PJCIS is, importantly, defining this. Similarly, checks and balances on this decision-making criteria are also important. The upshot of all this is whether a technical assistance notice will be reasonable and whether it will cause harm more broadly outside the context of that specific notice. That is something that will turn on the circumstances. It will turn on the individual facts of a particular security system of a particular IT platform. That's what we've sought to do through the PJCIS. We've sought to bolster the checks and balances. We've sought to bolster the criteria governing the minister's decision-making so that no harm is done through this. I do want to make one comment. There has been an information vacuum on this bill, which has been partly created by the contradictory statements of the government and partly created by our law enforcement and security agencies. Their unwillingness not to be specific about the methods that they intend to use is perhaps understandable. But this has created a real paranoia online and in the sector about what this bill may do. So, in the limited time left available to me, I want to bust a few myths about what is in this bill. First, I just want to say really clearly: this bill will not break internet banking. If this bill were going to break internet banking in Australia, there would have been a submission to the PJCIS from the CBA, the NAB, Westpac and ANZ. We are dealing with a targeted regime here. There is nothing in this bill that bans strong encryption on passage. There is nothing in this bill that makes strong encryption unworkable in a banking security system. It is just nonsense. I want to also specifically say that there is nothing in this bill that provides for the serving of individuals within corporations with these notices. This bill won't create a situation where an individual DevOps guy gets a notice from the government that he or she is not allowed to tell their boss or co-coders about in doing their job. There are provisions in this bill about service of these notices on individuals, but that is only when the individual is a separate entity, when someone has created a product off their own bat. So what is this bill actually about? It is difficult to speculate, because, as I said before, the different circumstances of each security system will govern it, but I do want to point to some examples that we've seen from overseas of things that might be possible under this bill, might be workable, without breaking encryption. Recently in Germany-a country with a very high regard for strong encryption-we've seen its intelligence agencies intervening in the identity management system of apps to add additional end points to group chats. Indeed, their group chat in Telegram is a very high profile app. It was something that we raised through the PJCIS process, to say: 'Would this be a systemic weakness?' It is fair to say that the answer to that was different from the key escrow and the encryption maths answers. That might be possible. We might be looking at end point exploitation instead of breaking end-to-end encryption. We might be dealing with the way that communications are stored and managed on handsets or at end points rather than getting in the middle of it. These are the things which we could productively do, without breaking encryption, and which could assist our law enforcement and security agencies, without breaking the internet. That being said, it would have been nice to spend more time exploring these proposals through a rigorous committee process.",26
4,Mr HUSIC,BILLS," As is often reflected in this place, we are compelled to consider a range of issues that are very important to the people who are affected by them. They may not necessarily garner wide interest, but the people who are touched by the laws that we pass in this place feel very strongly about them. There is a slice of law-making that is in a realm all of its own. In this instance, I believe that, where matters relating to national security combine with one other item, they demand national attention but also deep consideration by every single person in this place. National security, twinned with economic security, demands that we ensure that we are fully aware of the impact, the potential consequences, of the laws that we will put in place. In terms of the matters before us under the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018, it has been flagged for some time in the Australian jurisdiction that we would attempt to do something that had eluded our friends in other parts of the world with more resources, more brains and more capability. This is not disparaging our own strengths and abilities. But, if you look in parts of the world like the United Kingdom, they spent an extraordinary amount of time looking at the matters that are at the heart of this bill. They not only took their time in how they would address this but also recognised the immense challenges in being able to do what the home affairs minister reckons he was able to do with the snap of fingers, which is to deal with, to interfere with, to  manipulate, something as complicated as encryption in an easy way. Well, you can pretend that you can do that, but the reality is something completely different. While a former Prime Minister said that the laws of mathematics are one thing but the laws of Australia are something else, the reality is that the laws of mathematics apply across the entire globe, and there's nothing inherently Australian about our ability to defy those laws. The whole thing about encryption, the big worry that a number of people have expressed about this, is-if I can put it this way-that what has been attempted is like feeling in some way, shape or form that you can make a tiny cut in the mozzie net and you won't get bitten. The reality is that people are deeply concerned that, if you weaken encryption in any particular way, it will, in the longer term, be watched by people who want to cause harm and will do it. There is absolutely no walking away from the fact-and I think there are a lot of joined views in this placethat we do need to absolutely target those who want to cause harm: terrorists, paedophiles, those who want to undertake at a major scale things that are completely beyond the pale. We need to be able to deal with it, absolutely. But, in tackling the people who want to cause harm, we don't want to inadvertently do harm ourselves, so this process needs to be given thought as to how to best architect an arrangement that will allow us to achieve it. There are a lot of us in this place-I suspect that there are some on the other side as well-who have recognised the challenge in doing this and have been troubled by what has been proposed. The regimes that have been put forward by the government have been the subject of deep examination by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. A number of my colleagues have singled out, in particular on our side, the people who have been able to make a very meaningful impact in that committee process. I want to recognise especially the work of the shadow Attorney-General and the shadow foreign minister, which we're very grateful for, but also my friend Senator Jenny MCAllister; the member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly; and the member for Holt, Anthony Byrne. I especially want to single out the last two, who have been open to members of parliament talking with them about the issues at the heart of this bill and working through our concerns with them. And they have, I have to say, given me a greater degree of comfort about what's being proposed. But, having said that, some of the interventions by the member for Melbourne-who I do get on with but I deeply disagree with in this-show some belief that, on the opposition side, we think that this entire matter has been resolved to our satisfaction. It hasn't. We do have concerns still with what's being proposed. What we are trying to achieve is giving the tools to the security agencies to allow them to do their work but subjecting the types of proposals the government has put forward to ongoing review. Now, bear in mind that I was one of the few people in this place to stand at this spot and argue against the arrangements on metadata, because at that point in time. I was deeply concerned-and I still maintain the beliefthat the powers that were granted through that process would potentially be abused, with little oversight and corrective ability. And what's happened in the meantime? We've discovered 350,000 applications for metadata, including from local councils! Why local councils would want my metadata, I don't know. I don't know if they're checking up on the contents of my recycling bin, but I may have caused some sort of offence triggering a need for metadata. People were told, 'We need this metadata for national security,' but we find out that local councils have access to metadata, in 350,000 requests-when we were told that there would be a narrow group of people, agencies and departments that would have access to it. It is astounding. The concern that a number of us have is that, when the government puts this legislation forward, what are the oversight arrangements? I acknowledge the nous and capability of the Attorney-General. He has been much more adroit at dealing with this matter than his predecessors, who would have gone on afternoon Sky News and found themselves in all sorts of tangles describing metadata with tortured analogies involving the postal service. You have been a very good Attorney-General. When this Attorney-General was asked about the types of circumstances where the legislation would apply, which a lot of people have interest in, to give people comfort and understanding about what's going on-he is a clever boy-he said, 'I can't possibly go through those examples, because I've been told it's not appropriate for me to do so.' Very handy but not very helpful: with a controversial piece of legislation like this it is important to have examples you can walk the public through to build assurance, Attorney-General. I think people want to know the types of circumstances in which these laws would be used and what protections will be in place. Longer term, if we want to work with arrangements like the CLOUD Act, the type of judicial oversight offered in this process is tissue-tough. I don't think it cuts the grade of what people would expect. People want a specialist judge backed by a team of people who can assess warrants and applications made to gain access under the TCN arrangement. They want to know that people who are capable of making judgements on applications can do so. I've been told privately that I'm being a bit too tough about the notion that a retired judge is the best person to make those decisions. I personally have deep reservations about it. I think we need to have a much stronger form of judicial oversight. I'm not going to get lectured to by people opposite who don't necessarily take the time to  care about technology. In fact, if they had the ability to work a remote control on the TV, that's a great day in tech for them, but on this they want to tell us",28
5,Mr Wallace,BILLS,That's highly offensive.,30
6,Mr HUSIC,BILLS,"It's not offensive; it's a genuine reflection, Member. It's offensive? They can disparage decorated members of parliament who have served this country in Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Timor or in other capacities, saying that, in raising legitimate questions about this law, they are trying to help terrorists, but the minute you tease them about their capacity to operate a remote control, they get in a huff. It tells you everything about the way those people have approached this and are absolutely",30
7,Mr Khalil,BILLS,Hypocrites.,30
8,Mr HUSIC,BILLS,"as some have interjected. While I won't characterise it that way, I endorse what the interjections have said. As I said, this involves economic security. Encryption is a legitimate pathway used by businesses to securely carry data that involves sensitive material about individuals, be it health records or transactions of financial status and wealth. Commercial operations legitimately use those platforms to conduct their business, and we as consumers and members of the public know that that's done. Anything that is being put forward by those opposite that would have an impact on that, needs to be considered carefully. The warrants process is an important mechanism to ensure that, when people make the applications through agencies, someone capable is making the decision on them. I believe that the arrangements that have been put forward by the government are only interim ones. I say that because, in the longer term, judicial warrants and oversight will be critical. The second thing that I think will be important is parliamentary oversight. Our committees have done a terrific job in oversighting this legislation, but they should also be empowered to a far greater extent to look at the way in which the laws that are passed by this body are actually implemented and operate. We have very little in the way of future reform of the parliamentary oversight committees to give them the same capabilities as those that exist in our allies, such as the UK and the US, to ensure that the types of things that are being proposed now are dealt with properly. We need to have better arrangements there. The third thing that I think we need to do is to have clarity about the reporting on this. Through you, Deputy Speaker, I say to the Attorney-General: I would be very grateful if, in your reply to the contributions today, you can outline the kinds of reporting arrangements that will let the public know how many times the orders or the arrangements have been accessed over a defined period of time and also the numbers of people that are affected by those orders. With the greatest respect, Attorney-General, I think there would be people in the public who would want to know what arrangements are in that. So, as I said, I think the oversight arrangements are important, and there are a lot of people in this place who believe that, in the longer term, we need to have those mechanisms in place to give comfort. Again, there are a lot of us who are deeply concerned about this. There have been some reflections made about the views of people in the tech community who rightly raise-they should not be dismissed as extreme libertarians-what impact this has on the local tech sector if they are trying to ensure that the tech sector is able to flourish in this place and have confidence, because it's in an interconnected community with other parts of the world, that the quality of the work that it does here isn't questioned because of the legal arrangements put in by the government. There have, I note, been quite a few views that have been raised online about whether or not this will put the local digital economy at a great disadvantage relative to others. Others have questioned whether or not simple geoblocking arrangements by a lot of the types of platforms that have been raised will see us not having access to some of the apps that have been mentioned in the course of the debate because people and organisations do not want to be subject to a penalty regime as envisaged by the act, which is important as well. This is not the end of the debate, and I want to emphasise to people who are listening to this and following this debate outside this place that this is subject to ongoing review, and it is also subject to the commitment of parliamentarians who believe that the oversight arrangements, the judicial warrants and the way this system is accountable to others need to be strengthened. We certainly think, in the longer term, that this is the thing that needs to happen and happen quickly.",30
9,Mr HILL,BILLS," I endorse the comments that have been made by previous speakers on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 and seek to build on those. In doing so, I record my strong concerns at the outset at the government's shameful, disgraceful approach to national security, as evidenced by the handling of this bill and the discourse and comment by government ministers, particularly over the last week or so. Being a serious, responsible party of government is a responsibility which the Labor Party accept. We're not seeking to be populist in relation to national security matters. I don't think anyone could say that, at any point in the last two terms of parliament, we've taken the low road on national security. We've worked sensibly, in a  measured fashion and in a bipartisan way, through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, always seeking to listen to the evidence, to take seriously the concerns of our security agencies-and industry in this case-and to reach agreement and compromise with the government. I think that committee has issued more than 300 recommendations in relation to a range of legislation, all of which have been adopted by the government and all of which have improved the initial proposals introduced by the government. Of course, it's easy being green, as Kermit the Frog used to say, and the Greens political party have chosen the other route: to vote against every single piece of national security legislation, seeking populist headlines and spreading rubbish on social media. They're not serious legislators. Indeed, I think in Gareth Evans's book, he observed that at least back in the day the Democrats were serious legislators. They'd go on serious committees. They'd put in the hours to read the clauses, grapple with the evidence, do the hard yards and actually have evidence behind the claims that they made. But even back then the Greens Party just didn't do the work. It wouldn't surprise me at all if none of them really said much in the Senate after 6 pm because they're not going to get on the telly tonight, so why bother, as we saw with the foreign influence bill when it went through the Senate. This is yet another badly thought out, badly drafted and rushed bill, just like the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2018 was when it was rushed into parliament and introduced. I was in the chamber then. Everyone else was off having a drink after the marriage bill, but the Leader of the House was waiting to shut the place down, so I had to table an obscure committee report and listen to the Prime Minister's overblown rhetoric coming off the back of their disgraceful politicisation of national security when they were desperate at that point with 'Shanghai Sam' and all this stuff gratuitously insulting China and selling out our national interest at that point. But the pattern is there. When this government is at its most desperate and when even picking on minorities, migrants and the most vulnerable Australians doesn't seem to be working anymore-as we saw in the Victorian election; talking up fear of crime didn't go so well, did it?-its last resort is: 'Break glass. Press ""national security""'. That's what we've seen this week in how they've handled this encryption bill. As I've said, the Labor members have taken the issue seriously. There was a timetable agreed on with the chair of the committee, who's over there. I think he sought to do his best to put a proper, grown-up process in place, to listen to the national security agencies, to listen to technical experts and to listen to other government agencies even when they gave clearly misleading and wrong evidence, like the Department of Home Affairs did. It became apparent that the government's consultation on the bill with the exposure draft was cursory at best, and not genuine. They didn't listen to any of the concerns raised. They just ploughed on ahead, thinking: 'We've ticked the box in consultation. We stuck out an exposure draft-that'll do.' When the bill was introduced, there was no suggestion from the government that this was urgent. There was no date specified. It was only after the government's shocking week last week-you got smashed in Victoria, you lost Wentworth on Monday and you had a defection and lost the seat of Chisholm on Tuesday-that they then all of a sudden hit the panic button and started heavying the committee and smearing Labor with ridiculous slurs. If we didn't pass the bill immediately, as drafted, with no interrogation and no thought, then somehow we were all friends of paedophiles and friends of terrorists. It was an utterly ridiculous comment by the member for Hume with terrible overreach and hyperbole, and the commentators called him out on it. As if saying we were all friends of paedophiles was somehow going to get the opposition onboard! Indeed, I think it was at that point that the former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor called out the Minister for Home Affairs as being unfit for his office through taking the low road, as the government have done, and politicising national security in the way we've seen in the last week. That is an important point. I heard the member for Eden-Monaro before remark upon that slur on the opposition and call for an apology. Well, I don't feel I need an apology-that's the normal kind of rubbish we hear when the government is desperate-but I do agree that, if anyone is owed an apology, it is the member for Eden-Monaro. He spent 30 years of his professional life working in the national security establishment of this country, serving in the SAS, serving overseas and fighting terrorists. For a government minister to somehow imply that he, as a member of the intelligence committee, in seeking to fix this flawed bill was somehow a friend of terrorists is disgraceful. For any of those opposite who wonder why they're held in such low regard by the Australian people now, that's a very good example of the kind of thing that should stop. When it's said in the heat of the moment, perhaps on Sky News, if anyone was watching-I actually was at that moment-then perhaps a withdrawal and an apology would go some way to restoring some trust and decency. In contrast to this process, the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2018 was passed without fuss by the House earlier this week, because that followed a grown-up process where there was early and extensive consultation with the opposition and grown-up behaviour through the committee. The bill had checks and balances in oversight embedded in it, and they were strengthened, but, of course, that was driven by the member for Curtin, when she was the foreign minister. For that, the thanks she got from her party room was 10-or was it  11?-votes to be leader. So, for grown-up behaviour, you're spurned, but for taking the low road and politicising national security, apparently you get rewarded on the other side. In good legislative process, at 6.32 this morning, we got handed the amendments to the bill-100 pages in the report and goodness knows how many amendments. So we're supposed to stand here-like government muppets do-and support a bill, when there's been no chance to properly consider whether the amendments agreed to even reflect the agreements made through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. We've had multiple examples on previous occasions where an agreement is reached, the government runs off, does the drafting, comes back, and it's not right, either through bad intent, in some cases, or just fair, excusable mistakes that may happen when people are working overnight drafting complex legislation. The shadow Attorney-General has well outlined and summarised Labor's substantive concerns with the bill, but I'd say very clearly the bill is flawed. It was flawed in a serious fashion when it was introduced to the House. The original version was hopeless. Despite the supposed consultation on the exposure draft, as I said, there was no actual listening-we may hear, but we don't listen. There was no credence given to the red alarm bells ringing from industry that the bill, if it proceeded with as drafted, would actually compromise national security, would weaken national security. But we called the government's bluff and said: 'No, there is a line. We've reached the line. We are not going to support legislation that weakens national security, even if the government thinks it's in its short-term political interests to call us all ""friends of terrorists"". We're not going to do that.' I'll draw attention to two things that have been remarked upon. Encryption: once it is broken, you can't unbreak it. Encryption plays a critical role in our national modern security, not only in more traditional national security domains of defence and policing and so on but also our economic security-banking, telecommunications and critical infrastructure. And the back doors that have been talked about-that if you require technical providers to build in known flaws-are a serious issue. It's not a trivial issue like the 'big stick' which we hear so much about in question time; it's a serious issue. Industry lined up to point out serious numerous problems, but there was nothing, silence from the government-doesn't matter; we're just going to plough on ahead. One of the most serious issues, the shadow Attorney-General's identified. When this was raised in committee hearings with officials and government members, there was this kind of stunned silence, like no-one had actually thought of the implications for the security relationship with the United States and the CLOUD Act that was passed in March. In that sense, whilst this bill is less problematic, Labor still have concerns about it. We still believe it's flawed legislation despite the agreements reached. We are going to do the sensible, grown-up thing as a responsible party of government and reach a compromise with the government to pass the bill before Christmas and ensure that the security agencies have the powers that they have said that they need-some of that in public evidence, some of it, of course, in classified evidence, restricted to the committee. It is a fact of life that we have to trust the judgement of those senior members of the House-at least from our side-who are members of that committee. I do want to draw attention and record my concerns about a couple of aspects of outstanding concern. Firstly, judicial oversight: appallingly, the bill does not provide, even as amended, for judicial oversight of technical assistance notices or technical capability notices. Judicial oversight via warrants does apply to telecommunications interception notices, which is the most obviously reasonable parallel. It's an accepted norm. It has been for decades. An important legislative principle anywhere in public administration but particularly in relation to intelligence and security matters is that, as the legislature grants greater powers to security agencies, there has to be greater accountability and responsibility. It shouldn't be a difficult concept. If you give more powers away to do hidden things then there has to be greater accountability. That's why judicial oversight via warrants is a long-accepted, well-accepted practice. But the government won't agree to that. Point-blank, they will not agree to judicial oversight. There's no sensible, convincing explanation being given as to why the same regime that has applied for decades to telecommunications interception warrants can't apply here. There's just no explanation. It's a basic norm, but it's also a civil liberties and a trust issue. Trust in government is declining. Surely this is one thing that we can agree on to help address some of the concerns floating around the internet or the hyperbole that we've heard from the Greens' political party. This is one issue that we could agree on that would help to moderate some of the legitimate public concerns about trust. I'm concerned that this legislation allows one government minister-well, the initial proposal was that one government minister could issue the mandatory technical assistance notices or technical capability notices. I'm not remotely comforted by the fact that it's now two government ministers, particularly when one is the very weak Senator Fifield. This double-lock system of two ministers doesn't give much confidence. The best we could get out of this initial compromise was judicial review from a retired judge. A judicial review is a very poor second cousin to judicial oversight. This should be fixed next year, as the committee's inquiry continues. But if it's not fixed by this government, I think it should be fixed by the next federal Labor government.  The other concern, of course, is the definition-or lack of definition-of 'systemic weakness'. Apparently, the protection was that you can issue a technical capability notice-you know, the big stick-to make them build in a back door, but there's no definition of what a systemic weakness, in fact, is. They're ignoring industry on this point. Labor has got the government to finally, after listening to the evidence through the committee, agree to accept that there has to be a definition of systemic weakness. It shouldn't be rocket surgery, even for those opposite, to understand that if you're going to pass a term that is supposed to be the big protection from stuffing up the",30
10,Mr HILL,BILLS,"'Rocket surgery' was Warwick Capper's favourite phrase, actually. It's one of my personal favourites. I thought it might help some of those opposite to understand the point I was making. It shouldn't be rocket surgery to understand that you need to define the term 'systemic weakness'",33
11,Mr HILL,BILLS,"I know it's 'rocket science'. I think 'rocket surgery' has a nicer ring to it, Leader of the House. Ms O'Neil: I'm defending you!",33
12,Mr HILL,BILLS,"Thank you. It was deliberate. It was a Warwick Capper term. It's part of my lexicon. In summary, I do welcome the fact that the PJCIS inquiry will continue. This provides an opportunity to address the serious and outstanding national security concerns-most particularly, but not limited to, the US CLOUD Act and our security cooperation-to address the privacy and civil liberties concerns. I have to say, a lot of what I've seen and received via email is clearly overstated. Warrants remain for the interception of individual communications, as has existed for decades, but we could strengthen it with judicial oversight. Very importantly, as others will talk about, we can take the time to consider the economic impacts and our economic security.",33
13,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," It goes without saying that everyone in this House is focused on national security and everyone in this House is doing everything they humanly can to enhance our national security. Yes, we all approach it from different places and look at it through different coloured glasses. But I would just like to say, quite clearly, that the member for Eden-Monaro's comments were justified. The member for Hume's comment was a deeply offensive comment. There have been other deeply offensive comments made over time, when it comes to some people criticising other people in this place when it comes to national security. In fact, although I haven't done the numbers exactly, I think there would be as many, or more, former members of the military and the intelligence and security services serving in the current opposition and on the crossbench than there are in the government. That's not a criticism of the government. It's just to give a sense of balance. We all have our heart in it, and we should keep the discussion about policy issues respectful. Some people see me as a bit of a dud, but I did more than 20 years in the military and intelligence services as well. Even though I am not supportive of the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018, let's all just respect each other's position and where we're coming from, please. I share the concern of many people-not so much in this place, but many people in the community-and agree that it is a bad idea to be building a known vulnerability into encryption software. That is not necessarily because we have concerns about that access into encrypted communications for government-although there are legitimate concerns about that to be had. But there is the broader concern that to design a weakness, a vulnerability, a back door-some way to access encrypted communications in all communications-is such an invitation to wrongdoers to find the key to that door and to eavesdrop, effectively, or to see in plain text what people thought was a secure communication. So I think that's the first point to make: that it's a bad idea to, by law, require all the encrypted communications in this country to have a vulnerability by design that can be exploited by wrongdoers. Of course, having that within our own country might be something we accept. Clearly the government and the opposition accept it, and I suspect they're going to vote together on this bill shortly. But it does raise a question: what will our security partners and our business partners think of that? I think it is a reasonable conclusion to draw that there will be concern in other countries and in multinational businesses that have operations in Australia that they will then be partners with a country that has this vulnerability within our ICT. That's another thing that needs to be considered. So I think this bill is ill considered, and I'll be one of I suspect a small number of people who will oppose it. There is a broader issue, and that is about the power of the state. I've spoken about this on many occasions, and I have expressed the concern of a great many Australians that the power of the state has now grown and been extended so far in this country that it is unacceptable. In fact, since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, well over 60 security reforms have gone through this place. I understand that when security reforms at the state level are included there have been literally hundreds, many hundreds, of changes to our security legislation-principally, it is said, to deal with the threat of terrorism. I acknowledge that some of those reforms have been sensible, and we  should be always reviewing our security arrangements and always looking to improve them where they need to be improved. But there is a widespread concern in the community that some or many of those reforms have not been well considered and have not been justified. In fact, you could even go back to the very start of those shocking events in 2001, the terrorist attacks in the US. I think the whole response was wrong. At the end of the day, that was a shocking criminal act of mass murder, and really that should have been our response way back then. We shouldn't have been racing around the world invading countries; we should have been treating it as a terrible criminal matter. If we need to enhance our legislation to help the crime busters, then let's do that, but let's not overextend; let's not unnecessarily extend the power of the state. I'm pleased that some people have reminded us of the issue of mandatory metadata retention. I'll take this opportunity to make the point again: that was a bad idea. That is bad policy-the fact that every piece of metadata collected by an Australian telco must be kept for two years and can be accessed without merit. There's no comfort in that. I personally would probably have had a different response to mandatory metadata retention if I had known at least that it could be accessed only with a warrant-and no, it's not. So, there is that issue that the power of the state has already been extended greatly. In the minds of many people it has been extended way beyond what has been necessary. When I wrap that context around what's going on here today, I think this is another case of an excessive extension of the power of the state, and it's another case of the government and the alternative government being in lock step. I think one of the characteristics of a healthy democracy is that we have a strong, ethical, confident government and that we have a tough opposition that holds the government to account. It doesn't oppose for opposition's sake, which has been the case far too often in this country in recent years, but holds the government to account when it needs to be held to account. And when it comes to issues of national security-and the response to irregular immigration, I would add-far too often, in fact almost always, whoever's in opposition, whether it be the coalition or the Labor Party, will just say, 'Yes, where's the blank cheque? We'll sign it for you.' Far too often, it's out of a fear of being wedged. I do wonder, in fact, about bringing the encryption bill on at this point in time, after 18 months of it wallowing around the parliament in the lead-up to a federal election. I do wonder: why the haste? To what degree is bringing it on right now a political move? Was it done in the hope of wedging the Labor Party? Well, you know what? I wish the Labor Party had been wedged on it, because they shouldn't be supporting it. I think the Labor Party are letting down many of their supporters by getting behind this bill. I'd also make the observation that, yes, when you're in government, you do need to be responsive to the needs of the security services. You should ask them: 'What tools, how much money, what resources and what legislative freedom to manoeuvre do you need? What do you need to do your job?' That's good. We asked them and we listened to them. But we should never just say yes to every request, because it's in the nature of the security services to ask for every possible tool they can get their hands on, to the point where they would have way more than is in the public interest if you gave them everything they wanted. So sometimes, in this place, we've got to be prepared to say no. If the security services were able to access any and all encrypted communications, I agree that that would help the security services. But at what point do you rein them in and say: 'You're asking for too much. You are asking us to extend the power of the state beyond what is reasonable'? If you were to give the security services everything they want, they'd probably have rockets and missiles and be able to do who knows what. You've got to rein them in. That's our job. Our job is just as much to be a check on the power of our security services as it is to give them the tools they need. And I do worry that, in this country nowadays, governments, supported by oppositions, are too quick to give the security services everything they want. It's telling that several years ago now I gave a speech in here lamenting that Australia had entered a stage of being almost in a prepolice state, with excessive powers of the state and excessive legislation that had gone too far. For example, mandatory metadata can be accessed without a warrant. I was genuinely alarmed a little bit earlier in this debate to hear that councils-local government-in Australia are now accessing, or at least seeking to access, that metadata. What we were promised, only several years ago now, was that it would be used only to go after terrorists and that the list of agencies that would be allowed to use that information would be very small. In fact, the list of organisations was being reduced in size, because I remember that at the time, years ago, before it was mandatory, we were wondering, 'Why does the RSPCA have access to metadata?' We were having, I think, a healthy debate about who should access this sort of stuff and we were absolutely promised that it would only be used to go after terrorists. Then, after a while, the debate morphed into: 'Oh, yes, but also paedophiles and other things.' The problem with these sorts of reforms is incrementalism. Things are rolled out with lots of promises and grand speeches, but over time the security services want just a bit more, other agencies want just a bit more and  ministers give out a bit more, and you end up in a bad place. I do worry about this access to encrypted material. I think the government's saying it's only to assist in the fight against terrorism and the most serious of crimes, like child exploitation, paedophilia and so on. And, yes, they are heinous crimes. But next year it will also be for this and that, and the year after it will be for that and that and that. And before we know it, family law lawyers will be wanting access to information, whether it be metadata or access to what we thought were secure communications between two parties. Then local governments will be wanting access to it and all these other agencies will be wanting access to it. People in civil law courts will be wanting access to it. The idea of a slippery slope isn't just a cliche; it is real. As the Attorney-General is leaving I will say through you, Deputy Speaker, to him, and I have said it before and I will say it again, that I think the Attorney-General is a decent man and he is not prone to acting recklesslyexcept in the problem case of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, and I still don't know why we are going after those two. But what happens when in a future government we have a really nasty piece of work or a real fool in a position like that? We need laws to be really tight to protect us from people in the future. Laws should never be rolled out on the assumption that they will never be misused. Any opportunity to misuse, any hole in it, should be closed before we bring it into law. Why the rush? These ideas have been, as I said earlier, washing around parliament for about 18 months, and all of a sudden we have to get it through the parliament today. We have to have it in place before Christmas. Why the rush? If nothing else, why can't we just delay this, look at it further, consult more broadly and put in place more safeguards? That would keep some members of the community happy. I come back to my original concern and that is that it's just fundamentally a bad idea to build a back door into encrypted systems, because it is an inherent vulnerability and, mark my words, people will search for that back door. And some very clever people will find it and they will access it. Then once they've found the key they will sell it to someone else. It will become a very valuable commodity. Before we know it, what is being said for the wrongdoers-perhaps the criminals and perhaps the terrorists-will be no secret and it will be used against us. It will make us less safe. It will be because of a government-this government, this opposition-seeking to extend the power of the state just that bit further, and, frankly, to take us that bit closer to a police state, because in so many ways we have already reached a prepolice state-too many laws, too much power for the state and too much power for the security services. I will be opposing this bill today. Thank you.",33
14,Ms KEARNEY,BILLS," I rise today to speak on this Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018. I will just say first that later today I will speak on the Treasury laws amendment bill. I only mention this because there is a similarity in how both these bills have been brought to this House, both in a rush of ill preparedness and, may I say, seeming desperation. The bill being discussed this afternoon was moved in this House without anyone actually having time to properly read it, to properly analyse it and to properly work out a proper response-and I believe even the members of the government's own party. Both bills have been prepared in a rush and in desperation, because this government knows that it is in deep trouble. It knows that it has nothing to offer the Australian people that connects them with the people, or that shows that they are in any way in touch with what is happening in what they would call 'real Australia'. The haste and desperation around about this bill is disgraceful and, quite frankly, deeply concerning. There has always been a bipartisan approach to matters of national security through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. There has always been a deep and real consideration of issues that befits responsible government, a practice that this government has thrown out the window, and all in the name of what? Certainly not in good national security policy-perhaps trying to be populist. As my friend and colleague the member for Bruce just articulated so well, the government have tried picking on minorities, they have tried race hatred and they have tried vilifying vulnerable Australians, and none of this has worked to improve their popularity or their position with the Australian electorate. So, as we have seen time and time again from the Liberal Party, they resort to fearmongering on national security. Their handling of this encryption bill has been abominable. Labor members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security have done their job with all seriousness. They have been consulting with industry and civil society stakeholders, both through the committee process and outside. Labor have negotiated with the government to address some core concerns of ours. While there are significant outstanding issues-and I will go to those later-the compromise we are debating today will deliver security and enforcement agencies the powers they say they need in the short term and ensure adequate oversight and safeguards to prevent unintended consequences, while enabling continued scrutiny of the bill until 2019. Labor are prepared to take this course of action because of the government's undertaking that the committee will continue its inquiry into the bill into 2019 and a separate statutory review will be undertaken by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor within 18 months of the legislation coming into effect. These  separate processes will provide an opportunity to resolve our ongoing concerns about the bill with the assistance of industry, experts and civil liberty groups. It will also help uphold our responsibility to keep Australians safe. The Labor members of the committee have taken on board all evidence from our national security agencies. They have listened to the industry and technical experts. This is serious, complicated business, and it's quite clear that the government's consultation and consideration were not deep enough or good enough to produce an original bill that was in any way acceptable. The government, to begin with, did not suggest that there was any need to rush this. They suggested, indeed, that they would give it the consideration that it deserved, and we started that process in good faith. As the member for Isaacs said this morning, we put a great deal of time and energy into rigorously analysing every national security bill that is presented, and we do this because we understand that, in conferring new powers to protect our nation's security, it is vital that we do not compromise the very freedoms and way of life that we are seeking to protect. We must always be aware that, while the laws we pass can be part of the solution to national security threats, those laws, if improperly designed, can become a part of the problem. When we tried to explain that this was important to us and that we on this side of the House wanted to make sure of the above-that we needed to slow down-the government said, as if there were a sudden urgency, that if we didn't pass this bill immediately, as drafted and without evidence, we were helping and befriending terrorists and paedophiles. This was an outrageous slur on the Labor Party simply because we wanted to follow due process. As other members of the House have mentioned this morning, this was insulting, and there should be an apology and a withdrawal. What we were trying to do was protect the rights of Australian citizens. The member for Isaacs and others have outlined Labor's concerns with this bill. Yes, it is not perfect, but the original version presented by the government was a mess. It was hopelessly flawed and completely unsafe. It was clearly rushed and ill-written. Some of our concerns have been dealt with in this bill, and they go to a couple of things that have been spoken about already this morning. We have concerns about systemic weakness and its implications for security, technology and Australian economic competitiveness. We are concerned about inadequate oversight and safeguards, including implications for privacy and civil liberties. Labor members of the committee have sought and obtained recommendations in the PJCIS report that, if translated into amendments, will address many of the core concerns raised by Labor and stakeholders, noting that the committee will undertake further inquiry immediately after the legislation is passed. Systemic weakness related concerns will be addressed through amendments to clarify the meaning of the term. Now, this is incredibly important and the industry has told us this: we need to clarify the meaning of the term 'systemic weakness' and clarify that technical capability notices cannot be used to create a systemic weakness. We need an ability for a provider to disclose details of a technical capability notice, except, of course, where it would compromise an investigation. There needs to be authorisation of a technical capability notice, requiring the approval of both the Attorney-General and the minister for communications, despite the concerns of my colleague who spoke previously about the capability of the current minister. A designated communications provider that has concerns about a technical capability notice may request a binding assessment of whether it would indeed create a systemic weakness, that the requirements are reasonable and proportionate, that compliance is practical and technically feasible and that the notice is the least intrusive measure that would still achieve the objective. Two persons would be jointly appointed to conduct the assessment, and the report must be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This essentially means that any request to a provider that might create a systemic weakness would be subject to a merit review style process. Inadequate oversight and safeguards will be addressed through the strengthening of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security oversight powers, including explicit notification and reporting requirements, limits on the exercise of powers, defences for the IGIS officials and clear information-sharing provisions. There will be clear authority for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to inspect and gather information on the exercise of these powers. The AFP Commissioner must approve any state and territory initiated technical assistance notices, and they must apply the same criteria and go through the same decision-making process that would apply as if the AFP were the original issuing authority. These things were taken up by the Labor Party, and I congratulate the member for Isaacs and the other Labor members of the PJCIS for paring back and amending some of the worse aspects of this bill. We have another concern, and that is that this bill does not provide for judicial oversight of technical assistance notices or technical capability notices that allow for interception notices, or, in less technical wording, for the gateways to be inserted and to bypass the encryptions. The government will not agree to judicial oversight, and I agree with previous speakers who say that this should be fixed. If it is not fixed before the next election and if Labor is elected, I think Labor should fix this part of the bill, which we are concerned about. Labor will monitor the implementation of this legislation very carefully. We welcome the necessary changes that Labor members of the committee have brought about, and we welcome the fact that the committee inquiry  into this legislation will continue with full review. We will continue to listen to stakeholders, including concerned Australians. While there is some misunderstanding, some misinformation, some hyperbole and, as we have heard, there are some insults that have been thrown about the House with respect to this bill, Labor, I am pleased to say, take this very seriously. We will continue to monitor this bill. We will continue to stay in touch with the stakeholders. We will reassure Australian citizens that we will continue to monitor this bill very carefully, as we go into the future.",35
15,Mr KHALIL,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018. National security versus individual privacy, individual rights versus collective rights, privacy versus security-these are the traditional conundrums and the traditional challenges that governments have faced since time immemorial. It's about getting that balance right and what that balance should be. Of course, with the advent of modern technologies, particularly over the last couple of decades, we see that there is a further complication of this conundrum with respect to the entanglement of national security concerns with economic concerns. We've heard, as some of the previous speakers have noted, that members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security have heard evidence from security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies about the risks of the surveillance environment going dark because of some of this technology where terrorists, paedophiles, organised crime and drug traffickers all utilise encrypted technologies and applications for their communications and their planning. But we still have the same challenge that we face here in this parliament and that governments face around the world, and that is making sure that we get the balance right between the security of the collective community against those threats which I just enunciated and, in the case of the bill that we are debating, the security of the data and the content that is transmitted through the encryption service. We need to make sure the privacy of that data and those communications is protected from the eyes and ears of government agencies when it's not necessary for them to access that data. So it is a difficult balancing act, and this challenge has been compounded by the process we've witnessed, where the government has tried to ram this bill through the intelligence committee. I also want to echo the comments of many of the other speakers and commend the work that has been done by the members of the intelligence committee, who, as some previous speakers have noted, have worked extremely well together in a bipartisan way on this bill. On the 15 different national security bills that have passed here in this place during the term of this parliament, they have made something like 300 amendments. They've done excellent work in trying to get that balance right, and they're faced with getting that balance right in most of the work that they do and the consideration of the different laws before them. Unfortunately-and it is not so much the fault of the members of that committee-the government itself has sought to almost weaponise or politicise this process by trying to rush the committee's very important work and to force their hand by asking them to come out with a report much earlier than I think they would have liked to. They would obviously have needed to spend much more time in consideration of the bill. The Labor members of that committee obviously have heard the evidence given by enforcement, security and intelligence agencies that there is a real need for some of the powers that we're debating within this bill in order to protect Australians from what they've characterised as increased security threats that are very real, particularly over the Christmas and holiday period. Of course, the Labor members and other MPs have consulted not only with the intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies but also with industry and civil society stakeholders-tech companies and other stakeholders that have a real interest in how this bill proceeds. In many respects, there has been enormous effort through the committee to try to negotiate the issues of concern that have been rightly raised by tech companies and many others about the unintended consequences and effects of this bill, particularly given the rushed fashion in which it has been put to the parliament. Those negotiations have led to a series of substantive amendments which Labor has put forward to try to address those concerns. I just want to note again for the record that, while there has been excellent work done by the committee, it is most unfortunate that the government of Prime Minister Morrison has tried to force their hand with respect to the work that they were doing. There were a number of Australian companies that indicated that they were not consulted by the government and that, even when they made submissions to the inquiry, they were simply ignored. That, as I said, has meant that this process has been far from ideal. We have the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs conducting what we would say is unacceptable interference in the work of that committee and seeking to politicise these issues. There has been strong bipartisan support for national security, including on this side of the House, through the term of this government. Of course, as I said, there have been hundreds of amendments that have been worked through as part of that process, but we on this side see the seriousness and the importance of our responsibility to ensure national security and the collective security of all Australians. But we also want to get that balance right.  We've tried in good faith to work with the government, so there's a real disappointment about what we've seen with this process. And I note, too, some of the comments that were made by the opposite side against members on this side who have worked for most of their lives on national security, like the member for Eden-Monaro and me. I have worked in DFAT and Defence, and I actually served in Iraq with the member for Eden-Monaro. We are absolutely committed to national security, but we also want to get the balance right.  contributions, I rise to speak on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018, a bill which is urgently required to strengthen the ability of Australia's law enforcement and national security agencies to deal with challenges presented by modern communications technology. Australia's prosperity is fuelled by the technologies of our age-that's self-evident-but everyday Australians rely on digital communications for banking, shopping, education, health, communications and other key services. Australians expect the digital platforms they use to be secure. That is why the government strongly supports the use of ubiquitous encryption to protect personal, commercial and governmental information. Encryption is a vital part of the internet, computer and data security, supporting Australia's economic growth and national security. However, we would be naive to think that digital technologies which drive our economic prosperity are immune to exploitation. The same technologies that protect us online are being employed by terrorists, by paedophiles, by drug smugglers and by human traffickers to conceal their illicit activities from law enforcement and security agencies. Put simply: encrypted communication is helping criminals and terrorists to remain anonymous and to operate beyond the reach of the law. Tellingly, 95 per cent of ASIO's most dangerous counterterrorism targets use encrypted communications, with encryption impacting intelligence coverage in nine out of 10 priority cases. Encryption has significantly degraded law enforcement and intelligence agencies' ability to lawfully collect intelligence and conduct investigations. The Australian Federal Police and ASIO suggest that, by 2020, almost all communications amongst terrorists and organised criminal groups will be masked by very strong encryption. As we move towards ubiquitous encryption, the challenge it poses for law enforcement and national security agencies will continue to increase. The assistance and access bill is a very necessary and proportionate response to these challenges. The legislation introduces new tools that complement existing powers available to law enforcement and national security agencies. The bill establishes a framework for agencies to seek assistance from relevant industry stakeholders in support of law enforcement and national security investigations and operations. The reforms ensure agencies can obtain legitimate and necessary assistance from communications providers when it is reasonable, proportional, practicable and technically feasible to do so. Agencies will also be empowered to seek assistance from offshore providers supplying communications services and devices in Australia. This reflects the modern nature of the communications industry and ensures that agencies are able to seek assistance from those best placed in the communications supply chain. The bill also ensures that our agencies can access lawfully obtained content and data. This is enabled by the introduction of new computer access warrants for law enforcement, enabling them to covertly obtain evidence directly from a device, and the strengthening of law enforcement and national security agencies' ability to covertly access data through warrants and orders for assistance. Importantly, these measures are supported by strong safeguards and limitations to protect the privacy of Australians, maintain the security of digital systems and ensure that agency powers are only ever used appropriately via lawful processes for national security purposes. The legislation clearly prohibits the creation of so-called back doors for any reason. Companies cannot be required to create systemic weaknesses in their encrypted products or be required to build a decryption capability. The legislation does not allow for mass surveillance. Rather, the provisions in the bill assist authorities in their investigation of individuals who are reasonably suspected of being involved in committing a serious offence or are of national security concern. Access to personal information must be authorised by existing warrants and authorisations, which are subject to their own safeguards, including judicial oversight. The need for the powers in this bill has become more urgent in the light of the recent fatal terrorist attack in Melbourne and the subsequent disruption of alleged planning for a mass casualty attack by three individuals last month-also, sadly, in Melbourne. Individuals in both of these cases are known to have used encrypted communications. ASIO's Director-General of Security, Mr Duncan Lewis, informed the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security last week that there is an operational urgency to this legislation. He advised the committee: The impact of encryption on our operational effectiveness is real. He said: It has degraded our ability to identify terrorist activity.  He also noted that the risk of further attacks is heightened as we head towards Christmas. At the same hearing the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Andrew Colvin, told the committee that he is: … concerned with the increase in criminal communications that are beyond our lawful ability to intercept and/or view. The operational urgency … is … very real … Commissioner Colvin has also written: What this bill does, in essence, is give police a fighting chance … Likewise, Assistant Commissioner Neil Paterson of Victoria Police told the parliamentary joint committee: At the moment, we're fighting with one hand tied behind our back by not being able to lawfully access the data that we needTo keep Victorians safe. We on the government benches implore all of our parliamentary colleagues to support this bill and the agreed amendments to ensure law enforcement and national security agencies can lawfully access the data that they need to keep Australians safe over the Christmas period and beyond. The bill reflects an extensive three-stage consultation process with industry, community organisations and the public. I acknowledge the significant work in this regard by the former Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity, the member for Hume, and the Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Dickson. I also acknowledge the tireless efforts of the staff in the Department of Home Affairs, their colleagues in ASIO, the AFP and parliamentary counsel and thank them for their work on this legislation. I also thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for its comprehensive review of the bill. The amendments recommended by the parliamentary joint committee increase transparency and strengthen the existing accountability and oversight measures. They have been agreed upon and ensure that the powers in the bill are to be used only when required to facilitate the legitimate and lawful operations of law enforcement and national security agencies. The amendments also enhance measures which prevent so-called 'back doors' from being introduced into networks and devices. The bill before the House ultimately strikes an appropriate balance between maintaining the privacy and integrity of networks and devices and ensuring agencies continue to protect the Australian community. For all those reasons I commend the bill to the House.",37

I rise to speak briefly to these amendments. I thank the parliamentary joint committee for accelerating their comprehensive review of the bill. The government's response to the committee's review is extensive and the amendments address the committee's recommendations. The amendments include several very important amendments which have been the product of the parliamentary joint committee's consideration: a double  authorisation mechanism requiring the Minister for Communications, as well as the Attorney-General, to approve a technical capability notice; a definition of systemic weakness and systemic vulnerability, and an extension of those definitions to technical assistance requests; a clear provision to acknowledge how the proposed measures interact with parliamentary privilege; a deconfliction mechanism for the use of technical assistance notices to ensure that issuance of notices by Commonwealth, state and territory agencies is consistent and proportionate; extending consultation requirements to technical assistance notices issued by interception agencies; limiting compulsory industry assistance measures to serious offences, notably those with a maximum period of imprisonment of three years or more; the imposing of time limits of 12 months for technical assistance notices and technical capability notices; the extending of consultation requirements to technical assistance notices; and the introduction of a new definition of interception agency to remove the ability of state and territory independent commissions against corruption to utilise the industry assistance measures in the bill. To reflect recommendation 11 of the parliamentary joint committee's report, a robust framework has been established to enhance the independent assessment of technical capability notices. Upon referral from the provider, the Attorney-General will appoint a technical and legal expert to determine if a proposed capability will create a systemic weakness. These experts will also have carriage as to assessing whether the requirements imposed by the notice are reasonable and proportionate, whether compliance with the notice is practicable and technically feasible, and whether the notice is the least intrusive measure that would be effective in achieving the legitimate objective of the notice. The amendments also provide robust review mechanisms-namely, review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor within 18 months of commencement and the expansion of an existing review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in early 2019-to encompass these measures. Existing oversight functions of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman have been enhanced to reflect their extensive comments provided during the committee's review of the bill. The amendments, therefore, increase transparency and strengthen the existing accountability and oversight measures. They ensure that the powers in the bill are only used when required to facilitate our law enforcement and national security agencies' legitimate and lawful operations. I have tabled an associated explanatory memorandum to provide further detail on these amendments, and the agreed amendments provide further assurances to the parliament and to the broader community that the bill strikes the appropriate and necessary balance between maintaining privacy and security and ensuring agencies have the powers they require to protect our nation's security. I, therefore, commend the amendments to the House.",39
18,Mr BURKE,BILLS," Labor will be responding to the amendments in two ways. The shadow Attorney-General will follow me and will talk about the detail of the amendments. I will explain to the House the reason why we're taking the approach that we're taking right now. We had been given in writing a guarantee from the Attorney-General, which I will quote from now: 'As discussed with you in our meeting earlier today, the government also commits to introducing the agreed amendments in the Senate, subject to the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives without amendment.' We had presumed that that would be the process that would be followed. The reason why we viewed that as the wisest process in terms of national security is simple: whenever the intelligence committee has come forward with recommendations for amendment, those amendments have been provided to the opposition and, on each occasion, as I understand it, the opposition have come back saying, 'Some of these amendments don't actually fully reflect the recommendations within the committee.' When that has happened, the government, in good faith, has revised the amendments and we have ended up with amendments that properly reflect the committee's report. These amendments were provided to the opposition at 6.30 this morning. They were circulated online at 9.22 this morning. There are 173 of them. In the time that the opposition have had to go through them, we see that there are areas where the amendments that are currently in front of us do not yet properly reflect the findings of the intelligence committee. We believe it would have been the wisest path for the government to keep with their original agreement, but they have chosen not to. Notwithstanding that, the amendments that are in front of us get us closer to the committee's report than the original bill. With that in mind, Labor will be supporting the amendments that are before us. But, given that there are now comments following a particularly enthusiastic media conference from the Prime Minister, the government should recognise that there is a plan, potentially, to shut down the House today. I want to advise the parliament that that would not be wise. We will be seeking in the Senate to pursue further amendments to make sure that this bill properly reflects the findings of the intelligence committee. We would have preferred to have done that correctly the first time, but the government has chosen a path of particular haste. So we will support these amendments now, we will support a  third reading of the bill and we will continue to pursue further amendments in the Senate, which will then come back to the House for this bill to be finalised. The amendments we will be pursuing will be within the frame of what is recommended through the intelligence committee report, in the same way we did when Malcolm Turnbull was Prime Minister or, indeed, when the member for Warringah was Prime Minister. I would simply ask the government to act on national security with a similar level of responsibility as what has happened under their two previous prime ministers. The intelligence committee operates this way for a reason. Bipartisanship matters and getting amendments right on national security matters as well. We are not afraid of the parliament. We are not afraid of the parliament sitting. We're happy to stay here for as long as it takes today. We don't need to clock off early. Of all the issues to clock off early on, it would be extraordinary if the government chose to do that on national security. Therefore, given the limits around what the government have done in breaking their earlier agreement, we will support the amendments in front of us, send the bill across to the Senate and, in the Senate, seek to have amendments that properly reflect the intelligence committee's report.",69
19,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," Just to add to the comments of the Manager of Opposition Business, there has been extraordinary conduct by the government in relation to this inquiry. There has been extraordinary conduct in relation to an inadequate bill, despite a consensus report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I thank the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Andrew Hastie, the member for Canning, who is here in the chamber with us. As the chair, he and the other government members of the committee, together with the Labor members, joined with us in a consensus report, like the 18 or so other consensus reports that have been made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security since the Abbott government was formed in 2013. Labor has cooperated with the government to ensure that bills on national security that are introduced into this parliament are, in fact, fit for purpose. More than 300 recommendations have been made on a consensus basis by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security since 2014, as I say, in respect of some 18 different pieces of legislation, 15 of them major. To that, we can now add the 17 recommendations that have been made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in respect of this bill, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018. The inquiry of the committee has already been shamefully interrupted and interfered with by this Prime Minister and by this Minister for Home Affairs. It should, as we have said in an additional comment to the committee's report, never occur again. At the end of the legislative process-when Labor has cooperated with the government and when Labor has cooperated with the government to ensure that the process of the committee has been accelerated in an extraordinary way-this, as members of the public listening and any members of this parliament should know, is a 175-page bill that amends, in five schedules, 10 other acts of parliament. It is a complex bill. It's a bill that introduces, for the first time in Australian law, a power for agencies and police to compulsively require innocent third parties to assist the police in their inquiries in the technology area. The compulsive powers are to be used against innocent third parties who have nothing to do with the subject of an investigation, and that alone should have warranted much, much more time being provided for consideration than the government has seen fit to do. To add insult to injury, late on Tuesday, at about 7 pm on Tuesday, having committed in the terms that the Manager of Opposition Business has already referred to, in a letter to me from the acting Minister for Home Affairs, the Attorney-General, we were told: 'The government also commits to introducing the agreed amendments in the Senate, subject to the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives, without amendment.' We proceeded in good faith on that basis. We finalised the report of the committee yesterday. It was tabled at around 7.30 pm yesterday. It contained 17 recommendations. We awaited the government's response. There still hasn't been a formal response of the government, but the first response of the government was to send us on an informal basis, at 6.30 this morning, most-but not all-of the amendments that are now before the House. And it's significant. We now have 173 amendments, covering some 50 pages, which the Attorney-General and the whole of the government, including the Prime Minister-who's here in the chamber and should be ashamed of himself for the disgraceful way in which he has performed over this national security bill, brought to the parliament, not fit for purpose",70
20,Mr Morrison,BILLS,I just called you out.,70
21,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS,"The Prime Minister is now saying that he just called us out. Indeed he did.

I call the Attorney-General.  mentioned by the shadow Attorney-General in his addressing of the amendments. Yes, it is the case that I indicated in a letter that we were intending to move the amendments in the Senate. That was based on an agreement between the shadow Attorney-General and me-and I'll be very specific about this-that the parliamentary joint standing committee would report yesterday in a way that would allow us to move the bill through the House of Representatives yesterday. So, the undertaking to move the amendments in the Senate was based on the agreement that this bill would already be in the Senate now. Indeed, we agreed, if I recall correctly, that there would be a very small, limited number of speakers so that we would be able to facilitate this bill through the House yesterday, and that didn't happen; that agreement was breached. And last evening, in trying to extract the report from the joint committee, I corresponded with Senator Wong, who was dealing with this. I said to her that I really don't want a fracture on the parliamentary joint committee, that I'd spoken to Pyne-our affectionate term for the Leader of the House-and I said, 'How about the committee signs off on the unanimous report tonight, we table the report tonight, you have the report and the amendments and we proceed first thing tomorrow?' and the response was, 'We'll work towards that.' So, the idea that somehow we're in breach of an agreement is totally false. This is a procedural effort to cause problems in another area of national security by procedurally jeopardising a national security bill, and we will not let that stand.",71
27,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," Regrettably, in the very short time the opposition has been provided with these amendments and the parliament has been provided with these amendments-they were first circulated to the parliament at 9.22 this morning, barely three hours ago, and there are 173 amendments covering some 50 pages-the government's contribution to this has been for the Prime Minister to give an intemperate and, frankly, ridiculous press conference rather than focusing on the fact that, despite the consensus report made by the 11 members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which recommended to the government that a large number of changes be made to the inadequate legislation brought to this place by the government, it's already apparent that the 173 amendments do not conform with the 17 recommendations of the intelligence committee in a number of important respects. I will just take some examples, although I'm not going to take up time going through the whole of the ways in which the 173 amendments don't conform to the committee's recommendations. Take recommendation 11 alone. That's a recommendation which makes it very clear, in very substantial detail, that the assessment of a technical capability notice-this is right at the core of contentious schedule 1 of the legislation-by a former judge and a technical expert is to be binding on the Attorney-General, and that both of them must be satisfied of certain matters. By contrast, the government's amendments only require the assessors to 'consider' certain matters rather than 'be satisfied of them', and only require the Attorney-General to 'have regard' to the assessors report rather than 'be binding' on the Attorney-General. This is a sharp and clear example of the government's failure to consider the recommendations or fulfil the recommendations. It's consistent with the sloppy approach that this government has taken pretty much to every national security bill. I see one of its authors, the former minister assisting the Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Hume, is in the chamber. The member for Hume is, of course, the minister who is responsible for the inadequate consultation on this bill, where",71
28,Mr Taylor,BILLS,I'm very proud of it.,71
29,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS,"He seems to think-he's interjecting now-that meeting with Apple is a sufficient form of consultation. The reality of this is that the member for Hume and the government didn't meet with the thousands of Australian smallto medium-sized businesses who are going to be affected by this bill. They should be ashamed of themselves for that alone. Committee recommendation 17 makes it very clear that the bill must be amended so that an agency cannot sidestep a warrant requirement by asking a provider to give voluntary technical assistance. That called for an  amendment to the bill. The government's 173 amendments, covering 50 pages, regrettably ignore this recommendation of the committee entirely. We're also concerned with the government's proposed definition of 'systemic weakness' and proposed definition of 'systemic vulnerability'. This, of course, is at the core of the committee's consideration. It's at the core of public concern about this bill. The government brought a bill that didn't even attempt to define 'systemic weakness' or 'systemic vulnerability'. What they've now done, in response to the committee's recommendation, is to includeas recommended-a definition of these two terms, but they're now using a definition that nobody can understand. They've used the term 'whole class of technology'. What does that mean? No ordinary person could understand it and no lawyer could understand it. Is new technology a class? Is old technology a class? We proposed a workable alternative to the government yesterday afternoon. Regrettably, the government hasn't responded, so we'll be moving amendments in the Senate-if this bill passes the Senate with these amendments-in order to ensure that the bill is fit for purpose and not the inadequate piece of legislation the government brought here.

30,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS," by leave-Back when Prime Minister, I used to observe that to live in Australia is to have won the lottery of life-and that's true, unless you happen to be one of those whose ancestors have been here for tens of thousands of years. That's the Australian paradox. Vast numbers of people from all around the world would literally risk death to be here, yet the First Australians often live in the conditions that people come to Australia to escape. We are the very best of countries, except for the people who were here first. And this gnaws away, a standing reproach to idealists and patriots of all stripes. As long as many Aboriginal people have Third World lives and are on average poorer, sicker and worse housed by a vast margin than the rest of us, we can indeed be, as we boast, the most successful immigrant society on earth-except, ahem, for those who have been here the longest. Why don't the objective outcomes for Aboriginal Australians match those of everyone else-and what can be done to close this gap? Amidst all the glittering successes of our nation, this is the one question that's haunted us, almost since the very first Australia Day; and always will, until it's fixed. You can appreciate, Mr Speaker, my reservations, then, when the Prime Minister asked me to be his special envoy for Indigenous affairs. How could a backbench MP make a difference in six months to a problem that had been intractable for 200 years? Yet perhaps someone who's been wrestling with this for a quarter century and may have spent more time in remote Australia than any other MP, except the few who actually live there-but isn't dealing with every lobby and vested interest, as the Prime Minister, the minister and the relevant local member invariably are-can bring fresh eyes to an old problem and perhaps distinguish the wood from the trees. Amidst all the generally depressing indicators on Indigenous Australia, this one does stand out: Indigenous people who do finish school and who do complete a degree have much the same employment outcomes and life expectancies as other comparable Australians. And it stands to reason that to have a decent life you've got to have a job; and to have a job you've got to have a reasonable education. As prime minister for Indigenous affairs, this, always, was my mantra: get the kids to school, get the adults to work, and make communities safe. So the Prime Minister and I soon agreed that, as special envoy, my task was to foster better remote school attendance and performance because this is our biggest single challenge. Around the country, school attendance is about 93 per cent. That's 93 per cent of enrolled students, on average, are there on any given day. But for Aboriginal kids, school attendance is just 83 per cent. In very remote schools-where the pupils are mostly Indigenous-attendance is only 75 per cent, and only 36 per cent of remote students are at school at least 90 per cent of the time, which is what educators think is needed for schooling to be effective. Not surprisingly, in remote schools, only 60 per cent of pupils are meeting even the national minimum standards for reading.  Now, it's not lack of money that's to blame. On average, spending on remote students is at least 50 per cent higher than in metropolitan schools. A key factor is the high turnover of teachers, who are often very inexperienced to start with. In the Northern Territory's remote schools, for instance, most teachers have less than five years experience, and the average length of stay in any one school is less than two years. Of course, every teacher in every school is making a difference. Even a transient teacher in a poorly attended school is better than leaving Aboriginal people without the means of becoming successful citizens in their own country. And even attending a struggling school is better than missing out on an education. Our challenge, though, as a government, as a parliament and, indeed, as a nation, is to do more to ensure that kids in remote schools are getting the very best possible education, because it's only once we're doing our job that we can expect parents to do theirs and send their children to school. Posing this simple question 'How do we get every child to go to school every day?' prompted one teacher, an elder, who had been at Galiwinku school since the 1970s, to sigh that she had been asked the same question for 40 years, and pretty obviously that's because after all that time the answer still eludes us. Yes, if there were more local jobs and a stronger local economy, if housing wasn't as overcrowded, if family trauma wasn't as prevalent and sorry business so frequent, if the sly grogging and the all-night parties stopped, if there were more Indigenous teachers and other successful role models, if pupils didn't have hearing problems or fetal alcohol syndrome and maybe if Indigenous recognition had taken place and land claims had been finalised, it might be easier. In their own way, these all feed into the issue; but, if we wait for everything to be fixed, little will ever be achieved. There are all sorts of reasons why a particular child might not be at school on any one day, but there is really nothing that can justify-as opposed, sometimes, to explain-the chronic nonattendance of so many remote Indigenous children. After this latest round of visits and discussions, I can readily understand the despondency which people in this field sometimes wrestle with; but there are more grounds for optimism and fewer reasons to be resigned to failure than ever before. Yes, some of the federal government's remote school attendance teams are a glorified bus service, but others are deeply imbedded in the school and in the community and can explain almost every absence. Yes, too many remote schools still have very high staff and principal turnover, but there are also hundreds of dedicated remote teachers who have made their work a calling or a mission rather than just a job or even a career. Yes, there have been plenty of policy flip-flops over the years as new governments and new ministers try to reinvent the wheel, but in most states and territories there are now 10-year strategies in place, with the stress on staff continuity, on closely monitoring every single pupil's progress and movement, on back-to-basics teaching, on community involvement and on getting mothers and their new babies straight into the school environmentstrategies, I'm pleased to say, that have outlived changes of government and minister. In other words, there is finally broad agreement on what needs to be done, at least for schools, and a collective official determination to see it through for the long term rather than be blown off course by each you-beaut new idea. In all the remote schools that I've just visited, culture is respected-and, in many of them, teaching is bilingual, at least in the early years-while teachers still strive to enable proud Indigenous people to flourish in the wider world, not just in the community they are born into. Many fret that progress is stalled or is even in reverse, because the world only changes for the better, person by person, school by school and community by community. At this level, there can often be two steps back for every step forward. But, while little ever improves as fast as we would like, it was gratifying to see that the Opal fuel, which I introduced as health minister, has all but eliminated petrol-sniffing in remote Australia. The larger communities of the APY Lands, with just one exception, now have what they all lacked a decade ago-the permanent police presence that I tried to achieve as the relevant federal minister. The lands are still off limits without a permit to most Australians, but at least Pukatja now has a roadhouse. And at least some remote community leaders haven't shirked the 'tough love' conversation that is needed with their own people and have accepted restrictions on how welfare can be spent with the debit card in Kununurra, Ceduna and Kalgoorlie, and the Family Responsibilities Commission in many of the communities of Cape York. On my most recent swing through remote schools, all classrooms, every one of them, were free of the defeated teachers, the structureless lessons and the distracted pupils that were all too prevalent some years back on my stints as a stand-in teacher's aide, even if actual attendance rates still left much to be desired. In all the bigger schools there is now the Clontarf 'no class, no footy' program for the boys and, increasingly, comparable girls' academies too. Who would have thought that Kununurra, Coen and Hopevale schools would have concert bands that any school could be proud of? In Coober Pedy I helped wrap books as gifts for the quite a few children who regularly attended school. In Aurukun I handed out satchels to the quite a few students going on excursion to the Gold Coast as a reward for being at school all the time.  I am much more confident than I expected to be that, left to their own devices, the states and territories will manage steady, if patchy, progress towards better attendance and better performance, but what will be harder to overcome, I suspect, is communities' propensity to find excuses for kids' absences and school systems' reluctance to tailor credentials and incentives for remote teachers. This is where the federal government could come into back strong, local Indigenous leadership ready to make more effort to get their kids to school and to back state and territory governments ready for further innovation to improve their remote schools. While all states and territories provide incentives and special benefits for remote teachers, sometimes, I regret to say, these work against long-term retention. In one state, for instance, the incentives cease once a teacher has been in a particular school for five years. In others a remote teaching stint means preferential access to moresought-after placements, so teachers invariably leave after doing the bare minimum to qualify. There should be special literacy and numeracy training, as well as cultural training, before teachers go to remote schools where English is often a second or third language, and there should be substantially higher pay in recognition of these extra professional challenges. Because it takes so long to gain families' trust, there should be substantial retention bonuses to keep teachers in particular remote locations. We need to attract and retain better teachers to remote schools and we need to empower remote community leadership that is ready to take more responsibility for what happens there. The objective is not to dictate to the states their decisions about teacher pay and staffing but to work with them so that whatever they do is more effective. It's not to impose new rules on remote communities but to work in partnership with local leaders who want change for the better. Where local leaders are prepared to accept measures that should create a better environment for school attendance, like the debit card or the Family Responsibilities Commission, the government should be ready to offer extra economic opportunities or better amenities. If local communities have a project, would like federal government support and are prepared to accept that with rights come responsibilities, they should make contact to explore what we might all do better. For instance, at Borroloola, when I wanted to talk school attendance, locals only wanted to talk housing. I well and truly got their point, once I had seen the near-shanties that people were living in. But new houses, I'm pleased to say, are now on their way. On future visits, no-one should have poor housing as an ongoing reason for kids missing school, because if government wants communities to lift their game, we have to be ready to lift ours, too. As the national government we should be prepared to make it easier for state and territory action to attract and retain better teachers and we should reinforce the self-evident maxim that every kid should go to school every day, not by taking away the responsibility of the states and territories for managing schools, not by imposing a punishment agenda, but by making good policy and strong local leadership more effective. After all, good government-certainly good, sensible, small-C conservative government-means a clear objective plus reasonable, doable means of moving towards it. As envoy my job is to make recommendations rather than decisions, but recommendations with a good chance of success because they are consistent with the government's values and policy direction. First, the government should work with the states and territories, whose responsibility it is to pay teachers, to increase substantially the salary supplements and the retention bonuses, if any, currently paid to teachers working in very remote areas. Obviously, that will cost money, and the government is working on that now. Second, and this is just a federal responsibility, the government should waive the HECS debt of teachers who, after two years of experience in other schools, teach in a very remote school and stay for four years. Third, communities ready to consider the cashless debit card or arrangements akin to it, in order to boost local pupils' capacity to attend school, should have fast-tracked Indigenous Advancement Strategy projects as a reciprocity measure. It would be a form of mutual obligation, if you like, between local communities and the national government. Fourth, the Remote School Attendance Strategy should be funded for a further four years, but with some refinements to obtain more local school 'buy-in' and better community 'intelligence' and to encourage more engagement with local housing authorities and police where needed. Fifth, the Good to Great Schools Program, which has reintroduced phonics and disciplined learning to quite a few remote schools, should be funded for a further year to enable further evaluation and emulation. And sixth, the government should match the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation's private and philanthropic funding on an ongoing basis. Officialdom never likes selective schemes that send people to elite schools, but this one is undoubtedly working to lift people's horizons, to open people's hearts and to create an Indigenous middle class with the kinds of networks that people in this parliament, for instance, can invariably take for granted.  These recommendations will now be considered through the government's usual policy processes. I look forward to ministers' announcements in due course and, in some cases, before Christmas. In every state and territory, it's compulsory for school-aged children to be enrolled and not to miss school without a good excuse. For a host of understandable reasons-such as schools' reluctance to be policemen, the disruption that unwilling students can create in class, the difficulty of holding parents responsible for teenagers' behaviour and the cost to family budgets-these truancy laws are rarely enforced, even though there should be direct consequences for bad behaviour and not just the long-term cost to society of people who can't readily prosper in the modern world. Most jurisdictions are once more ready to impose fines on consistently delinquent parents and guardians, but fines are often ineffective when jail is the only mechanism for making people pay. Hence my final recommendation is that all debts to government, including on-the-spot fines-and not just those to the Commonwealth-should be deductible from welfare payments. Finally, I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity he has given me. I thank the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and I thank the Minister for Education and Training, both of whom have magnanimously put up with an intruder on their patch. I thank the Prime Minister and cabinet staff who I've been working with in Canberra and the regional networks for the past three months. I thank the Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian education ministers and their officials, and Queensland officials, for their discussions and for facilitating community visits. In particular, I thank the schools and communities of Warruwi, Galiwinku, Nhulunbuy, Yirrkala, Borroloola, Koonibba, Yalata, Coober Pedy, Pukatja, Broome, Kununurra, Coen, Aurukun, Hope Vale, Palm Island and Cherbourg for making me welcome. Ms Burney: Borroloola didn't.",72
31,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS,"They will welcome me back a second time now that the housing is in the process of being fixed. However long my public life lasts, in government or out of it, in the parliament or out of it, I intend to persevere in this cause. Some missions, once accepted, can never really cease. Of course, the future for Aboriginal people lies much more in their own hands than in mine; but getting more of them to school and making their schooling more useful is a duty that government must not shirk. An ex-PM has just one unique trait and that's a very big megaphone that I will continue to use to see this done. This is my first statement to the parliament on remote school attendance and performance, but it certainly won't be my last word on this vital subject.",75
32,Ms BURNEY,STATEMENTS," by leave-I rise to make a statement on remote Indigenous education in response to the member for Warringah's statement. I acknowledge the member for Warringah's statement, the special envoy for First Nations people. I come to this statement with a wealth of experience in this area. I was a schoolteacher and one of the very early Aboriginal schoolteachers in New South Wales. I began teaching in 1979. I have spent a long time as an education bureaucrat and was responsible for bringing in, along with my colleagues, the first national Aboriginal education policy. My educational background gave me appointment to the reconciliation council. I have been an advocate in Aboriginal education. I have also been the director general of the Aboriginal affairs department in New South Wales. I know what I'm talking about. We know that, without a proper education, First Nations people will have poorer life outcomes, poorer health outcomes and poorer employment outcomes, and that applies to everyone across the community. We also know, which the member for Warringah didn't address, that the cycle of poverty is what grips so many Aboriginal communities. We know that, without decent housing, it is very difficult to have decent health. Without decent health it is very difficult to have a good educational experience. Without a good educational experience it is very difficult to have employment. And we know that many of the communities that the special envoy has referred to are communities that are gripped with poverty and very few entrepreneurial opportunities, and that's a very important aspect to understand. Education is critical to improving the lives of our First Nations people. We know from the latest Closing the gap report that that gap is still significant. Attendance rates for Indigenous students have been stable, at about 83 per cent, between 2014 and 2017. Things are not getting worse but they are also not getting better. The target of closing the school attendance gap between First Nations children and other students by 2018 will simply not be met, and that is on this government's watch. I listened carefully to the member for Warringah. He talked about the community but he did not talk about the system. There are many reasons why children are not going to school. Partly it is to do with the fact that the system does not cater for their needs and does not seem relevant. There is no point having a punitive approach to Aboriginal education and the participation rates of Aboriginal students. It is about what's going on, of course, in the community, and there needs to be a responsibility there, but there is also responsibility for what the system is  offering or not offering in many cases. In 2017 the overall attendance rates for Indigenous students nationally was 83.2 per cent compared with 93 per cent for the non-Indigenous students. What I disappointingly didn't hear from the member for Warringah was anything to do with early childhood education. We know that if a child gets a good start to a schooling experience where they enjoy it, where they develop a love of learning and where there is opportunity for early childhood education then that makes an enormous difference in terms of that child's journey through the education system. We didn't hear anything about the first thousand days of a child's life, the plasticity of a child's brain at that time and the importance of being born at a healthy birth weight. We didn't hear any of those other factors that need to be considered when we talk about children's participation in school. Indigenous attendance is lower in remote areas than non-remote areas, and the attendance gap remains larger in remote areas. I, with enormous grace, acknowledge the member for Warringah's work in this area, and I don't doubt his passion and his commitment for one second. I really and truly don't. But of course on this issue, as on many issues, the two of us do not see eye to eye, and we do not agree with all that he asserts in his statement, and it remains unclear what role the special envoy for Indigenous affairs actually entails. Top-down does not work. When are we going to learn? Ask the question: what about the system? Punitive approaches of docking welfare payments are not going to transfer automatically into children going to school. I'm not saying that some of the ideas the member for Warringah has put forward don't deserve consideration; they do. I particularly think the first two recommendations have some significance, and that was, of course, to do with working with states and territories to make it more attractive for people to teach in remote communitiesbut, more importantly, not just to teach but to actually stay in those remote communities for some time to have an effect. Some of the suggestions do have potential for further exploration, as I've said, including the retention of teachers. I also think there is something to be said about the HECS debt for teachers being waived. I do believe that special literacy and numeracy training as well as cultural training is important, but I don't think that we should conflate education with debit cards. I don't think we should conflate education with some of the direct instruction methods that the member has spoken about. Curriculum development, pedagogy, what's delivered and how it's delivered to First Nations children in remote communities are not a one-size cookie-cutter model. It needs to be designed with the community, it needs to be designed for the community and it needs to be very much an individual thing. Understanding what the historical context is in each community for the participation of people in the education system, we know that in the past the education system was complicit with the removal of children. We know that the experiences of many Aboriginal adults in the education system have been very poor. Those historical things are extremely important when it comes to the outcomes for First Nations children. But we must base this on culture. We must base this on experience. We must base what happens in schools on the needs of those students, not punitive measures, and these programs must have proper evaluation. Can I just say, in the few closing moments that I have: the member for Warringah points out some real issues that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government should recognise as being their responsibility. It was on their watch. We cannot rewrite history, but culpability does have to be understood. The government cut $500 million from Indigenous affairs, it closed remote communities and it has cut funding to remote housing. If a child does not have a decent home, there is no way they can have a decent future and a good educational outcome. Most particularly, though, the government has cut education funding to the states and territories, and this is important, having a direct impact on the delivery of education services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and the very subjects of the envoy's statement. This government's rejection of the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the proposal for a voice and constitutional reform looms large in the debate. The record of this government on Indigenous Affairs is appalling-simply appalling. The record of this government on education is also equally appalling. Before the 2013 election, the member for Warringah promised that there would be no cuts to education under his government. At the 2013 election, the Liberal Party put up corflutes on polling booths saying, 'Liberals will match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar.' That was a lie. In the infamous 2014 budget, the member for Warringah cut school funding by $30 billion. The worse affected schools were public schools, the schools which the vast majority of Indigenous children attend. This includes NT Catholic and independent schools, which will lose $35.9 million. Northern Territory government schools will lose $71 million of federal government funding over the next two years-2018 and 2019. But we hope this statement points to a new attitude towards this critical national project. It would be helpful if this government could respond to the interim reports to do with Indigenous education-The power of education: from surviving to thriving-produced in May and December 2017. That would be useful. As I said, we hope this statement does point to a new attitude. We look forward to hearing what the government is actually proposing to do in this area.  If we are afforded government at the May election, or the next federal election, it is our strong hope that, in the very near future, a new Labor government will be in a position to make a difference in this area. If we are afforded government, we will commit record funding to our nation's public schools, delivering more resources to every school-in particular, remote schools. We will roll out preschool for threeand four-year-olds around the country-revolutionary. Every child will have universal access. We will build our TAFE campuses and waive upfront fees for 100,000 students. We will uncap university places and we will invest in programs like Stars, which supports Aboriginal girls to stay at school. We support young First Nations girls staying at school, and boys as well. We will value indigeneity, and the funding in relation to domestic violence will not be reduced in these areas. This is a taste of what they Labor will do. Of course, there is much more to do, and we understand that. We will work in partnership with First Nations people. That is why our commitment to establishing a voice to parliament for First Nations people is so important. Only when we sit and listen to First Nations people can we truly find solutions to these very complex issues. We need a real sense of engaged collaborative partnerships with communities, of engaged parent and community groups being empowered to work with school communities to bridge the gap between home and school and between non-Aboriginal and Indigenous cultural norms and practices. It is First Nations people who will make the difference when we listen to First Nations people, where there is an equal sharing of power and authority, particularly in respect of education services in remote Australia. In closing, I thank the member for Warringah for his comments and for his considerations. But I can say with absolute certainty that I have never met a First Nations parent, or parents of First Nations children, who don't want a good educational outcome for their children, and they will do anything to attain it.",75

NA Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017 Consideration of Senate Message Message received from the Senate acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House. Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2018 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House declines to give the bill a second reading, and notes: (1) this unprecedented intervention into markets which will result in higher prices for families and businesses; (2) the Government has abandoned all pretence at being the party of free enterprise and open markets; and (3) the Government has abandoned all proper process, scrutiny and consultation.”",77
34,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,BILLS," The Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2018 would have to be the worse, shallowest, most ill-conceived piece of legislation that I have seen in the parliament in my time as a member. Given this government's track record, that is really saying something. This legislation is rushed. It has not been recommended by any parliamentary inquiry or external inquiry to the parliament, it has not been sought by the ACCC, it has been condemned by business groups across the spectrum in Australia, it won't work, it won't reduce electricity prices, it will see carbon emissions continue to rise in our economy, it won't support new investment and it is job-destroying That the question be now put.",77

36,Mr Burke,PAIRS,"No, Mr Speaker, leave is not given to consider the bill as a whole.",82
37,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Just before we proceed-I take that point from the Manager of Opposition Business, and he's entitled to move motions-there's a more fundamental point, though, and that is that the member for Kennedy is seeking to move some detailed amendments. They need to be circulated, and I haven't got a copy of them.",82
38,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,82
39,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"No, actually the standing orders are very clear that amendments need to be circulated and available to members, and it's a point, in fact, that the member for Grayndler made rather vigorously on another occasion. I just want to understand that",82
40,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,82
41,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"While you're agreeing with me, that's fine! I just want to make sure that there are sufficient copies at the table. Mr Katter interjecting",82
42,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,You don't need to stand; I'll call you in a second. I'm just trying to clarify something. UnderstandMr Katter interjecting,82
43,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Sure. It's obviously an issue with these amendments only just being tabled that it's important that the clerks have the opportunity to look at them and work out where they go sequentially. The Manager of Opposition Business has moved his motion. I don't feel that in good conscience we can proceed if we go down a wrong track with the bill with the amendments. What I'd suggest, if members are happy, just to give a little bit of time. I'm well within my rights to say I don't think there's been sufficient time, and they've only just been circulated. I first heard of their existence during the division. I could go through the House of Representatives Practice in arcane detail, and I could do that for several minutes. I just think it would be a better use of time if we moved to the 90-second statements, and that would mean that we would deal with it sufficiently. Is the Leader of the House happy with that course?  with the bill as one, as a whole, and therefore now, in consideration in detail, there would be this in-detail amendment from the member for Kennedy. Because, in this unprecedented way, Labor has refused to give leave to do that Mr Dreyfus interjecting",82
44,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I remind the member for Isaacs that he has already been warned today. The Manager of Opposition Business was heard in silence. So will the Leader of the House be.  when we get to it. The first clause is, of course, the opening statement of the bill-the title of the bill, in fact-and there will be other clauses which the amendment might impact upon.",82
45,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"That's right.  part of the whole. The opposition has just deliberately stopped this bill from being able to be debated, and I agree with you that your course of action to go to 90-second statements while the clerks go through that laborious process is the only alternative.",82
46,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"That's right. It's not up to me to comment on motions that are moved. Motions are entitled to be moved, but what's most important is that the House knows what it's considering and that the advice is properly there before the House.",82
47,Mr Katter,PAIRS,"A quick point of order to clarify the matter, Speaker",82
48,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,Yes.,82
49,Mr Katter,PAIRS,and I think it does need clarification,82
50,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,Yes. ,82
51,Mr Katter,PAIRS,"Everyone in this House, particularly on this side, is worried about the sale of government assets that will occur. The government has agreed that we will prevent the sale of government assets, so my amendment is about preventing the sale of government assets, which particularly appertains to the Snowy and to Queensland.",83
52,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I gave the member for Kennedy a chance to rise, given that he was moving the amendments. So I've set the course of action we're going to pursue. The reason for that is that the amendments hadn't been circulated in sufficient time for the due diligence that needs to be done, to be done. It's not proper, I don't think, for the member for Kennedy to start explaining his amendments prior to that work being done. Once that work has been done, he'll be able to do it. It being 1.30 pm, are there any members' statements? NA Ryan Electorate: Christmas Card Competition Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:30): At this special time of the year, I would like to thank the many students in Ryan who've contributed to the Christmas spirit. Ryan's annual Christmas Card Competition has recently been 'wrapped up'. We had hundreds of entries from all across the electorate, and I must say that the standard was of a very high quality. Congratulations to the aptly named Eliza Claus, Jack Cahill and Felicity Enever, who, along with the runners-up, will have their work distributed to more than 100,000 locals as part of my 2019 calendar. A special thankyou to the community judges, who had such a hard job choosing the winners. In recent weeks, my office has also been overwhelmed by Australian Defence Force Christmas cards creatively decorated by local school students. Christmas for our deployed troops is often one of the most difficult times of the year. They will be far from home without their families, and it's important they know that we are all thinking of them. Students showed their appreciation by sending handmade cards for deployed service men and women. It is delightful to see the children so excited to be involved and giving back to the community. I thank the students, parents and teachers for their participation and their role in spreading selflessness and positivity throughout the community at this time. Tasmania: Hospitals",83
53,Mr HART,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Overnight, we've seen the release of the Institute of Health and Welfare's annual hospital statistics, and they paint a disturbing picture for Tasmanian patients. One in 10 Tasmanians presenting to our emergency departments face a wait of nine hours and 41 minutes to be seen. It's the longest waiting time of any state. Last year, Tasmania's elective surgery waiting list grew by 2,385 people. At the same time, there were 1,623 fewer admissions from the list-a fall of 8.5 per cent. On average, Tasmanians needing vital cardiothoracic surgery are waiting 46 days-that is 20 days longer than any other state. One in 10 of these patients face a 138day waiting period-40 days longer than any other state. Tasmanians rightly expect that, when they get sick, they receive the best treatment possible, without facing lengthy waiting times. That's why, if elected, a federal Labor government will invest $30 million to address Tasmania's elective surgery backlog, delivering almost 3,000 extra procedures and boosting our health workforce. Whilst the Liberals keep cutting health, Tasmanians can be assured that Labor will put patients first and fix our hospitals. Telecommunications",83
54,Mr RAMSEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to say just how much I welcomed the tabling of the review into regional telecommunications a couple of days ago. It's a very fine body of work that recognises the good work that the government has done, particularly in the rollout of the mobile phone network. Over 840 base stations have been built as a result of that program. Of course, there is the continuous rollout of the NBN network. They do recommend increasing the satellite packages, the Sky Muster, which has already been done, but I'm hoping that there is more scope to do that in the future. I made the point at the release of the review that sometimes Australian agriculture farmers, in particular, are viewed with a hayseed behind their ear and the backside out of their pants. Modern agriculture is not like that at all. It is cutting edge. It's first rate. It's high technology. Some of the smartest people in the country are investing in this wonderful industry, which supports regional Australia, and they need the best tools. Some people need to monitor where their packages are on this earth for their marketing and for satellite guidance for precision agriculture within the paddock. All these things are giving great benefits to Australian agriculture and to regional Australia. That's why this government continues to invest strongly in that area. I keep lobbying the Prime Minister and others that we make an ongoing commitment to mobile phone infrastructure in Australia. That's what my people keep asking for. Queensland: Energy Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (13:34): I stand here today to fight against Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his LNP government, who want to sell Queensland energy assets. We have the former premier, Campbell Newman,  reincarnated as Prime Minister Scott Morrison. In yesterday's Courier-Mail it was revealed that the Morrison LNP government could force the sale of state-owned electricity generators. The direct quote from the Minister for Energy, Angus Taylor, was: The Queensland state-owned generators are on notice. If the LNP Morrison government want to make threats like that, then let me tell them: they are on notice for a huge fight. If the LNP want to start a war with Queensland, they have got one, because we are not going to sell our assets. Again, in question time yesterday Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to rule out introducing new laws that would allow for the forced privatisation of Queensland's energy generators. The Queensland government is reinvesting more than $1 billion a year of returns from energy assets into lower prices. These returns would go interstate or offshore if the power assets were sold by the LNP. For five years under this government there has been no national energy policy, and now the only energy policy that can be produced is to sell Queensland's assets-a typical response from the LNP: privatise and sell assets. This will only lead to higher electricity prices. It shows how clueless and out of touch the LNP are with Queensland. Queensland's assets are now under attack. I will vote tooth and nail against privatisation of our energy assets. (Time expired) Deakin Electorate: Roads",83
55,Mr SUKKAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," At the end of the year I think it's timely to reflect on some of the local projects that we are undertaking in Deakin. We recently upgraded Canterbury Road in Heathmont, with $1.2 million for safety upgrades that have been completed, and it's pleasing to see that that has finally been achieved. I spoke earlier in the week about our $8 million upgrade to the Maroondah Highway and Dorset Road intersection. That has progressed to phase 2. That is another effort from this government to improve traffic congestion in the eastern suburbs. A range of other road projects that we've undertaken have been finalised, including an upgrade to Oban Road of over $1 million, which residents are very pleased with. Also we are investing significantly into local community and sporting infrastructure. We've got upgrades being undertaken at the moment to Walker Park in Mitcham, a pavilion upgrade of over $3 million. We've got an upgrade to Benson Oval in Croydon, which is going to improve facilities for the new women's football team that will be playing out of Benson Oval. We've also got an upgrade to the Heathmont Football Club and Heathmont Cricket Club pavilion, complementing work that's already being undertaken at HE Parker Reserve with our new $17 million netball stadium, which will finally mean that instead of predominantly girls playing netball in the rain they'll be playing in a brand-new stadium come next year. Macarthur Electorate: Infrastructure",84
56,Dr FREELANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The people of my electorate of Macarthur deserve a fair go. They deserve a fair go for our schools and our hospitals and an easing of pressure on their family budgets. They deserve representatives who will stand up for workers, invest in cheaper and cleaner energy, and build a strong economy that works for all. Take the building of the vital rail infrastructure that's necessary to connect Macarthur to the new Western Sydney Airport. The Liberal government's City Deal is a heavily politicised travesty. It fails to deliver the infrastructure that we need for transport in Macarthur, in spite of massive development. Labor understands that this is an important aspect of development. There must be infrastructure that helps our commuters. That's why we have no less than $3 billion committed to begin the construction of this vital public transport infrastructure. The Liberal Party gives us a bus to take us from the new airport to Macarthur. Labor's also committed $12 million to provide upgrades to commuter car parking at Leppington Station and Campbelltown Station with the Daley New South Wales Labor team to secure more funding on these projects for further stations. We want to help people spend more time at home with their families and their children instead of travelling to work. Labor will also deliver $23 million in extra funding for public schools in Macarthur, because our schools deserve the best. Labor understands what families need to get on with their lives and to provide support for their kids for the future. Labor understands this; the Liberal Party doesn't. (Time expired) Bethania: Crematorium Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (13:39): At this time of year when we're looking forward to celebrating Christmas, sadly the community of Bethania in my electorate of Forde is less than pleased as they've seen the tasteless plans to build a crematorium on the doorstep of an aged-care facility this week given the green light by the Logan City Council. My thoughts are with the local community, which is home to young families, retirees, homeowners and businessowners who will be directly impacted by this decision. I also am concerned for the Palm Lake Care aged-care facility, located adjacent to the site, and the Bethania Lutheran primary school across the road, who are unequivocally opposed to this development.  I'm proud of the efforts of my local community-their tireless efforts and the way they've come together to write letters, sign petitions, host community meetings and fight for the place they all call home. Despite the community opposition and the calls for a more appropriate location to be found, the council voted to allow this crematorium to go ahead on the high street in Bethania. I thank the Bethania Residents Action Group for their hard work and, in particular, I want to thank the coordinator Diana Howes. I will continue to work together with the community to see if we can have this decision reversed. I call on the proponents of the project to withdraw their application and look for a more suitable location away from the local aged-care facilities in our community. Prostate Cancer",84
57,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed cancer for Australian men, with over 17,000 Aussie blokes being diagnosed each year. However, compared to other cancers, prostate cancer has a high survival rate, with approximately 95 per cent of men who are diagnosed surviving at least five years after that diagnosis. That's why it's absolutely crucial that men don't delay putting off going to see their GP, discussing their family history and other risk factors and, if appropriate, getting a prostate cancer check. I want to acknowledge the work of the Prostate Cancer Foundation and, in particular, the prostate cancer nurses. Their work is so important. While men are beating prostate cancer, we must also focus on ensuring that those survivors are living well. Men and families need to grapple with the long-lasting impacts on their physical and mental well-being of diagnosis and treatment. That's why the local prostate cancer support groups, such as Prosper in my electorate of Solomon run by Don Lockley, are so important. Well done to Don. I'll be popping into the Christmas party for the prostate cancer support group Prosper, in Darwin. But I say to everyone: have that conversation with your dad or your brother, whoever it may be. Have that chat. Have they had their check-up? Have they seen their GP? Taxation",85
58,Mr VASTA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Many of my constituents have shared with me their concerns about Labor's plan to abolish negative gearing and increase capital gains tax by 50 per cent, and they have every right to be worried. If Labor gets these policies through, they will hurt the people who own their own homes-over 35,000 households in Bonner-as their houses will be worth less. They will also hurt over 14,000 households in Bonner that rent. They will have to pay more to keep a roof over their heads. Then there are those who negatively gear. Over 9,000 households in Bonner use negative gearing. This is higher than the national average. The people who negatively gear their properties aren't millionaires like Labor wants you to believe. They're teachers, they're nurses, they're firefighters-they're people just trying to get ahead, and they stand to lose if Labor has its way. One of my constituents put it to me very well recently. He said: 'I distinctly remember Paul Keating having to eat humble pie and reverse his decision to stop negative gearing back in the eighties. People stopped buying investment properties. There were fewer houses to rent. Demand for rental houses exploded and rent went through the roof, so poorer people who rented got very badly hurt financially. The same thing will happen.' Now Labor wants to implement these policies that a growing list of experts warn will have a negative impact on the economy and property market. For the sake of my constituents and for the 1.3 million Australians who negatively gear their property, I hope Labor starts listening to these warnings and dumps this very big new property tax. Mayo, Dr Helen Mary",85
59,Ms SHARKIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," My heartfelt thanks goes to Dr Alistair Gratton for the gift of a sketch by Dr Helen Mayo, the namesake of my electorate. Mayo is one of the few electorates in the nation named after a woman, and Dr Mayo was an extraordinary woman. She was a reformer, a maternal and infant health educator and an activist. During the four decades of her influence on South Australia's medical profession, the infant mortality rate in my state fell by 60 per cent. Born in 1878, Dr Mayo was described as a progressive woman with forceful views. In 1902, she became the second woman to graduate with a degree in medicine from the University of Adelaide, and she enjoyed a stellar medical career. Her focus on health education led to the formation of the Mothers and Babies Health Association in South Australia and she also supported the kindergarten movement. In 1914, Dr Mayo became the first woman university councillor in Australia and she was founder of political and professional associations for women. As a South Australian, as a woman and as the federal member for Mayo, I am proud of the legacy of Dr Helen Mayo and what she has left our nation. I thank Dr Alistair Gratton for his treasured gift, and I thank the member for Indi for connecting me to Alistair Gratton. I will hang this sketch in my electorate office with pride. Wide Bay Electorate: Staff Mr LLEW O'BRIEN (Wide Bay) (13:45): This year has been a big year of achievements for Wide Bay. I've worked with local groups and businesses, and together we've chalked up some really big wins. These projects will  build safer roads, create jobs and improve services across Wide Bay. This year has also been a big year for the O'Brien family, with the arrival of our first grandchild, the amazingly beautiful and very kissable Penny. I thank my electorate staff for their work: Barbara Morris, who manages my diary; Rae Hurley; Barb Hannon and Vicki Kuhn, who help me look after Wide Bay's constituents; and Simon Kelly, who is always on the road with me and comes down to Canberra. They all do a great job. I welcome back Clementine Norton from maternity leave following the birth of her daughter Isolde. Liam Smith and Jack Carr have also been a big help to me in Parliament House this week. To the staff at Parliament House-attendants, cleaners, librarians, researchers, hospitality, security, 2020, FCM travel, COMCAR and shuttle services: thank you for all your help during the year. If you're travelling on our busy roads, please drive safely. To everyone in Wide Bay, my friends and my parliamentary colleagues, have a wonderful Christmas, and I wish you all the best for 2019. Summer Holidays",85
60,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," As parliament winds up for the year, as school students begin their holidays and Australians begin their holidays, I wish to pay tribute to and thank those who will volunteer their time over the course of these summer holidays to keep us Australians safe-in particular, our volunteer surf lifesavers, rural firefighters, volunteer firefighters and the SES, who give of their time, who spend time away from their families, just to keep us safe over the summer holidays. Australians love being around the water, and most holidays will involve going to the beach or one of our fantastic rivers and waterways. I say to the Australian people: please stay safe around the water this summer. If you're heading to the beach, make sure you swim at a patrolled beach. Please swim between the red and yellow flags and always obey the instructions of lifesavers. Don't let a trip to the beach this summer turn into a tragedy. Stay safe around the beach. I'd also like to pay tribute to those who will give of their time and work over these summer holidays-in particular the emergency services, police, firies and ambos who will keep us safe and those who work in our hospitals. Thank you for spending time away from your families to keep us safe during this summer period. Everyone, enjoy the summer holidays but please stay safe. Thank you again to our volunteers. Robertson Electorate: Australian Reptile Park Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (13:48): I rise to place on record my congratulations to the Australian Reptile Park, an outstanding local business in my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast. The Reptile Park is an iconic tourist attraction in our region and a big part of our history. Since 1958 it's been a major tourist attraction for our region. It welcomes thousands of visitors every year and employs 65 staff, as well as volunteers. When travelling along the M1-or the F3 as we all know it-who can miss Ploddy, the 55-year-old giant dinosaur replica, a constant reminder of the natural attractions and history of the place? A few weeks ago the Reptile Park was named 2018 New South Wales business of the year at the Business Chamber Awards from a pool of 172 finalists from 16 regions across the state. The Reptile Park also took home the excellence in business award. Tim Faulkner, director of the Australian Reptile Park, said, 'Being an Australian and a family-owned business makes receiving awards like this even better.' Tim said, 'It's wonderful to be able to share this with our staff and our visitors.' As we head into the summer holidays the Reptile Park has got plenty on offer for the whole family. There are loads of chances to experience all that the park has to offer. In a few short weeks the park will open its brand new exhibit, the dragon's lair, which will be home to some komodo dragons, as well as their Aussie bush wildlife sleep out in the New Year. To the whole team, congratulations on this special award. I can't wait to see what you achieve next. I look forward to coming and visiting with the kids over the holidays. (Time expired) Energy Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (13:50): What we've witnessed in this chamber today is an absolute abomination of process. This is why the people of this country have lost faith in this parliament. After five years this government has finally brought an energy bill to this parliament and has gagged debate without one opposition member being given the opportunity to speak to it. They gagged debate before the opposition could even get to its feet to speak on an energy policy that will affect 25 million Australians. It's an absolute abomination of process. It's a joke of a bill from a clown of a minister and a circus of a government. It's an absolute disgrace. It's taken them five years to get here, after multiple attempts at this bill, and they've absolutely failed at every step. What we're talking about here is an amendment before this House on this bill. This late amendment came in because of the concerns about privatisation of government assets. This amendment comes in at the last minute and the government says, 'This will save things.' This is the energy policy of the nation and you've put an amendment in at the last minute to say, 'There'll be no privatisation.' Tasmania has a hydro system that is government owned  and we want to keep it in government hands, and I think your promise not to privatise is as thin as the paper in my hand. Telecommunications Mr RICK WILSON (O'Connor) (13:51): Yesterday's release of the 2018 telecommunications review reinforces the government's strategy to invest in telecommunications to build stronger regional economies and help create jobs. The review put forward 10 recommendations to improve access to telecommunications infrastructure, ensure modern and appropriate consumer protections and promote digital inclusion. I'd like to thank the chair, Sean Edwards, and the committee for visiting Albany and Kalgoorlie in my electorate of O'Connor where access to reliable telecommunications services is vital for business, education and pleasure. In O'Connor there is a fantastic story to tell regarding telecommunications services, which have improved over the last five years. There are 85 new mobile phone towers, that's one in 10 of our Mobile Black Spot Program, that will be completed by June 2019 and the NBN is now 99 per cent completed across the electorate. Communities such as Kulin, Iluka and Scaddan, which prior to 2013 had no mobile phone coverage and expensive and unreliable internet options, now have access to reliable services for daily operations as well as emergencies. Recommendations of particular interest in O'Connor are the review of existing data limits for Sky Muster, with the aim of increasing them where possible; auditing the existing copper services in regional areas, including repair times and the impact of mass disruptions and penalties; and the independent measuring of the performance of fixed wireless and satellite NBN services in regional Australia. If I may thank and wish a- (Time expired) Coalition Government",86
61,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," There's a new saying in this parliament and it's 'never say never' with the member for Fadden back on the front bench again under the Morrison government, but already back in protection. In question time yesterday, we found out that this minister, the Assistant Treasurer, is pretty much responsible for very little. No-one could tell us yesterday in question time. We heard lots about what he wasn't responsible for but we didn't hear what he was responsible for. I don't think that's an accident, because the member for Fadden, it appears to me, is the minister responsible for payday lending. He's the most recent minister responsible for not bringing in the government's own draft legislation after the government's own review that sought to amend the way and to regulate the way the payday lending industry works. That review was worthwhile. This government's obstinate refusal to bring its own draft legislation into this parliament so that we can vote to protect vulnerable Australians is now in the hands of the member for Fadden, in his responsibilities. I would call on him. He's got a few hours left this afternoon. Perhaps he'd like to give us an opportunity to protect vulnerable Australians as we head into Christmas and they're getting ripped off by shonks in this industry that he is responsible for. Fahey, Dr Michael Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (13:55): Fulbright scholarships foster cross-cultural academic exchanges. They offer Australia's best minds the opportunity to travel to the United States for research collaboration, cultural understanding and the exchange of ideas to mutual benefit. The Goldstein community is proud of Brighton East's Dr Michael Fahey as a 2019 recipient. Dr Fahey is the head of paediatric neurology at Monash Children's Hospital and director of neurogenetics and paediatrics at Monash University. Neurogenetics is concerned with the link between our genes and the diseases and disorders of the nervous system. As part of his Fulbright program, he will spend three months next year working with some of the world's leading minds in genomics at the children's hospital of Arizona, focusing on helping people living with cerebral palsy. Dr Fahey is representative of thousands of people across the Goldstein electorate who do amazing things every day that make the strength of this country what it is, where individual people, families and communities come together to form a great nation through ingenuity, through enterprise and by standing up and taking responsibility to create a better world. So congratulations to you, Dr Fahey, and stay awesome. Prime Minister",87
62,Mr CHAMPION,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," What we have now is a scheming, plotting Prime Minister who came up through the middle after Mr Dutton failed to become Prime Minister. They axed Mr Turnbull, and what we've got is an accidental, scheming Prime Minister who can't stand the heat in this parliament and can't stand the heat in the electorate. How do we know this? We know he doesn't go very well in the electorate. We look at Longman and Braddon, those by-elections they were supposed to do so well in. We look at Wentworth, which they   Whether it was the baseball caps, the forced Aussie vernacular, drinking cans at the Caloundra races, or the daggy YouTube videos, people understood what the Prime Minister was trying to do but were worried about the execution. Too right they were worried about the execution! That's because it was hopeless-absolutely hopeless. What we've got is a Prime Minister who can't win in the electorate and is called out as the fraud he is in the electorate, and guess what: he can't win in this parliament either. The first couple of days he spent dealing with Turnbull. Then he rushed through rules changes. Then he put in a half-baked energy bill. Then we had partisanship on national security. Now we all know he faces losing the confidence of this House. (Time expired) La Trobe Electorate: Tour of Hope",87
63,Mr WOOD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to again find a solution to the youth crime surge in the electorate of La Trobe. Together with Pastor Larry Sebastian from Casey City Church and Mr Beram Kumar, chairman and CEO of Strategic Missions Partnership, I'm working with the Tour of Hope project, where Brazilian soccer players come out to help disadvantaged kids. I'm also working with Dr Thomas Edwards, director and co-founder of Natural Intelligence and former senior lecturer in psychology, and Dr Cosimo Chiera on the proposal to facilitate behaviour change in that high-risk group through the development of hope, as people with high levels of hope also tend to demonstrate increased levels of well-being. I've met with Brazilian soccer players, including world champion soccer players. They've come out to the electorate, including Paulo Sergio, a 1994 World Cup winner. They're so excited about helping young people in my electorate-in particular the Sudanese youth. Many of the Brazilian soccer players, I was told through their interpreters, had very tough childhoods, and all they want to do is give back to those who experienced the same problems. I'm working with Larry and Tom on a two-year proposal, and I very much want to thank Minister Paul Fletcher for the work he has done trying to obtain this funding. Immigration Detention Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) (13:59): A few moments ago the Prime Minister gave a press conference, which has been described by some as swinging between offensive and febrile. He has threatened to distort the processes of parliament because he does not agree with a private member's bill which would provide for the medical evacuation of children from Nauru. I'm not offended by the fact that over the last six months the Prime Minister has picked his own nickname, has changed everything from his signature to his footy team and sculls beer before lunchtime-I think this stuff is just silly, and I hope for the sake of the country he leaves this stuff behind and gets on with governing-but I am offended by the approach that he has taken to this issue, because it is completely contradictory to some of the things he said in the past. I believe the Prime Minister was sincere when he told a Lifeline conference that he got down on his knees and prayed for the future of those children on Nauru. I believe his sincerity",88
64,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I don't care what you believe; we're past two o'clock. In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Morrison Government",88
65,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, since deposing Malcolm Turnbull, he has lost Wentworth, his majority and the member for Chisholm; and ensured just 10 sitting days in the next eight months? Can the Prime Minister also confirm that earlier today he lost control of himself in delivering one of the most hysterical press conferences in Australian political history? Why isn't Malcolm Turnbull still Prime Minister? None of this happened under him.",88
66,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," When it comes to losing control, the Labor Party lost control of our borders and should be ashamed of it. National Security",88
67,Mr EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is also to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government has been able to implement strong policies that protect Australia's borders? What are the risks of failed, alternative approaches?",88
68,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. When members on this side of the House came into government in 2013 we confronted one of the most difficult policy challenges a government could face. Not only did we have to deal with the fiscal and financial wreckage that the Labor Party left us back in 2013 and not only did we have to deal with the carbon tax they promised not to introduce but then introduced in one of the greatest defiances of the Australian people we've seen in the lie they told to the Australian people prior to that election but we also had to deal with the carnage and horror of what the Labor Party allowed to happen on our borders and seas to our north, which should be to their eternal shame.  When we came to government we did what we said we would do. We said we would stop the boats and put an end to this horrific tragedy, and that is exactly what we did. Those opposite tried to stop us. The Labor Party mocked us. The Labor Party said it could never happen, that you could never implement the measures we said we could. We said three things. We said we would turn back boats where it was safe to do so, and we have. We said we would have offshore processing, and we were able to clean up the offshore processing mess that was left to us by the Labor Party-you never get someone to implement something they don't believe in, because they always stuff it up, and that is exactly what the Labor Party did when they were dragged kicking and screaming to introduce offshore processing. We have maintained that system over the last 5½ years. We said we would restore temporary protection visas, and we did. They are legislated, and the Labor Party wants to reverse them. They never learn the lessons from their failures, ever. It was in August of 2008 when the Labor Party-cocky, new in government, thinking that they knew everything and that there was no risk-decided to abolish temporary protection visas. They thought there'd be no consequences-50,000 people turned up on 800 boats, and 1,200 people, at least, died as a result of that decision. Now the Labor Party want to do it all over again. If they come back into government, cocky and arrogant as they are, they will do it all again. No. 1: they will abolish temporary protection visas. They've already proved it. Today they have made very clear that they will abolish offshore processing as we know it. It will all go. If anyone thinks that this weak Leader of the Opposition would turn a boat back where it was safe to do so, they're kidding themselves. He hasn't got the mettle for it. Energy",88
69,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that yesterday Queensland LNP leader Deb Frecklington said about the government's plans to force Queensland to privatise its electricity assets: 'The Prime Minister's plan is out of touch. Queenslanders want lower power prices, but they don't want asset sales'? Isn't the leader of the Prime Minister's Queensland party correct when she says that the Prime Minister's plans are completely 'out of touch'?",89
70,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition refers to the LNP leader in Queensland, Deb Frecklington. I'll share with the House her statement: LNP leader Deb Frecklington has welcomed confirmation that the federal government's legislation to prohibit misconduct in the energy sector will not allow Queensland's electricity assets to be sold. We welcome efforts to stamp out misconduct and ensure the lowest possible prices for consumers. Queenslanders want lower prices, but they don't want asset sales. Then-this is what is difficult for the Leader of the Opposition-Deb Frecklington said: Unfortunately, the Palaszczuk government has been using electricity as a secret tax for years. Labor is drunk on the revenue this secret tax generates and, according to its own budget, will rip off more than $8.5 billion from Queensland electricity customers over five years. So which side is the Leader of the Opposition on? On the side of Queensland consumers or on the side of Queensland energy companies and the state government? She goes on: Instead of lowering prices, the Palaszczuk Labor government is solely focused on profit maximisation and has allowed government-owned generators to abuse their market power and to price-gouge. And she goes on-and this is probably the most relevant statement for the Leader of the Opposition from Deb Frecklington: Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition's, reckless 45 per cent emissions reduction target will, according to Queensland Labor's own expert panel on renewable energy, cause the early closures of Queensland coal-fired power stations. So Deb Frecklington has a lot to say today. She says that the Leader of the Opposition is sending power prices up for Queenslanders. She says, about the blue-collar workers in Queensland at those coal-fired power stations, that Labor is selling them out. And she says she's on the side of the Liberal and National government at the federal level, doing everything they can to lower power prices. This legislation is a test. This legislation is a clear test of the Leader of the Opposition. Will he continue to be a proxy for big business and big energy companies, or will he join with us in stamping out misconduct and ensuring the lowest possible energy prices for Australian families and businesses? National Security",89
71,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how the government is acting to keep Australians safe from those seeking to do harm? What are the consequences of alternative approaches?,89
72,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and his service to Australia in the cause of national security, not just as a member of this place but as a policeman in Victoria who worked in the area of counterterrorism. He knows what he's talking about. That's why he's been so  pleased to be part of a government that is absolutely committed to keeping Australians safe and doing what is necessary in terms of legislative powers that support police, ASIO and other security agencies to ensure that terrorists, organised criminals, paedophiles and others are not able to exploit the weaknesses in our laws to get on with their evil business. We have brought legislation into this place to ensure that those agencies can get access to the encrypted communications of terrorists, paedophiles and organised criminals. We've been on this for months and months. It has gone through a committee process and, in this place today, the Labor Party are frustrating the passage of that bill through this place for one simple reason: to play political games in an effort to embarrass the government and undermine border protection laws in this country. Don't tell us that the Labor Party are in lock step with the government when it comes to national security. We're not in step; we're not even on the same page. The Labor Party, when it comes to national security, are very unwilling travellers. Our government will continue to focus on delivering the laws and the powers that will keep Australians safe, but, for the sake of a headline, for the sake of a vote in this place, to play tricky politics and for a TV grab, they are prepared to sell out national security. That is the character and the mettle of the leader of the Labor Party. He has been tested over the last 24 hours and he has been found wanting. I'm advised that 30 years ago was the last time that the opposition sought to go through a bill clause by clause. It's an old trick, but it's just as ugly, particularly when it's being used to delay important national security legislation which the Labor Party have had to be dragged to. They have had to be dragged to it when it has come, slowing down the divestment legislation as a political tactic to ensure that these other measures cannot be addressed. This is very disappointing. It is incredibly disappointing, but the Australian people know who they can trust when it comes to keeping them safe. It's the Liberal-National Party. The form of the Labor Party is too well known. Energy",89
73,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that yesterday the Queensland Premier slammed his plan to force Queensland to privatise its electricity assets, saying: If he wants to start a war with Queensland well he's got one because we are not selling our assets … … … … It just goes to show that they have no idea when it comes to a national energy policy. Isn't the Queensland Premier correct when she says that this government has no idea when it comes to national energy policy?",90
74,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," As the Prime Minister just said, Labor shamelessly and disgracefully today used a tactic to shut down debate on our legislation to prevent misconduct in the energy sector, a tactic that hasn't been used for 30 years. It was so long ago, but do you know what happened 30 years ago? Labor delivered a surplus. Thirty years ago, when Taylor Swift was born, was the last time Labor delivered a surplus. The reality is that we have legislation before the parliament which will deliver lower energy prices for Australian families, a more stable system and a better deal for businesses. The member for Hume and our government have been driving changes across the sector which have already seen some of the energy companies reduce their standing offers by 10 per cent, delivering major savings to businesses and to households. We saw the prices come down in Queensland and South Australia from July of this year. We've passed legislation through this House to abolish the limited merits review, which, if the Labor Party had done it when they were in government, would have saved consumers $6 billion. We've prevented the shortfalls in the domestic gas market that Labor set up when they ignored the warnings in their own energy paper back in 2012 and the warnings from AEMO. We, on the other hand, have ensured there is sufficient gas in the domestic market. We're putting in place storage and backup for more renewables that are coming online, and the Minister for Energy is working with his state counterparts to get a reliability guarantee put in place. When Labor were last in office, electricity prices doubled. When the Labor Party were in office in South Australia, they had a big experiment. We've seen in other states-like in Victoria, following the closure of Hazelwood-wholesale prices go up by more than 80 per cent. We saw the same thing happen in South Australia after the closure of Northern. This is a very serious matter. This is not a time to stand with the energy companies. This is the time to stand with Australian families and businesses. Indigenous Affairs",90
75,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, to our shame, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples remain one of the most incarcerated people in the world. Again this  year, the Closing the gap strategy report showed no improvement in the disadvantage experienced by First Australians. For over 200 years, non-Indigenous people have been writing policy and legislation, destroying the lives and culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and taking away their right to self determination, health, land rights, justice and sovereignty. We need to stop doing this now. Prime Minister, when will the government pursue substantial policy and legislative changes beyond constitutional recognition? When will you legislate a voice to parliament as outlined in the Statement from the Heart?",90
76,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. As he knows, the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition Relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples delivered their report, a bipartisan report, and I want to thank the chairs of that committee, the member for Berowra and Senator Dodson, for the work they have done, and other members who have taken a passionate and enthusiastic interest in the work of that committee. It was established in response to the Statement from the Heart and the Referendum Council report, and the main item the committee considered was the idea of a voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and a way for them to be consulted and engaged about the policies and laws that affect them at the local, regional and national level. After eight months of consultations, there were four major recommendations. Firstly, in order to design a voice that best meets the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the committee recommended a process of co-design between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and government be initiated in communities across Australia to design a voice that could help deliver practical outcomes. Secondly, the committee recommended that, following a successful co-design process, the parliament should consider the legislative, executive and constitutional options to establish such a voice. Thirdly, the committee heard that Australians have a desire to have a fuller understanding of the history of Australia, and the history, traditions and culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and the history of contact between black and white Australians. And, fourthly, the committee recommends the establishment in Canberra of a national resting place for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remains which could be a place of commemoration, healing and reflection. It's clear from this report that much more work needs to be done along the lines of what they've recommended regarding the voice proposal. We have always supported giving Indigenous people more of a say at a local level. We support the process of co-design of the voice because, if we are going to change the lives of Indigenous Australians on the ground, we need their buy-in on the matters and policies that affect them-and that includes the targets in things, like Closing the gap, that they should have a very strong say and a partnership in defining, and then having a participation role in having met them. So we support constitutional recognition but maintain our reservations about a voice. We prefer to establish local bodies in the first instance and then build on a successful model to inform a regional, and then a national, governance model. So this is a ground-up process. We thank the committee for their report and the bipartisan nature of the way they worked together, and the sincerity with which they've put forward their recommendations. We look forward to advancing those in the months ahead. National Security",91
77,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House how the government's strong border protection policies are helping us balance the budget and deliver a strong economy? Is the Treasurer aware of any weaker approaches that would result in budget blowouts?,91
78,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Bonner for his question. He knows-we know on this side of the House-that politics involves tough choices. Politics involves difficult decisions. And in politics, you can't just listen to the last commentator or the last critic. Sometimes, you really have to hold your line and stay the course. And nowhere is that clearer than in one of the most difficult issues to confront this parliament, which is around border protection, because in border protection you have to put in place policies that are a deterrent to the evil people-smugglers who prey on the most vulnerable in the community. And if you don't get it right, the consequences are terrible. People lose their lives at sea. People end up in detention. There is a budget blow-out. We all remember Kevin Rudd going to the Australian people in 2007, saying he was a big C economic conservative like John Howard, and he wouldn't touch the most successful border protection policies put in place by that government. But what happened over the subsequent years of the Labor government-or a Labor-Greens government-was that the border protection policies were unwound. Over 50,000 people arrived in over 800 boats. There were 1,200 deaths that we know of at sea. Over 8,000 children were in detention while Labor was in government. And in July 2013, there were 10,200 people in detention, including nearly 2,000 children. Seventeen detention centres had to be opened, and there was a budget blow-out of around $16 billion.  There is a stark contrast. I want to pay credit to the now prime minister and then border protection minister for the work that he did in stopping the boats, closing the detention centres, ensuring lives were not lost at sea, and that children were removed from detention. The benefit of these policies is that we restored order to our program and we increased our humanitarian program from 13,750 to 18,750 a year in 2018-19. And we've closed those detention centres, and we've won the respect of the Australian people for the strong policies that we've put in place, which have not only helped the budget but, most importantly, put an end to the business model of those people-smugglers and put an end to the tragic loss of life at sea. Energy",91
79,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister please tell the House which clause in his divestment legislation prevents the government from forcing states to privatise their electricity assets?,92
80,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The legislation makes very clear that, when there is a divestment of a government asset, it will go to another government entity. The member for Kennedy stood up in this parliament less than an hour ago and sought to move an amendment to make that abundantly clear.",92
81,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,92
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members will cease interjecting! The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.,92
83,Mr Shorten,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On direct relevance: it was a very specific question. I asked the Prime Minister and, as he has done all day, he has given his energy questions to the Treasurer, but the question was very clear. So, whoever in the government can answer it: what clause prohibits the privatisation of state electricity assets? It's a simple question. It's a clause. One clause. Any clause. Santa Clause!",92
84,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Section 4, schedule 1, item 1, page 25, lines 3 to 18 make it very clear that, if the body corporate is an authority of the Commonwealth or an authority of the state or territory, the court may order the body corporate to dispose of those interests in security or assets, and it goes on to another state authority. This is the amendment that the member for Kennedy was making clear: to avoid doubt, the court cannot make an order under subsection 3 for the body corporate to dispose of interests and securities or assets otherwise and in accordance with paragraph 3(a). The question really is for the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to listen to the member for Kennedy, to hear his amendment, to debate his amendment, to vote on his amendment, to support his amendment, which would make absolutely clear that government assets, if they were divested, would remain in government hands. The member for Hume knows this, the Prime Minister knows this and every member on this side of the House knows this, but we have to ask the question: why is the Leader of the Opposition covering up for the big energy companies? Why is the Leader of the Opposition refusing to stand with Australian families, Australian pensioners, Australian small-business people and indeed some of the large energy users in the steel sector, in the aluminium sector, in the paper sector and across the economy? Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition is turning his back on the Australian people? There must be a reason. There must be an answer. We need to know why. The Australian people at the next election will know there's a choice between a Liberal and National government that stands on the side of Australian families and businesses and lower power prices and a Labor Party that stands with the big energy companies and wants to see their power bills go only one way-up. (Time expired) National Security Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (14:25): My question is to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney-General please update the House on the importance of strong and consistent border protection measures? Is the Attorney-General aware of alternative approaches that would put Australia's strong borders at risk?  well aware that this government has turned back 33 boats, resulting in over 800 people being returned. On top of that, more than 2½ thousand people have been prevented from boarding leaky, dangerous vessels, run by people smugglers, which would otherwise have been bound for Australia. In total, Operation Sovereign Borders has disrupted 80 ventures and stopped more than 3,300 people arriving in Australia unlawfully. Preventing people from getting on those boats prevents men, women and children from drowning at sea. It is as simple as that. The fact is that the alternative was probably the greatest public policy failure in Australia's history. Under members opposite, 50,000 people arrived on over 800 boats; 8,000 children went into detention; and 1,200 men, women and children drowned at sea. Our approach-which was designed by the Prime Minister, which we have held fast to for five years and which has stopped the boats and saved lives-has always had as a central pillar the commitment to offshore processing. There is now, as we are all aware, a bill in the Senate that is designed to  weaken that central pillar of our successful border protection policy. I'd like to say two things to all members present with respect to that bill. The first is that people are already transferred to Australia where that is medically necessary and appropriate. That already happens. The practical effect of the legislation before the Senate is to achieve nothing more than to weaken our borders and send precisely the wrong message to the people smugglers and their potential victims, which causes the loss of life at sea. The second thing I say with respect to it is that, as Attorney-General and acting home affairs minister, I've offered briefings at the absolute highest level to all members of the crossbench. I thank crossbench members who've accepted those briefings, even when their ultimate view might differ from that of the government, but I must say to members who appear to commit to supporting a position which would weaken our borders on an issue as critical as this: to not accept those briefings-not hear from the people who understand all of the dimensions of this tragic problem and can say with authority, because they have been at the coalface of this problem, what the outcome of that bill in the Senate might mean-is unbelievably unwise, and I think their electorates deserve better than that. They must hear from the experts before they make that decision (Time expired) Energy",92
85,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to my last question and the subsequent answer. If the government legislation prohibits the privatisation of state electricity assets, why is the amendment from the member for Kennedy even necessary? Further, why is it that privatisation will be ruled out for the time being only because the member for Kennedy is now writing government energy policy?",93
86,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The real question is: why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition stand up for the consumers of Queensland? Why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition stand with us and the member for Kennedy and other members of the crossbench for this amendment, which will make it absolutely abundantly clear that when an asset is divested it cannot be privatised? And why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition stand up for the blue-collar workers, who he's said he represents, at the Tomago aluminium smelter and the paper manufacturers and the like? There are lots of questions, and those questions are to the Leader of the Opposition. He needs to stand up for energy consumers. National Security",93
87,Dr MCVEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. Will the minister update the House on why the government's strong border security policies have been so successful? Is the minister aware of any threats to the government's successful border security policies?",93
88,Mr COLEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Banks-Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (14:31): I thank the member for his question. We know that this government stopped the boats. We know that this government has closed 17 detention centres that were opened by those opposite. We know that this government has got 2,000 kids out of detention who were forcibly placed there by those opposite. And we know now that they want radical change to Australia's system of offshore processing and resettlement. We also know that what they proposed is not about children. There are 10 children on Nauru, four of whom will shortly resettle in the United States, leaving six children on Nauru. We know that it's not about medical transfers, because there is a process in place in relation to medical transfers, and it does allow a third-country transfer for medical attention on a temporary basis, and that has occurred more than 200 times in relation to children. What the opposition and the Greens propose is about ending regional processing and resettlement. That is fundamentally what it's about. The last time that happened, 50,000 people arrived unlawfully by sea and 1,200 people drowned at sea, including children. We'll never know how many, but we know that children drowned under the policies of those opposite. Today they go further with this proposed bill, which fundamentally will end regional processing and resettlement. It's very important that people understand how this bill operates. Under this bill, if a doctor on Nauru has assessed an individual and said that the person either is not sick or is capable of being attended to on Nauru, that is irrelevant if two doctors in, say, Hobart, via Skype, say that person should come to Australia for assessment. It's not required that those doctors say that the person is sick. It is merely required that two clinicians anywhere in Australia say that the person should come to Australia for assessment. It doesn't matter, under this bill, if the doctors on Nauru or Manus who have actually seen the person say that it is not appropriate or required. It is an absurd proposition. It will lead to the complete breakdown of Australia's system of offshore processing and resettlement. And it proves once again that the opposition fundamentally cannot be trusted on this issue. We know what happened last time.  Energy",93
89,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question's to the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister possibly expect Queenslanders to believe that he is not planning to force Queensland to privatise electricity assets when recommendation 2 of the government's own electricity report recommends that Queensland state-owned power stations should be sold off?,94
90,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," We've made it very clear that we don't support the privatisation of the Queensland assets. It's the Labor Party, who seem to be voting against the member for Kennedy's amendment to an important bill in this House, who would exactly do that. The ACCC has found that in Queensland, black coal generators have increased the price of some generation capacity despite no increase in fuel costs. This was likely due to a lack of competitive constraint and the highly concentrated market structure. The ACCC has found the Queensland government should take immediate steps to remedy the passed over investment of their network businesses in order to improve the affordability of the network. This would lead to savings for the consumers of Queensland by $110 a year. We know that it was a Labor government-back in Queensland in 2011, with the Bligh government-that saw the consolidation of three businesses into two in the energy generation assets. This concentration has elevated wholesale prices due to low competition. If anyone has a case to answer for the high prices in Queensland, it's Labor governments both past and present. We on this side of the House have been seeing energy prices come down as a result of the actions we have taken. We on this side of the House have put into this place a piece of legislation to hold the energy companies to account. Unfortunately, it's the Leader of the Opposition who turns his back on this debate and who has turned his back on the Australian people. National Security",94
91,Mr FALINSKI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister update the House on how government is supporting the work of the Australian Defence Force with strong and consistent border protection policies? Can the minister also tell the House what impact alternative approaches would have on the work of the ADF?  for his question. It's extremely unfortunate that the Labor Party is trashing our border protection and national security policies in order to win a cheap political stunt in the House of Representatives. That's exactly what we're seeing today. Labor have proven they are not fit to be in government, because they would rather have a cheap political win in the House of Representatives, in the Canberra bubble, than protect our borders and our national security and support our service men and women of the Australian Defence Force and, in particular, the Navy. That's where the Labor Party's leadership has taken the Labor Party at the end of the sitting year. It is absolutely disgraceful. Labor cannot remember back before 2013. As the Minister for Defence, I don't want the service men and women of the ADF, in particular the Navy, recovering the dead bodies, in the sea north of Australia, of people who paid people smugglers to come to this country on dangerous boats and vessels. Who can forget the work that the ADF had to do, during Labor's period in office, recovering bodies? Has the Labor Party forgotten the boat crashing on the rocks at Christmas Island? In December 2010, of the 92 people on board, 48 people died. How can Labor forget? In October 2001, there was SIEV X: over 350 people perished south of Java. The ADF and the Navy had to do this work of protecting our borders from people smugglers, and they had to do the work of cleaning up Labor's mess, literally, because of the deaths at sea. Because of the cheap political stunt that Labor wants to pull today to impress their friends in all sorts of parts of the Left agenda in this country, they are prepared to make our service men and the women of the ADF do that work again. It is disgraceful. As the Minister for Defence, I call on the Labor Party to see the error of their ways, to withdraw this threat in the Senate to use their numbers to damage our border protection policies and to dismantle offshore processing. That's what the Labor Party is doing; they are dismantling one of the three legs of the stool that has stopped people smugglers and their evil trade. Energy",94
92,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he promised that privatising New South Wales electricity assets would bring down power prices, but they went up and up? Can he confirm that now he's asking Australians to take him at his word when he says he won't force other states to privatise their electricity assets, which would further push up electricity prices? ",94
93,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The only electricity assets that the Commonwealth government has had a direct engagement with when I was Treasurer was that we arranged for the full purchase of the Snowy Hydro scheme. That was announced in the budget before last and executed in this budget. The form and track record of me as Prime Minister and Treasurer is actually to put those types of assets into public ownership. Asylum Seekers Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (14:40): My question is to the Minister for Defence representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on how the government is implementing strong border protection policies without affecting or impacting our foreign aid budget? How might a different approach undermine our foreign aid budget?  for his question. One of the extremely unfortunate impacts of the Labor Party dismantling the offshore processing system that has helped stop the people smugglers' evil trade is that the record that they had in government, not just in the unfortunate deaths at sea but in the massive budget blowout that will occur because they'll have to reopen the processing centres-we've closed 17 processing centres and we've stopped the billions of dollars being spent every year on the interdiction of boats and the settlement of asylum seekers. Because we've stopped Labor's policies we haven't had to spend that money on the response to people smuggling. When Labor was in power, of course they ran out of money. Because they didn't have the strength to recognise that sometimes governments have to make tough decisions, and because they didn't have the strength to really be in government, they oversaw 50,000 unauthorised arrivals on 800 boats, which was a disgraceful and failed policy. It cost other parts of the budget. As the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I should remind people-because Labor has obviously forgotten-that in 2012 the then Labor government diverted $375 million from the foreign aid budget to pay for the rising costs of food and housing for asylum seekers released into the community. Labor had to take $375 million from the foreign aid budget to pay for their failed border protection policy. They had taken over from the Howard government a policy that had stopped the boats in the Howard government. They then restarted the people smugglers' evil trade. The coalition was elected in 2013 and the current Prime Minister, as the minister at the time, stopped the boats with the policies that were necessary: turning back boats, offshore processing and temporary protection visas. Now the Labor Party wants to dismantle it all. The Labor Party wants to dismantle temporary protection visas. In fact the member for Braddon is nodding. The Labor Party wants to dismantle offshore processing. They want to dismantle temporary protection visas. If anybody believes this weak Leader of the Opposition, who can't even control his Left in the caucus, would turn back a boat, they're kidding themselves. If Labor wins next year, if the people choose Labor, you will have the boats starting again. The people smugglers will see the green light. The welcome mat will be put out to the people smugglers. A lot of the Labor Party members know it. They've gone along with these tactics as a cheap political stunt. All those Australians who support foreign aid and the foreign aid budget, like I do and the member for Goldstein does, get ready for Labor having to rob Peter to pay Paul if they get back into office and their policies are implemented again. Energy",95
94,Ms KEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that under his discredited forced divestment laws the government could force Tasmania to sell off its state owned electricity assets. When so many Tasmanians are already doing it tough, why does the Prime Minister want to make life even harder by privatising Tasmania's electricity assets, which will put up power prices?",95
95,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," If I were the member for Braddon, in Tasmania, and I wanted to stand up for the constituents of Braddon, do you know what I'd be doing? I'd be rejecting Labor's big new property tax, because Labor's big new property tax is going to hurt 3½ thousand people in the electorate of Braddon. Labor's big new retiree tax will hurt more than 3½ thousand people in the electorate of Braddon. I say to the member for Braddon, 'If you want to stand up for your constituents and if you want to stand up for the people of Tasmania, support us on this side of the House and our low-tax, high-growth agenda.' When it comes to energy, no side of politics has put more investment into Tasmania than the Liberal-National government. We support pumped hydro facilities across your state. We support another interconnector from your state to the mainland. We support renewable energy projects, wind projects, across your state of Tasmania. What we are doing is opening up new opportunities for energy users and for energy producers across the state of Tasmania. The real question for the member for Braddon is: what problem does she have with a piece of legislation that could potentially force a divestment of an asset as a last resort if the conduct of the company is dishonest, in bad  faith, fraudulent for the purpose of manipulating prices, and the divestiture order made by a court is proportionate and targeted to the conduct? What's wrong with that? I say to the people of Tasmania: no government assets will be privatised in the state of Tasmania. I also say to the people of Tasmania that we are standing with you to deliver lower energy prices. We want to see families in the electorates of Braddon and Denison, and families right across the electorates of Tasmania, benefit from the policies, the ideas and the projects of a Liberal-National government, which are only designed to do one thing: send prices lower for Australian families and Australian businesses. Pensions and Benefits",95
96,Ms FLINT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Families and Social Services. Would the minister update the House on how the government is able to support Australians in need through a strong social security system? What impact would a different approach have on the social security system that Australians rely on?,96
97,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Boothby for her question. She's a strong champion for those Australians who need the support of our social security system in her own electorate, where 17,957 rely on the age pension, 3,963 rely on the disability support pension and 3,547 rely on Newstart. All of that is delivered through spending $176 billion on social security and welfare. In fact, it's a number that's risen from $132 billion in the last full financial year that Labor had responsibility for these matters, and we've done that while moving the budget towards balance and surplus. That is good financial management. We've got the social security system back to a sustainable position. Under the previous government it was growing in expenditure at roughly twice the rate that government revenues were growing at. That is unsustainable and we've fixed that through basic managerial disciplines-for example, setting out a plan, executing against the plan and capably and competently managing money. That is something that Labor has a proven record of being hopeless at. It is no surprise that-when you gather together those chosen for their skills such as union officials, their core skill is shaking down money from business, like the donation from Unibilt to the Leader of the Opposition's campaign; when you gather together people whose core skill and background is being student activists, they're good at holding protests and waving signs; or, when you gather together people whose core skill is being a social justice warrior, they're good at showing you how many coloured bracelets they have on their wrists to show you how caring they are-people like this are not actually very good at management. That's why the budget blew out by $16 billion on the cost of detention centres when this hopeless rabble were in control, supposedly, of the budget. The key point is that that is $16 billion which is not available to support vulnerable Australians, which is not available to support older Australians with the age pension, which is not available to support Australians with disability-because they've lost control of their expenditure. Yet Labor today is going right back to their core beliefs, their mismanagement of border protection. They're going to vote with the Greens to go back to ending offshore protection. That's what they want to do and that is terrible news. It's terrible news for Australians who want secure borders. It's terrible news for vulnerable Australians because it means less money will be available to support them. And it's terrible news for the people who invariably, tragically, are going to end up as the innocent victims of people smugglers, and people will lose their lives as a result. Energy",96
98,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his previous answer to the member for Sydney. If he and his government do not support electricity privatisation, why did the Prime Minister sign off on this agreement with Gladys Berejiklian for the privatisation of New South Wales electricity and poles on 3 May 2016?",96
99,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," That was a decision of the New South Wales government that was taken after an election, where they went to the people of New South Wales. That was their policy measure, their initiative. It was also part of the asset recycling program. As a result, when you go to New South Wales these days, you'll see infrastructure getting built, you'll see an economy which is humming along, you'll see surpluses, you'll see a state government that is delivering important services for the people of New South Wales. In New South Wales they have a government that understands that having a strong economy means you can pay for hospitals, you can pay for schools and you can pay for essential services. If you go to Queensland and you're looking for all that earthmoving equipment and all that infrastructure-building equipment, you've got to look further down the coast because it's all down in New South Wales. That's because there's a state government in New South Wales which is getting on with the job of delivering important infrastructure for the people of New South Wales. I commend the New South Wales government for the economic management and leadership that  they've been providing for the people of New South Wales. As a citizen of New South Wales, I'm very pleased to be living in a state that is going ahead and doing well.",96

101,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House on how quickly people smugglers can respond to any changes in border protection policy, and also can he advise the House if there are any risks in this regard?",97
102,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The member for Menzies, as a former immigration minister himself, is very aware of the threats that come from people smugglers who seek to take advantage of Australia. He would know, like I know and like the Minister for Home Affairs, who is not with us here today, knows, that there are 14,000 people currently in Indonesia waiting to get on a boat. They are ready and waiting. And they're waiting for one thing: they are waiting for the Leader of the Opposition to become Prime Minister of this country. That's what they're waiting for-for the leader of the Labor Party to become the Prime Minister of Australia so it's game on in Indonesia for people smuggling. They know-because it happened back in 2007-the form of the Labor Party. They know that, if they can get Labor policy back on the books of the Australian government, there are 14,000 people who will be ready and waiting to jump on a boat and pay the money-and the people smugglers know this too. Under our policies, there used to be a people smuggler who used to run a pretty good business. He's driving a cab in Jakarta now because he's got no people-smuggling business because we put him out of business. We put people smugglers out of business right across Indonesia and all the way up through the people-smuggling chain. We've pursued them and we've had them prosecuted; we've worked with the Indonesian government to do all those things because we know that this business could revive instantaneously. These networks can be revived and re-established. That is why it is just beyond belief that the Labor Party, who were so malevolently negligent when they were in government when it came to their failures on border protection, would now, as part of some sort of cheap political pointscoring in this chamber, seek to put all of that at risk and to provide support for the dismantling of offshore processing in this country; it is truly extraordinary. But the people smugglers know it; they know the mettle of the Leader of the Labor Party. They know the Labor Party. The Labor Party is the best friend that people smugglers have ever had. When we talk about busting their business model, these characters would be eligible for membership of the board of directors of them because of the way they have contributed to their business model as people smugglers in the past. We don't want to go back to 8,000 children in detention. We got all the children out of detention and, as Prime Minister in the last three months, I've got 100 children off Nauru, down to the levels that the minister for immigration has outlined. We don't want to see 10,000 people go back into detention. We don't want to see 18 detention centres open again. We stopped the boats; we'll keep them stopped. Those opposite will let it rip.

103,Dr ALY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, under his discredited forced divestment laws, the government could force Western Australia to privatise its state owned electricity assets? Why does the Prime Minister want to make it even harder for Western Australians to make ends meet by forcing WA to sell off its electricity assets, which will make electricity even more expensive?",97
104,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I can tell the member for Cowan that in Western Australia no government assets will be privatised under this legislation because, under this legislation, if there is a divestment at last resort of a government asset then it goes to another government entity. But I can say to the member for Cowan: if you want to do something for the people of her electorate and make their lives better off, then stand up to the Leader of the Opposition and his big new property tax, because there are 9,443 people in the electorate of Cowan who are going to be worse off as a result of Labor's policy. And what about Labor's big new retirees tax? What about that? In the electorate of Cowan, there are 3,173 people who will be worse off at the next election as a result of Labor proposing a big new retirees tax. The hyperbole of the member for MCMahon in this debate was very, very funny, because the other day on divestment he got up in the parliament and he started saying, 'I'm going to have to write to the government of Venezuela about this legislation.' I thought to myself: 'Venezuela-the Labor Party. The Labor Party and their union friends-they've already got the Venezuelan government as a penpal.' I discovered a letter from the  CFMEU to the government of Venezuela and it's titled 'Comrade Daniel'. Let's remember: the Venezuelan election was described by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as 'not in any way fulfilling minimal conditions for free and credible elections'. But what did the CFMEU say to the government of Venezuela about their elections? 'It's with great satisfaction that we've received reports of your successful presidential elections. We've observed the electoral process and we're satisfied with the transparency and the broad participation of its citizens.' There we have it-the CFMEU, known for its transparency and its adherence to the rule of law, praising the government of Venezuela and their elections for their transparency and adherence to the rule of law.

The reality is that our exposure is through the support that we have been providing in a technology-agnostic way to new projects across the country, which have seen, as the member for Hume and the Minister for Energy have said, a pipeline of $15 billion of renewable energy projects being committed across the country. Our focus is on lower energy prices. If the member for Melbourne supported consumers, families and businesses in his electorate, he would stop with the antics in this place and get behind our legislation. NA Energy",98
116,Mr BOWEN,MOTIONS," I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for MCMahon from moving the following motion immediatelyThat the House: (1) notes: (a) the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Governments have failed to provide a consistent energy policy for Australia; (b) that the Government has embraced respectively, before each policy was abandoned: (i) an emissions intensity scheme; (ii) a clean energy target; (iii) at least six different versions of the national energy guarantee; and (iv) three different versions of divestment just this week, (c) the Government's most recent attempt at forced divestment policy has been panned by experts as increasing sovereign risk, chilling investment and putting upward pressure on power prices; (d) that the divestment policy had to be completely rewritten to remove the power to order divestiture from the Treasurer to the courts; (e) that the legislation tabled by the Treasurer yesterday allows for the privatisation of energy assets if divestiture is forced in relation to a government owned asset; (f) that the Treasurer and other Government ministers have continually denied this is the case despite the legislation being clear on this point;  (g) that the Member for Kennedy has moved an amendment, seconded by the Member for Dawson, which seeks to ban privatisations as part of a divestiture process, which confirms that the current bill does not; and (2) condemns the Government for their complete failure in energy policy, their botched divestiture policy and for seeking privatisation by stealth. There has been a lot of intemperate language in the House and in the building today from the Prime Minister. We heard of 'clear and present danger'-he swallowed one too many Tom Clancy novels-in a very un-primeministerial and unedifying performance from the incumbent in the job, but what we actually see here is what happens when a government's policy agenda falls apart before our very eyes. Nowhere is this more evident and more important for the economy and for households than in this government's complete failure when it comes to energy policy. This is a government which has had so many energy policies that the House would be forgiven for forgetting just how hopeless it has been when it comes to stability and certainty in energy. The now Treasurer, when he was Minister for the Environment and Energy, had an emissions intensity scheme as his policy. The House would be forgiven for forgetting that, because it lasted less than 24 hours before the extreme right-wing, climate-change deniers opposite killed the then energy minister's policy. Then the Chief Scientist recommended the clean energy target. That lasted a couple of weeks-relative longevity as an energy policy for the government-before it was destroyed. Then we had the National Energy Guarantee, which was personally designed by the now Prime Minister and the now Treasurer. The National Energy Guarantee was personally designed by them and redesigned by them. We had four versions in 14 days of the National Energy Guarantee. Now, to make up for their lack of policy, we have the made-up policy of divestiture. It is poorly designed, poorly implemented policy on the run. It has had three versions already and it's a week old. We had the version where the Treasurer would be able to force divestiture of energy assets. We had the version where the Treasurer wouldn't have the power to force diversion of energy assets; the courts would. And now we have version 3, which the government seemingly embraced during question time, which embraces an amendment moved by the members for Kennedy and Dawson. So, clearly, the legislation allows for privatisation. You shouldn't need to be a Rhodes scholar to know that it allows privatisation. The members for Kennedy and Dawson could work it out, but the Minister for Energy and the Treasurer couldn't work it out. Why would the Australian people be concerned about privatisation under this? Because the government believes in it. The now Prime Minister himself said: 'privatisation of the New South Wales electricity network will place downward pressure on electricity prices'. He believes in it. The Treasurer's alibi here is that the legislation allows for a government entity to be disposed of to another government entity. Who is going to buy these assets whose divestiture is being forced? Is the Queensland government going to sell it to itself? Are they going sell it to Tuvalu maybe-or Morocco or Tunisia? Which government owned entity is going to buy the asset which they are being forced to divest themselves of? Are the people of New South Wales expected to buy the Queensland assets when they're being privatised in New South Wales? This is absurd policy on the run from the Treasurer and he should have the gumption to admit he's got this wrong. He should have the gumption to admit he's had to rewrite his policy and he should have the gumption to admit that his policy will put upward pressure on energy prices. The Minister for Energy says that this side of the House voted nine times for higher energy prices. I'll tell you what we voted nine times for: good policy. I'll tell you what we voted nine times against: sovereign risk. We voted nine times against a policy which would chill investment in this country. The Treasurer talks about Venezuela. If he wants to talk about Venezuela, he needs to go no further than the nearest mirror. That's where he needs to go if he wants to talk about Venezuela, because he'd see the policies of a country which does not believe in stable policymaking but which does believe in sovereign risk. The words 'sovereign risk' should not be uttered about Australia. It should be the first responsibility of the Treasurer of Australia to ensure that the words 'sovereign risk' are not uttered in relation to us. On this Treasurer's watch he is introducing sovereign risk in a way which is extremely dangerous for the Australian economy. What this Treasurer and this government have done is unite energy consumers and energy producers in one view. The energy consumers and the energy producers released a joint statement, together with the leaders of the business community, earlier in the week saying that this is bad policy which will make electricity more expensive. You'd think that, if the energy consumers thought that this was a good idea and it was going to reduce power prices, they wouldn't have signed on to that statement. Well, they did. It's there for all to see. The energy consumers have united with the energy producers. Well done, Treasurer! You've managed to bring Australia together and unite the producers and the consumers in opposition to your policy. That's what the government has managed to do. It takes an effort, it takes some doing, but they've managed to do it. That's what happens when you have such bad policy being implemented by this government.  You have the opportunity for the privatisation of assets. You have that being facilitated by this government. If they really didn't believe in the privatisation of assets, if they had had the chance to make sure that the legislation was crystal clear on that point, maybe if they'd spent more time getting it right-if that's their real view and not their secret view-maybe they would have spent time referring it to an inquiry, having draft legislation, showing it to the states, showing it to the industry and showing it to experts. No state saw this legislation before the Treasurer introduced it yesterday. No industry players saw the legislation. It was introduced confidentially and not released for draft exposure. The Liberal and National Party rooms did not see that legislation. I doubt that cabinet saw the legislation before the Treasurer introduced it. This is what this government has become. We have reached the nadir of policymaking on this Prime Minister's watch, the nadir of policymaking of this once great party that once believed in sound economic policy, that once eschewed sovereign risk, that once believed in investment certainty and that once consulted with industry and with consumer groups before embarking on such a policy. This government has lurched from crisis to crisis in energy. It has destroyed one Prime Minister so far and it should destroy this Prime Minister today. We'll talk of clear and present danger if you really want to. This Prime Minister is a clear and present danger to electricity prices, if that's the language he wants to use. The nation has been subjected, on their watch, to the most un-prime-ministerial Prime Minister we have seen since Billy MCMahon. He is the most un-prime-ministerial Prime Minister we could imagine-a man who will always see the politics in any issue. You can take the member for Cook out of the role of state director of the Liberal Party, but you can't take the state director of the Liberal Party out of him. He will always find the cheap political stunt, he will always find the slogan and he will always find the cheap policy. Where we have divestment, a policy which stands against everything the Liberal Party once believed in, and a policy which stands against everything that political and economic conservatives in this country once advocated, we know that this Prime Minister has jumped the shark. He's finally jumped the shark when it comes to economic credibility. Former Liberal leaders will be hanging their heads in shame. John Howard and Peter Costello will be hanging their heads in shame that a government has been reduced to forcing electricity companies to divest their assets if the government is not happy with the way they conduct themselves. There's a better way. There's a better way than this and it's policy, stability and certainty under a Shorten Labor government. If you're so certain, call an election and we'll bring it on. The SPEAKER (15:14): Is the motion seconded?",98
117,Mr BUTLER,MOTIONS," It is. A very serious energy crisis has emerged under this government, an energy crisis that is crippling household budgets, that is seriously threatening the viability of businesses and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country and a crisis that is seriously damaging Australia's reputation as a sound destination for investment either in energy or in energy-using manufacturing across the globe. In response to this crisis this government has now reached its 10th energy policy in just this parliament-its 10th energy policy since the 2016 election and it still hasn't been able to land a single one of them. The emissions intensity scheme, which my colleague the shadow Treasurer spoke about a little earlier, was a policy that had the support of every single business group in the country and every single state governmentLabor and Liberal alike-in the country. The National Farmers' Federation supported it. As the Deputy Prime Minister will remember very well, I'm sure, the Young Nationals annual conference supported the emissions intensity scheme. It was extraordinary consensus, yet after one radio interview that the Treasurer did with Fran Kelly in late 2016 it was smashed by a veto led by the member for Warringah. The then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, tried again. He asked the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to come up with an alternative, and he did-a clean energy target. The story's rather familiar. Every single business group in the country supported it. Every state government, Labor and Liberal alike, supported it. Federal Labor said we could work with it. I'm not sure about the position of the Young Nationals-the Deputy Prime Minister might inform us-but they seemed to take a pretty constructive view about energy policy. The National Farmers' Federation supported it. Again there was a veto led by the member for Warringah-sorry, I forgot to mention the member for Hughes-and many others on the hard Right of the Liberal Party to smash yet another attempt to gain consensus to solve to energy crisis that has emerged under this government. In response to that we had the National Energy Guarantee. There were two versions of that, and four versions in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership. In just 14 days there were four versions of the National Energy Guarantee added to the original two. You have to admire maybe not their views on energy policy and climate change but the assiduous way in which the member for Warringah, the member for Hughes and the  member for Hume-now the energy minister-have gone about demolishing every attempt at energy policy consensus in this country. In some exquisite irony, the new Prime Minister gave the member for Hume, the chief spear thrower against the National Energy Guarantee, the portfolio. The dog that caught the car was finally given a chance to work on a solution to this energy crisis. Just like the proverbial dog, he's been left utterly bereft of any ideas. He had one idea: throw billions of dollars of taxpayer funds at building new coal-fired power stations, and maybe even indemnify the operators of such power stations for any future carbon risk. Now, trying to find an operator to do that would be pretty difficult. The only business figure who has indicated any interest in partnering with this government on building a new coal-fired power station is of course Clive Palmer, whose last great idea was building Titanic II. The Australian Industry Group has estimated that indemnifying just one coal-fired power station would cost taxpayers $17 billion. Added to that brilliant exercise in fiscal recklessness, this government has come up with the idea of divestiture, a Venezuelan-inspired act of neo-Marxism the likes of which are difficult to find in the 21st century-but they've found it. And who supported this? You'd think that if this were in the interests of consumers then the consumer watchdog might have come up with the idea after an exhaustive inquiry into the electricity industry over 18 to 24 months. But they considered it and they explicitly rejected it as an extreme measure. You'd think that, if this were a measure that would cut power bills, maybe business groups that use lots of energy would support it. But, to a group, they have said over the past couple of weeks that this is a deep and real sovereign risk that will impact the Australian economy and simply force prices up. The government haven't asked anyone else. They didn't ask any of the state governments, and we learned earlier this week why they didn't ask the state governments. It was because a more sinister purpose behind this legislation became clear from the energy minister: it was about continuing their 25-year exercise in selling off-in privatising-the people's electricity assets. They did it in Victoria. They did it in South Australia. They did it with the support of the now Prime Minister in New South Wales, and they had Queensland, Tasmania, WA, Snowy Hydro and the Northern Territory in their sights. It took the member for Kennedy to fix the government's mess. (Time expired)  political stunt'. That is like Darth Vader giving a parenting class-having them accuse anyone in this place of a cheap political stunt. Let's work out why they are trying to suspend standing orders at exactly the time that they did, during question time. It is because they did not want to face another question on border protection. There is a stunt going on, and it is one that they've orchestrated in the other place. There'll be a price for that stunt, and it won't be cheap. That's why they are here now trying to divert attention away from the fact that their own stunt is blowing up in their face. Every Australian is being reminded of the absolute diabolical tragedy that occurred under their watch, under their policies. And what's the stunt that's going on? They are up there now trying to have a home affairs bill, in the portfolio of which I have stewardship at the moment-polluted with amendments that relate to medical transfer from Nauru-brought back down to this House. Why are they doing that? To try to cause some modest procedural embarrassment to the government. What's the price of that? The price of that is to fundamentally destroy one of the three central pillars of a policy that has stopped children drowning at sea. That's why they're quiet now, that's why they were quiet in question time and that's why they've moved this suspension of standing orders motion-so they wouldn't have to hear it anymore. Well, they're going to hear it a little bit more. And let's talk about what an utter and diabolical disaster their policy was. There's a place in WA called Geraldton, 2½ thousand kilometres from Christmas Island. On 10 April 2013, 2½ thousand kilometres from Christmas Island and in fact not very far from Perth-a holiday destination for people who live in Perth-would you believe the surprise of the people in Geraldton who were having cups of tea, literally, at the cafe when they looked up and saw an asylum-seeker vessel with 66 men, women and children arrive at the doorstep of Geraldton? And do you know what? They were the lucky ones, because they made it here. They also, of course, ended up in detention, including the children, but there were so many who drowned at sea. That's why we've got this stunt. That's why we've had stunts all week-because it's blown up in their faces. Bring your bill back down here. Let's talk about it. Let's debate it. Let's remind every Australian what it is that you did, what it is that you were responsible for. Because if you support and align with the crossbench, if you do that to revert to the policies that you had, the inevitable result is drownings at sea. We will never, ever let that happen again. Do you know what happened when that boat arrived at Geraldton? The member was the minister. The home affairs minister at the time released a press release. Do you know what it said? He said that they would respond to the arrival. Well, thank you very much. Everyone must have been breathing a sigh of relief. They would respond to the arrival of 66  people-the lucky ones who made it; the lucky ones who ended up in detention; the children that ended up in detention, 8,000 of them. As we have heard today, the cost wasn't just human, although that cost was utterly devastating and tragic. The cost was economic. It cost $16 billion for the taxpayers of Australia to fund that disaster, which they want to run away from, which they never want to talk about again, and which they stupidly put back on the agenda. They put their policy and our discussion of their policy back on the agenda to talk about and for the Australian people to see and remember the disaster and the tragedy. $16 billion-if you don't think that makes a difference, in my portfolio of Attorney-General, we run the entire justice and court system, including legal assistance funding, for $1.2 billion. With the money that you wasted in a policy that lives were lost under you could fund the entire court and justice system in Australia for 16 years. Sixteen years with the money that you wasted propping up a policy that caused the deaths of children. And now, in a stunt, you want to try and unravel the successful response to those years of disaster. Another thing that you've done today is delay a bill that you agreed would go through the House yesterday and that you agreed the parliamentary joint committee would respond to and report on yesterday morning. You delayed it here, contrary to your agreement. You did that because you thought it gave you some kind of strategic advantage in bringing a bill back to this place which would unravel border protection. So here you are, delaying a bill meant to keep Australians safe from terrorists by allowing our law enforcement agencies to have appropriate powers to get into encrypted systems. You are delaying that national security bill in order to have a tactical win on a bill that would destroy another plank of Australia's national security and border protection. How bad can it get? How dishonest can you be? How much can you rely on using stunts which blow up in your face to try and embarrass a government? The only people you've embarrassed are yourselves. You've shown exactly who you are and what you're made of it, and it doesn't do anything for any man, woman or child. Australia needs strong border protection. That is what we have given this country for five years. Right now, up there and behind the doors of your offices, you are trying do deals, destroy legislation and undo the protection that we have offered for the Australian people at their borders, for the people who are the victims of people smugglers. What you are doing is an absolute disgrace. It goes to the very core of the way that you conduct politics and the very core of your failure to understand what is necessary to protect Australia's borders. This has been stunt upon stunt upon stunt. It's blown up in your face and you know it. If you want to have an argument about border protection, bring it on. Bring it on every day between now and the election, because the Australian people need to know what you will do if you ever got your hands back on that policy again. It will result in the deaths of children at sea.",100
118,Mr KATTER,MOTIONS," It's a rare phenomenon in this parliament where I stand up to defend the ALP and the LNP, but I'm left with no alternative but to go to this ugly scenario. We all greeted the legislation with cynicism. I got calls about it from the trade union movement in Queensland. I hadn't looked at the legislation, and my chief of staff said, 'Divestment?' And I said, 'No, we want nationalisation.' We're all socialists! But if we can't get nationalisation, I suppose we have to go along with it. It suddenly occurred to me, as it did to the ALP: 'Uh, uh, uh, sneaky trick to get all the Queensland electricity industry sold off.' This is where I depart from the ALP. Everyone in Queensland knows, including the trade union movement, that there is nothing the ALP in Queensland would want more than to sell off the electricity industry. They tried to sell it and got themselves annihilated in an election. They were selling the railways and half selling the electricity industry. So they're scared, but they know they can buy their way through the next election if they sell it for $15,000 million. I would agree with almost everything the ALP have said today, because that was exactly what I was saying to the Treasurer. I'm going to defend the Treasurer here. I said, 'This is a cheap, sneaky trick to sell the Snowy and to sell the Queensland electricity industry.' And he said, 'No, it's not.' I said, 'Well, you prove it by passing a piece of legislation saying that you're preventing it.' He said, 'Yes, I will.' I was quite stunned. I didn't have a plan B. He said, 'You draft the legislation.' So I drafted the legislation. Either the Treasurer is an extremely good actor, for which I congratulate him, or, alternatively, he is quite genuine and honest. In this case, it's my opinion that he was playing a straight bat. If you're not going to nationalise it-this side of the House doesn't want that and that side of the House doesn't want that; this little group over here does want that, but we're a minority-there is divestment. Everybody knows the story about Theodore Roosevelt and how divestment was forced on the Standard Oil company in New Jersey and Rockefeller was broken up into 20 or 30 parts. Everyone knows that it is one of the great moments in world history. If you can't have nationalisation then you've got to go to divestment. The other side of it was: was it a sneaky trick to force the sale of the assets? So, we moved the amendment that prevents that. There is absolutely no purpose in selling a Stanwell to another government department. It has to be in the same state as well, because you could sell it maybe to another state. So I stand up here on a very rare occasion to  defend both sides of the House. I think both sides have approached this issue with the best intent, and I thank them. (Time expired)",102

121,Ms HUSAR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.,105

124,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member may proceed.,105
125,Ms HUSAR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Too often during the last six months I've had to bite my tongue and not defend myself publicly whilst being misrepresented. I will not wait around for someone else to do what is right and show leadership. There are two sides to every story. Now it is my time to correct the record, be my own champion and the battler that I've always been in pursuit of what is right and fair. I do not object to the media doing their jobs, but misrepresenting members is not one of them. I respect those who have shown ethical and good conduct while reporting. Let me be very specific. At 9.33 am on 2 August, Ms Alice Workman of BuzzFeed published the most damaging article. In it she claimed that she had requested my comment. She had not. This is false. At 9.34 am on that same day, one minute after that publication, she emailed me requesting comments and answers to 48 questions for the article that she had already published. I had no chance to refute or respond. At 9.35 am she further tweeted that I had bragged about who I was having sex with, that I had sexually harassed an employee and intentionally exposed myself, like Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct, in front of a colleague and his infant son. As a result of this initial misrepresentation, over 225 articles were re-published, each and every single one of them misrepresenting me in so many respects. Within 36 hours of this gross misrepresentation and the slut-shaming smears going viral, I was asked to resign as the member for Lindsay. Let me correct the record. BuzzFeed and Alice Workman knew that the confidential letter which contained untested and contested allegations was in their possession. They also knew that I was bound by confidentiality under the Whelan process I was being examined by. But they went ahead and published their slut-shaming story knowing and with full intent that it would go viral. Let me correct the record: They didn't give me any notice in advance. They didn't give me the opportunity to seek release from my confidentiality obligations so that I could respond. They didn't give me the opportunity to use our legal system to preserve the confidential process until it had properly played out. In furtherance of my correcting that record today, I have launched proceedings for defamation in the Federal Court against BuzzFeed and Alice Workman, who were involved in this shameless misrepresentation and subsequent take-down. Sunlight is always the best disinfectant, and today I bathe those misrepresentations in a flood of light, to remind them that they are not above the rule of law in this great country of ours. Mr Speaker, I am not a bully. I am not Sharon Stone. I am not a thief and I did not deliberately misuse my work expenses. I will fight for my integrity, for my family and for Lindsay, which is full of battlers just like me, and I will fight for every woman who comes after me. I'm going to do my bit to ensure that this never happens again. NA Business",105
126,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Obviously the respect of the House goes completely to the words we've just heard. Mr Speaker, may I raise a different matter. There's a motion on the Notice Paper that the House has not yet moved, in the name of the Leader of the House, which, unless we move it, we won't be able to complete the encryption legislation today, or the divestment legislation, both of which the government has said are essential. Once the MPI starts, it will be too late for that to be moved, and if we want to make sure that is dealt with, it would have to be now.",105
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The Leader of the House on a point of order?  has passed the encryption bill with all the necessary amendments, and it doesn't need to return to the House if the Senate passes the amendments, because there are no other amendments necessary. It was the Manager of Opposition Business in the House who stopped the divestments bill being dealt with today by requiring it not be taken as a whole and dealt with clause by clause-for the first time in 30 years.",105
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"On that note, we might move to valedictories.  NA Valedictory",105
129,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS," Well, ho, ho, ho, Mr Speaker! It has been quite a year for all of us-for every single member of this House and the other place. All of us have the opportunity to serve here because of the great love and affection that comes from our families, and when we leave this place we will go and be with them. We will have the opportunity to spend the most joyous time of the year with them and be with our families for Christmas and New Year's and share stories, experiences of the year and our reflections, but, most of all, just hold each other in our arms. It will give us an extra opportunity, as we go into next year, to remember those fond times that we have had over the Christmas break. I particularly want to be mindful of those who will not have such a merry Christmas and those who will be under great stress and strain, because I must reflect on the fact that the issue this year that I believe was most penetrating, most humbling and most significant was the day we stood in this place and offered the national apology to the victims of sexual abuse. It was a day that I think the Leader of the Opposition and I will certainly never forget, and I hope it's a day that those who suffered that abuse will also never forget. It can't change what happened. As they go through their Christmas and holiday period, there won't be the same warm smiles for many of them. There will be the same confusion. There'll be the same sense of hurt and damage and things that they will never feel they can get over. So I would suggest that, as we go off to our break and spend our time with our families once again, we think of them and think of what they're going through over these periods, because we know that, at Christmas and holiday periods, for those of us who are blessed-as I have been with Jen and the girls and a wonderful family-this is the most joyous time of the year. For others it's a time of terrible isolation, a reminder of the things that really make life so hard for them. That's why I'm so thankful for the services, like Lifeline and others, who will be there for them and who will be turning out and volunteering on Christmas Day all around the country and serving Christmas cheer to others. Christmas is a religious season. It is a reminder of our Lord who came into this place and brought new hope but, most of all, a message of love. In that message of love, there are so many Australians who take the opportunity-and God bless them for doing it-to go out there and extend that love and care to their fellow Australians and try to ease what might otherwise be an even more difficult day. So we thank those volunteers who will be doing that this Christmas, and we thank them for doing it each and every day of the year. We hope that, through their comfort, they will bring some measure of joy to others over the Christmas period. I also thank all of those of our Defence Force who will be serving far away from this place-and, indeed, here in our own country-and will be away from their families. They might be at sea. They might be serving in Afghanistan or other places in peacekeeping missions around the world. We are mindful of the service and the sacrifice that they are making on our behalf, and we send them our best. We will always seek to do our best for them in this place and at every opportunity we have. We think of those who are serving as volunteers on our beaches, in the rural fire services and those out there caring for our community over the holiday season. With the fires still burning up in Queensland, thankfully, their intensity has diminished. Just during question time. I received advice that there are fires burning in South Australia right now. The warnings have not escalated to a high level at this point, but it's just a reminder. As I've said in this place, we are going into one of the most difficult fire seasons for many, many years. So, as we go around the many Christmas events and other things we will have in our electorates and communities over the next few weeks, all of us will have the opportunity to remind fellow Australians to have those conversations as communities and families and at the street parties to say: how will we work together; what will we do? Make sure that the first conversation you have about evacuation or responding to an emergency is not when it's happening for real and you have to make those choices. I would encourage all of us to be out there carrying that message to everyone over this Christmas season. Whether it's our police officers, our firefighters, our nurses, our doctors or others who will be out there providing care, we thank them all for their service over the course of the last 12 months. They are called to do what they do in their vocations, as we do here, and we thank them for the great work they do. I extend to the Leader of the Opposition, his family and his wife, Chloe, all the best for the Christmas period. I hope they have a great break. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his personal kindnesses to Jenny and me. And I thank Chloe for her kindnesses to Jenny; they are able to take refuge in each other's company on occasion when we are attending various events. We appreciate them and we wish them all the best. And I extend that to all the members of the opposition and, of course, all the members of my own wonderful team on this side of the House. I also extend it to the Leader of the National Party and to the Treasurer, as well as to Senator MCKenzie,  the Deputy Leader of the National Party in the other place. To the Leader of the House-what would we do without the Leader of the House! He completely embodies a sense of Christmas cheer and is an adornment to the House-I wish you and your family all the best for Christmas. To the leadership in the Senate-Senator Cormann and Senator Birmingham-and to Senator Wong and the team in the Senate, I wish you all the best for your year. I thank very much the Chief Government Whip and the deputy whips. Well done, whips, for working so well together with the whips from the opposition and ensuring we get about our business and work through the important work of the parliament. I thank the Clerk of the House, David Elder, and all of your team-the deputy clerk, Claressa Surtees, and the clerk assistants. I thank the Serjeant-at-Arms, James Catchpole, and his team for the work they do. I thank the House Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Anne Dowd, and her colleagues Luke Bulow and Tim Moore. From my own department, I thank Secretary Parkinson and all of his team-as I'm sure my colleagues in the executive would want to thank all of their department secretaries and all of those who work principally here and in and around Canberra. As a result of the policies of our government, a lot of them are working outside of Canberra these days, which is a good thing. I wish all of them the best for Christmas and I hope they can enjoy their time off so they can return refreshed for what will be a very busy year next year. I also thank all of our staff. We had the opportunity last night as a coalition to thank all of our staff for their great work. I thank the attendants of this place. I thank the Federal Police and the security and support staff who look after us all and keep us safe. In my own office we have three cleaners-Lucia, Anna and Maria-who would be known to most people around this building because they've been here a very long time. Anna and Maria are sisters, and they have worked in the PMO since Prime Minister Hawke. They are loud and joyous and wonderful, and there is bipartisan agreement that we love them very much.

132,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS,"I was just about to say, Mr Speaker, that earlier this week they lost their mother. I know we would all like to send our love and prayers to two sisters who have become part of the soul of this building. To them we extend our condolences, and our thoughts are with them at a difficult time. I want to pay tribute also to Laura Gillies, who is the executive assistant to the Serjeant-at-Arms. Laura is about to retire. She has worked for the Department of the House of Representatives for over 33 years. She joined the service of the parliament in Old Parliament House when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister. She has seen everything in this building-and she has seen a lot over the last 10 years! On behalf of the government, I thank you for your service to Australia. Christmas is a very joyous time, and we know it can be tough for many others. Those who it will be particularly tough for-as it has been for many years now, particularly in Queensland-are the communities that have been affected by drought. Whether up in Quilpie-and the Tullys-or anywhere else across the country, I think one of the most generous things we've seen from fellow Australians this year is the way that they, whether they're schoolchildren or seniors groups, have reached out and wanted to help our rural and regional communities, our farmers. And it is not just the farms but the communities, the shops, those who work in the schools. For all of those communities, Australians reached out and had their back this year. We're very pleased to be doing many things to help and support them at this time, but we pray that they'll have a wonderful Christmas, and I'll certainly continue to pray for rain for them. I suspect that would be a great Christmas prayer, as people go about their Christmas Day, that day of religious celebration. I think it would be a wonderful thing for the nation to join and pray for rain. Mr Speaker, may I wish you also a wonderful Christmas, and your lovely family.

135,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS,"Great poise-yes, thank you, Treasurer-but also a great sense of spirit and a sense of humour, which I'm sure is well received by those who look in on these broadcasts. You very much are in control of this House, Mr Speaker, and we commend you for the way that you've done that, with great integrity. You  really do bring a great authority to this House, and the House is incredibly well served by you. So, to all colleagues, I again extend my best wishes, from Jenny and I and our family, and may God bless you and yours.",107
136,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS,I thank the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition on indulgence.,108
137,Mr SHORTEN,STATEMENTS," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I congratulate the Prime Minister on his valedictory speech. When I say thank you first of all to you, Mr Speaker, I mean it. After all, being Speaker of the House and a Carlton supporter is enough to test the patience of a saint! So, it's a great credit to you that you've kept order in the chamber and held on to your sense of humour as well. I'm pretty sure that last week the Prime Minister effectively announced that the date of the election could be 11 May-or 18 May. But it may be of greater interest to some in the House to learn that the Prime Minister's birthday is 13 May, and mine is 12 May. So, it's fair to say that both of us are hoping that the other one doesn't necessarily have the world's happiest birthday next year! I think it makes it all the more important to wish the Prime Minister a merry Christmas. Chloe and I wish you and Jenny and your very precious daughters a safe and happy time together over the summer. And despite everything that they say about me, I give my best wishes to the government members. They did me the compliment this year of mentioning me personally 1,260 times in question time; that's about every 3½ minutes, and that includes our questions. It makes me wonder what on earth the government would do without me! I should also briefly acknowledge former Prime Minister Turnbull and Lucy Turnbull. The Prime Minister served and led this country up to August of this year. I also should acknowledge the member for Curtin, who has served with distinction as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and foreign minister not only for much of this year but indeed for her time in government. I also should say merry Christmas to the fastest-growing group in the chamber, the crossbench: merry Christmas. Having acknowledged the people who serve in the parliament, I think it's appropriate this Christmas to think of the men and women of our Defence Force who are serving overseas and in Australia-and their families, who serve also. We pay tribute to the Australian Federal Police and our security agencies, who calmly and professionally keep us safe. We acknowledge the men and women who have already begun another long, hot summer of fighting fires and saving lives and communities. At Christmas we think of our police and our ambos, our nurses and our emergency services-the people who come face to face with the tragic human consequences and stresses and strains of this time of year. Let us also spare a thought for those who are going without, people battling everything from poverty to addiction to homelessness to just simple loneliness. We give thanks to their allies in this fight, those remarkable souls of the charity organisations, who do everything they can to bring some Christmas cheer to those who really do deserve it the most. I also want to salute all the Australians who will be working through Christmas, giving up their time with the people they love, to make sure that there is food on the table, the bills are paid and the rest of us can enjoy our Christmas. In 2018, around the nation, Australia was tested by fire and floodwater, by drought and hardship, by terror and tragedy, but, in the face of disaster, our people stand strong. In the shadow of evil, our communities come together. When times are tough, neighbours and strangers could always count on each other. As ever, the greatness of our country revealed itself not just in the high places of power and privilege but in the hearts of our citizens. As always, we find remarkable inspiration in the character and courage of everyday Australians, especially our resilient farmers battling drought, who put the food on the table for the nation. Only twice in the history of football has a side kicked the first five goals of a grand final and lost, and on both occasions it was Collingwood, so congratulations to Western Australians and Eagles supporters, and, in league, the Roosters. It was on the Gold Coast this year that our athletes starred-none, I would suggest, more inspirational or impressive than the amazing, legendary Kurt Fearnley. At beautiful Moonee Valley in my electorate the 'mighty mare' won her fourth Cox Plate. Speaking of winning with a leg in the air, congratulations to Premier Daniel Andrews. In the Caribbean the Southern Stars clinched another world cup, and as women's sporting codes around the nation continue to grow, thrive and inspire, let us do more to see these athletes be paid like the elite professionals they are. None of us would be here without the sacrifices, patience and support of our families. I thank Chloe for her love, advice and policy passion and for basically raising our kids largely on her own, as so many of our partners do. Last night I missed my youngest daughter's concert, but we all miss a lot in these jobs-big moments and little everyday treasures. To my son, Rupert, congratulations on finishing year 12; to Georgette, I'm sorry that I mentioned your boyfriend on radio before you were Facebook-official; and to Clementine, I'm pleased to say that I kept my promise and made it through the year without dabbing in public-please lift the fatwa.  Speaking of families who've put up with a lot, I'd like to thank my caucus colleagues, beginning of course with the member for Sydney. Tanya, the greatest gift, not that there are many gifts for being the Leader of the Opposition for five years, is to have developed the friendship that I have with you. In the other place we're fortunate to be led by senators Penny Wong and Don Farrell: perhaps the most unlikely, iconic and beloved partnership to come out of South Australia since the pie floater. To the member for MCMahon, thank you for your belief in Labor as the party of ideas and initiative and for everything you to do advance our cause as an alternative government, not just a strong opposition. To our Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Watson, we need only look at next year's sitting calendar to show how effective you are at your job. To the newest member of our leadership group, Brendan O'Connor, your resiliency, humour, love of a good fight and love of Una-you cheer us all; you make us respect you. To all of my senior colleagues, I won't namecheck you all, but you know who you are. To all of my members of the executive, to all of those who serve in the parliamentary Labor Party, thank you very much for your support, for your vision and for your unity. I say thank you to our chief whip, Chris Hayes, and the deputy whips who do everything you can to keep us in line. Indeed, I wish I had the opportunity to acknowledge each of my caucus colleagues. You are outstanding. You give up a lot. You put your case with fierceness and determination and with idealism and optimism. On this side of the parliament we carry the Labor banner, but we know that an army marches at our back. To our branch members and true believers, thank you for giving our movement such life and purpose. To our national secretary, Noah Carroll, and his team, in the next 162 days and 12 hours, you have a national conference-I thank the government for that-before Christmas and a federal election campaign to run next year. Please squeeze in a merry Christmas in between. I do want to thank and acknowledge the trade union movement of Australia. Earlier this year I travelled up to Sale to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the explosion at the Longford gas plant. I will never forget being at the site that afternoon, as a younger official, when they showed us the security footage of the explosions which took two lives and badly burned two others. There were nine explosions, nine fireballs. It looked like film of an air force bombing raid as the gas explosions occurred. In the foreground, sensibly, you could see a lot of people running from the area of the explosions to safety. But every single person in the orange overalls, the operators and the in-house maintenance, were running towards the danger going to their mates. Twenty years ago these were the people that this large multinational company tried to blame for the disaster, the people who ran towards the peril. Their union stood up for them then, defended them and protected them, and in the end these workers got bravery medals. But even now at Esso, the union movement is still fighting for maintenance workers who were unceremoniously sacked over 500 days ago, only to be told that if they wanted their jobs back, that in some cases they had had for some decades, they had to accept a 30 per cent pay cut from one of the richest companies in the world. The fight for fairness is a job that never stops but it is where some of the most rewarding work can be. It is why I am proud every day to be a member of an Australian trade union. Speaking of powerful and important collectives, I acknowledge the press gallery. I say to those of you who located our free drinks on Tuesday night, which was a healthy majority-and I think they all attended the Prime Minister's beforehand too!-you genuinely perform a public service. Our democracy is better for it. Talking of what makes our system better, that brings me to the people who do the listening in this place, the Hansard reporters, the clerks, the chamber attendants, the tabling and drafting officers and all the other quietly turning cogs that keep the machinery of our parliament and our democracy turning over. To everyone who plays a part, the caterers, 2020, broadcasting, landscapers, librarians, gym staff and security guards, thank you for what you do in the service of our democracy. In particular, we must always acknowledge one of the more remarkable monopolies in this place, so I acknowledge Dom and the team at Aussies. They've probably got the soccer on right now but they can read about this later. I do, too, want to thank our cleaners, especially in my office the aptly named and ever-cheerful Joy. We all spend our lives in a tearing hurry. I would say that, in Melbourne, without my Comcar drivers, Peter Taylor, Steve Smith and Dave 'Smoky' Keeley, I would miss a lot of flights and be even later to some of my press conferences. As usual, this section of my speech is both highlighted and in bold. I would like to thank my staff, both at my electorate office in Moonee Ponds and my personal staff. Many staff come here dreaming of The West Wing. These days, my staff console themselves with watching Veep. It has been a long road, not just the 1,602 kilometres that I've run so far this year-I've recorded this-and I've been glad to have you with me on the journey.  There are issues and questions which divide this place, from the momentous to the trivial, but a big truth unites us all: we are drawn here because we believe that politics is more than a career. It is a vocation. It is a call to service. Service not just in the name of the people who voted for us but for the next generation, for the future of all Australians. The best day this parliament has had this year, in 2018, was the apology to the survivors and victims of institutional child sexual abuse. It was a day full of hard truths, raw emotions and reawakened pain for those who came to hear the apology. There was grief for those who did not live long enough to hear it being given. And amidst the remarkable privilege we all had of meeting with survivors, advocates and warriors who fought for that day, two things shone through to me. One is the unselfishness that drove them. They sought the apology not because of what it would mean for them but because they believed it was the best and surest way to prevent this happening again to another generation-to protect the next generation so that what happened to the survivors would not happen again. But the second thing which shone through to me is this. There are many Australians who have reasons to distrust this place. There are many Australians who are cynical about politics. These Australians in particular had every reason to distrust this place and despise politicians, but they still found it in themselves to include the parliament in the nation's healing. So, remarkably, after all of the betrayals that they had endured, they gave us a gift. They reminded us of the privilege that we have in this place and the power we have to speak for our nation and to serve it. So, in the new year, let us all work harder to make redress real. Let us all do more to remember the gift that they gave us, to honour their example and to live up to it in 2019. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Happy Diwali. I thank the House. The SPEAKER (16:11): I thank both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and I support their very generous remarks. I'm just going to make a very few brief remarks with respect to the staff of the House and the operation of the House. I want to start by thanking the Clerk, David Elder, and the Deputy Clerk, Claressa Surtees, and their team, who've worked extremely hard through the course of the year. I want to also thank the Serjeant-at-Arms, James Catchpole, and all of his staff. I'd also like to thank all of the staff of the Department of the House of Representatives. I'd like to thank the attendants who work here in this chamber. They're led by Paulene Crook, who's worked very hard throughout the course of the year. I want to thank them for all of the messages they've run to keep the House operating. I think they do a fantastic job. I want to thank the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business. I have a lot to do with the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business on a daily basis-in fact, sometimes on an hourly basis. I think we've had a good relationship, working through all of the very difficult issues from a procedural point of view. I want to thank the Manager of Opposition Business, who I've had a lot to do with. The Leader of the House I've known for 30 years. We are friends, but there was a first the other day: he said sorry for the first time in my living memory, and that's probably the only time. I've been momentarily stunned, I think! But I want to thank him and, as I said, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I'm fortunate; I've known them a very long time as well. The Leader of the Opposition and I, of course, are both Melbourne boys, and I've known the Prime Minister for about that same length of time as well. I want to thank my personal staff, led by Cate Clunies-Ross. They work incredibly hard and they give very good and frank advice. At the same time, they all manage a really healthy sense of humour-that's often at my expense, I have to say, but that's healthy. I wish all of you a Happy Christmas and I look forward to seeing you all at the start of next year. Thanks so much. NA Workplace Relations The SPEAKER (16:14): I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gorton proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to address record low wages growth, insecure work and growing inequality. I call upon all those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesMr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (16:14): I rise to reflect on the failures of this government to deal with wage growth, to deal with job security and, really, to attend to the needs of working people in this nation. I am aware that there is a very short, abridged opportunity for us to discuss this matter today, but I do think it's a good  opportunity when the government has sought to make the point that it has been a successful government. I think it's quite clear on the evidence, when you look at wage growth in this country over the last five years, that there's been a real problem for people in making ends meet. It's the lowest wage growth in a generation. In fact, you've seen wages in many sectors of our economy fall in real terms. You've seen a government resist the opposition's efforts to restore penalty rates for up to 700,000 hard working retail and hospitality workers, compounding the stagnant wage growth in this country. When you look at the national accounts that came out yesterday, you can see clearly that workers continue to receive less of the benefits of economic growth. Over the year to September, corporate profits grew by seven per cent, six times as fast as average compensation per employee, which only grew by 1.2 per cent. Yet, despite companies clearly getting relatively high profits, we've seen no effort by this government to attend to low wage growth. In fact, the government instead has relied upon the discredited theories of trickle-down economicsnamely, to provide largesse to large companies on the basis that somehow that will be provided in the form of wage increases for millions of workers. Well, of course, that has not happened and, as a result, you're seeing the difficulties that households are having in meeting and attending to cost of living pressures. Without a doubt, if you look at national savings, they're down. Household savings are down and household debt is up, and that is in large part due to the failure of wages to be comparable to improvements in productivity in the economy and increases in profits. I think, for that reason, the government needs to do better. It's clear the government like to suggest that they have done well in terms of unemployment, and it's true to say unemployment has fallen since 2013. But let's look at some of the underlying problems in the labour market. There are over 700,000 unemployed people and 1.1 million Australians that are underemployed. That means you have over one million Australians looking for more work and not being able to find it, and you have, of course, 700,000 unemployed. So, despite the efforts of the government to suggest that they've dealt with the employment issue, the fact is that the underutilisation rate-that is, the combination of unemployed and underemployed Australians-is very high, and that, of course, is a concern to Labor and it should be a concern to this government. The fact is that we have yet to see any policies enunciated by the government to attend to this problem of wage growth, nor have we seen the government in any way seek to deal with problems in the labour market that go to exploitation of workers. We've seen great scandals that have occurred with significant underpayments. We've seen the misuse of independent contracting, where people are paid less than the minimum wage and deemed to be independent contractors when in fact they are, and should be deemed to be, employees. We've seen a failure to attend to the casualisation of the workforce. The Federal Court recently reflected on a matter that came before it with respect to a worker who had a permanent roster and had been working for years indefinitely and yet was not considered to be permanent. There's been no effort by the minister or, indeed, this government to respond in this place to that Federal Court decision. That Federal Court decision is one that really points to the ongoing misuse and misapplication of what was once a tighter definition of 'casual'. In that instance, you could see that the larger company that was being provided with the labour by the labour hire employee wanted certainty when it came to the supply of labour and wanted a permanent supply of labour but did not want to see that worker defined as a permanent employee. That is not acceptable as far as Labor is concerned. That's why, if elected, a Shorten Labor government will provide an objective test for 'casual'. We'll have that defined within the statutes so that we can clearly delineate between a legitimate casual employee and a person who should be afforded permanent employment because of the nature of their work. We've seen nothing from the government on this in this place. If the government wants to respond to a common-law decision-that is, a Federal Court decision-the best place for the executive government to consider that is in this place, not in submissions made before any subsequent court matter, I would contend. Whether it be dealing with casualisation or dealing with sham contracting-that's becoming an increased problem in the labour market, where you're seeing people selling their labour on platforms; and often the labour is conventional work, yet they are not being afforded even minimum entitlements that ordinary minimum award employees would receive-that should because for concern for the government, yet there has been no policy response by the government to these problems. As a result, you are seeing that workers are increasingly feeling more insecure at work and workers are feeling they're not getting their fair share of the dividend of economic growth. For that reason, workers are not able to deal with cost-of-living pressures. When I go around my electorate-or, indeed, around this country-often the way in which that's perceived or the way in which that's understood by workers is the difficulty in them paying their bills. As for paying essential bills, whether it's paying the rent, paying the mortgage, paying for school uniforms, putting petrol in the car or paying for other essentials for household expenditure, they cannot afford it because of this issue. As I say, that has been put to me anecdotally many, many times over the past five years; but the national accounts yesterday did  really point to a problem in the economy because there have been stagnant wages. That's leading to a slowdown in the economy. That should be attended to by this government, but they fail to do so. One of the reason they fail to do so is that the government really are not sensitive to the needs of working people in this country. They're not sensitive to the concerns that working people have. They're not concerned that they have made a decision that has cut, in real terms, the wages of low-paid, hard working retail and hospitality workers. The government do not see that as a problem, yet it's a very significant problem for those workers and there is no relief for those workers. If elected, a Shorten Labor government will ensure that we legislate to restore penalty rates back to as they were on 30 June last year. We will do that as a matter of priority because those workers do not deserve their wages being cut in real terms as a result of that decision, where there was no compensation provided and particularly as that was at a time where wage growth has been so low. Wage growth has been low; as I say, people have been struggling. What has the government provided in the form of an answer? Unfortunately, the silence is deafening from the government benches. They have not responded to those concerns. It will take a Labor government to attend to it, it would appear. We're certainly happy to hold out that the government may start considering these matters. But, as recently as yesterday, we have had a government seeking to introduce a bill and not have a debate on the penalty rates matter. That's because the government does not share Labor's concerns about that. The other concern I think we should note-given the nature, the role and the importance of the Fair Work Commission-is the appointments by this government in relation to the Fair Work Commission. Since 2013, what we have seen is 14 consecutive commissioners, or deputy presidents, appointed by this government who were all from one side of the bargaining table. There were 14 consecutive commissioners, but they were all from the employer side of the bargaining table. That is, in fact, a terrible decision that does not consider any balance. I dare say that the government should certainly not be thinking of further appointments that continue the bias that affects a very important institution like the Fair Work Commission. I hope the government doesn't choose to do that in the near future.",108
138,Ms HENDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Corangamite-Assistant Minister for Social Services, Housing and Disability Services) (16:24): In these few minutes that are remaining in this MPI, after we've heard the valedictory speeches in the House, I want to start off wishing everyone a very merry Christmas-to all of my parliamentary colleagues; to you, Mr Deputy Speaker; and of course to the people of Corangamite. I particularly want to acknowledge the member for Gorton, who is facing the first Christmas without his wife, Jodi. I also want to acknowledge the member for Barton, who is facing a very difficult Christmas without her son. We all join together in thinking particularly of those members. It is with great pride that our government is making so much progress in delivering a strong economy. One thing we're not hearing much about anymore from the Labor Party in the debates in the chamber is jobs growth. The reason we're not hearing that from Labor is that jobs are going gangbusters in this nation. We are working extremely hard to set the right conditions for strong economic and jobs growth, with employment growth in 201718 of 349,000 new jobs, which is the largest increase in a financial year since 2004-05. Since the coalition came into government in September 2013, just under 1.2 million jobs have been created. The economic conditions are very strong, and that is leading to enormous boosts of confidence among small and medium-sized businesses, which have largely been deserted by the Labor Party. We know that the Leader of the Opposition made it very clear that he's declared a war on business. That's his intention if he is elected. That's why I think, underlying some of these very strong numbers, there's a very strong confidence in this government. Our unemployment rate has fallen to five per cent. The percentage of working-age Australians on welfare has fallen to 15 per cent-the lowest rate of welfare dependency in over 25 years. All of these measures that we have implemented are leading to more jobs, allowing us to fix the budget. We know that we will be delivering a surplus in next year's budget, which is wonderful news, and that helps us guarantee the record funding we have delivered for schools, hospitals and other essential services, including of course the very significant work we are doing to keep Australians safe. Talking about jobs and our economy, I want to pause and celebrate the very significant milestone that's been achieved in the Corangamite region and in the Geelong region, with the commencement of the new Avalon International Airport. That is an incredible day for jobs and our local economy. By 2028, the investment that our government has made into the terminal and into allowing this international terminal to be built will create an additional 2,000 jobs. And that's fundamentally why I think so many Australians, including in my electorate, have confidence in this government-we are making the investments that we need to make to grow jobs and the economy, including in delivering Victoria's second international airport.  I want to make a couple of points in response to the member for Gorton. He has fundamentally misrepresented matters in relation to the casualisation figures. There has been no change in the percentage of employees who are casual. Since about 2004 it's been at around 24, 25 per cent. So, while the Labor Party has worked very hard to misrepresent these figures, I do want to place on the record that, as at August 2018, 24.6 per cent of employees were casual, compared with a peak of 25.5 per cent in 2004. As I say, this government is delivering in spades, and the comments made by the member for Gorton demonstrate that Labor is interested in scare campaigns but not so interested in the facts. I do want to make one really important comment: there is strong evidence that wages growth is picking up. A number of the official statistics are showing that. We are seeing some very positive signs that wages growth is increasing. We know that the laws of supply and demand still hold. Lower unemployment is a key driver of higher wages for workers. Mr Deputy Speaker, my time has been cut short today. I wish you a very merry Christmas. And to all of my parliamentary colleagues and to Mr Speaker, I wish you all a very merry Christmas and a safe and happy new year. NA The SPEAKER (16:30): It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Morrison Government",112
139,Mr BURKE,ADJOURNMENT," With the clock clicking to 4.30, this government just gave up. This government just decided that everything we were told for the last two weeks was not true. For the last two weeks, we were told that getting the encryption legislation fully legislated was incredibly important, and we were told this in the strongest terms. The fact that it's in the SenateMr Evans interjecting",113
140,Mr BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"Okay, let me help you. We've just had an interjection: 'Oh, but it's in the Senate.' Sometimes the Senate does things called 'amendments'. When they do an amendment, you can only proclaim the law if it comes back here. The only way it could have come back here is if the Leader of the House had moved the motion that he had on the Notice Paper today, but he wouldn't move it. And why wouldn'the move it? Why did the government decide, even though they had planned for us to sit late, that they wouldn't? The answer is simple. It is because the Senate has also been debating whether or not medical advice should be followed for the people on Nauru, and the government realised that of the three issues-encryption, divestment and medical advice being followed on Nauru-they could get all three or none. They decided the price of following medical advice on Nauru was so high that they would rather not go through with the encryption legislation that they had been spending a fortnight backgrounding. All the words that they fired at us now actually reflect directly on them, because this is legislation that we voted for. This is legislation we were willing to keep at work for, which they've now decided to bail on. This is how Senator Cormann described people who are now in the exact position as the government members: 'To think that they would want terrorists to be able to communicate with each other.' Now, those are extraordinary words, but they are now a Liberal describing other Liberals. They are now the National Party describing the National Party. They spent the last two weeks talking about divestment. They backgrounded to the papers today that they were going to make sure that this legislation, the privatisation of the electricity assets-and that's exactly the form the bill is still in-went through the House of Representatives today. Now, they've made a lot about, 'Oh, but Tony Burke moved something that confused us, and we couldn't go ahead with it.' Let's have a think about what I didn't give leave for. I didn't give leave for the bill to be taken as a whole. That meant that the minister at the table needed to understand every clause of the bill, because we were going to debate it clause by clause. The truth is the minister wasn't up to being able to defend every clause of the bill. Those opposite have no idea what's in the legislation that was introduced to the House yesterday. They have no idea. But they've decided that they have an abject fear of the parliament. If you can't face the parliament, you can't govern, and today they've decided they can't face the parliament. For the whole of next year, for eight months, they've decided they can only face the parliament 10 times. This is a government without an agenda, but they've also decided that the agenda they've spent the last two weeks on they don't really want anyway. What sort of government decides against having a win on something that they described as essential for national security and forcing something through which they had the numbers on? They just had to sit through the whole debate. It would have been a bit humiliating for the minister, but they had to sit through the whole debate. I suspect divestment would have made it through the House, too. But the price of doing that was to  have legislation that didn't say, 'Everybody come straight from Nauru to Australia,' but rather, 'You really should listen to the doctors; you really need to listen to the doctors for people who are in your care.' We can all make a note of the fact that they've often missed deadlines. We were told the education agreements would all be signed by October. We were told encryption would go through this fortnight. We were told all the kids would be out before Christmas. We were told the divestment legislation would go through today. But the real deadline is that we were told there would be stable government by 2013. And what we have seen is exactly the way they describe it best: this parliament has been shut down because it has become a muppet show. Energy",113
141,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT," I'd like to respond to some of the claims there. It's great to see so many people turning out for my adjournment speech. Obviously this House has passed the encryption laws that are needed for the continuing safety of our country. And if Labor wants to hold those encryption laws hostage in the Senate for their cheap political games, it's on their heads. I was hoping to take this opportunity to use my time on the adjournment debate to record some of my observations on another important matter that's been discussed in the House this week: competition in the energy sector. I want to make some observations partially based on my experiences working as a regulatory economist in that sector. Firstly, I want to give Australians an assurance that there has been the sort of healthy debate you would expect inside our government when it comes to deciding how best to regulate an industry like the energy sector.",114
142,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,114
143,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"Apparently, judging by some of the jeers opposite, that sort of healthy and necessary debate does not really occur in other political parties in our country anymore. That sort of homogenous, non-diverse, unthinking sort of approach is almost terrifying. On this side of the House, for Liberals, we do have a reluctance to regulate markets unless it is necessary to do so. Our policy instincts around promoting freedom, choice and competition have been forged by overwhelming evidence, across the world and going back centuries, that liberal economic policies are proven time and again to lead ultimately to better welfare for humanity. At the same time, the standing assumption behind those policy instincts is that there can be competition and markets in the absence of that regulation. That assumption is hugely challenged in cases where there is a natural infrastructure monopoly at the heart of a market. There has been much debate in this parliament this week about regulation of the energy sector. There is clearly a natural infrastructure monopoly at the heart of the energy sector. We're obviously never going to see five or six sets of poles and wires running down East Street, with customers getting to choose which one they want to use to supply their premises with electricity. The expense involved in that obviously means there will only be one. So when you have a infrastructure monopoly like that, the default situation is not choice; it's not competition in markets; the default is a monopoly. I want to make the point very, very strongly that monopolies have always been equally abhorrent to liberal economics and our values. The answer, in the least worse kind of way, has always been to regulate these industries in a way that attempts to mimic the outcome of competition. The regulation of these infrastructure monopolies, whether it's electricity, trains, gas pipelines, telco-you name it-is now well established. It has been happening around the Western world since the 1970s. However, just because the regulation is well established doesn't mean that it stays up to date. This is where we find ourselves. The energy sector is rapidly changing. It's in transition, so the way we regulate the sector needs to be reviewed and kept up to date if we're going to keep attempting to mimic competition where there would otherwise be strong monopolistic tendencies. It can't be set and forget when it comes to regulating monopolies in an industry that's changing rapidly. There has been much said in recent months about conduct that we are starting to observe in energy markets. To my mind the most concerning aspect of that is that we are seeing some very large, vertically integrated power companies using their market power to withhold supply in wholesale markets and then getting windfall gains, either from those same wholesale markets or from retail markets where they also own significant assets hedging against the wholesale. That's what the ACCC says concerns them, too, incidentally. And as the sector changes, as new concerning conduct emerges, as new flaws in the competition we are trying to mimic arise, we do need to keep the regulatory regime up to date. So I want to put on the record today that the remedies and laws being considered by this parliament are limited to the energy sector. I wouldn't automatically or necessarily support measures like this being extended to other industries, particularly other sectors where there is not a natural infrastructure monopoly being regulated. I also want to put on the record my strong support for the prerequisite, the requirement, that there is the involvement and the judgement of both the independent competition watchdog, the ACCC, and the judiciary, through the Federal Court, in order to establish that the most severe possible penalties and remedies are  appropriate in cases of severe misconduct. And that approach, I think, achieves the appropriate balance in the circumstances of the energy sector. Coalition Government",114
144,Mr SHORTEN,ADJOURNMENT," I don't normally take the adjournment, but today Australians deserve an explanation. They deserve an explanation as to why this government lurches from crisis to crisis, embarrassment piled on embarrassment, week after week. Australians deserve to know why they don't have national security encryption legislation, why the kids are still on Nauru and why their power prices are still going up. This government has said that these are very important issues, in particular national security. At the beginning of this week, they threatened Labor and said,' You must not stand in the way of encryption legislation.' And, indeed, earlier on 22 November the current Prime Minister said about encryption legislation: Our police, our agencies, need these powers now and I would like to see them passed, in fact I would insist on seeing them passed before the end of the next sitting fortnight. But I regret to advise the Australian people that we've arrived at the end of the sitting fortnight. There is legislation passed and amended in the Senate, which then comes back to the House of Representatives to be finalised. It has ever been thus in the Australian parliamentary system. The House of Representatives or the Senate amend laws and the other house then considers them. Now what happened is this government rushed a set of encryption laws which were, just frankly, botched. This opposition absolutely worked to get agreement to repair them as best we can. This morning the government gave us 170 amendments on vital legislation to do with digital privacy, tracking down terrorists and criminals, security and economics. Labor, in the parliament, and the crossbench have considered 170 amendments and ratified them in the Senate in the last hour. But apparently this Christmas, when it was so vital to have national security laws, the government now says: 'Oh, five o'clock, time to go home. We'll worry about national security next year.' Shame, shame, shame! You use national security as a stick to try and score a political angle. Labor looks at national security and says,' How do we work together to make Australians safe?' What has happened is that these laws are ready to be passed right now. Every year past when the parliament has had laws which arrived late, because the parliament was scheduled to finish at five o'clock for the year, we sat later. Both political parties tell their members of parliament: 'Don't book your flights. Don't make commitments in the electorates tomorrow,' because a tried and true system of government under John Howard and Bob Hawke-and even Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull-was that if you have laws which need to be passed, and the government has made the case they need to be passed, you stay and do the job. You don't go home. But with this government apparently national security is only national security until five o'clock on a Thursday, because the bad guys don't worry about our national security-they will stop at five o'clock. We have got a work-to-rule government. We're not dealing with these laws, because the parliament is expressing the will. In addition to the proper scrutiny of laws, we want to see the kids off Nauru, kids who need medical treatment, where the treating medicos say that should be done. We simply say, 'They should get that treatment and the decision-making should be transparent and accountable.' But this is where we now find out of the real priorities of this ideologically bankrupt and this morally abject failing government. They are more keen to be seen to maintain their political pride than protect Australians, get kids off Nauru or even deal with lower energy prices. This is a government who is so consumed by their own pride. They have been divided all this year. They got rid of their sitting Prime Minister. They lost an electorate and lost some of the members of parliament on whom they have relied. They bullied the member for Banks out of the Liberal Party. Because of their own internal discord, they are now concerned that children might be able to have a transparent process to receive the medical treatment they deserve. But this is a government who says national security is No. 1, unless it's Prime Minister Morrison's pride, because then national security is No. 2. It says the safety of children is No. 1, unless the pride of Prime Minister Morrison is in danger, and then that comes first. This government should be ashamed of itself. It has put its own pride and its own political bacon ahead of the children on Nauru, ahead of national security and ahead of the people of Australia. United Kingdom: Pensions",115
145,Mr LEESER,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak about the inequitable pension freeze that affects British expatriates living in Australia. Glenhaven resident Dr Bernard Stone had an extensive and distinguished career as a researcher, manager and entrepreneur in the wool and textile industry in the United Kingdom. Throughout his career, Bernard made compulsory salary contributions into the National Insurance Fund in order to qualify for the state pension. In 2013, Bernard retired and moved to Australia, into my electorate.  When Bernard retired, he started to receive a pension from the UK government. Under this system, Bernard is entitled to pension payments determined by the number of years he made salary contributions to his pension fund. Pensions are generally indexed annually to keep up with inflation, but, as soon as Bernard left the UK and started receiving pension payments in Australia, his pension was frozen in time. This means Bernard's pension payments will never increase while he lives here. Bernard will find himself in a similar situation to the late Dela Willmott. In 1979, Dela retired, moved to Australia and received a UK pension of 17 pounds a week. In March this year, 39 years later, aged 98, Dela died in Australia, still receiving only 17 pounds a week from the UK government. West Pennant Hills resident, Pat Redlich, aged 87, is another one of my constituents affected by the UK pension freeze. Pat trained as a civil engineer at Cambridge and joined a UK management consulting firm which saw him travel to Saudi Arabia, Greece and Ireland before his work brought him to Australia over 50 years ago. Pat first lived in Melbourne, then transferred to Sydney and is enjoying his retirement in my electorate. Pat started drawing the UK part-pension nine years ago. Pat told me that, since 2009, the amount he draws for his partpension has remained frozen after all these years. British policy is that British subjects retiring in 48 of the 53 Commonwealth nations, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and India, all have their pensions frozen when they arrive in their new home. This means retirees don't receive the annual indexation which accounts for inflation. By contrast, British retirees settling in the United States, Turkey, and the Philippines enjoy pension increases in line with inflation. The system is inherently discriminatory. Under this system, Bernard Stone's salary contributions he made while he worked in the UK are ignored. While Bernard lives in Australia his UK pension will never increase in value. In fact, he is basically taking a cut in real terms. Pension payments have been a point of contention in our bilateral relationship with the UK for a long time. In 1958 Australia and the UK had a social security agreement that meant host countries provided income support for those individuals residing in their country. Under the agreement, the Australian government paid indexed pensions to former residents living in the UK. However, the UK government did not reciprocate. Australia terminated the social security agreement with the UK in 2001, because the UK government refused numerous requests to renegotiate the agreement to include indexation provisions. In recent times the British government has argued that global indexed pension payments are unaffordable. Richard Harrington, a former Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions, stated that it would cost an additional 500 million pounds a year to index all state pension payments in full to the current rate across the world. This is despite UK pensioners living in the EU receiving increases in their payments as well as retirees living in countries where reciprocal social security agreements exist. Of the 1.2 million UK pensioners living outside the UK, almost half, 542,565, live in countries where the state pension isn't indexed. Of those, close to 250,000 reside in Australia. Approximately 180,000 UK pensioners here in Australia also receive payments from the Australian government. The organisation British Pensions in Australia headed by the indomitable Jim Tilley estimates that, if those 180,000 UK pensions were indexed and paid by the UK government, as it does in other countries, the Australian government would save approximately $185 million in pension payments. This $185 million could go towards Australia's 2.5 million age pensioners, of which 11,000 people are on the age pension in my electorate. While the rules around eligibility for the UK pension and indexation are ultimately a matter for the British government, I consider the current British policy of frozen pensions discriminatory and unjust. Over the years, the Australian government has made many representations on this issue and has provided low-cost options as a resolution. Julie Bishop raised the matter with Boris Johnson in 2017, and Malcolm Turnbull raised the matter with Theresa May in 2018. Despite these efforts, to date the UK hasn't agreed to change its indexation policy. Britain's decision to exit the EU and negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia presents a potential opportunity for us to re-engage the UK on the indexation of pensions for British subjects living here. I'm calling on our government to maintain pressure on the British government to find an equitable solution for all the British pensioners living in Australia, including the significant number of British pensioners living in my electorate. Coalition Government",115
146,Ms PLIBERSEK,ADJOURNMENT," This morning there were people driving across cities with two kids in the back, dropping one to child care and one to school before they made the trip to work. There were people standing on railway stations waiting to get onto overcrowded carriages. There were people on buses, standing room only, all of them making their way to work, to open their shops and to work in their factories, childcare centres and mines, all of them starting work today-some of them in the early hours of the morning, some of them having worked all night-and tomorrow they'll do exactly the same. This parliament disrespects those people when we pull up stumps at half-time and go home. It is absolutely disgraceful that this  government is so frightened of doing something decent for the refugees on Nauru that the work of the parliament stops. The rot set in with this government when they knocked off a parliamentary sitting day so they could knock off a leader. They actually cancelled parliament to roll Malcolm Turnbull, and it has just got worse since then. You can look at their speakers' lists. The speakers' lists this week have been so instructive, haven't they? Long lists of Labor people have been prepared to speak on government bills, while there has been no-one, sometimes, from the government side on some bills-not a person. Look at the imbalance on these speakers' lists. It has happened day after day. Then we got the calendar for next year. There are 10 sitting days in 8 months. No wonder people are disgusted by this part-time parliament. Now, tonight, they're preparing to scurry away from their failure. This is the 20th year that I have been here, and I think that almost every year we have sat late-sometimes through the night, sometimes through the next day. I've been here heavily pregnant, sleeping on a couch at 3 am in the morning, coming down to divisions, working through the night and working the next day to get it done, just as Paul Keating did when the Mabo legislation was being debated in the Senate and he held the House of Representatives back until that debate was done. They sat almost through Christmas that year-but not this lot; no, not this lot. In October, the Prime Minister said we should get rid of discrimination against gay and lesbian kids as a matter of priority. It has still not been done. They'll scurry away from here without that being done. Encryption legislation that this government has said again and again is urgent, critical and vital to keeping Australians safe over Christmas must be passed this week. They're scurrying away before that's done. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it's done, it's amended, it has been changed in the Senate. We are simply waiting for it to come back here to the House of Representatives so we can pass it. This vital legislation should be brought back to the House of Representatives so it can be passed. This House should sit until we deal with it. We are prepared to sit all night. We are prepared to sit tomorrow-but not those opposite. They'll scurry away from this one too. Their big stick divestment legislation, again, is so vital and so important. They can't stay back for half an hour to fix that up either. These people should be absolutely appalled. And do you know why this government is walking out on a job half-done? They are walking out on a job half-done because they are so frightened that the crossbench and Labor will bring sick refugees to Australia for medical treatment on the advice of doctors. By their own measure, they are prepared to endanger national security because they're so frightened of doing the right thing by refugees on Nauru. We heard that the Prime Minister was talking-he was revving up his party room by saying that there would be full engagement with the enemy. He means us. He doesn't mean those on his backbench who are undermining him! 'There'd be full engagement with the enemy.' Well, this is a government in full retreat. It is in full retreat. Ms Rowland: White flag!",116
147,Ms PLIBERSEK,ADJOURNMENT,"They have run up the white flag. They are scuttling back to their electorates in shame because they are so frightened of Labor and the crossbench doing the right thing, combining to do something that Australians are in favour of, that they're prepared to give up what they say has been most important this year in keeping Australians safe. Groom Electorate",117
148,Dr MCVEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," As the 2018 calendar year draws to a close, here in parliament I have the opportunity to be the last to address the House for this year. I was interested-quite impressed, in fact-to see the Toowoomba Chronicle newspaper reveal just yesterday that Toowoomba and the surrounding area's gross regional product hit $10.81 billion in 2017-18, marking a growth rate of some 4.5 per cent. Our mayor, Toowoomba Regional Council Mayor Paul Antonio, recognises these figures that The Chronicle reports as being essentially double the national and state averages for economic growth. He said: The latest figures are extremely encouraging and demonstrate how the Toowoomba Region continues to raise a high bar, not just throughout Queensland, but also nationally … I reflect upon that impressive result, those impressive figures, those nation-leading figures, from my region, and I reflect on the infrastructure that's been put in under private investment and certainly public investment, particularly from the coalition government here in Canberra. There is the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, nearing completion in the coming months. There is inland rail, which promises to be a boon not only for our region but for the entire region from Melbourne to Brisbane, and there are the export and import opportunities that that provides, particularly for farmers throughout Victoria, New South Wales and, of course, Queensland. The James Street culverts in my town of Toowoomba are all about  a recent investment from the federal government to complete the jigsaw puzzle, if you like, to prevent the sorts of floods we saw in 2011 that took life away in our city. There are the mobile black spot towers throughout our region. There is the continued upgrade to the Warrego Highway, the LifeFlight helicopter base investment on behalf of the federal government and of course the RSPCA centre to be developed in Toowoomba-a real resource for southern Queensland, not only our own region. Beyond that infrastructure investment, I've reflected upon business throughout our community, business certainly in the Toowoomba city and also that developing in Highfields, in Cambooya, and of course in Greenmount, where I've been working with small businesses just in recent months. I reflect upon the efforts of the FKG Group and particularly the Pulse Data Centre-which promises, in fact, tens of thousands of jobs, given what it will generate in our community in the coming decades-and of course the Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, which has been developed in recent years. It is the first to be developed-in this case, a private development-for many, many decades. I reflect on our wonderful education sector: the University of Southern Queensland, with the main campus in Toowoomba; the southern Queensland TAFE, in Toowoomba as well; and most particularly our wonderful schools, our primary schools and our secondary schools, some of which are boarding schools serving not only northern New South Wales but southern Queensland as well. I reflect on our traditional agricultural industries: grain, cotton, beef-the processing and the export activities in beef in particular in our region-and, of course, other intensive horticulture and livestock production as well. I reflect on our expanding services sector-aged care in particular for our region-energy, resources, the Acland coalmine and what's happening in terms of gas in our region, solar in our region and wind in our region. We have all of those technologies in and around Toowoomba. I reflect in particular on small business, and I am so pleased to be part of a government that is focused on small business. It's those small and family businesses, well over 16,000 of them in the electorate of Groom, that are the heart and soul of our community, the main employers collectively in our community. They are supported by the Oakey Chamber of Commerce, the Pittsworth District Alliance, the Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce and Toowoomba and Surat Basin Enterprise. They, like the rest of our community, will step up with the challenges going forward: finalising inland rail, drought, PFAS contamination and getting the NDIS right for those who need it. Finally, I recognise at the end of the day the community. We are refugee focused. We're a refugee-friendly city. We've got more work to do there in terms of funding; there's no doubt about that. I recognise the schools that I've mentioned and our health sector in particular. The fact that our community came together so well just recently for Remembrance Day, right across the region, shows that we really do reflect on those who went before us and those who fought for our region. Toowoomba, the Darling Downs and the Groom electorate extend their regards to the rest of Australia at Christmas, and, Mr Speaker, I do the same to you. Debate interrupted. House adjourned at 17:00 QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS Assistant Treasurer MR MORRISON: In question time today, I took on notice a question from the Member for MCMahon in relation to the Assistant Treasurer. [House Hansard, 5 December 2018, 15:09] For the benefit of the House, I am advised that the Assistant Treasurer has not attended any LNP event with the Australian Small Business and Family Ombudsman. I am also advised that the Assistant Treasurer has not organised or hosted any LNP event that included the Australian Small Business and Family Ombudsman.  Thursday, 6 December 2018",117
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Ms Vamvakinou) took the chair at 10:00. NA Eureka Stockade: 164th Anniversary Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (10:00): In the history of Ballarat there are many defining moments, but Eureka is one of the most significant. The events of the Eureka Stockade are well known across Australia, and this week marks their 164th anniversary. Those who died at Eureka lie buried in Ballarat's old cemetery, where each day a Union Jack is raised over the dead of the redcoats and the colonial police, while a Eureka flag is raised over the fallen miners. At Eureka, the door was opened for Australia's democratic future. The colonial authorities tried to hold back the coming tide of change, but within months the leaders were acquitted by a jury of their peers. The jurors were unwilling to sentence those charged for an action which had such broad political sympathy and support. Less than a year after the battle, the miners' leader, Peter Lalor, took his seat in parliament. The arm he lost to a British bullet was forever a reminder that this democratically elected leader had not long before had to fight for those rights. While Eureka is important because it saw individuals unite to fight for their rights, it is more significant for being the exception. Its bloody circumstances never had to be repeated in Australia's history. Future advances in Australia's democracy came peacefully, with discussions, strikes, protests and conventions, not with bayonets and bullets. Thankfully, Eureka stands alone in our nation's history. Never again on Australian soil would such defined instances of rebellion mark the cause of democracy and rights. While the miners lost the battle at Eureka, their ideas won out. The Italian miner Raffaello Carboni described the people of Eureka as being 'of all nations and colours' who gathered to 'salute the Southern Cross as a refuge of all the oppressed from all countries on earth'. It would be over a century before Australia embraced its destiny as a multicultural nation. These words were well and truly ahead of their time. The demands of the Ballarat Reform League, a copy of which hangs in my office here in parliament, called for full and fair representation, manhood suffrage, payment of members of parliament and no property qualification for members of the legislative council, demands which would soon become law and, over following generations, would expand to the full democracy that we cherish today. These ideas weren't perfect. They saw no place for women within Australian politics and certainly no place for certain races within Australian society, but they were certainly a start. The fight at Eureka for democracy, representation and unity is one which remains important to all of us, and all Australians, today. It is something that we should reflect on each December in the commemoration of the events that occurred in Ballarat but which had ramifications across the state and across the nation for years and years to come. Berowra Electorate: Schools",119
150,Mr LEESER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Berowra has 51 government, independent and Catholic schools teaching over 26,000 students. The teachers and staff do a remarkable job educating the children in our area. Berowra is bolstered by dedicated parents who play an active role in their children's education. I'm very proud of all the schools in my electorate. A vibrant government, Catholic and independent school sector ensures parents retain the choice of where to send their kids to school. Commonwealth funding of non-government schools takes the pressure off the state system while providing increased competition to the education sector. This ultimately raises standards across the board. Today I want to particularly focus on some of the Catholic schools in my area. One of the great privileges of my life was the four years I spent working at the Australian Catholic University, whose fundamental role is the preparation of teachers for Catholic schools. Catholic education is vital to the future of the Catholic Church, and the future of the Catholic Church is vital to the moral ecology of the nation. One of the strengths of the Catholic Church in Australia has been the school system, where children can have a good education, with the marriage of faith and reason in the context of the faith tradition of their parents. I'm a huge supporter of Catholic education in Australia and in my electorate. In Berowra there are four Catholic systemic schools that teach around 4½ thousand students. Catholic schools play an important role in educating children in our community. I recently had the pleasure of attending and addressing Parents and Friends Association meetings at the two schools in my electorate that form part of that Broken Bay diocese. On Wednesday, 21 November I attended the AGM of St Agatha's at Pennant Hills. I want to acknowledge St Agatha's school principal, Kevin Bauer, and the  newly elected P&F members, president Gemma Haggenmueller, vice-president Katrina Travers and treasurer Nidhi Pereira. I also want to acknowledge Jocelyn Hordern-Smith, who has previously served as a very good president of the P&F. I also attended the P&F AGM of St Bernard's in Berowra on Wednesday, 14 November, and I want to acknowledge their school principal, Jeanette Fowles, and the P&F president, Melanie Lord. I also want to acknowledge secretary Sam Conyngham, treasurer Steve Fitzpatrick, pastoral care director Meagan Rice, diocese and council representative Amanda Tindale, and Tracy Parker, who always keeps St Bernard's at the top of my mind. Our government is delivering a record $93½ billion recurrent funding to Catholic, independent and government schools across New South Wales from 2018 to 2029. Nationally, Catholic schools will now receive a record $102.4 billion through our funding package. Funding of non-government schools grows by over 70 per cent in the package. The package is sector blind and will deliver choice and affordability for parents and students. We've listened to the Catholic schools, particularly in the diocese of Broken Bay. I acknowledge their director, Peter Hamill. Our package has addressed the concerns of Catholic schools. No government in the history of the Commonwealth has invested as much in schools as our government. We're committed to better school funding arrangements for all schools. We're committed to improving literacy and numeracy standards that deliver better student outcomes. We're the most trusted government to provide quality education-that's paid for-for our children. Festive Season",119
151,Mr KHALIL,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," As the year draws to a close I think all of our minds wander to the holiday season to come, that joyful time of the year where we can celebrate and spend time with our loved ones, our family and our friends. But, in truth, the holiday and celebration season in my electorate of Wills has been ongoing for the past month or so, with many different cultures and religions celebrating their festivals. Early in November the Anatolian Alevi community celebrated the Abdal Musa celebration, where the traditions of unity and togetherness are preserved. The Abdal Musa feast has been celebrated by the Anatolian Alevis since the 14th century. Also early last month, the Hindu community celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, to signify the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance and hope over despair-all I think very good messages for this place. And in late November the Muslim community in my electorate came together to celebrate Mawlid, a very special time for Muslims around the world, celebrating the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. Earlier this week the Jewish community began their celebrations of Hanukkah, also known as the festival of lights, a celebration of hope and freedom. Of course, as we go into December, we can say that Christmas party season has begun in earnest. For Christians, of course, it is a significant time, marking the birth of Jesus. It's a tribute to our thriving multicultural society that these holidays and celebrations are opportunities for all of us to develop friendships and a deeper understanding of those with different faiths and cultural backgrounds. But there are other celebrations coming as well. The year 12 exams have been finished, and I'm sure every student is very happy to mark the end of their high school career. Of course all other school students are excited with the end of term 4 just around the corner and the summer holidays starting or already started. This is all in the build-up to the end of this year and the start of the new year. Obviously it is an arbitrary date decided before any of us were here to have input to it, but it's an undeniable fact that there's a sense of rejuvenation in the air when you get into the new year. It gives us time to reflect and come to terms with what has happened in the past yearand a lot has happened-and allows us to reflect and look ahead with hope at the year ahead. That's the common thread of all those holiday seasons and festivals: hope. Although things don't always go to plan or go the way we want them to, our humanity and the intrinsic nature of what we are means that we will always strive to work together to make things better for those around us, our friends, our family and the broader community. Here, as members of parliament, we also seek to do that for millions of Australians around the country. I want to congratulate the graduating class of 2018. Enjoy the holiday. To all the people of Wills, whether you celebrate Diwali, Mawlid, Hanukkah, Christmas or even Festivus, have a wonderful time with family and friends and a happy new year. Higgins Electorate: Christmas Card Competition",120
152,Ms ODWYER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"Higgins-Minister for Women and Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations) (10:09): Christmas is fast approaching. Decorations are lining our local shopping strips and front yards as Australians prepare for the festive season. I was very pleased to host again my annual Higgins Christmas card competition at the Metro Gallery in Armadale last week. We received over 600 entries from primary schools right across Higgins. I invited students to draw or paint their Christmas wish. The overwhelming theme of their entries was the importance of family and giving to those who are less fortunate, as well as requests, of course, for a puppy and the  latest LEGO set. The fantastic drawings and paintings were brightly coloured and filled with Christmas cheer. Many of them are now brightening up the windows of my corner office in Malvern. Local award-winning artist, Vicky Watts, and editor of Domain magazine, Emily Power, joined me on the judging panel, and what a tough task that was with so many brilliant entries! I congratulate the recipients of the 12 Days of Christmas Award. They are: Max Dorey, De La Salle College; Starla Tong, Korowa Anglican Girls' School; Honey Dee Lawson, Loreto Mandeville Hall; Oliver Milus, Murrumbeena Primary School; Aayush Saini, Oakleigh Grammar; Aimee Herington, Sacre Coeur; Sophie Bailey, Sacre Coeur; Jemma Greich, Solway Primary School; Milla Cohen, St Catherine's School; Tilly Marshall, St Cecilia's Primary School; Alexandra Foundas, St Roch's Primary School; and Elinor King, Windsor Primary School. And, of course, I'd like to congratulate the winner of this year's competition, Isabella Benvenuto from Sacre Coeur. Isabella's painting had an Australian theme and a tribute to our coat of arms, with a kangaroo and an emu overlooking a beautiful Christmas tree. I'm delighted to feature Isabella's work on the front of my official 2018 Christmas card. Christmas is, of course, a time to think of others, especially those who are less fortunate than ourselves. For many families, this time of year can be especially difficult. That's why I'm pleased to again partner with St Joseph's Outreach Service and local bookseller Jeffreys Books to help local families in need through our Higgins Christmas Appeal. Books will be donated again to the Smith Family. Over the past two years, more than $7,000 worth of books-hundreds and hundreds of books-have been donated. I want to thank everyone who has contributed to this year's appeal and those who have contributed to past years appeals as well. It is truly amazing to be part of such a generous and thoughtful community. For those who are thinking about it, if you go to my website, you can, in fact, donate. I want to wish everyone a very happy, a very merry and a very safe Christmas. I want those who face challenging times at Christmas to know that we're thinking of you and that we will be there to support you as well. Thank you. Petition: Broadband",120
153,Mr KEOGH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In 2013, Malcolm Turnbull promised that every Australian household would have the NBN by 2013. That deadline and Mr Turnbull have come and gone, yet still many homes and businesses in Perth's south-east have been told they'll have to wait until at least 2020 to be connected to the network. For many who have received it, the service has been highly unreliable and speeds are far below that advertised. Under the Liberals, the cost of the NBN has blown out to $22 billion, the rollout has been delayed and homes and businesses are connected to inferior fibre-to-the-node NBN technology. It's 'fraud-band'. That's why I've asked the people of Burt to help me tell this parliament just what a rubbish service we're receiving. Together, we're asking this parliament and the government to take into consideration the poor NBN capability of Perth's south-eastern suburbs. This petition asks the government to deliver at least fibre-to-the-curb technology to all remaining Burt residents and businesses as a matter of urgency. Currently, the NBN rollout plans for nearly seven in 10 premises to be connected with substandard fibre-to-thenode technology rather than the superior fibre-to-the-curb or fibre-to-the-premises technology found in other locations and announced with such fanfare by the government. Indeed, while some small areas of Burt are getting fibre-to-the-curb right now, others will still be waiting until 2020 and beyond to merely get fibre-to-the-node. The petition so far has grown to more than 370-that's 370 homes that are stuck, living in the 20th century-and represents thousands more who are frustrated that the suburb in which they live in Perth's metropolitan area has less access to the rest of the world than those who are only a suburb away. As I heard from one resident who lives around the corner from my office, he has a fantastic internet connection, for 2007! In this process, I've heard from a variety of constituents with a whole range of issues with the NBN. They feel that they have been left in the Dark Ages through no fault of their own. I've heard from residents who have health issues and medical alarms connected. Those residents now live in fear that, should they have a medical emergency, they may not be able to get the assistance they need. I've heard of people voluntarily signing up for excessive 4G bills just so they can stay connected. Not only is the absence of connectivity affecting these people in their ability to connect to the rest of the world; it's affecting their capacity to work. It's affecting students being disadvantaged in getting their homework done and being able to progress in their education. I present this petition to parliament today with more than 370 signatures from the people of Burt imploring the government to reconsider their NBN rollout before more people in my electorate of Burt are left behind.",121
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS, The document will be forwarded to the Standing Committee on Petitions for its consideration. It will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms to the standing order. ,121
155,Mr KEOGH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,I seek leave to incorporate the petition. Leave granted. The document was unavailable at the time of publishing. Brisbane Electorate: Sports Fields,122
156,Mr EVANS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I have an update on an important local issue in Brisbane relating to congestion, safety and parking issues and amenity along the sports fields that sit along Enoggera Creek from Downey Park in Windsor, though Herston and Wilston and up to Kelvin Grove and Newmarket. In total that precinct is home to 10 parks and 11 major sporting and community groups and at peak times, like weekends, the space is under huge pressures coming from many directions, including families and kids visiting to play sport and the needs of local residents and commuters, including around the RBWH and QUT. I've been working on this since I was elected, and to help find solutions I teamed up with the Brisbane City Council and I made the case here in Canberra for resources so that further consultation can be harnessed to shape a future vision for this community area. My view is that we need a good long-term plan to help guide future decisions and investments. Now, pleasingly, the funding has been flowing-this past month has seen further postal surveys and information kiosks-and the consultation process is being finalised. I do strongly encourage all local residents and groups around the Enoggera Creek sports fields to make sure they have their say and provide their ideas and concerns to help shape the plan going forward. The information gathered so far is already helping guide some planning actions that should help reduce some of the pressures. Just a few months ago, the Brisbane lord mayor announced in the council budget that they're resuming some adjacent land and utilising the extra space for a new sports field and community park in Windsor, which will also help with easing pressures on the precinct. Another recent announcement by Councillor Wines which I know some residents will be pleased to hear is that council is negotiating for the Brisbane Bandits baseball team to be relocated from Newmarket to a new location. This is about different levels of government being able to work more closely together, and this plan is not the end result; it should be just the beginning. It will help me as the federal MP and it could also help the state government and the council in our advocacy because it gives us the information and the confidence we need to make a strong case, knowing that good consultation has taken place and that the priorities of the local community have been made clear. That could involve future priorities like sizeable investments in more or better parking or it could be further environmental improvements, given the key role that the Enoggera Creek plays in the Brisbane River catchment or similar. I want to say a big thank you to local residents and groups for being so involved in the consultation processes so far and a big thank you also to the Brisbane City Council and to Councillor Wines for being so willing to work together so that we can deliver real results for our local community, which we love so much and which we want to be the very best community there is in which to live, work, raise a family and retire. Fuel Security",122
157,Ms KEAY,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise today to highlight a critical issue to Tasmanian businesses, the Tasmanian community, the Tasmanian economy and Australia as a whole, and I would think everyone would want to listen to what I have to say. We currently have a fuel security emergency on our hands, yet this government is doing nothing about it. I will note there is a Liberal senator, Senator Molan, and a Liberal backbencher, the member for Canning, who do understand what I have to say, which is pleasing, and I wish there were more who would listen to them. The government's own statistics show current reserves of fuel diesel, jet fuel and petrol sit at three weeks or less, and that includes the supply sitting out at sea on vessels. This is in contravention of the International Energy Agency's 90 day fuel stockholding obligation that has been in place since March 2012. In simple terms: as a nation, we are meant to have three months supply here on the continent; instead, we have just three weeks. There are a number of factors at play here, including the closure of four Australian petroleum refineries and the loss of a domestic shipping fleet to transport fuel to and from this country. Our fuel supply is at the mercy of the boardrooms of overseas countries, which is an absolute shame. In my electorate, we have seen these decisions at work. The Alexander Spirit, when docked in Devonport, my home town, in 2015, had its crew sacked, to be replaced by foreign labour in Singapore. And who gave the permit to allow that to occur? This Liberal government. This decision has meant that Tasmania is now entirely dependent on international ships with foreign crews to supply our fuel.  Nationally, this emergency, the lack of Australian-crewed ships, potentially has enormous ramifications. What happens in a time of conflict when the government needs to requisition ships to supply the Navy and the nation with fuel? Where will they come from? The simple answer is: nowhere, because, under this government, there will not be an Australian ship supporting an Australian effort. Also, what happens if there is another global financial crisis and international credit markets collapse, tying up foreign ships? That could happen, based on the situation with some of these international shipping countries. You could have a ship out at sea with fuel to come to Australia; that ship needs support, and nothing happens with that fuel. And then, again, Australia has three weeks fuel here. Short-sighted and ideological policy decisions from this government could see Australians paying a very heavy price. Earlier this week, I called upon this government to abandon the flawed coastal shipping legislation they're proposing, as it will potentially open Bass Strait up to more foreign-flagged ships. Tasmanian Senator Colbeck responded that the government's proposals were good for business. But his logic is flawed beyond belief. As an island state, Tasmania absolutely relies upon reliable shipping services, and Bass Strait is Tasmania's social and economic lifeline. It's about time that this government woke up, for the good of the Tasmanian economy and for our farmers and producers. (Time expired) Family Law",122
158,Mr RAMSEY,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise to relate a truly remarkable story from Port Pirie in my electorate. It's a story that pulls on the heartstrings, but it's also one that epitomises how important it is to stamp out gender biases in our family law system. My constituent David drove himself to the point of bankruptcy and suicide, going through a three-year custody battle for his daughter. The case saw David's daughter removed from a life of severe neglect and delivered into the loving care of her father when she was eight years old. When she came into David's care, his daughter was not in a good state. She was unable to perform even basic tasks like showering herself, washing her hair or telling the time. She was unable to read or write simple words and unable to do basic maths. Shortly after coming into his care, his daughter sat the three-year basic skills test; she finished at the bottom grade in every single facet of the test. That low point became the beginning of a truly inspiring story that saw David, with the support of his daughter's school, set her on a path to achieving her full potential. After the test, David spent every weeknight and many weekends at his kitchen table teaching his daughter himself. The results were astonishing. Soon his daughter mastered both spelling and maths-so much so, indeed, that she no longer had to attend the special needs class, and, soon after that, she was invited to join a class with the gifted and talented children. The year 5 basic skills, language and maths test gave evidence of her remarkable progress. She finished fourth overall. Imagine that-from bottom grade in everything to fourth in the school, in only two years. David was beaming with pride. But that was only the beginning. His daughter went on to finish third in her class when graduating from high school. After that, she completed a psychology degree at university, followed by an honours year where she won the Flinders University Medal for her efforts. She earned a PhD scholarship in forensic psychology, and she completed this at the age of 25-not bad for a girl who had special needs classes as a 10-year-old! She now works as a project supervisor in research evaluation for a private company. I am personally a very strong advocate of defeating domestic violence and the need to protect women and children. But, if David's story tells us anything, it's that modern phenomena such as working parents, child care, drugs and alcohol, mental health issues and family violence mean that every parent and case must be assessed on their individual circumstances. I don't envy any judge who is responsible for making parenting decisions. They are often placed in no-win situations. But we must make sure that our family law system always makes needs based decisions on the merits of each individual case, in a process that is fair and balanced, without any focus on gender. Currently, there is a review underway of the family law system, which was established in 1976-the first for 40 years. The Review of the family law system discussion paper poses 33 questions and makes 124 proposals. For those who have an interest in this area, I urge that they read that report and feed back into it. For David, and others like him, I strongly urge them to do that. Climate Change",123
159,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Climate change is real. Australians know that it's real. Age is no barrier to this reality. From young to old and everyone in between, the people of Australia, indeed the citizens of the world, accept the reality of human-induced climate change. At 92, Sir David Attenborough isn't urging action on climate change out of self-interest. Representing the world's people at the United Nations  conference on climate change in Poland, his message was clear: 'If we don't take action on climate change, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.' Sir David's focus is on future generations. He's calling on the leaders of the world to lead on this issue. It's the same message that we have heard from the youth of our nation-the tens of thousands of school children who know that climate change is real; our young Australians who left classes to march and demand real leadership from this government on the issue. What did they get from the coalition of the unwilling to act on climate change? The minister for resources rose to the occasion with this low response: The best thing you'll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue. Who is in charge of the Liberal and National parties when it comes to climate change? It's the extremists. It's those who don't believe in human-induced climate change who are fracturing this coalition and who continue to deny the reality of climate change. Australians know that climate change is a reality and they want leaders to lead. The government's latest data shows that carbon emissions are now at their highest levels since 2011 and will continue to rise all the way to 2030. That deliberate inaction from this government is risking our natural wonders, like the Great Barrier Reef. The UN Emissions Gap Report says that Australia's emissions are projected to be well above its targeted reduction of emission levels by 2030. Is it any wonder that moderate Liberals are now finding a voice? The Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations had this character assessment of the Liberal Party: 'They're homophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers.' That's from one of their own. The only way our nation will get real action on climate change is with a change of government. Labor will meet a target of 45 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. Only Labor will provide $10 billion in extra capital for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation over five years from 2019-20. Labor's action will support large-scale generation and storage projects, including solar and wind farms. A household battery program will provide concessional loans to buy solar and battery systems. Labor will provide $5 billion in capital to futureproof our energy network. Only Labor will lead on climate change and energy. Energy",123
160,Mr LAMING,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In Queensland we've got state owned power generation, making us quite unique. It also means that all the profits are basically captured by the state government. We know it was about $2 billion two years ago and $1.9 billion this year. This is a state government artificially keeping prices as high as possible for Queenslanders to make as much profit as possible out of Queenslanders. When we investigated through the ACCC, we found in some cases standing offers $369 a year more expensive for households than they need to be. Of course the federal government is going to step in in those circumstances. No-one deserves to be facing a state owned monopoly and paying those kinds of prices. That $2 billion a year profit is equivalent to $22 million in pumped up, inflated power bills in my city alone every year. It's the most vulnerable that pay it. This is not a progressive system. The poorest are paying the relatively greatest proportion of that amount of money. So we have to have a default market offer. We have to have the legislation that's in parliament today. We need to remind the Labor Party, before we get a case of group-wise pants-wetting, that it is not necessarily privatisation here; it's divestment. You can divest into more than one state owned power entity. What you can do is-and we're not going to do it for Queensland-you can have two publicly owned entities and have power responsibly divested to more than one publicly owned entity. You don't have to privatise. Let's have a look at the states that did privatise. When you go to the ACCC analysisAn opposition member interjecting",124
161,Mr LAMING,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"Show some manners. When you go to the ACCC analysis, you find that Queensland's power prices in fact have increased by 66 per cent in just 10 years, and that's higher than any other state except South Australia. How did state Labor respond? They put up a graph, as they always would. Wait for this: it's a graph with no X axis, no Y axis and no labels. I know we all went through first-year stats, but a graph has to have an X axis, labelled, and a Y axis, labelled. There was none of that, and nothing from the ACCC. We just had from Queensland Labor four lines, with Queensland running along the bottom, being the cheapest. Yes, they were the cheapest in 2016. No, they're not the cheapest anymore in 2018. That's why this government is acting, with a default offer, saving Queenslanders up to 369 bucks a year, with a reference bill so you can do realistic comparisons between retailers in a meaningful way. If you want data, go to the ACCC. Look at the average wholesale cost of power. The data is collected nationally. We don't need a state government that is so frightened of privatisation because in the end they just want to collect that $2 billion a year out of the pockets of the most needy Queenslanders.",124
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," If there is no objection from any member in the chamber, we will continue with three-minute statements until 11 am.  School Student Activism",124
163,Dr LEIGH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Lionel Murphy put it best when he said, ' Mr Neal is entitled to be an agitator,' in support of the notion that our civil society is richer when we encourage people to dissent, to complain, to speak out, on issues where they have a different view. In our schools we frequently have student representative councils and debating competitions. Here in the parliament we have the Parliament and Civics Education Rebate program, PACER, which even today is bringing to this building school students to engage in the process of parliament. It is bringing students to our national capital so they can better understand our civil society. When I was at school, I protested in Martin Place against education changes being made by Terry Metherell, an experience from which I learned a great deal, not just about education but about the process of making a difference, as students do when they join peaceful protests against laws with which they disagree. So it was surprising to hear the Prime Minister say, 'We do not support our schools being turned into parliaments,' when in fact that is what a government program does in many schools, to allow students to learn about civics. The Prime Minister has said, 'What we want is more learning in schools and less activism,' but it's a false dichotomy because, through activism, students get to learn. It was a pleasure, when we had the Climate to Parliament program, for me to go outside and meet with Luca, Sullivan and Gemma, who were concerned about unchecked climate change and its impact on the planet, who were concerned that Australia's emissions are going up rather than down. During that very same week I also hosted in my office Zahra Moinkhah, as part of the Jasiri Girls Takeover Parliament program. The Girls Takeover Parliament program was supported by 31 members of parliament. It's an innovation which pairs young women and girls with parliamentarians to ensure their voices are heard. Ninety-five per cent of the young women and girls who participate in the Girls Takeover Parliament program say afterwards that they would like to be politicians, and that is a great thing. We on this side of the House are a whisker away from having half of our party room be women. It's an important initiative, and it is something which has come through quotas and grassroots efforts. I hope Girls Takeover Parliament will do more. I also pay particular tribute to Patrick Gorman, the new member for Perth, and Senator Sue Lines for their initiative to rename the House of Representatives alcove and the Senate alcove after Edith Lyons and Dorothy Tangney-again, activism brought to parliament in the great Australian tradition. Bundaberg Community Safety and Emergency Services Expo  this Saturday from nine o'clock, beside the Bunnings Warehouse. This is a great opportunity for the people of my community to come along and, firstly, say thanks to our police, our ambos, our firies and our SES-and there will also be a presence from the Army, Navy and Air Force. If you or your kids are keen to work as a police officer or in one of those other fields, or to join the Defence Force, this is your chance to talk first hand to those who are right now in the field and doing that type of work. What a fantastic career this could be, if you enter, as you head to work every day knowing you're making a real difference to the lives of the people around you. You can be inspired by what these amazing emergency services workers do every single day. This is a chance to say thanks to those firies and rural firefighters who've worked tirelessly in the last two weeks to control the devastating fires in Central Queensland. And, while I have the opportunity, can I say I was very thankful to see the shift changes through the Bundaberg airport last Sunday. In fact, between 60 and 80 firefighters from New South Wales were changing out with crews from the same state. There were a dozen fire trucks lined up outside the Bundaberg airport. I thank all those who came to Queensland in our hour of need. The expo will also host the launch of the local Christmas road safety campaign. As we all know, it is a time of higher risk on our roads. I'd urge everyone to remember the Fatal Five. And while there are too many people to thank for this great event that is happening on the weekend, I will single out Senior Constable Mick Gray. He has worked tirelessly for almost a year to get this expo happening. He has been the driving force. I congratulate him on the work that he has done. He actually wandered into my office in March looking for help to secure Defence Force involvement, and since then he simply hasn't stopped. This expo has got bigger and bigger quite simply because of his passion and his determination to try to do the right thing locally, to try to get more of our local kids involved in the emergency services. To all those people in my community, make sure you get to the expo this Saturday and say thanks to those people who do work every day, who work shiftwork, who work nights and who work in very tough conditions, mostly in our most desperate hour of need. Once again, regarding the fires in Central Queensland, we had some great relief this week thanks to the weather. Up to 40 millimetres of rain has fallen and certainly dampened down the fires. I say to all of those who have turned out in what I would have to say are some of the toughest weather conditions for firefighting that I've seen in my lifetime, it was a very, very tough event to manage and control. I  was involved with the Rural Fire Service myself for many years. I've got an understanding of what they have to face in dealing with these difficult circumstances. I thank the community for doing what they were asked. Unfortunately, we had one loss of life in Central Queensland, but thanks to all those who turned out. Turn out for the Bundaberg Community Safety and Emergency Services Expo. Aged Care",125
164,Mr HILL,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise on behalf of Mr Bolster from my electorate. He's 97 years old. He's lived in Dandenong for 50 years in an independent living unit-feeling well at home for the last 20 years-yet, shamefully, he's still waiting for the Liberal government to approve funding for his home care package. It was first approved at level 2 in June 2017, and he got some funding at level 2 nine months later, in March this year. He was then admitted to hospital with renal failure-very serious-but he's recovered and is back at home. But he needs some extra help now with cleaning, shopping, gardening-nothing too much, you'd expect. In June 2018 he was approved for level 3, yet five months later there's no funding. He's 97 years old. The government should show some care and some respect. His family are now ringing my office desperate for help. They're telling me how much he needs this help and how they're worried he's now deteriorating further, needing some extra help with cooking and other things because he's struggling trying to do things which are now impossible for him to do. He's mentally sharp, he's clear-headed; he just needs a little bit of help from his community, from his nation, to live with some dignity in his last years at home. That sounds bad. You'd think that's bad enough, but Mr Bolster is now one of 121,000 older Australians still waiting for care: 95,000 of these older Australians are waiting for care with high needs; 70,000 have no care at all. None. Not even a package. As we've said before, the minister's response is, 'Just take what you can get.' So apparently Mr Bolster should consider himself lucky to have any care. This is an unfolding crisis in the country. The Prime Minister's response, when he was Treasurer, was to allocate 14,000 new packages over four years14,000 over four years-and yet the waiting list has risen by 13,000 just in the last three to six months! The response from the minister is, 'Call the 1800 number and see how you're going.' Over three months there were 10,000 calls to that 1800 number that were not answered. It's no exaggeration, at this point in someone's life, to say he could literally die while waiting on hold to get through on the 1800 number or waiting for just a little bit of care so that he can stay at home. I think the government need to update their website, because they've run out of categories. If you google the waiting times on the government's website-they used to have zero to three months, three to six months, six to nine months and 12-plus months-you'll see the expected waiting times for the packages now are 12-plus months, 12-plus months, 12-plus months, 12-plus months. The government should act. Moore Electorate",126
165,Mr GOODENOUGH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I inform the Chamber that my electorate office has this week relocated to new premises at 129 Grand Boulevard, Joondalup. The lease over the old office had expired and, after some 22 years, the premises were in need of maintenance due to water leaks. There was also a requirement to comply with contemporary building codes currently in force to provide disability access to all constituents and to comply with upgraded security protocols. My dedicated team of staff and I look forward to continuing to serve our constituents and the community from our new office, which is in a more central and accessible location within the civic precinct of the Joondalup CBD, with good access to public transport and car-parking facilities. Looking forward, major infrastructure priorities for the electors of Moore include widening of the Mitchell Freeway between Hepburn Avenue and Hodges Drive and the extension of it north from Hester Avenue to Romeo Road in Alkimos. East-west traffic connectivity is set to improve from next year through the construction of bridges over Wanneroo Road to permit the free flow of traffic at the congested intersections with Ocean Reef Road and Joondalup Drive. In addition, the provision of federal road funding to the city of Joondalup will improve road safety at a number of busy intersections along Marmion Avenue. The federal government has delivered $8.99 million in road funding to the city of Joondalup under the Roads to Recovery program. In addition, under Black Spot Program funding, $1.44 million has been allocated to improve road safety at 10 of the most dangerous locations in the Moore electorate. I'm pleased to be a member of the federal government which has delivered $5.5 million in financial assistance grants to the city of Joondalup in the current year to ensure the delivery of essential services for local residents. There are a number of local community projects which I actively support in conjunction with local government. To mention a few, they include the extension of the clubrooms of the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club, the provision of a sheltered bowling green at the Sorrento Bowls Club, the installation of closed-circuit television security cameras at Hillarys marina, an upgrade to lighting and facilities for the Whitford Amateur Football Club  at MACDonald Reserve, the construction of a dual-use coastal pathway connecting Burns Beach to Mindarie, and the provision of a school pedestrian crossing across the busy Marmion Avenue in Kinross. May I take this opportunity to thank all the staff in Parliament House who have provided dedicated service and assistance to me in my role during this year. Your commitment and professionalism is very much appreciated. I wish all of you a merry Christmas. Lindsay Electorate: Pensions and Benefits",126
166,Ms HUSAR,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I would rather be using this three minutes to wish everybody in my community a really happy Christmas and to thank all of the Parliament House staff-the clerks, the drivers, the security officers-who support us here in our jobs every day. But the reality is that two people I know of in my electorate have, in the last 24 hours, had their Christmas spirit severely dampened by this cruel and out-of-touch government. I rise today to talk about an issue for a carer in my electorate, Christie Green. Christie is a single mum to four beautiful kids: Tristan, Tyrone, Scarlett Rose and Carlito. All of these children have special needs. All of them have had lives of struggle. Tristan is now 16 and is supported by his mum. He has level 2 autism, ADHD, severe depression, anxiety and other behavioural issues. With four kids with special needs, it is not a surprise that Christie is supported by Centrelink payments that are designed to help families in her position. Yesterday she learnt that her carer payment had been cancelled. That's fine; we can get it back online. But Centrelink have told her that this government's instructions are to make her wait six to nine months to get her carer payment restored. We are coming into the festive season. I urge Minister Fletcher and this government, who are completely out of touch when it comes to special needs families, to do something about it. As if that were not cruel enough, Lachlan Bell, the son of another constituent in my community, Renee Bell, has a DSM5 diagnosis of level 3 autism. He has social communication issues. He has type 1 diabetes and epilepsy. He's non-verbal and totally incontinent. This morning Renee woke up to the news that her son's NDIS package has been slashed by 70 per cent. His diagnosis and his needs have not changed by 70 per cent in just 12 months, and it is an absolute disgrace that Renee is coming into Christmas with the uncertainty of what funds will be available to help her support her child. Renee is also a single mum. She has two other children. Olivia also has a diagnosis, and her funding claim is also about to be reassessed. This is nothing but out-of-touch cost savings by a very cruel, out-of-touch government, and I would urge Minister Fletcher and his assistant minister, Sarah Henderson, to ensure that this is fixed before Christmas and that their office and their departments are doing their jobs. I am sick and tired of rising on my feet week after week in this place, dealing with these same issues. This is not a one-off; this is, unfortunately, a pattern. It is a pattern of behaviour that the government will be happy to continue to repeat for families like Christie's and Renee's. I have absolutely no doubt that this Prime Minister will rock up somewhere on Christmas Day with a fancy hat and serve meals to those people he is absolutely disadvantaging-people like Christie and Renee, who will probably have to turn up to these things in order to put food on their family's table. It is cruel and out of touch. Fiji: General Election Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (10:46): I would like to start by congratulating the people of Fiji on the success of their national election on 14 November, their second since the return to parliamentary democracy in September 2014. Congratulations to Prime Minister Bainimarama on his re-election. It is also pleasing to note the increase in the number of women members of parliament. Ten weeks ago a multinational observer group was established at the invitation of the Fijian government to observe their 2018 Fijian general election. The MOG undertook a program of work, observing all key electoral processes and meeting a wide range of stakeholders. This was only possible through the hard work of the 25 long term observers and MOG secretariat staff. I particularly thank Alice Cawte and her team. Overall the MOG consists of 77 observers from a range of countries, including Senators Ian Macdonald and Claire Moore from the Australian parliament. I was honoured to be a co-chair, along with Mukesh Sahu from India and His Excellency Wajid Fauzi from Indonesia. The findings of our interim report, handed down on 16 November, were formed through the systematic collection of information by all of our observers, who visited more than 460 polling stations on election day across all four divisions, and reflected a consolidated view of their observations and perspectives from prepolling and election day as well as the weeks preceding it. While the campaign was robust, election day was peaceful and free of any security incidents. The MOG was impressed by the professionalism and transparency of the Fijian Elections Office and their staff. The successful conduct of election day was a testament to this professionalism and their degree of preparation.  While the counting process itself can be time-consuming, this is a result of the high numbers of checks and balances. All votes are counted by hand and by multiple election officials in the full view of party political agents, if they wish to observe. This means it is difficult for errors to occur and easy for observers and political party agents to follow. Voter information awareness campaigns since the last election have been extensive, and this led to a good level of understanding of how to cast a vote under the still relatively new electoral system. Despite voting being non-compulsory, there was a 71 per cent voter turn-out. Women participated actively as both candidates and voters, and there was a strong female representation in the administration of the election. The MOG's assessment was that the outcome reflected the will of Fijian voters and that they were able to exercise their right to vote freely. Integral to this result was the hard work, dedication and professionalism of the FEO. Most of all, I thank the Fijian people, including the communities, the chiefs, the turaga ni koro and the everyday people, for being so open to us with their views on the electoral system and for welcoming us so warmly. Eden-Monaro Electorate: Forestry Industry Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (10:49): On Tuesday night I think we all enjoyed being together with the Parliamentary Friends of Forestry and Forest Products group for their Christmas drinks. I was particularly keen to attend that event-and I was able to catch up with wonderful friends there-because Eden-Monaro is one of the most important regions in the whole of this nation in relation to forestry, particularly the plantation industry. It was good to catch up with Bill Hurditch, an old friend of mine working in the forestry sector, to talk about the proposal for a South West Slopes regional forestry hub. The Softwoods Working Group have put a really worthwhile and impressive document together on seeking to establish that hub. My region is currently a massive plantation timber estate comprising 125,000 hectares, and it generates the largest socio-economic presence of any softwood region in Australia. It's supporting 5,375 jobs directly in flow-on and is contributing, in gross economic terms, over $2 billion per year. Obviously, this would be a very important project. We need to expand our timber resources. We need to give our farmers the ability to diversify their incomes. When Labor introduced the Carbon Farming Initiative under our previous climate change plans and the Clean Energy Future package, it provided the economic dynamic that was going to drive investment in this kind of carbon sequestration, which would then enable people who invest in forests to not only earn money at the 10to 25-year mark but earn money throughout their lives from those forests. We were going to enable farmers to get together and aggregate to give the scale that's necessary and have brokers work for them to make the arrangements. Some of that is happening at a micro-level at the moment. I met a farmer in Bombala the other day who's done a deal with the ANWE chip mill to plant forestry on his property and participate in that enterprise. Not only is this a way to go forward on sequestering carbon and contributing to our battle against climate change but it's generating thousands of jobs, it's great for the economy and it gives me the way forward to gradually wean our chip mill in Eden off native forest logging and on to pure plantation. I think they're hovering at around the 40 per cent mark on plantation resources. We have the scope within our region to expand our resource to enable that transition to happen completely and then use our native forests for ecotourism and carbon sequestration. Labor did a great job in government at enabling the metrics to be placed around forests to bring them into emissions trading schemes. That is what they've highlighted in the submission, saying: 'Securing an effective carbon price for sequestered carbon will drive a process like this.' That's what the industry's calling for. That's what we need. That's what Labor will deliver: the economic framework to allow great developments like this forestry industry expansion for our nation's interests. Dunkley Electorate: Sports Facilities Dunkley Electorate: Nepean School",127
167,Mr CREWTHER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Firstly, I want to wish all local residents in Dunkley a merry Christmas and a happy new year. It is an important time of year to spend time with our families, our parents, our grandparents and our young ones. Supporting young people and local families has been a passion of mine since I was elected nearly 2½ years ago. I've fought persistently hard to ensure that our local sporting clubs and community clubs have the support and the facilities they deserve to engage our youth and create a healthy environment for all to enjoy. My ongoing advocacy for grassroots sports facilities in Dunkley has been reflected in many of the meetings I have had with the Minister for Sport and other ministers so that we can continue to fund our local tennis, soccer, football, cricket, basketball, netball, baseball, bowling and other facilities. I'm also proud to have delivered for many clubs across Dunkley, whether it's under the Stronger Communities Program, the Community Development Program or other funding rounds. But there is always more fighting to be done, and I will continue to advocate for local clubs in Dunkley. Most recently, I've been advocating to the Minister for Sport for funding for Langwarrin Tennis Club. I was pleased to previously secure funding for solar  panels for their club to assist them in lowering their electricity costs, as well as $3 million for a new multipurpose facility at Lloyd Park for tennis and other uses. They're also in need of upgraded courts, lighting and the redevelopment of the tennis club, so I've been fighting hard for improvements to their club house and surroundings. I'm also fighting for the completion of the Frankston Dolphins Junior Football Club clubroom upgrade and fitout and the netball courts. The coalition government previously provided funding of $300,000 for new lighting at the ground, which has been completed across the two ovals, and I'm further advocating for funding to complete their clubroom upgrade and fit-out as well as their amazing new netball courts. This project would hugely benefit from the funding they are seeking. Our electorate needs these facilities and our players and users deserve them. Separately, I would like to mention the situation of Nepean School in Seaford. A few months ago, Nepean School, which services people living with a disability in my electorate, had a $12,000 teepee burnt down by vandals. After that-and it was reported in the local media-I set up a GoFundMe page calling for donations to help rebuild the teepee and other facilities for children with a disability. We received nearly $2,000 of donations for that. I'm also proud to announce today that, in a partnership with 123Read2Me through our Stronger Communities Program funding, I've secured an additional $5,000 towards that project and $1,500 has been contributed in kind through material for the teepee. That means that we have several thousand dollars now committed. I call for people to donate further funding at the link I mentioned to enable the teepee and other facilities to be completed. Workplace Relations",128
168,Ms CHESTERS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Last week we had a visit to the parliament from people who work in a lot of low-paid industries-members of United Voice, workers-coming to tell us their experience of enterprise bargaining under the current system. It's a simple fact: wage growth is at its lowest since 1991. We have an industrial relations bargaining system equally as old as that statistic. What we know is that the current system is not working for the majority of workers in our economy. One in four workers relies upon the awards system for their wages. It is barely the legal minimum, and in many cases these workers are earning less than $700 a week-$700 to pay for everything: rent, clothing, car insurance, food, medical bills, energy bills, you name it. Yet what we haven't heard from this government is any plan on how to genuinely lift these workers off the minimum, to empower them to enterprise bargain. They have been locked out of the system, many saying that they feel like they're caged and trapped. Part of the problem is the nature of work today. Take one example: private contracting. Gamal Babiker shared his story. He's a contract cleaner. He has been working for Spotless cleaning for many years in shopping centres, yet when they tried to organise all the shopping centres' intercollective bargaining, Spotless used the excuse: 'If we paid higher wages, the next time the contract went out for tender we'd be undercut by somebody else because the client wasn't engaged in any way.' We've seen that happen here with the Parliament House cleaners who did strike higher wages with their contractor. The moment that this government had the chance, they put the contract out for tender. A new contractor came in, paying the award and undercutting the cleaners. There is a problem when it comes to bargaining for workers in the private contracting industries, like cleaning and security. There is also a problem when it comes to government funded sectors like early childhood education, where they have multiple employers spread across almost every single town in Australia. In early childhood education, there are over 4,000 individual workplaces and therefore employers. To collectively bargain for each of those, one at a time, would take over 4,000 years. It's just not practical. We need to start working on a better industrial action system that ensures that all Australian workers receive a pay rise. Everyone should have access to the benefits of bargaining. This will help employers, this will help industry, but most importantly it will help Australian workers. Australian Junior Sedan Championship World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation Academy World Cup Tickled Pink High Tea",129
169,Mr HOGAN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Lismore Speedway is renowned Australia wide as the track of champions, and this was highlighted again recently when local junior drivers Josh Boyd, Brock Youngberry and Connor Reeves finished first, second and third respectively in the Australian Junior Sedan Championship. The trio travelled to Cullen Bullen speedway near Lithgow last week to secure their top three placings. These young men have had great success.  I'd also like to congratulate their families for supporting and encouraging their children's endeavours: Josh's parents, Trevor and Karen; Brock's parents, Paul and Janet; and Connor's mum, Tania, and grandfather Trevor. This outstanding result also moves the tally of Australian titleholders from the Lismore track of champions to 18 in its history. Congratulations to you all. Robbie Preston recently competed in the Australasian qualifier for the World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation Academy World Cup, where he finished second. Placing second in his first qualifier event has allowed Robbie to qualify for the world cup being held in Egypt in just a few weeks. Robbie will be the only representative from Australia and indeed he is the first ever Australian to qualify for the world cup. Several years ago, at the age of 18, he suffered a serious case of glandular fever. Being unable to eat for three weeks, his body weight dropped to a low of just 45 kilograms. Soon after recovering he joined a gym and found calisthenics, and the journey began. I wish Robbie all the best. Candy Fitness from Alstonville's Candylane Fashion Boutique has for the past seven years organised an annual fundraiser-Tickled Pink High Tea-at the Alstonville Plateau Bowls and Sports Club. It's to promote local awareness and raise money for local cancer charities. Some of the people helping this year included MC Sarah Moore, Deborah Marks from Deborah Marks Weddings and Occasions, and Felicity Jay from Black Tie Photobooths. For the past couple of years the money has gone to the local cancer charity Jody's Inspiration, with nearly $5,000 handed over to Jessie and Kym last Saturday. The event, with more than 150 tickets sold, was also attended by my wife, Karen, who always says how wonderful the afternoon is, with loads of fun and committed local women raising money for others. Many local businesses support this great cause by donating prizes for raffles and games, and I thank them. Congratulations to Candy and everyone involved for a great effort.",129
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS, In accordance with standing order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. NA Electoral Matters Committee Report Consideration resumed of the motion: That the House take note of the report.,130
171,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES," This report which I'll be speaking on today, Report on the conduct of the 2016 federal election and matters related thereto, is an important document. It's an important document for democracy in this country, and also an important document to learn from the lessons of the 2016 election. It has had an incredible amount of work put into it. I want to start by acknowledging the secretariat of the committee, who have done an outstanding job in pulling together basically a 2½-year body of research. I also want to thank the former chair, Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds; the current chairman, Senator James MCGRATH; and my colleague and friend the Deputy Chair, the member for Scullin, Mr Giles, for all of his work. It's been a collegiate effort. It's been a team effort with cross-party members and some new members as well to the committee. The report covers significant matters. There is one in particular that I will be talking about today which has raised a lot of concern already. I am deeply concerned about the government's approach to this matter. For five years the Australian people have put up with the shambles of this government. Today is no different, where we're going from crisis to crisis. But the incompetence and overreach of this government may have peaked in this report that I'm holding today. I'm going to particularly focus on recommendation 12, put forward by government members of the committee, which concluded that voters must present identification to be issued with ordinary prepoll or election-day votes.",130
172,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Government members interjecting,130
173,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES,"The member for Hinkler in this chamber has just issued his support for that recommendation. He's saying it's a great idea. Where have we heard this before? Not content with tearing the government apart by their own hand, they are now trying to make it harder for Australians to have a say at elections. No wonder the government is so out of touch. I note that even the LNP leader of the state which the member for Bowman and the member of Hinkler hail from has said that their government is out of touch. That's not the Premier of Queensland or any Labor politician saying that-that is the elected leader of the state LNP. Those opposite have gone pretty quiet now as I've issued to them",130
174,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Government members interjecting,130
175,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES,"No, they've woken up again. The state LNP leader has said they are out of touch. No wonder!  We know, and the Australian community knows, that the government are out of touch and are incompetent. Now their only hope appears to be making it harder for the Australian public to show ID when they have to turn up to the election. This proposal, in my opinion, is a pathway to voter suppression. This is exactly what we saw with the former Queensland LNP state government, the toxic Newman state government. This is what they did when they were in power. I can appreciate that the member for Hinkler is a strong supporter of the former Newman government, but they were thrown out of office. There are similarities between recommendation 12 in this report and what the Newman government did. Queensland was the first and only Australian state or territory to introduce a voter ID requirement, despite no evidence suggesting the need for change. ",130
176,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES,"I started with this comment. The member for Hinkler said that he supports this proposal. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Hinkler wants it to make it harder for voters when they go to vote. Even a discussion paper initiated by the Newman government and released in January 2013, which canvassed voter proof of identify-the very recommendation we're talking about in the chamber today-stated that there was no specific evidence of electoral fraud and no requirement for this measure. But they did it anyway, resulting in a huge impact on voter turnout, which was the lowest in 30 years. They brought in this change in Queensland, and what happened? Voter suppression-the lowest turnout in 30 years. In fact, the ECQ website showed that over 15,000 voters without proof of identity documents were inconvenienced on election day and were required to make declaration votes. Further to that, the director of the Queensland Association of Independent Legal Services, James Farrell, told a subsequent parliamentary inquiry that voters who did not have appropriate ID were in some instances turned away and unable to cast their votes. That's what the member for Hinkler supports today",131
177,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Honourable members interjecting,131
178,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES,"voters being turned away. Those opposite are big on talk on freedom of the individual, except when it comes to voting. They are the government that are supporting a recommendation to stifle the voting processes for tens of thousands of Australians, making it harder for them to vote and have their say. On this side of the House, my Labor colleagues and I share",131
179,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES,"I do point out to the House that the member for Hinkler is a member of this committee. So I ask, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, where was the evidence to this joint standing committee about this issue? We are particularly concerned for those citizens most likely to be disenfranchised through such changes, including First Nations Australians, people affected by family and domestic violence, younger Australians, homeless people and itinerant people. That's why the Queensland Labor Palaszczuk government did the right thing and, with their very first bill of the 2015 parliament, did away with these draconian voter ID laws. They removed discriminatory and unnecessary voter proof of identity requirements introduced by the toxic former Newman government. Much effort has been put into increasing electoral participation in Australia and into engaging with population groups which have historically been less likely to vote or which face particular barriers to electoral involvement. You would think a government of Australia would want more Australians participating in the democratic process. You would think that members from my home state, such as the member for Hinkler, would want more citizens to have their say. But, at this particular junction in our nation's history, is there perhaps a reason why the LNP do not want voters to have their say? I invite the member for Hinkler to speak on this report today. Mr Laming interjecting",131
180,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES,"Well, he wasn't listed. He wasn't going to bother to speak, but now he's going to scribble down some notes! I want him to provide the evidence-not the evidence that he's given to the chamber today, saying, 'You need to provide ID when you go to the RSL.' That's apparently what you've got to do. We have had a parliamentary inquiry into this for 2½ years. I know that, before the member for Hinkler became a member of this committee, he may not have been as interested in this. I sat through evidence in hearing after hearing. Mr Laming interjecting",131
181,Mr DICK,COMMITTEES,"If the member for Bowman has evidence to provide-it is a little bit late after the fact-if there is strong evidence which the committee hasn't received, which no member of the government provided, which no member bothered to turn up and provide to the committee, let's have it today. We'll be grateful if we've got experts, academics, members of the public, who are calling for this-not members of the LNP government in Australia, who are trying to suppress voters. It is unnecessary. It was unnecessary under Campbell Newman and it  is unnecessary now. I simply ask members of the government to reject these draconian and out-of-touch propositions that the government has put forward. I note that the Queensland LNP state leader, as I said earlier in my remarks, called the government 'out of touch' today. We know that on this side of the chamber. The Australian community know that this government has lost its way, isn't governing, is only worried about tearing itself apart. But we are seeing a proposition in this report today, in recommendation 12, that the government wants to suppress voting in Australia. It tried this before, in 2013. It tried that as part of this committee, and it was rejected. Yet we are seeing the chair today, Senator MCGRATH, going out and saying that people should be forced, compelled, to provide photographic identification when they turn up. We know what happened when Queensland was the only state or territory in the nation's history to demand that. Voter suppression increased; 15,000 people weren't able to have their say in an easy manner. If there is evidence about voter fraud, if there is evidence that this is an issue, sure, let's have that discussion. No evidence? No result. We will not be supporting that recommendation. (Time expired)  the member for Oxley. He did get off to a good start, I'll give him that. It is a collegiate committee, where people work very well together. But it did go downhill from there, I've got to say. The purpose of this recommendation is quite simply to ensure that people understand their democratic responsibility. I am absolutely certain that every single member of the Labor Party in this place could be found making a quote that sounds exactly like this-they say to their constituents and supporters: 'Vote early and vote often.' I have heard it dozens and dozens of times. This is a strong recommendation for democracy in this place. You need a licence to get into a sporting club. You certainly need identification to open a bank account. You need a driver's licence in order to drive, and you have to have it with you. There are any number of places where you need identification-why not for our democracy? Quite simply, you get your opportunity to vote and you are aware of what is required. It is a good recommendation. I support the position of the chair, Senator James MCGRATH. I say to the member for Oxley: we gave him the authority to make statements on behalf of the committee, as we have done for others, and I think there is absolutely the ability for him to do that. He is well informed, he is well versed and it is a very strong position. I would also say to the opposition, given that they raised the Queensland government many times, that it was a Queensland Labor government that went against the Fitzgerald inquiry recommendations and brought back full preferential voting for the state parliament. It is just hypocrisy to stand in this place and make those claims. An honourable member interjecting recommendations, which the Queensland Labor government went against. However, I'll go back to the beginning. It has been a collegiate committee. The committee members have worked very well together in the short time that I've been on it. We support all of the recommendations bar a couple. I think that is a good outcome for democracy. I support Senator James MCGRATH, the chair. Debate adjourned. NA",131
182,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT, I move: That the Federation Chamber do now adjourn. Queensland: Arts,132
183,Ms BUTLER,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak today about a very important issue for the people of my electorate on the south side in Brisbane and the people of Queensland more broadly-that is, how Queensland deserves its fair share of federal arts funding. A little while ago I was assisted by the Parliamentary Library-the excellent Parliamentary Library-in getting a sense of Queensland's share of federal arts funding. You might be surprised to hear that in 2014, even though the population of Queensland was about one-fifth of the national population, we only got 4.62 per cent of the Australia Council arts grants and 4.63 per cent of the Department of Communications and the Arts grants. In 2015 it was a better year, with 11.7 per cent and 11 per cent respectively, but, again, we had about 20 per cent of the population of the country. In 2016 it went back down to 10½ per cent for Australia Council arts grants and just over seven per cent for communications and arts department grants. In 2017 it was 10 per cent of the Australia Council arts grants, and down to 1.97 per cent of the communications and arts department grants. And in 2018, at the time that we got this research from the Library, it was 11.89 per cent of the Australia Council arts grants and 2.82 per cent of communications and arts department grants. We shouldn't be in a situation where we have one-fifth of the population, but only get between two per cent and 10 per cent of the arts funding from the different sources. That's not a fair situation, and Queenslanders deserve  better. Queenslanders deserve a fair share of federal arts funding. Queensland has an excellent arts community and arts institutions, and I note there are many Queenslanders in the room who I'm sure would agree with that proposition. It's time we saw some redress in relation to the inequality in federal arts funding. I do represent a Brisbane seat, but the great thing about Queensland arts institutions is that, because we are such a big and decentralised state, they go on the road. They absolutely do everything they can to make sure that they have performances in major regional centres, and also in small regional and remote towns. And some of the performances actually originate outside of Brisbane, and then Brisbane gets the second or third go at them. One of the really wonderful arts organisations that we have based in my electorate of Griffith is Queensland Theatre. Queensland Theatre would be known to everyone in this building. I took the opportunity once, when I was sitting next to the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, on a plane to mention to him, 'Say whatever you like about theatre companies in Sydney, but none of them have put on a theatre production about a rugby league team.' I support the Cowboys; people probably already know that. Queensland Theatre had a production called The Longest Minute, and that was about the last few minutes of the grand final between the Cowboys and the Broncos. I think we were probably the noisiest household in Cannon Hill that night. A government member interjecting",132
184,Ms BUTLER,ADJOURNMENT,"Queensland either way! That was a wonderful production from Queensland Theatre. To have a play, domestically written, domestically performed, about Queenslanders' rugby league passions and about the many, many, issues that intersect with our support of rugby league-community, race, class, gender; all of those things together-in a really Queensland setting demonstrates the value of Queensland organisations telling Queensland stories. I want to see organisations like Queensland Theatre, and of course all of the many other arts organisations in Queensland, get a fair go, and they need to get a fair go from the Commonwealth. A good starting point is this. I've got in my electorate the Bille Brown Theatre, which is where the Queensland Theatre company holds the majority of its performances. It's undergoing a massive project at the moment to refurbish it, to turn it into a different style of theatre. It's absolutely wonderful what has been done to create a new performance space for Queenslanders, and I've been very proud to personally make a financial contribution to the Bille Brown Theatre. The Queensland government has made a contribution to the Bille Brown Theatre. I'd like to call on the Commonwealth government to make a contribution to the Bille Brown Theatre. It's really important that we support this important production company and theatre company. We also need to support local arts. Many electors in my electorate of Griffith have signed petitions online and on paper to call for the Commonwealth to support this project. I would love to see the Commonwealth step up and make a contribution to the Bille Brown Theatre, and I call on the government to do so. Hinkler Electorate: Employment  provision of local jobs. Local jobs do not occur in regional areas without strong regional economies, and the federal government, this coalition government, is doing everything it can to drive more local jobs into my electorate of Hinkler. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may or may not know it, but we have some of the worse statistics in the country when it comes to unemployment. Unfortunately-and it is unacceptable-the youth unemployment rate for the Wide Bay statistical area is currently around 28 per cent. Our broader unemployment rate is around nine per cent, and we have a per capita median income of just $34,000 per annum. When I talk to my local constituents, we deal with many issues; none of them is more important than the provision of more local jobs. What are we doing as a government? Under the Regional Growth Fund round recently announced, we have provided a grant of $19 million to Bundaberg Brewed Drinks-the famous soft drink factory that makes Bundaberg ginger beer and delivers it right around the world-to build a $156 million superbrewery, which will provide 213 or more jobs in construction and 147 postconstruction. That might sound like a lot but-to give you an idea, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - they currently process about 650 tonnes of ginger a year for their soft drink; this new factory will require 6½ thousand tonnes of ginger. It is a massive increase and an incredible contribution from a local, family owned company. Under the Building Better Regions Fund we have provided $3.7 million for stage 2 of the redevelopment of the Mon Repos Turtle Centre. Loggerhead turtles nest in only a couple of locations around the world, and one of those is Mon Repos beach. This will ensure that we can provide a good experience for visitors, whether they're visiting in season or out, which of course helps with our local tourism industry and provides more local jobs. The Royal Flying Doctor Service will receive $3 million so that they can build and fit out a new aeromedical base and patient transfer facility in conjunction with the helicopter service at Bundaberg airport. This $6 million joint hangar facility will provide much better transfer facilities for patients. We have over a thousand patient  transfers from that airport every single year. It will help people right around the district and right around rural Queensland, not just those in my electorate. A smaller one but no less important is the $68,913 grant to the Bubs and Kids facility at the Coral Coast community church. They'll build a new permanent building for baby's and children's clothing. This local community group provides these services to those who are in need. I think it's a fantastic contribution. Can I tell you, out of all the people I ring about grants, none were more excited than the representatives from Bubs and Kids. They've been doing it pretty tough working out of a container for some years but they continue to provide a wonderful service to mums and bubs in need in our area. Under the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, there is $4.68 million to Macadamias Australia. That has meant they've been able to increase the value of a proposal to $22 million. They'll build a manufacturing facility, along with a tourism facility, on Goodwood Road in Bundaberg, where their existing factory is now. They are one of Australia's largest macadamia exporters. It's a fantastic opportunity for them that will, obviously, drive more technical, highly skilled and highly paid jobs into our region. There is $2½ million to the Isis Central Sugar Mill. They intend to build an approximately $12 million railway into a new area to ensure cane supply for a factory that has been there over 100 years. They are the mainstay of the community of Childers, in the middle of my electorate. I congratulate them on one very important factor: every single year they have an intake of at least four apprentices. They are one of the few manufacturers left in our local region who take in local kids, typically the kids of farmers, and teach them a trade-whether it's to be an electrician, boilermaker or plumber or whether it's some other skill-which they can then go back and use in the local community or even just on their local farm. There is $1½ million for Austchilli for a value-adding facility, $495,000 for Costa Group to expand their avocado-packing facility, and $475,000 to Consolidated Linen Service, which is a very large linen-cleaning service in Hervey Bay. That money will allow them to expand their capacity by 25 per cent and provide all the additional jobs that go with it. We are helping out with the Building Better Regions Fund community investments stream, and one of the important grants was $17,600 to Bundaberg Regional Council for the Primary Schools Cup. It meant that almost a hundred netball teams from primary schools right around Queensland came to the new facilities in our area. It was a great economic boost, and I congratulate them all. Indi Electorate",133
185,Ms MCGOWAN,ADJOURNMENT," Colleagues and people watching, I take this opportunity to wish you a very happy Christmas and every good wish for 2019. My topic today is about the future of Indi. So many people are asking me, 'Hey, Cathy, what are your plans? What are you going to do?' So today I'd like to address this topic. I'd like to say that I'm going to continue to be the best possible representative I can be for my electorate. I'm absolutely determined that my electorate stays independent and orange because I believe that's the best way to ensure that benefits are delivered for my community and that strong, prosperous communities, which are alive with opportunities for everybody, continue to be created and supported. I'd like to share a short story about succession planning. My dad was a farmer. When he got to the age where he decided he couldn't actively farm anymore, he sent a letter to his children and said, 'Kids, come and talk to me. I'm ready to start the process.' Over the next period of time, the kids gathered in different ways, shapes and forms and had conversations with my father about the roles and responsibilities of taking over the farm, about his expectations, about the history of the farm and what he loved most about it, about the money needed, and about the time and the history. Eventually he made his decision about who he would leave our farm to. He wasn't in any hurry. He made sure that, when the handover happened, the majority of the community were happy with his decision. After he made that decision, dad stayed around as a mentor, as an adviser and as a fount of wisdom. Eventually he died in the valley where he lived, surrounded by his children and grandchildren-exactly as he wanted it. I found such inspiration in that story. I have begun the process of succession planning. My commitment to my community is like my father's. I will do this well. I will take as long as it needs. I will bring to it all the skills and ability I have to make a successful transition so that my ambition for my electorate to have the best representation it can have and to remain orange and independent will continue. But today I want to talk a little bit about my journey and where I started. I bring to the Chamber a wonderful document, Voice 4 Indi, a report of kitchen table conversations in 2013. I'm delighted that so many of the values that we talked about then are being implemented-the need for a diversity of voices and a strong voice at a national level; a commitment to encourage respectful debate and to undertake activities which build democracy; a commitment to be elegant in the way we work with our community and to be honest and respectful. It's such a lovely document. When I think about this year, I ask myself: how have I lived out the commitment I made to my  electorate in 2013? I've got four documents I'd like to share with the Chamber. They're on my web page, and, for my community, they are available from my offices. Let's talk about what we have done. We have worked really hard for a totally renewable Indi. The government has been so slow and so hard to work with on climate change, so we've taken it into our own hands. Right across my community now, terrific grassroots activism is taking place on climate change, and I'm so proud of that work. A second flyer I'll talk about is Connecting Community to Canberra-The Indi Way. This talks about how people who are interested in democracy can participate. I'm delighted that over 4,000 school students have come up here and been part of what we've been doing. Over 200 volunteers have come and worked in my office. Three of them are here today. So, to Chris, Charlie and Gary-Carole is not here at the moment-thank you for the work that you've done for me and, I know, for my community. So much work has been done. Then there is another lovely flyer about how my community has worked with me as a politician at the national level to actually get results in parliament. On the back of it is a really good way you can continue to work with my office to get things done. The final document is the Indi budget report-what people want from the government-which I use in my lobbying. But, in bringing my comments to a close, I'd like to say that this is time for Christmas, for families to gather together, and my commitment is to be around as long as it takes to work with everyone in Indi. To this end, I'm planning a summer tour in January and an autumn tour when we have our break in March, when I'll be out in my community with my little caravan, having listening posts in every nook and cranny that I can find. Please come and say hello. I'm going to be here for the long term, whether I'm a member of parliament or, like my dad, sitting on the veranda. I'm not ever going to forget Indi. Menzies Electorate",134
186,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT," Recently, a number of constituents in my electorate of Menzies came to see me about a range of issues. Some of them are to do with climate change, renewable energy and the like, and they asked me whether I would raise their concerns in this place. One group was led by Tamara Levy and another, WarrandyteCAN, had a petition, but, as it was not in the correct form to be presented to the House and they had come to discuss the issues with me, I said that I would nonetheless raise their concerns on behalf of the 99 people, and I do that today. On a second matter, I'd like to take this opportunity, as we approach Christmas, of thanking all who serve the community in my electorate. There are so many people who, on an ongoing basis, serve others within my electorate, as they do in electorates right across Australia. I'd like to mention some of those groups today. Obviously, at this time of the year, there's often a call for emergency services at a greater level than at other times. There are the local police, the ambulance officers and drivers-Ambulance Victoria has its headquarters based in my electorate-the SES workers and the CFA. We hope that the CFA and the SES have a quiet Christmas and New Year period, but, with the indication that we're going to have a warmer summer than usual, there's always the real chance that they will be called out to fight the bushfires that occur from time to time. I'd like to pay tribute to the many service clubs in the Menzies electorate, the Rotary and Lions clubs, who do wonderful work in terms of supporting the community by raising money and supporting various projects within the electorate. I also thank the seniors groups-the Chinese, the Italian, the Greek and the Macedonian seniors groups-who meet weekly at various places within the electorate. They bring a great sense of camaraderie to older people from their own particular ethnic backgrounds. They are very vibrant groups. In fact, they are so large in many instances that they're outgrowing the premises in which they meet and have to look for other venues. Their ongoing work for their local communities is something which should be acknowledged in this place, and I thank them. I also thank all the workers in the aged-care homes. There are numerous aged-care homes. Day in, day out, 24/7, the care workers, the nurses and others provide support, care, comfort and love to senior citizens within the electorate of Menzies. I'd like to thank Helen Jurcevic and the Women's Friendship Group, an organisation that brings women together on a regular basis. It provides friendship for those who may not have friends to the same extent that many others do in society. This is a wonderful organisation that's been operating for a number of years within Menzies. I thank the public transport workers. We get on a train or, as it is in my electorate, a bus, particularly over holiday periods, when we want to go from here to there or somewhere else, and we sometimes forget that there are people working at times when others are on vacation. To all the bus drivers, in particular who transport people around the electorate of Menzies, on behalf of the community, I express a very sincere thank you as well. I especially mention the volunteers who work with the major welfare agency within Menzies, Doncare, which provides wonderful services. It's staffed by professionals but also a huge army of volunteers-not only the ones who operate the various op-shops that raise money for Doncare but those who provide services through Doncare  itself. Many of the volunteers have been working for Doncare for decades, and I've been able to recognise some of them in the annual Menzies Australia Day Awards, which we'll have once again on Australia Day next year. In mentioning volunteers and people who work for the community, I'd like to take this opportunity to particularly mention the late Ray Lord, who passed away recently. Ray was a great worker for our community, a tireless worker for the community. He was particularly instrumental in the establishment of the Community Bank at both Doncaster East and Templestowe. His funeral will be held next week. He was a great worker for the local community throughout his lifetime, and it's appropriate to acknowledge him here for the work that he undertook. Finally, to all of my constituents: I wish you a very peaceful Christmas. I wish you a happy new year, a safe new year, and a holiday period in which you can rest and be with your family and friends. Let's look forward to a wonderful 2019. Queen Elizabeth Hospital",135
187,Mr BUTLER,ADJOURNMENT," The Queen Elizabeth Hospital has been a pillar of the western suburbs of Adelaide since it was opened in 1954. Initially a maternity hospital to manage the huge western suburbs baby boom of the postwar years, in 1959 it expanded to a full-service hospital for the western suburbs. Today it is an acute-care teaching hospital that provides inpatient, outpatient, emergency and mental health services to the some 250,000 people of Adelaide's western suburbs. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, or the QE as it's affectionately known in the west, has always punched well above its weight as a small suburban hospital. It was South Australia's first accredited teaching hospital. It quickly developed a reputation for research and performed Australia's first successful kidney transplant in February 1964. I've always been a strong advocate for the QEH. I love to visit the hospital to speak to the hundreds of hard working staff, nurses, doctors, researchers and others who are at the frontline of health care in the west. I'm also proud and honoured to chair the advisory committee for one of the centres of research excellence, funded by the NHMRC and based at the QEH, and have a strong relationship with the clinicians and the workers there as well. I've always stood up for the interests of the QEH and for the patients and residents of the western suburbs. I spoke out against the removal of cardiac, geriatric, oncology and palliative care services from the QEH two years ago. I was very pleased that the government then listened to the voices of the constituents of the western suburbs of Adelaide, who were desperate to retain those local services. Last time federal Labor was in government we granted the western suburbs of Adelaide its first Medicarefunded MRI machine, located at the QEH. Before this important decision, residents of the western suburbs had to travel to Ashford, up to a 40-minute drive away from some parts of my electorate, or even to Morphett Vale, up to an hour's drive away. The people who benefit most from having their services close to home, accessible and affordable are the most vulnerable members of our society. Low-income families, older Australians, the chronically ill and people with complex medical needs in the western suburbs suffered most from the lack of MRI services in the west. Because of Labor's grant of an MRI licence to the QEH, hundreds of people who needed scans for certain cancers, breast scans and scans for children could go to their own local hospital. However, the licence was only a partial licence. Many patients still have to go to the city, to the Royal Adelaide Hospital, or have to travel very long distances to get scans such as brain scans or spinal scans rebatable through Medicare. In 2014, I wrote to the then Minister for Health, the member for Dickson, regarding several applications that the hospital had made to the department for a fully rebatable MRI. I did so again to Minister Hunt this year as many clinicians have repeatedly raised the issue of MRI access for the western suburbs with me, as have a number of residents of the western suburbs themselves. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital is synonymous with health care in the west. It's the ideal place for a fully rebatable MRI machine to provide greater connectivity, access and continuity of care for patients in the western suburbs of Adelaide. It is beyond time for the residents of western Adelaide to have full and proper access to MRI services in their local community at their local hospital through a fully rebatable MRI machine. Petrie Electorate",136
188,Mr HOWARTH,ADJOURNMENT," I want to take this opportunity in the last sitting week of parliament of 2018 to say to everyone in my electorate: thank you for your contribution to Australia over the last 12 months. To all of you, merry Christmas and a happy new year. I look forward to seeing you over the next couple of weeks-we'll still be doing mobile offices, and I'll be out in the community. From parliament, merry Christmas. Thanks for your contribution, and I'm sure 2019 will be great.  This year I want to just say, as well: thank you to those people that are working over Christmas-our Defence Force personnel; emergency services; health and aged-care workers; and public transport workers, both bus and train. I also want to thank all the volunteers in the Petrie community. There are so many people who volunteer week in week out. Perhaps you're retired or perhaps you're able to volunteer on the weekends, and there's so much that you do that contributes to our local community. I think of the SES over Christmas and services like the Breakfast Club at Redcliffe, Rotary and Lions clubs, senior groups that do a lot, youth groups and, of course, over Christmas, churches as well, who often give hampers to families that are desperately in need. Thank you for that. This year, in 2018, we've been able to deliver a lot and get a lot done, particularly around infrastructure and transport. Back in 2013 the Liberal-National opposition promised a billion dollars to upgrade the Gateway Motorway, which is looking fantastic. There are six new lanes. It's almost done. There is final lane marking and pavement work to be completed, and the federal government has been assured that it will be finished by 31 December 2018, which isn't far away. That's on a state government website confirming this time frame. The state's transport and main roads department have let us know that. We've also completed the Boundary Road overpass, for which there was an $80 million federal government contribution, up at Narangba and North Lakes, which is fantastic. There have been other local roads which I have been able to secure funding for which are now completed, including King Street and Victoria Avenue at Woody Point, Macdonald Road and Main Road at Clontarf, Victoria Avenue and Robina Street at Margate and the Mustang Street to Norris Road section of Telegraph Road at Brackenridge, where it has gone from two lanes to four lanes-two lanes each way. The Brisbane City Council are still doing a bit of extra work from Mustang Street down to the Gateway Motorway. I was also able to secure that the Moreton Bay Regional Council were upgrading Henry Road at Griffin, which was a shocking road, the worse in the electorate. Thanks to them for getting that done as well. Next year there is more to be done. I've secured funding for the Deception Bay overpass at Deception Bay. That dodgy two-lane bridge will be torn down, and there'll be a new six-lane one with turning lanes like at Boundary Road. There's also additional black spot funding, rest areas and safety upgrades on the Bruce Highway and more local roads on the Redcliffe Peninsula that will be federally funded and upgraded. I've also secured a million dollars of CCTV to protect our community and keep our security strong right along the Moreton Bay Rail Link from Kippa-Ring station all the way through to Petrie, which is really important. We've also secured CCTV projects at Margate and at St Vincent de Paul at Margate, which is important. We're a growing community and sometimes that brings antisocial behaviour. Of course policing is looked after by the state government, and we're continuing to talk to them about perhaps a police beat for North Lakes. That was put forward at the last state election. I think it is desperately needed. The state government definitely needs to do a bit more there. This year we've also pumped over $790 million into the Petrie electorate to make sure that aged pensioners are funded as well as ensuring carer payments, disability support payments and Newstart allowance. In relation to disability support, we've got 1,679 people on disability employment services. I want to thank those groups that are working with people, helping them find work, and everyone who came to my jobseeker boot camps this year. I'll be holding another one in March next year as well. Thanks again for your contribution. Happy New Year and we'll see you in 2019. Calwell Electorate",136
189,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," It has been a busy and interesting year. As we approach Christmas, I'd like to reflect on some of the significant moments in my electorate that have made my job as the local member enjoyable and very rewarding-and challenging, I might say. I want to acknowledge the incredibly talented local primary school students who took part in my 2018 Christmas card cover competition. The entries were very colourful and impressive. I couldn't decide on one winner, so I chose two winners. I'd like to congratulate Aaron Alescio from the Jacana School for Autism and Sarah El Hassan from Greenvale Primary School, whose creative pieces both made it onto the cover of my 2018 Christmas cards. I want to thank the principals and staff of the primary schools for supporting and encouraging their students in the creative arts. I also want to thank all my local schools, who are terrific in the commitment and dedication they bring to their job as educators of our local students. Our Catholic schools in particular, especially Good Samaritan, Holy Child and St Dominic's, have done a tremendous job in assisting with the very large influx of refugees from Iraq and Syria. They go beyond the call of duty to help the children and their families, and I thank them most sincerely for that. In 2018 I also hosted a number of roundtables on important issues that affect my constituents' services and businesses. In July I hosted a settlement round table with Tony Burke, the shadow minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, and with Nick Tebbey, the CEO of the Settlement Council of Australia. Providing effective  employment services for migrants and refugees is a pressing issue in my electorate, and I look forward to continuing to work with my constituents to ensure that the government is fully aware of these issues. I want to thank the shadow minister for his commitment and his understanding. I also hosted a trade subcommittee round table on small and medium-sized businesses, which saw the trade subcommittee travel to Calwell and receive submissions from our local SMEs in regard to the inquiry around the benefits of free trade agreements and SMEs. The success and provision of opportunities for SMEs locally is very important to our community and local job prospects. I'm very happy to report that our local businesses are very attuned to the desire to expand their own businesses and to also provide job opportunities for our local people. This year saw the return of the Arthur Calwell Memorial Lecture, with the secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Luke Hilakari, delivering the keynote address. The event was held at our local Kangan TAFE. In the audience that night was Isobel Saxelby. Isobel was six when she arrived in Australia in 1949. As Britain's 100,000th migrant to this country, she was given a toy koala by the then immigration minister, Arthur Calwell. That koala now sits proudly in the Museum of Australian Democracy. Sadly, Isobel passed away quite suddenly last month. I'd like to offer my condolences to her family, especially her husband, Frank. Isobel's story is an important footnote in our country's long and continuing story of migration. As the federal member for Calwell, it was an honour to have met her, and I will remember her fondly, as she and I shared a common journey. I want to acknowledge a wonderful woman and diligent member of my staff-a woman who assists my constituents with patience and empathy and a woman I'm so proud to call my friend. Helen Patsikatheodorou has been a long-time member of my staff. This year she lost her husband, John, but she has managed to continue to give to our electorate. Last month, Helen was the 2018 recipient of the prestigious Robert Kumar Community Award for her outstanding contribution to the Hume community. This award, established by Banksia Gardens Community Services in 2015, was named after its inaugural recipient Robert Kumar, the former deputy chief magistrate and regional coordinating magistrate for Broadmeadows, who subsequently presented the award to Helen on that night. Helen has served her community as Hume mayor and as a community leader for decades, making this award very much deserved. Her passion for women's health and her support for older people, services for young people, education and multiculturalism are delivered with care, compassion and understanding. I want to congratulate Helen on finally being recognised for her years of contribution to Hume and the wider Calwell family. In finishing, I want to thank the outgoing communities in Sydenham and Taylors Lakes and the suburbs of Keilor and Calder Park, because, as a result of a redistribution, the boundaries for the federal seat of Calwell have changed. I'd like to welcome back Craigieburn, Mt Ridley, Mickleham, Oaklands Junction, Kalkallo, Wildwood and Yuroke. I look forward to continuing to work with you in 2019. Climate Change Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (11:48): Over the past fortnight we've seen very disturbing riots on the streets of Paris, in France. Protesters have taken to the streets because of increased taxation on their motoring. I hope that we never, ever see scenes like that on the streets of Australia. Therefore, as we go into the next election, I call upon the Australian Labor Party to fully disclose to the Australian community how they are going to achieve their plans for an economy-wide 45 per cent emissions reduction target and what their plans are for the transportation sector. What will the Labor Party's plans mean to the person that lives in an outer suburb of one of our major cities or in a regional area, to get to that 45 per cent emissions reduction target? At the last election, one policy that the Labor Party were able to sneak under the radar was a plan to reduce the average CO2 emissions of our car fleet from 180-odd grams of CO2 per kilometre travelled down to 105. The question is: how would this be achieved? What form of punitive taxation does the Labor Party have planned for our car buyers to achieve that policy? Transportation makes up 18 per cent of our nation's CO2 emissions. The Labor Party cannot walk away from this. They have to disclose this to the Australian public so that people know what they are voting for and so there are no surprises if they should take office. Previously, the Climate Change Authority estimated that Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target would require a carbon tax of $135 a tonne. What does $135 a tonne do to the price of petrol? It increases it by 40c a litre. We have seen riots in France over a few euro cents, the equivalent of less than 10 Australian cents. We have seen riots in France because of that. Yet we have the Australian Labor Party with a policy that, to reach that goal, is going to require a carbon tax on petrol at the equivalent of 40c a litre. People may be prepared to pay an extra 40c a litre. They may be happy that this is their contribution to taking action on climate change. If that's the case, the Labor Party has an obligation to spell out, crystal clear, what they are going to do. What about their emissions standards? What do they seek? What is their goal for the emissions standards of Australian cars? Are they going to have the same policy as before of basically putting these punitive taxes on any  large cars? How does it work for someone who lives in a regional area, who travels country roads and is likely to run into kangaroos and all types of other animals straying onto the roads, if the Labor Party says, 'If you want a large four-wheel drive to drive on our country roads, we are going to punitively tax you'? I don't know. I don't know what their policies are. I know what their goals are. The Labor Party have said, 'This is the target that we have,' but they have not said how they're going to get there. They owe it to the Australian people to come clean, to disclose what those targets are and how they're going to get to those targets. Otherwise-I hate to say this-I fear that we risk seeing what we've seen on the streets of France in the streets of Australia. This is why we need to give people the option and let them know, when they go to the ballot box, exactly what the policies are. How much will the carbon tax be on petrol when someone goes to the bowser? What are you going to do to someone who wants to buy a large four-wheel drive? How much more will you put up the taxes? If it's nothing, say so. Be very crystal clear about it. Macquarie Electorate",137
190,Ms TEMPLEMAN,ADJOURNMENT," For nearly 10 years I've been fighting for the people of Macquarie, both in this chamber and before coming to this parliament. Many things have changed. Prime ministers have certainly changed. New community groups have formed in my electorate, like BLORCAG. Kids who were in year 4 at school have now finished their HSC. Some small businesses have opened their doors, while others have gone. But one thing doesn't change, and that's the disregard and disdain with which the Liberals treat my electorate at both the federal and state level. We end this year with the Liberal government in a shambles. It has no policy to seriously tackle the cost of energy or the impacts of climate change, which our electorate, with its predisposition to flood and fire, is particularly vulnerable to. It has no policy to seriously tackle the challenges of housing affordability or homelessness. It has no policy to find permanent homes for refugees languishing in Nauru and PNG and no policy to provide the psychological support that is desperately needed by these traumatised people. It has no policy to seriously address the long delays that elderly people entitled to in-home care experience simply to maintain independence in their own home. It has no policy to speed up the lengthy wait people have to get a pension, a Health Care Card or any other benefit from Centrelink-in fact, any service from just about any government department. It has no policy to seriously improve health and hospital services, to make sure that patients get the care they need and that doctors, nurses and healthcare providers are not stretched to breaking point. It has no policy to seriously improve early childhood education, public schools, TAFE or universities. It has no policy to end live cattle exports and in fact voted against an opportunity to tackle that animal cruelty issue. It has no vision for our community, particularly in Macquarie, where it's hard to have a vision when you haven't even got a candidate. This disregard for things that matter to Macquarie is particularly evident in the Hawkesbury. The Christmas lights light up in Windsor this week, and kids and local music groups will be performing. The mall in the historic precinct will be alive with stalls and activity. But it's impossible not to dwell on the destruction being wrought at the end of the mall, in Thompson Square, the oldest public square in the country, where every day more and more of the history is being dug up and carted away. I want to pay tribute to those who are photographing the excavations and the artefacts that are being uncovered. The real kick in the guts here is that the Georgian square, which was laid out by Governor Lachlan Macquarie, is being destroyed for no good reason. The new bridge that will go through the modernised square-an ugly concrete structure-will provide only one extra lane of traffic. I can see you thinking, Deputy Speaker, 'An extra lane each way-that will make a difference.' But, no, this isn't an extra lane each way; it's a single extra lane, to make a three lane bridge-the brainchild of the New South Wales Liberal government, whose cleverness with infrastructure knows no bounds and leaves Hawkesbury drivers in unnecessary traffic. I say to the people of the Hawkesbury: you deserve better at a state level. You deserve better roads. You deserve better public transport. You deserve to have the reasons you live in the Hawkesbury protected. You deserve someone in the New South Wales parliament who sees what makes the Hawkesbury special. You should not be taken for granted by your state representative-who has in fact decided he doesn't even want to represent you-nor by his senior staff, who've been complicit in that treatment. I'd like to thank the thousands of people from across the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury who've contacted me. A division having been called in the House of Representatives",139
191,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Sitting suspended from 11:58 to 12:07,139
192,Ms TEMPLEMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I'd like to thank the thousands of people from across the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury who have contacted me, whether by phone or email or in person, about issues important to them. Whatever the issues-whether you're concerned about the, as yet secret, flight paths that are due to come with the  new airport, which I still think is a mistake and which I fear, as much as you do, will have an effect on our lives in years to come; whether you're concerned about the threats to our World Heritage area and the tourism industry that depends on it; whether you're fighting for a better deal from the NDIS; whether you, like me, are desperate for the NBN to arrive in the mountains, years overdue, and frustrated at the appalling internet speed we have to tolerate in the meantime; or whether you are still trying to get your fibre to the node up to speed-they are all consequences of a Liberal government that is obsessed only with itself, with no vision for the society we can be. This is a government that has lost the will to govern. It's time this government was gone. Capricornia Electorate",139
193,Ms LANDRY,ADJOURNMENT," Capricornia, as we all know by now, is a diverse and wonderful part of the globe-from golden beaches to arid interior; from coral to coal to cattle. As we reach the conclusion of this exciting and interesting year, I've been reflecting on the highlights from around my great electorate, and I'd like to share those reflections with the Chamber. The year 2018 has been a year of great advances and great intrigue, and a year of great travel for me once again as I get around Capricornia. One of the greatest highlights of 2018 was meeting young Chelsea Line from Moranbah. Chelsea is a passionate young woman devoted to her favourite sports: cheerleading and gymnastics. Eleven-year-old Chelsea is also a rather successful policy lobbyist. Along with her JDRF teammates, Chelsea visited Parliament House earlier this year to advocate for increased understanding of and assistance for type 1 diabetes. Chelsea does all these things while also living with the difficult reality of the autoimmune disorder herself. Due to her diabetes, Chelsea endures a barrage of finger pricks, blood tests, calculations and insulin injections throughout her day, just to keep healthy. Chelsea is an inspiration to us all and to everyone that meets her, and I know that she'll be pleased to know her lobbying has been worthwhile, with Minister Hunt recently announcing support for adult diabetics to access constant glucose monitoring systems, previously only subsidised for children. This means a great deal to many diabetics in Capricornia, and I have been overwhelmed by the response from our community to this news. Max Tapp is a typically humble teenage man from Emu Park who this week was honoured in Parliament House for doing something amazing. Max was awarded the Rescue of the Month award for August from Surf Life Saving Australia. Max is a keen young lifesaver, and his actions earlier this year did just that-saved a life. While on a family holiday on the Gold Coast, Max came across a scene that would have caused many others to freeze. A man was unconscious and receiving very poor resuscitation assistance from a couple of passers-by. Max didn't freeze though, and instantly engaged the knowledge and skills his lifesaving training had instilled. Max took over CPR assistance, continuing until the ambulance officers arrived. The patient survived and undoubtedly owes his life to the fast-thinking actions of this young hero from Emu Park. This just shows how real the lifesaver moniker is-it is at the core of everything that lifesavers do, and they just might save yours one day. This year, 2018, also saw the great triannual event that brings Central Queensland both to a stop and to fever pitch at the same time. Beef Australia celebrated its 30th anniversary this year by holding the best Beef Australia exhibition at the Rockhampton show grounds yet. The expo featured over 2,000 stud cattle, hundreds of trade fair exhibitors, a nationwide carcass competition, delicacies from across the globe and over 100,000 attendees across the seven days of the massive event. It was a shame that budget week happened to coincide with Beef Australia this year as I, unfortunately, missed most of the event. I did however take the Deputy Prime Minister and a group of my colleagues back up on the Friday, and we all enjoyed what we got to experience. The Beef Ball was every bit the highlight it always is. While the economic boon this event brings to the region is magnificent, many will be pleased to get three years to prepare for the next one! My hat goes off to the Beef Australia team, including outgoing chair and CEO, Blair Angus and Denis Cox. These two men have overseen the past two expos and have elevated it beyond the region and created a truly international event. It is a shame that, with only five minutes, I don't have the time to discuss more highlights, as Capricornia provides many. I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone in my Capricornia electorate, both those who support and those who don't. It's an immense privilege to be able to represent you all in this place and be part of the Central Queensland community. I couldn't do it without our tireless volunteers and my hard working staff, who serve me well. Thank you to the 2018 Capricornia office: Kylie, Nicole, Karen, Alex, Janine, Tory, our beloved DLO Belinda, Louise, Julie, Lanie, Jack, Christina, Sarah, Rebecca and, of course, Douglas. Merry Christmas to everyone in this place: Deputy Speaker, friend and foe. May we all get our own slice of peace over the summer break. National Security  and over the last several years Labor has always worked cooperatively with the Abbott government, with the  Turnbull government and with the Morrison government to make sure that we improve any national security legislation in a bipartisan way. Labor's first priority is always to make sure that Australians are safe. The Labor members of the security committee, which has looked at much of this legislation, led by Senator Penny Wong, are: the member for Isaacs, former Attorney-General and now shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus; Senator Jenny MCAllister; Dr Mike Kelly, whose background is as a colonel and legal officer in the Army; and the very capable deputy chair, Anthony Byrne. The Labor members worked with the coalition to make sure that any legislation serves its purpose of keeping Australians safe but also, obviously, has the appropriate checks and balances, as responsible government does. That committee has worked on over 15 pieces of legislation and has provided over 300 amendments to the proposed legislation-often hastily drafted legislation, bizarrely. The current piece of legislation that the committee is looking at, the encryption legislation, was first flagged by the former Attorney-General George Brandis 18 months ago. Now, in a flurry of press releases and histrionic media events, the Prime Minister has unpicked that nearly six years of bipartisan work and tried to use wedge politics to make national security a cheap point-scoring exercise. It was heart breaking for the members of that committee-the hard working Liberal members as well, I should stress-who had worked so hard to get the best possible legislation that would make Australians as safe as possible in these challenging and dangerous times. There has been no change to Australia's security rating over that time, yet we have recently had this rush of legislation coming into the parliament, and then the Prime Minister doing an extraordinary press conference today where he slurred and slandered and slithered his way through a press conference where he was trying to use the Labor Party as a target. It was quite disappointing. In relation to the bill that has been rushed into parliament, the Labor Party has worked with the government to make sure that there's better oversight and limitations on the powers in the bill and to provide better safeguards against any potential unintended consequences. Can I say, as a lawyer, that I always baulk at the idea of warrants being issued without judicial oversight. I always prefer that the rule of law is considered. I know it's enshrined in the US constitution, the idea that people just can't come in and seize and search and take stuff away. We, in Australia, should protect those things. Our copy of the Magna Carta down on level 1 in this building enshrines the idea that we have a judicial process and that individuals have some protections against the power of the state. Obviously we need to balance that with the interests of making sure that terrorists, paedophiles or criminals are caught and the full force of the law is brought down on them. But we can't throw away the very things that make Australia great-the freedoms and the rule of law that we value so much. Misinformation is flowing about. I'm getting emails in my office. I want to put the record straight. There's nothing in the amended encryption bill that allows an agency to force a communications provider to do anything that would otherwise require a warrant under existing legislation. The intelligence agencies and the like would need to obtain a warrant to view content or to intercept the communication. Importantly, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security will continue to scrutinise this bill into 2019. That process will allow any outstanding concerns to be worked on and further amendments to be considered calmly in the new year. Over the past month, in fact if we look back at the last 18 months, the government has sought to trash the long standing bipartisan process and has tried to politicise national security for its own short-term ends. The government's job is not to play politics with the safety of Australians. There's nothing more important than keeping Australians safe. Aqua Splash Fun Park Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (12:18): I'd like to take this opportunity to raise a concern that I have with the conduct of Gold Coast City Council in relation to the awarding of tenders for the Aqua Splash fun park in the Broadwater on the Gold Coast. Disappointingly, Gold Coast City Council has seen fit to apparently ignore its own guidelines around local procurement Its guidelines state that if the business is located on the Gold Coast it should be given a weighting of 15 per cent, being the successful tenderer. In this case they've made a decision based not on the location of where the business is-which is in the Broadwater on the Gold Coast which is 100 per cent in the Gold Coast City Council area-but rather where the registered office for the business is, which is with their accountants at Mount Gravatt. I think this is a very interesting sleight of hand, and the reason I raise this particular topic is that it directly affects constituents of mine-Matt and Kirsten Divine. They've spent the past five years building the AquaSplash fun park on the Broadwater from scratch. It was an idea conceived by them, and initially they approached the Gold Coast City Council back in 2013. They've spent the past five years developing and refining this concept over that time for an inflatable obstacle course in the Broadwater where more than 100,000 people go from the end of September through to the end of March.  Importantly, as a result of the council's decision, this business has now relocated from the Gold Coast to the open arms of the Redcliffe city council and they have reopened a new AquaSplash fun park at Woody Point. But the point remains: why has the Gold Coast City Council ignored its own guidelines and given a licence to operate this fun park to a new operator who we now know actually has no idea about what he's doing? He actually approached Mr Divine and said, 'Can I pay you to be a consultant to help me set up my new park properly.' And we found out also that not only did council not have the courtesy to contact Mr Divine; he found out through one of his suppliers because they thought that the contract for the extension of the lease had been sorted. I cannot believe that an organisation like Gold Coast City Council didn't have the courtesy and the professionalism to let business people, such as the Divines-who have put so much time, effort, sweat and tears into building what was regarded as one of the best inflatable fun parks in the Southern Hemisphere that attracts 100,000 people a year-know they weren't the successful tenderer. Mr Divine had to find out from one of his suppliers. Interestingly, his supplier also advised that the person who was the successful tenderer approached him about replacement equipment for the water park and the supplier said to him, 'That equipment that you're planning to put in the water park won't work. It doesn't meet the standards. You have to use this other particular equipment.' On that basis alone, the proposal should not have got to first base with council, because it didn't comply with the requirements of the equipment required. I call on the Gold Coast City Council to reverse this decision and reinstate the lease to AquaSplash Gold Coast and the Divines. Question agreed to. Federation Chamber adjourned at 12:24 ",140
