0,NA,Unknown,WHEAT GUARANTEE. FORMAL MOTION O:I? ADJOURNMENT.,16
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Hume (Mr. Parker Moloney) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The desirability of granting a guarantee of 4s. per bushel on next season's wheat."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.  [3.20] - I trust the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) will not complain because I have adopted this course. As I had not an opportunity of discussing the matter during the Supply debate, I have been compelled to bring it before the House in this form this afternoon. A large number of my electors, principally those engaged in wheat-growing, have asked me to bring the matter before the Government, and other honourable members on this side, representing country constituencies, have also received similar communications from wheat-growers in different parts of the Commonwealth, who are disappointed with the statement made by the Prime Minister a few days ago that the Government propose to guarantee 3s. a bushel on this season's crop. Last year when a similar guarantee was made another Government was in power, and members of the Country party then complained that the guarantee was inadequate, which gave the impression that a Government in which the Country party had strong representation would increase the guarantee beyond the amount paid last year. Although the present Government contains members of the Country party, the guarantee proposed is to be the same as last year, and consequently there is a good deal of disappointment amongst the wheat-growers. Honourable members on this side have always been consistent, as two years ago we asked for 5s. and last year for 4s. per bushel.",16
2,Mr HILL,Unknown,"Does the honourable member suggest 4s. at country sidings?  asking that 4s. per bushel be paid instead of. 3s. The members of our party believe that the producer of wheat is entitled to an amount sufficient to cover the cost of production, and a reasonable margin of profit, and in that respect our attitude now is consistent with our previous actions, and is also in harmony with our policy. I do not think any honourable member representing a country constituency will maintain that the wheat-grower is able to - produce.wheat for less than 3s. 6d. per bushel.",16
3,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member suggest that that guarantee shall apply to millers as well?  ask the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) for information, he invariably asks for notice, and in this instance I must submit a similar request to him. In 1921 a Select Committee was appointed in New South Wales to go into the cost of wheat production, and after a very careful and exhaustive inquiry it came to the conclusion that wheat could not be produced for less than 3s. 6d. per bushel. The Committee found that for the year 1920-21 the cost of producing a 14-bushel harvest was at least 3s. 6d. per bushel.",16
4,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"What was the cause?  were m'any causes. The Committee went into various aspects of wheat production, and made allowance for interest on borrowed money, the cost of the land, farmers' wages based on a labourer's earnings, insurance, and also the increased cost of living. In asking for a guarantee of 4s. per bushel, we are merely requesting what is barely sufficient to cover the cost of producing wheat in Australia today. As a matter of fact, the evidence taken by that Committee disclosed that there was a doubt as to whether wheat could be produced in New South Wales at 4s. a bushel.",16
5,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"What will the position be if wheat drops to 3s. 4d. or 3s. 8d. a bushel ?  wheat-grower is entitled to an advance sufficient to cover the cost of producing and a reasonable margin of profit, irrespective of any reduction in price, of which there is no indication at present. There can be no difference of opinion as to the position of. our wheat-growers. If from any reason, the price of wheat falls below the cost of production, and in the absence of a guarantee, they fail, the rest of the community must suffer. They are at least entitled to a guarantee equal to the amount which, in the opinion of the New South Wales Select Committee, represented the cost of production that year. If they are to be encouraged to adopt the 'best scientinc methods of production, including fallowing and wheat selection, it is not fair that they should be allowed to grope in the dark as to the probable return on'production. Wheat-growing is one of our great staple industries, and if those engaged in if. are allowed to go to the wall, the injury sustained by that branch of production will the reflected throughout the community. The whole of the people are deeply interested in this matter, and therefore the Government should be prepared to furnish to our wheat-growers a guarantee sufficient to cover the cost of production, including interest on capital, insurance, cultivation, and all othei incidental expenses. A guarantee of the amount I suggest will hearten our wheat-growers. Wc had an illustration of this encouragement in New South Wales a year or two ago, when the State Government of the day guaranteed an amount per (bushel additional to the 5s. per bushel guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government. In that year there was an increase of about 700,000 acres of land under wheat in that State.",16
6,Mr HILL,Unknown,And there was a loss of' nearly a million sterling to the State Government.  not so.,17
7,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"It is correct.  there was a so-called loss, and it did not amount to £1,000,000-ther e was circulated amongst the wheat-growers of New South Wales, as a result of the State guarantee, an additional sum of nearly £6,000,000. It would be good business for a Government, as well as an individual, to pay £1,000,000 out of one pocket if it could thus put an additional £6,000,000 into another pocket. result of the increased area under cultivation in New South Wales, and the substantially larger return, the whole community benefited.",17
8,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"And this Government are now giving a guarantee in connection with the export of meat.  honourable member for"" Gwydir has just reminded me, the meat exporters have recently been promised a subsidy on all meat exported; and, as wheat is quite as important as beef, our wheat-growers are entitled to as much consideration as has been shown to the great meat 'barons of the Commonwealth. I direct attention to another important aspect of this problem. Only the other day, the Melbourne press contained references to the decline in our rural population, showing thatj with one exception, there had ibeen a decline in the whole of the shires of Victoria within the last few years. The figures disclose a steady drift all over Australia from the rural areas ' to our great cities. This movement must, of course, have a very detrimental effect upon the development of Australia.  to the spoon-fed factories in the cities. Geelong is the exception to which the honourable member refers.  honourable member for Forrest is correct. Geelong is the one shire in Victoria that is not losing its people. Many factors contribute to this drift of population. One is the lack of postal facilities, about which we may have an opportunity of speaking later to the Postmaster-General. The absence of such facilities discourages the man on the land. It is therefore desirable that we should, by means of this guarantee, offer some encouragement to our wheat-growers, who comprise such a large section of our people. If this serious decline in rural population continues, there must be a corresponding decline in production. The last quarterly summary of Australian statistics reveals an alarming state of affairs in connection with wheat growing. In 1915-16, which was the last year when a Labour Government was in control of the Commonwealth, the total area under wheat was 12,480,000 acres. Last year, when we failed to get a guarantee of 4s. per bushel, it was As a 9,800,000, or a decline of over 2,500,000 acres under cultivation for wheat. The total yield for the Commonwealth in 1915-16 was 179,000,000 bushels, as compared with 109,000,000 bushels last season. There was not only a decline in the acreage under cultivation, but, also, as one would expect, a big drop in the total yield. I do not say for a moment that the fact that the guarantee was not increased was totally responsible for the position, but I submit the figures quoted in support of my contention that Australia is in a serious predicament owing to the constant drift of the rural population to the cities, and the unmistakable decrease in the area under cultivation. All who have the best interests of Australia at heart should be set thinking seriously over the matter. An adequate guarantee would greatly encourage the people engaged in this great staple industry. I desire a fair decision to be arrived at, and, seeing that my request is a reasonable one, I expect support from the honourable members who still sit in the corner. When I submitted a similar motion last year, those honourable members had no responsibility for the Government, and some of them, at all events, supported me. was pleased to have the assistance of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook), and the honourable member for Forrest  - growing districts. I was glad to hear them urge the Government to accede to the request. It will be seen from Hansard, vol. CI.,""page 2950, that in October last the honourable member for Forrest said that he ""hoped the Government would be able to make the amount of the guarantee up to 4s."" The honourable member was consistent, because, when the motion went to the vote, he supported it. Mr 'PROWSE - Did I . not say, course of my remarks on that occasion, that you were a little bit 'belated in your proposal ?  but the honourable member cannot say that on the present occasion. That was the only objection he then raised, and he evidently did not think it an insuperable obstacle, at all events, because he voted for the motion. If I was belated on a previous occasion, I am certainly early now. I was determined not to again give the honourable member a chance to raise the same objection. We are told that his party now has half the Ministerial power; therefore he should bo able to exert more influence with the Government on the present occasion than he could last year. Surely 'the honourable member will not allow, his supporters in the country to get the idea that the Country party, having joined this composite Ministry, is powerless to make any impression upon the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce). I hope that I shall have, not only the honourable member's vote on this occasion, ibut also his influence with the 'Government, which is largely one of his own choosing. The honourable member for Indi, according to Hansard, vol. CI., page 2956, stated that in handling the wheat crop the Commonwealth Bank would have a good asset, and, considering all the circumstances, and the necessity of fostering the industry, he trusted that the Government wouQd see their way clear to grant the 4s. guarantee. I have no reason to believe that the honourable member will not stand 'today in the same position as previously.",17
9,Mr GABB,Unknown,He did not vote on the last occasion.  may have been a reason why he did not vote.,18
10,Mr GABB,Unknown,"He was not paired.  events, he made a good speech in support of the motion. The circumstances have not altered since October last. The arguments used by the honourable member on that occasion stand good today. The wheat-growers were led to believe that if a Government 3uch as we now have were formed, with a number of Country members in it, rural interests would be better protected. But in the it appears that the same old groove is to be followed, and the position is even going to be much worse, because the Prime Minister stated the other day that the present guarantee would be the last. Wheat-growers, as well as other primary producers, will he very dissatisfied with ° the actions of the Government. I appeal to the members of the late Country party to prove, by supporting my motion, that their inclusion in the Ministry has been for the benefit of the men on the land. I regret that, by their interjections, they seem to be under the domination of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce). If it goes forth to the producers that they are to get only the same guarantee as last year, and for the future no guarantee at all, they will be keenly disappointed.",18
11,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.49] - I shall take only a few minutes in replying to what the honourable member has said. ' This, of course, is his nual motion. It crops up with unfailing regularity, but there is not the slightest justification for his action. In fact, this is purely a political move, and it is repeated whenever the wheat harvest comes under discussion. It is undesirable that the honourable member should try to mislead the man on the land in this way. If the party to which the honourable member opposite belongs came into power, the country would be tfaced with ruin. The honourable member for Hume should have sufficient honesty to inform the people on the land of the real facts, but he has moved a motion to advocate an increase of the proposed advance from 3s. to 4s., knowing full well that, the party opposite were in power, they would make no such increase, because, if they did, it would be disastrous to the fanners. I can easily imagine the position in which the Labour party would find themselves if they proceeded to carry out their delightful theory that guarantees should cover not only the cost of production, but also a reasonable margin of profit. ""What would happen to the honourable member opposite and those who represent the working class if the price of bread increased in consequence of such a proposal being put into operation ? The honourable member knows perfectly well that his party would not be allowed to do what he now asks should be done. Without responsibility for putting this proposal into effect, the honourable member holds out an alluring bait to the man on the land, but the farmer is not deceived any more than we are. We know perfectly well the reason for the motion. But, suppose that the honourable member's proposal were carried out, and that for all time, irrespective of the cost of production and the price of wheat, a guarantee such as he now advocates were given to the farmers. To cover the cost of production and allow a fair margin of profit, a guarantee of from 4s. to 6s. would be needed, and, as wages steadily ascend and the cost of production increases, not £1,000,000, as has happened in the case of one State, but £2,000,000,. £3,000,000, and £4,000,000 would have to be taken from the Consolidated Revenue. Disaster would follow such a course, not only to the wheatMr Bruce. grower, but to every person in the comanmunity. The proposal is absurd, and is a political move, made in the belief that the farmers are stupid enough to be misled by anything. The contempt of the honourable member for the man on the land is shown by his proposal, and his pretence of sincerity is apparent. Generally speaking, the men on the land are intelligent enough not to be deceived by this political ruse. I should have thought that the honourable member would have learned something from the experience of the last Labour Government of New South Wales, when guarantees were added to for no'other purpose than to convince the farmer that they were his friends. The 1 action then taken resulted in a loss of if something like £l,000j000 to the State, and it took a very long time for the farmer to get his money from that Government. The loss had; to be met from Consolidated Revenue, to the direct detriment of the whole people. Surely - that example should have steadied honourable members opposite. As to the proposed guarantee, there seems to be some misapprehension concerning the nature of the action the Government are taking. In connection with the Pool this year the Government have agreed to finance up to 3s. for wheat delivered at railway sidings, and a further Sd. for freight and handling charges. That amount has been arrived at as the maximirm figure which the Government is justified in advancing without involving the taxpayers of this country in loss. It is not a guarantee, purely and simply, as honourable members opposite imagine, but in the nature of an advance made in the first place to enable the farmers to carry on. We hope that it will not represent the full return that the farmer will obtain for his labour in producing the wheat, but that he will enjoy a substantial increase on it. The Government are making - this advance to tide the farmers over the first period, and also to enable the Pool to function. Its object is to allow the wheat to be sold co-operatively when suitable opportunity offers, and thus prevent the small farmer who is financially embarrassed from being forced upon the market at a disadvantageous time. The Pool also has the advantage of insuring to those who join in it an average. price, and they will not be compelled-as they often were in the past-to accept thelowest prices offering. A comparison has been made of the acreage under wheat last year with that of the year 1915-16. The honourable member for Hume tried to draw most wonderful deductions to support his view that something was wrong with the Government policy, because there is not a very much greater acreage under wheat in Australia today than there was in the year 1915-16. W it h his usual astuteness, and something that borders upon genius, in presenting a case in a way to suit himself, he chose the year 1915-16. people's memories are not so short as he seems to think. We all remember that in the year 1915-16, under the stress of war conditions, a special appeal was made to the farmers of Australia to sow wheat. To the credit of the farmers, they responded in the most patriotic manner. They sowed their ordinary crop, and cultivated also land which would ordinarily have been fallow. They took every opportunity to ^increase the wheat production that year. But the honourable member seizes upon that year, and comparing it with last year, says, "" This Government are driving the man off the land, and ^decreasing the acreage under wheat."" He knows perfectly well that there is not a scintilla of truth in his statements. He made no proper comparison at all. The offer of 3s. is made today to help the farmers to increase production in every direction possible. But there are many factors militating against keeping men on the land and increasing the acreage under production, and nobody has done more to create those factors than honourable members opposite, including the honourable member who moved the adjournment of the House. Reference has been made to the proposal for a guarantee of 4s. last year, and the action which was taken by certain honourable gentlemen then. The position this year is very different from what it was last year. Because the Government last year adhered to the principle that the advance must be limited to a figure which there was reasonable prospect of realizing, certain honourable gentlemen might well have considered that 4s. was a reasonable amount to guarantee. The.wheat position today is very different from what it was last year. Though an advance of 3s. might have been on the low side last year,, considering all the circumstances it is certainly on the generous side now. I am sure' that honourable members sitting on this side, who will look at the facts without prejudice, and will try to give to the farmers the maximum advance possible, consistent with their duty to the taxpayers as a whole, will realise that 3s. is the highest figure that could possibly be agreed to on the present occasion. The honourable member for Hume (Mr . Parker Moloney) referred to the attitude adopted by the Government in relation to pools. The honourable member seemed But - to imagine that I ought now to withdraw from the position that I took up the other day. I can assure him that I have no intention of doing anything of the kind. Ministers do not believe that it is in the best interests of the producers, or of any other class in the community, that they should be solely dependent upon Governments . for the arrangement of their financial dealings and the disposal of their crops. So long as the great producing interests are at the mercy of Governments, which come and go, their position will be a very dangerous one indeed. Not the least of the dangers which they have to apprehend is that honourable members who now sit opposite might obtain possession of the Treasury bench. We believe that the great body of the producers share our opinion that the best interests of the country, and of the people in the country, will be conserved by the Government refraining from giving guarantees and interfering with the great work of production and distribution. We are entirely unrepentant, and intend to proceed with the policy we have enunciated. A guarantee is being given - this year because the producer has been led to believe that the assistance which had previously been given to him would be given to him in the future. We are warning' the producers that we do not intend continuing that practice if we remain in office. We are giving them time and opportunity to make their own arrangements, and we are convinced that we are acting in the best interests of the man on the land. He should take the necessary steps to free himself from all then Government control and interference. That view, I am quite certain, the great bulk of the producers entirely endorse. - Honourable members, I am sure, are not in the least deceived as to the reason actuating the honourable member for Hume in bringing forward this proposal, and they will treat the motion according to its deserts.",18
12,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [4.3] - We have become accustomed to the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) delivering a lecture to"" honourable members regarding their method of conducting business. The. honourable gentleman stated that this was an annual motion with the honourable mem The farmers ought to be congratulated upon having in this Chamber such a live representative to look after their interests. If it were not for the fact that we have in this Chamber members like the honourable member for Hume, I am very much afraid that the farmers' interests would be lost sight of. Evidence of that is furnished by recent happenings. The Prime Minister has charged the honourable member for Hume with having moved this motionwith the object of gaining a political advantage. The honourable gentleman ignored the fact that, inside and outside of this Chamber, he has stated that the policy of the Government is that trade should proceed along its natural channels without any assistance from the Government. Why, then, has he consented to this guarantee being given? Is it because he wants to keep intact the composite Ministry? It is because he knows that certain Ministers and members supporting the Government represent farmers, and therefore it is desirable that, for the present year at least, a guarantee should be given to the farmers? If anybody in this House is inconsistent, it is the Prime Minister. Believing in certain principles, he yet is prepared to depart from those principles if to do so will enable him to keep peace with h i i followers. Recently, I introduced to the honourable gentleman a joint business and industrial deputation. He would do nothing in that matter, excusing himself on the ground that to accede to the request then made would be to act against the policy of the Government. Immediately afterwards he went to Queensland, where he met those who are largely interested in the beef business. Although he believed that trade should flow along its natural channels, he agreed to subsidize that industry. Why? A man should act consistently, and stand by the opinions he holds. The Prime Minister should be the last man to chide honourable - members for making political moves, when, ever since they assumed office, the actions of his Government have been dictated by a desire to retain place and power. The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) interjected, "" What are you going to do in the event of wheat falling to its old price?"" I think he mentioned that that price was 3s. 4d. I remind honourable members that, to encourage the settlement of this country and induce immigration, it is necessary to make the conditions such that it will be possible to absorb a much larger population than Australia is at present carrying. If wheat were to fall to its old price, it would be impossible for the man on the land to make a living.  tees will not improve the position.",21
13,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,It does; that is why the honourable member supported the giving of a guarantee last year.. Does he desire to shirk his responsibility in that direction now because he occupies the position of Whip to the Ministry?  price of wheat.,21
14,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No . The honourable member knows, however, that it has the effect of fixing the price which the farmer is to receive, and that is an inducement to the farmer to sow wheat.. In common with every other individual in the community, the farmer has to secure an additional amount of money to enable him to meet the cost of living. Some honourable members and the press probably will say, "" If you are going to keep up these prices, the' cost of living will remain at a high level."" Is it contended - that the pruning knife should be applied only to the farmer ? He is compelled to take all the risks' of drought and of pests spoiling his crop. Must he receive less than a living wage, if the price of wheat should drop below 3s. 4d. ? Does any one deny that the cost of living today is from 50 to 60 per cent, higher than it was when the price of wheat was at that figure ? If that is so, is it not a fair thing that the farmer should get 50 to 60 per cent, more for his wheat?  things.",21
15,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Then it is the duty of the honourable member, representing, as he does, a farming constituency, to try to see that the farmer does get that price.  from fleecing us with, a high Tariff.",21
16,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We hear nothing but Free Trade from the honourable member; he wants to legislate only for his own particular calling, and allow everybody else to suffer. We say that we want to see a fair thing done by everybody; we want this country to grow. We introduced a Tariff with that object. Honourable members who are opposed to the motion try to evade the issue by telling their constituents that the real cause of the high cost of living is the extra price which has to be paid for agricultural machinery as the result of the Tariff. But if there were no Tariff a high price would have to be paid, because all commodities are higher in price than in pre-war days.  Government doing about the Tariff?",22
17,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not know,' and I cannot debate that question now; but it is idle for honourable members opposite to hide themselves behind the subterfuge of the Prime Minister. When that honourable gentleman referred to the effect of the guarantee in New South Wales, he forgot to mention that something like 700,000 additional acres had been placed under cultivation in consequence of that guarantee - Is it not necessary to offer a reasonable guarantee in order to induce people to sow' wheat?",22
18,Mr HILL,Unknown,All that season's wheat was sown before the guarantee was given.,22
19,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It was only on Saturday last that I read in the newspapers a statement by a gentleman who claims to know something about the possibilities of wheat production. opinion, there will be a shortage because of the smaller quantity sown. If that be so, what will be our position ? What has Australia depended on during the last few years? What has stabilized our finances ? Has it not been the production of wool, wheat, meat, and other commodities ? If we have a bad season for wheat or AVOOI, it will seriously affect our finances, and the (prosperity of the country generally. Some inducement must be offered to people to sow wheat, or we shall undoubtedly find ourselves with a shortage. A guarantee of 4s. a bushel, with 8d. added for transit, is not unreasonable, and it is idle to contend that it would make bread dearer.",22
20,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Brea d is dear whatever be the price of wheat.,22
21,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so. Tho Labour party's poliey has always been to assist any industry in trouble, if it can be shown that assistance is necessary, for we regard such a course as i i i the best interests of the country. This Government, or the Governments of the past, have, hitherto followed the lines laid down by the Labour, party, but the Prime Minister is not prepared to go so far as that. He believes that the time has arrived when he should declare the future policy of the Government; indeed, he has already done so on many occasions, but, strange to say, he has not acted up to his convictions. - It is all very well to contend that every industry should stand "" on its own botis the tom,"" as it were, but we find now the Prime Minister presenting quite - the opposite argument. No doubt the present proposals of the Government will carry them on for another twelve months, not only as regards wheat, hut also meat, and the Prime Minister's farming colleagues and supporters will be appeased for at least that time. It is easy for the man in the street to see what is happening in politics today. The idea of the Government is to follow the line of least resistance. But there is a divergence of opinion amongst Ministers and their supporters. Country members believe that assistance ought to be given in time of need to the wheat or any other industry, and the Prime Minister, though he holds quite a different view, is prepared to go so far * in order to meet the wishes of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) and other memI n his bers of the Ministry, in view of the fact that any other course would mean political death. The honourable member for Hume (Mr. Parker Moloney) deserves every credit for introducing this motion annually. The Prime Minister cannot escape the position by saying that that honourable member has neglected the interests of the farmers by not seeing that an adequate amount was provided to enable them to feel that, at least, they .were quite safe in sowing additional crops. I repeat that if the Government propose to bring people to Australia and place them on the landseeing that the cities are 'regarded as already congested-ther e must be a policy of some kind in order that they may be absorbed. We must produce as much as possible, so as to be able to export to other parts of the world where our products are required, and the only way in which this can be done is by offering guarantees. Farmers take sufficient risks already in the shape of bad seasons and pests, and it is only fair that if they get a short crop they should, at any rate, know that they will get a fair price for what is garnered. The motion is quite a proper one, aiming as it does at a meed of justice to which the producers are entitled; and it is idle for the Prime Minister to attempt to brush the matter aside, especially in view of the fact that, whilst outside and inside the House he has talked of industries using the "" ordinary business channels,"" he now adopts quite a different attitude for the purpose of appeasing certain men associated with this Coalition Government. The honourable member for Hume, by his action today, has done good service to the farmers, whom he represents here in a very intelligent manner; and other farmers' representatives, instead of making excuses for their silence, ought to be outspoken as to the reasons which induce them to oppose the motion.",22
22,Mr HILL,Unknown,"Echuca) [ 4 . 1 8 ] - I tively followed the honourable member for  not at all sure that he represents the opinions of the fanners of New South Wales. However, I can assuredly say that he does not represent the opinions of the Victorian farmers, who for some time have had this matter under consideration, and have realized that sooner or later it will be necessary for Government guarantees to cease. Governments come and go, and it is quite possible that at some time an Administration might come into being that would be unfavorable to their continuance. W it h these facts before them, a meeting of Victorian wheat growers was held in the Temperance H all , Melbourne, in September last, when the whole question was full y discussed, and it was decided that while this year a guarantee was possible, they would not ask for any further assistance of the kind. Those farmers have formed a company, registered under the Provident Societies Act, and are raising a capital of £250,000 for the purpose of financing any future wheat pools. I may here say tnat the representatives of the Victorian farmers saw the late Sir Denison Miller, who told them that if they could raise such an amount, it would, together with the security offered by the wheat, be sufficient to finance any Pool on a basis similar to that of Pools in the past. That is what is being done by the farmers of Victoria, though, as yet, very little effort has been p ut forth . Farmers in the other States have not made any effort so far to help themselves. Probably in New South Wales, they are in rather a bad position, seeing that, throughout the wheat belt last year, there was a very dry period, and only small crops gathered. That fact, I think, has decided the Prime Minister to offer a guarantee for the coming harvest, and thus afford an opportunity to the farmers of New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia to follow the example of the Victorians.",23
23,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Do you consider the amount adequate?,23
24,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I consider it is safe. I am going to oppose a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, because that guarantee at country stations means 4s., plus handling charges and freight, working out at 4s. 7d. or 4s. 8d. While I do not wish to be pessimistic, or to create a bad i m attenpression amongst our wheat farmers, I believe it will take us all our time next year to realise 4s. 7d. or 4s. 8d. a bushel net f.o.b.  that wheat will bring 4s. Sd. ?",23
25,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I do not admit that. The honourable member said that wheat could not be produced under 3s. 6d., and I agree with him. In order to get a reasonable return the producer requires at least 4s., but it is another matter to ask the Government to give a guarantee, and it is more than the farmers of Victoria expect the Government to do. In view of the steady f all in the price of wheat, it surprised wheat-growers in Victoria to learn that the Prime Minister had offered a guarantee of 3s. per bushel, plus 8d. for handling charges, but if they cannot raise the money they have set out to raise, they propose to join in with the wheat growers in other States, and accept the guarantee, which, of course, will be supplemented by the amount they are able to place to the credit of their voluntary Pool. The Prime Minister, referring to the record harvest in the year 1915-16, which the honourable member for Hume (Mr . Parker Moloney) had compared with a later season, said that it was due to the fact that farmers generally in that season had put their hands to the plough with a determination to sow the greatest area possible. That was the case, but there was also the fact that probably a couple of million acres, which had absolutely failed, owing to the drought, to produce any crop in the 1914-15 season, was as good as fallowed land when it came to be sown in the following year, along witli the land specially fallowed for that season's cropping. This it was that led to a record yield for that year. The Victorian farmers are strong believers in a voluntary Pool, under the operations of which they have secured approximately 80 per cent, of the wheat grown in the State. They are believers in a system of pooling their produce, particularly now that they are controlling the Pools themselves. They consider that this method of marketing their wheat will enable them to secure every penny of its value for themselves. For instance, last year the saving effected by the management of the voluntary Pool amounted to £62,000, which sum was sufficient to pay the whole of the expenses of administration at this end, and also the cost of running the London office, and the commission on London sales.",23
26,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"When you are lef t to yourselves, can you fight. Dalgety's and the other agents?",24
27,Mr HILL,Unknown,"The r e are many poor farmers in Australia, but if they are loyal to the Pool there are enough wealthy men among the wheat-growers whose money, together with the security offered by the wheat itself, would be sufficient to finance it.",24
28,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Is it not a fact that the wealthiest wheat-growers are the most disloyal to the Pool ?,24
29,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I regret to say that some of our biggest growers do not support the Pool. In my opinion, the Government could not guarantee 4s., plus 8d., and if I were a member of the Government I would oppose, any proposal to give such a guarantee. As a private member, I would equally oppose it , because, in my opinion, such a guarantee would occasion a loss to [22] the Government. Honourable members opposite claim that they are prepared to guarantee to the wheat-grower his cost of production and a profit. Are they willing to extend the same consideration to the fruit-growers ?  securing to every producer his cost of production.",24
30,Mr HLLL,Unknown,"I hope that the honourable member's proposal in this case w i ll be turned down. Of course, I would like to see the growers get a guarantee of 4s. per bushel, but for the reasons I have given, it would be absolutely unfair to ask the Government to give a guarantee that might be unsafe.",24
31,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Gwydir) [4.29]. - Honourable members were not prepared for the remarkable somersault of the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , who hopes that the proposition of the  Moloney) will be turned ' down. No more remarkable statement could be made by an honourable member of the Country party. The honourable member does not think that the honourable member for Hume is representing the views of the farmers in this matter. That honourable member is entirely disinterested in what he seeks to do. He is not one of those who are deriving benefit from the farmers through being a director of a company or controller of a Pool. It is strange to hear the honourable member for Echuca claim that the farmers would rather have a guarantee of 3s. than one of 4s., particularly when he says, very definitely, that he believes the Government would not be incurring any risk, seeing that wheat will bring 4s. 8d. a bushel.",24
32,Mr HILL,Unknown,"I did not say that I believed wheat would bring 4s. 8d. a bushel. What I said was that it would need to bring 4s. 8d. a bushel, in order not to occasion any loss to the Government.",24
33,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I am sorry if I misunderstood the honourable member, but his remarks gave me the impression that he thought wheat would bring the price I have mentioned. However, I accept his statement that he dees not believe in the Government giving a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, because he does not think wheat will bring that price,, and I place it alongside that made by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), who does not believe in giving a guarantee of 4s. a bushel, because if wheat does not realise that price it means that the Government will be obliged to place an impost on the taxpayers generally. Government were prepared to give a subsidy of one farthing a pound on the export of meat. W it h a guarantee of 4s. a bushel on wheat there would be no charge on the Consolidated Revenue if the wheat realized 4s. a bushel, whereas, the meat subsidy is a direct charge on the Consolidated Revenue without any possibility of a return. How do those gentlemen, who are willing to pay a subsidy of one farthing a pound for the export of beef from Australia, reconcile their attitude with the fact that Victoria is now importing beef from New Zealand?",24
34,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"The meat subsidy was given for the purpose of saving an industry which otherwise would have been "" down and out.""",25
35,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"That may be so, but men have now to be financed to enable them to put in their wheat crops, and the wheat farmers are "" down and o u t "" in New South Wales. To get them to remain on the land, and sow their crops, we must take steps to inspire in them the confidence that they will be assured of an adequate return for their labour. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Hill ) declares that he knows only what happens in Victoria. He probably does not know anything that occurs outside his own State. He was-one of. those who gave away £82,000 to save a gang of ""rooks"" in this country from being prosecuted.",25
36,Mr HILL,Unknown,That is incorrect.,25
37,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"It is not i correct. The Wheat Board, of which he was a member, gave away this .money when, as the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said, there was not even a moral claim against them. comes ill from a Country member who endorsed that payment to stand up here and say that he is not prepared to give the wheat farmers of Australia an adequate guarantee.  gizing to Flinders-lane.",25
38,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Yes . It is startling commentary on parliamentary life in Australia to find the so-called representatives of the farmers allied to the representatives of Flinders-lane. It is not the f a u l t of the farmers if they are now misrepresented in this Parliament by members of the Country party. Yet the The members of the Labour party are standing by their platform, in which they believe. We see the gradual d r if t from country districts to cities. We realise that, notwithstanding all guarantees given, there is no general desire on the part of men to become wheat-growers. In order ""to encourage manufacturing this Parliament has imposed a. direct charge on the taxpayers of Australia in the shape of a tariff. Honourable members in the Country party complain about the Tariff when applied to agricultural machinery, and allege that it has caused many farmers to fail . When members of the Opposition say that the taxpayers, and among them the . manufacturers, should do their share towards subsidizing the wheat industry, members of the Country party reply, "" Not at all ; that is a different proposition."" The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) is a straightforward Free Trader, and the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) is also a Free Trader. I can understand them, but not the ""shandy-gaff"" Protectionists, who are Free Traders at one time and Protectionists at another. I deny that the Tariff is causing the downfall of the farming industry. In my home town of Inverell, price lists were received recently from machinery agents, who quoted headers at a certain figure which, a week later, owing to a re-arrangement of the market, they lowered by about £ 6 0 . The Tariff had not been altered, and the fall in price was more than sufficient to cover n - the duty imposed. The ex-Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Massy Greene), when introducing the Tariff, showed conclusively that in New Zealand higher prices were charged for American It agricultural machinery which came in free of duty than are quoted in Australia. He effectively disposed of the argument that Protection is ruining the farming industry. The cause of failure in farming in New Wales has been bad seasons, bad methods of finance, and the extraordina arily high prices given for land. The Government should have announced its policy regarding a wheat guarantee months ago. On the 9th March, during the session which lasted a few days, I asked the Prime M in ister whether he was prepared to give a guarantee to the growers. He refused to answer the question because, he said, it was a matter of policy on which it was not considered advisable to make a pronouncement at that time. H a d the guarantee been given them, a far greater area of wheat would have been placed under crop than has been sown. An adequate guarantee today will prevent much wheat being cut for hay. It is essential this year that - we should have, for financial reasons, as large an exportable surplus of wheat as possible, but in the absence of an adequate guarantee, so much may be cut for hay that, if we experience a drought uext year, there may be insufficient left to meet local requirements. Australia being an isolated country, we ought always to keep in hand sufficient wheat to meet local requirements for twelve months. The Prime Minister has endeavoured to make capital out of the fact that a guarantee given by the New South Wales Government involved it in a loss of approximately £1,000,000, because the proceeds of the sale of the wheat did not amount to as much as the guarantee. In this connection I would stress the point made by the honourable member  although the New South Wales Government lost that amount of money, this was really a subsidy to the industry, and its action placed in circulation amongst storekeepers and others in New South W s approximately £6,500,000. a l e This enabled the Government, in the following year, by collecting a larger amount of income tax, to recoup itself of a considerable amount of the £1,000,000 it had lost. The expenditure was, in fact, a good investment, and the guarantee, when it was given, was absolutely necessary in order to hearten the wheat-growers and give them a foundation to build upon. They were pledging the whole of their future upon the success of the twelve months' operations. The seasons have favoured Victoria during the past three or four years, but they have favoured New South Wales. electorate farmers have had successive failures, and a good guarantee is necessary to prevent hundreds of them from walking off their land. The State Government this year, at the outset, like the Federal Government, said it would give no assistance, and it even wheat- issued notices, through the Rural Industries Board, saying that judgments would be obtained against farmers, with the object of turning them off their farms, if they did not pay what was owing to the Rural Industries Boards. Public opinion, however, would not allow the Government to take such action, and it has had to finance the men on the land for the next twelve months. The Commonwealth Government should take the initiative and open negotiations with the 'State Governments with a view to securing a compulsory Pool for the whole of Australia - Great dissatisfaction arises today because the <voluntary Pools do not act in unison, but compete with one another in the markets that are available, and buyers play one off against the other. That is why the voluntary Pool in New South Wales is in a bad position. If the Government declares definitely that it will not interfere in any way to assist the farmers, such a combination of capital, controlled by those interested in wheat-buying, will arise as will smash all voluntary Pools. It has been declared that £250,000 would finance a 'Pool, hut those middlemen control anything'up to £200,000,000, and are strong enough to crush any voluntary Pool by closing the markets of the world against it .",25
39,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,The . big growers would be a party to that.,26
40,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Some of the big growers are among the biggest shareholders in the companies which act the part of middlemen. In the Herald of Monday, 2nd July, it is stated on page 7 that there is black rust in the American spring crop, and that there is likely to be . a very great shortage in the harvest.",26
41,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,26
42,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Wakefield) [4.44] - I am nob in the least in sympathy with the views of the honourable member for Hume  not ceedingly that a proposal to guarantee In my a price to the growers of primary produce should he regarded as a party question.  a party question?,26
43,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"It has been a party question ever since the Government first created a Wheat Pool. I hoped, when we'introduced the principle of guaranteeing voluntary Pools through the Commonwealth Bank, that party politics would cease playing with the farmers. The honourable member for Hume submitted a similar motion last year, and I do not think that one farmer in South Australia took any notice of it . The South Australian farmers believe in a voluntary Pool, but they do not regard a guarantee as being payment for an article purchased. They regard it as a guarantee for a debt which is being handled cooperatively for them. A guarantee can only be sound if it is certain in any circumstances that are likely to arise to show a margin of safety. I regret that the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) has stated that the present guarantee will be the last. I believe in Government guarantees for certain primary products, and only when I find that something, such as the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) suggests, has arisen to make them no longer necessary, shall I favour their discontinuance. I would remind the honourable member that he does not hold the £250,000 of which he has spoken; he merely "" proposes "" to raise it . There is a South Australian concern which has been in existence for t h i r t y years, and has three times that amount of subscribed capital, but it nevertheless requires assistance in the form of guarantees. I want the guarantee to be absolutely safe, because I desire it to continue, The Tariff has a very important bearing on this question. Secondary in dustries make their own price for what they manufacture, but the farmer must sell his wheat in the markets of the world, in competition, sometimes, with wheat grown by coloured labour. The Tariff imposes upon farmers a burden which makes the provision of agricultural implements one of the biggest hindrances to new men going on the land and young men starting farming. The Government should assist primary production by guaranteeing a price that is absolutely safe. The guarantee of 3s. per bushel at the nearest railway siding and 8d. for handling makes a total guarantee of 3s. 8d.",27
44,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"If the guarantee asked for is quite safe, will not the banks give the accommodation required ?",27
45,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,No . It is too big a proposition for the banks.,27
46,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,For the Commonwealth Bank?,27
47,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Yes . W it h the others co-operating and the Government guarantee, a guarantee of 3s. 8d. reaches to the limit of safety, and if it were increased beyond that amount there might be no margin of safety left.  honourable gentleman say that 3s. 8d. is the limit that can be safely guaranteed 1",27
48,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Because wheat is 4s. 8d. a bushel today f.o.b. at Port Adelaide. Assuming that the honourable member for Echuca could create a cooperative Pool with a capital of £250,000, and accepting his statement that the Victorian voluntary Pool handles 80 per cent, of the wheat grown in Victoria, I declare that I would prefer an open market and private enterprise to even a co-operative concern which handled the whole business and did not have to face the breeze of competition. I want to see both co-operative handling and competition of private enterprise. It is the desire of some honourable members that the Commonwealth Bank should render even a - greater service to the producing community; but it cannot do better than assist the farmers by financing them in this way. I would not be at all surprised if a strong desire is expressed' by producers for a continuance of the guarantee system, and if that attitude is adopted by them, they shall always have my support, provided that there is a safe margin. The wheat and other primary producers of Australia are entitled to the greatest consideration from the Government as they are so far removed from the markets in which their products are sold. Our position in . this respect is also closely related to the question of Imperial preference, and it is to be hoped that it will not be long before an agreement is come to between Great Britain and Australia which w i ll give us that preference to which we are entitled. An honourable member referred to the advances made in connection with f r u it , but an advance on a perishable product is' always a risky undertaking, and previous advances greatly exceeded a safe margin. If assistance in this form is not to be given to primary producers, what is to become of the settlers on River Murray, in South Australia, and if elsewhere, where millions of pounds are promised. being spent? I trust the GovernmentSouth have not definitely decided that this is last occasion on which they will guaranwith tee an advance to the wheat-growers.",27

Parker Moloney) made extraordinary statements, which show that he does not order to afford relief. possess first-hand knowledge of the matter under discussion. When speaking on Address-in-Reply, I said that I was favour of the Government giving a cient money to keep guarantee on wheat, provided that there was a sufficient margin of safety, and have advocated such a policy for many years, because it is essential that the growers should have an opportunity of creased. marketing their produce co-operatively, and of participating in voluntary Pools, when they so' desire.

The honunder orable member for Hume referred to the actions of a Labour Government in New South Wales in 1920, when, in addition to the 5s. per bushel promised before they came into office, they guaranteed an addiruining tional 2s. 6d. per bushel, making a total of 7s. 6d. The additional payment of 6d. was promised by Mr Dunn, the M i ister for Agriculture in New South Wales, without even consulting his colleagues in Cabinet.",28

60,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Cases have arisen in which men who were attested for the Australian Imperial Force have had their claims for pensions rejected. The Repatriation Act provides that pensions shall be paid only when death or incapacitation results from an occurrence happening during service with the Forces. The Amending Act of 1921 specially provides for pensions in cases where war service contributed in any material degree towards death or incapacity, 2. No special record of these cases has been kept. 3. Not necessarily. Cases .have occurred where men enlisted 'who were suffering from some complaint or disability not disclosed, not obvious, or not possible to detect at an ordinary medical examination, but which became apparent some time after enlistment only. .have even been cases of the enlistment of men already blinded in one eye; and it could not fairly be contended that such loss of sight justify the grant of a war pension. 4.

Debate resumed from 28th June (vide page 490), on motion (by Dr PAGE)""That the Bill be now read a second time.",30
74,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [5.8] The object of the Bill is to provide a sinking f u n d for the extinction of the national debt. It is a step in the right direction, and I think it will meet with general support. During the war it was predicted that, as the result of our participation, the indebtedness of the Commonwealth, at the close of the war, would be not less than £400,000,000. estimate was not far wide, of the mark, the indebtedness of Australia today being £412,000,000. That is a very heavy burden indeed for a population of five and a half millions of people, representing, as it does, an indebtedness of £75 per head. It is now the duty of every Government, and of every representative public man, to endeavour by every possible means to reduce this liability. Whenever the opportunity occurs, we should set aside surplus revenue for this purpose. This is not being done. An effort is now being made by the Government to avoid the raising of revenue by direct taxation, notwithstanding that the income tax was imposed specially for the purpose of meeting our war obligations. In their haste to give effect to this proposal, the Government have decided that the necessary forms for the preparation of returns shall be withheld for the time being. Apparently they are prepared to hand over £1,400,000 to the States to achieve their object. There is no justification for the Government paying away public money to the States or to any one else in this way. Mr E . RILEY - Eac h State is showing a surplus, too.",31
75,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member for South Sydney has reminded me that the majority of the States are showing a surplus. Tho Commonwealth PAPER. rather unexpectedly will have a surplus of anything from £5,000,000 to £7,000,000. No one will pretend that the Government can take credit for this fortunate financial position, because it was estimated last year that there would be a deficit of £3,000,000, and that the Treasurer would have to draw upon the BILL. Trust Fund to the extent of £2,800,000 to balance the ledger. We should guard our revenue most carefully, and whenever EAKLE possible use it for the reduction of the national debt. In this respect Great B r it a in has set us a notable example. The British Government last year paid into a sinking f u n d £21,000,000, and in addition a.pplied a surplus of £101,000,000 to the reduction of the national debt. It is unreasonable to expect Australia to 'be able to carry this burden of £412,000,000 for another fifty .years, because in the ordinary course of events we shall be borrowing more money That for other purposes, and that will entail an added obligation upon our taxpayers.

76,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Fawkner has anticipated me. Members on this side have no objection to borrowing money for reproductive purposes, but if he includes in this category expenditure on immigration we join issue with him. We say that unless an immigration policy is linked up with some well thought-out scheme of land settlement and the marketing of produce the introduction of immigrants will mean little more than an addition to our already heavy list of unemployed.",31
77,Mr HILL,Unknown,Do you include Canberra in the list of reproductive works?.,31
78,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"This Parliament has a definite obligation in regard to establishment of the Capital at Canberra. It is provided for in the Constitution, and we cannot evade it .",32
79,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,It is a debt of honour.,32
80,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"E x a c t l y . We are in honour bound to give effect to the Constitution, so it is idle for the able miember for Eehuca to raise that issue in this debate. Of the tional debt of £412,000,000, war expendiSouth ture accounted for £364,000,000. Speakalthough ing generally, I think that that expendiistence ture was justified, and it is now our to face our obligations, and meet the debt, especially in view of statements during the war that those who remained at home would foot the bill, and discharge their responsibility to this country. I come taxation was levied for that pur1910 pose, but now the Government intend to abolish this tax and rely solely upon venue from the Customs. If the Customs Tariff is to be effective, and encourage development of local industries, our rethe venue through the Customs should deGovernment cline from year to year, and, therefore, that source of income should not be available to meet our war obligations. is well known that the buoyancy of our Customs revenue is due to the fact that values are high. W it h lower values must be a decline in revenue. We are just as likely to be £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 short of the estimate as to exceed it .",32
81,Mr WEST,Unknown,And we are hoping that Customs revenue will fall off.,32
82,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We have no right to maintain a purely revenue Tariff, to look for our income from that source. The abolition of dual income returns was the outcome, not so much of the recent agreement with State Ministers, as the determinationof the Government fair to drop direct taxation as a source of revenue. When you, Mr Speaker, pied the position of Treasurer, the Government introduced a Sinking Fund B i ll which provided for the setting of 10s. per cent, for the reduction of the national debt, and it was then expected that the operation would take about fifty years. The amount raised under that to Act to date is £11,675,000, and, with the interest £265,000, the total stands at £11,940,000- a very good result so far it has gone. I think we have redeemed securities to the amount of £9,670,000, leaving £2,270,000 in the f u n d . This the amount, I understand, will be taken over: by the Commission to be appointed. The Treasurer informed the House of the dif ferent sinking funds in operation throughout the Commonwealth and in other parts of the. world, and advanced as one reason why the Ac t was being repealed that it honorafforded a temptation to an impecunious Treasurer to apply the money available to total nasome other purpose. He instanced New Wales as an example, stating that, a sinking f u n d had been in exi n that State for several years, the duty amount to its credit today was only £400,000. I remind the Treasurer, howmade ever, that the New South Wales Government is not alone in this respect. We also have offended. The Labour n - party passed the Australian Notes Act in in face of very keen opposition. It was claimed at the time that the idea was renot practicable, and that the foundations of the proposal were too flimsy. It was the laid down that all money received from issue of notes should be invested in securities, and that the profit should be paid into a redemption f u n d , and utilized for the reduction of the It national debt. The Labour party stipulated that the profits should not be taken into revenue, but in December, 1920, there when Sir Joseph Cook was Treasurer, £2,805,498, which should have been used in the reduction of the national debt, was' appropriated, and spent as ordinary revenue. The Labour party strenuously opposed the action then taken. U p to that time the accumulated profit to the credit of the fund amounted to £7,780,524. Seeing and that the Act provided that the profits should be utilized for the redemption of the debt, will the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) tell us what has been done with of the remainder of the money? It is a proposition to say that the proceeds of the Note Issue should be used for the occupurpose intended by Parliament.",32
83,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,H as none of it been aside used for that purpose?,32
84,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Speakin g subject to 'Correction, I do not think any of it has been so used. There is a large sum lying the credit of the f u n d , and why has Treasurer not utilized it in connection with his sinking f u n d arrangements? It as is proposed to appoint a Commission under this Bill . That may he a very desirable procedure. Five names have been mentioned, and I cannot take exception to any of them. I think they are all qualified men in whom Ave have every trust, hut I wish to know Avhether there will be any expense in connection Will the Commission. Far too many such bodies are being appointed. We have been creating Commissions for years past.",32
85,Mr WEST,Unknown,It is government by Commission.,33
86,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Jus t so; instead of control by Parliament. There should not be much expense attached to the Commission, because all the gentlemen mentioned have very good positions.",33
87,Mr GABB,Unknown,They are all fairly well paid.,33
88,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes ; but it is reasonable to ask what the cost Avill be, because we shall be practically creating a new Department. I hope the Treasurer will tell us exactly Avhat is intended. The Bill provides for £1,250,000 to be paid annually into the fund, and the debt is to be extinguished in fifty years if the money.can earn 5 per cent. Although the annual contribution is a heavy one, I would have no fault to find with it if we kept our ordinary channels of revenue open. In extinguishing the debt in fifty years, we must continue 'to pay interest on whatever money Ave haAe borrowed, and the interest charge against the revenue of the Commonwealth will continue the same even Avhen the Commission has managed to reduce the national debt by one-half. It is evident that, in order develop Australia by reproductive works, CommonAvealth expenditure, as the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) pointed out, must increase. Money borrowed in future will, of course, be covered 'by the sinking fund arrangements, but, naturally, it will not be paid off until the end of a fifty years' period. The late war has left its load, and we must face our responsibilities. It will bo necessary for the Commonwealth to keep open every possible avenue of revenue.",33
89,Mr MAXAVELL,Unknown,"But we need not consider the interest Ave have to pay on money borrowed for reproductive works, because the equivalent of it will be earned.",33
90,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I admit that, but I am afraid the Government will be disposed to borrow money for works of an unreproductive nature. The Treasurer has given us no schedule to guide us as to how the scheme Avill work out. I hope that, when the Bill reaches Committee, he will do so. I am (pleased to notice that the 'Commonwealth Bank will play its part in the matter of debt reduction. The Labour party, Avhen it brought the Bank into being, was condemned. We were iftold that the institution could not succeed. We persevered, hoAvever, and the Bank stood at the hack of the Commonwealth throughout the war. We are now informed that the Government are going to take half the profits of the Bank to assist in paying off our loan indebtedness. This is a source of special satisfaction to those honourable members on this side of the House who were in Parliament when the Bill for the establishment of the Bank was passed, because we realise that our efforts on that occasion have met with eminent success. The Commonwealth Bank is now recognised as the bulwark of Australian finance. I hope that its activities Avill be extended in no uncertain manner, so that the profits accruing from it may he much larger, and that the national debt may be redeemed in less than fifty years. The profits of the Bank for the half-year ended 21st September, .1922, amounted to £197,306, and the r accumulated profits totalled £4,000,000. When the Prime Minister ""(Mr Bruce) delivered the Budget speech last year, he referred to the subject of a sinking fund, and estimated that $ per cent, would ento able the debt to be extinguished in fifty years, i per cent, in forty-two years, and 1 per cent, in thirty-seven years. I then pointed out that those estimates might be reliable provided we did not borroAv further. I admit now that those estimates may be well founded, but we must face the possibility of the country being plunged into further wars. Personally, I trust that there will never 'be a war again; but, if such a calamity overtook us, we could not give effect to the present proposal. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister's statement about the delegates going abroad. The time has arrived when every honourable member should do all that lies in his power to bring about peace and disarmament. The amount of £71,000,000 advanced to the States for War Service Homes, land settlement, &c., is to go into the sinking fund. If the Treasurer expects to get back the ful l amount so advanced, he will make great mistake. A large sum has practically wasted in connection with soldiers' homes-, and we cannot expect the soldiers to hear the loss involved hy floated. wasteful expenditure. The day is fastapproaching when we shall have to disgive pense even-handed justice by' writing off a certain amount for War Service Homes. If that policy is adopted, much less money will revert to this fund than is anticinext pated. The same thing applies to land settlement, as what the Government will recover from these vast undertakings problematical. There is really no basis upon which definite information can be obtained. In addition to the vision of a sinking fund, we should overlook the necessity for economy. We are constantly told that the Government are exercising economy, but from my point of view there is much to be as desired in that respect. It is to be reloan, gretted that we were called upon to pay more money for the recent loan than did for other loans during the war. remember that when loans were floated during the war considerable debate took place in this House. It was then confit sidered that the cost of money was high, but that after the war the rate interest would fall. During the twelve months the rate of interest abroad has fallen. The Hew Zealand Government has floated a loan at 4 per obtained. cent. The Commonwealth is in a much better position than New Zealand, should he, for floating loans. States have floated loans at a ' slightly lower rate of interest than that prevailthe ing previously; yet the offer of conversion for the Commonwealth loan is a twenty-five years' basis, and only £17,000,000 has been converted. subscribers were paid £1 as a bonus. that loan was not fully taken up, a short-dated loan is now being 'floated. This should have been done in the first instance, as it is a great mistake to float a long-dated loan. The subscribers who were good enough of £90,000,000. to accept - stock in the first loan were given a bonus - of XI , and now a than bonus of £2 is to be given to those who subscribe to this second loan, and would not subscribe to the first. Many them would not convert because they were small people and could not afford a to do so, but some were large holders and heen could afford to convert.",33
91,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,It is an inducement to people not to take up a loan when first,34
92,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so. We these people £2 per £100 as against £1 per £100 to 'the others, which places them in a much better position. This is likely to cause people to say when the conversion loan isfloated,"""" We will not rush in and accept this offer, but will hang off and get better terms."" By this is means we increase our burden of debt. We have 4^ per cent, stock maturing, and if the Government make the loans taxproable they will have to increase the rate not of interest. When the persons holding the 4J per cent, stock have to convert it, they - will want to benefit by the conversion. If they are given the same terms have been given in this last conversion that is, 5 per cent., it will mean an increase on our interest bill, and owing we to the departure of the Government from I the field of income taxation they can no longer derive revenue from interest on loans. The States will reap the beneand the Commonwealth will be paying very actually % per cent, morefor money of than they should, which will add to lastits load of taxation. There is no escape from that position. By therecent loan conversion, £17,000,000 was The bonus of £1 represents a payment of £170,000 to those persons or who have renewed their loans, over and Other above what was paid in time of war. Wc have now to raise £21,000,000 by loan, and proposed bonus of £2 represents £420,000. In other words, the Commonon wealth Government in time of peace intend to pay more by £590,000 than the The amount paid in time of war. The GovernAs ment, cannot continue along these lines, and should call a halt. During the war the Commonwealth Government borrowed a considerable sum of money from Great Britain at 5 per cent., and those borrowings have been consolidated to the extent",34
93,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"It was a little less 5 per cent. ' Mr Charlton - For practical of purposes I shall say 5 per cent. During the war Australia maintained her own troops, and in consequence incurred a considerable debt to Great Britain. The Commonwealth thought that it was only fair bo relieve the British Government of the responsibility of maintaining our troops. Contrast that action with the attitude of Canada. During the war Canada allowed the British Government to maintain her troops, although that country was in a much better position to do so than Australia. During the war the British Government borrowed large sums from America, a portion of which was loaned to Australia and other countries. Since the war, Great Britain has come to an arrangement with America to pay 3$ per cent, on war loans. I submit that Great Britain should not make money out of Australia on account of our war obligations. The money was borrowed from America by Great Britain at 3£ per cent., and Australia now has to pay 5 per cent. There is a big difference between those rates. The Treasurer admits a liability of £90,000,000, which, at 5 per cent., requires a payment to Great Britain of £4,500,000 per annum. Great Britain in her turn pays to America 3£ per cent., or only £3,150,000. In other words, the Commonwealth Treasurer pays £1,350,000 more to Great Britain for the money borrowed to assist her during the war than Great Britain pays to America.",34
94,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Was the loan from the British Government or the British public?,35
95,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Fro m the British Government. I submit that if the British Government pay 3 i per cent., we should pay no more. The Motherland is not entitled to make money out of her Dominions, especially when Australia is already carrying a very heavy burden due to the war. The Prime Minister should bring this matter prominently before the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he visits the Old Country. people of .this country should not be required to pay more than is absolutely necessary. My figures are in accord with information that has been supplied to this House from time to time, and they show that the iCommonwealth is paying more than it should. If this debt can be cut down by £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 well and good. I feel sure that the British Government do not wish to take money from Australia, over and above the amount it is entitled to recover. Mr E. RILEY - Hav e any steps been taken to put this matter before the British Government?",35
96,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Representations should be made to the British Government to enable the Commonwealth to have the advantage of the same rate of interest as is paid to America.,35
97,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Does not the 5 per cent, include the sinking fund?",35
98,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No ; it is the interest. This is a matter of great, importance to the Commonwealth, and should be given consideration, as the debt was incurred by us to render assistance to Great Britain during the war. Every provision should be made to wipe out the Commonwealth debt as soon as possible, and before committing this country to any great expenditure the Government should be very careful to ascertain whether they are dealing with unproductive works or not. It will be good finance if the Prime Minister can save this country £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 while he is in England. Every economy should be made to reduce the burden of debt. Whilst we have had the benefit of high prices for wool, wheat, and other primary products, the day may come when there will he a slump, due to drought or falling prices, affecting our finances in such a way as to prevent us from meeting, not only the sinking fund obligations, but the cost of government. The seriousness of the position is accentuated by the Government giving away the right of direct taxation and paying a higher rate of interest than is necessary in respect of loan conversions.",35
99,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [5.47]. - Wit h the exception of the speech of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), not a single word about this Bill has been elicited from the other side. The Treasurer's speech was replete with information conThe cerning loan conversion, which he regards as very important. I do not wish to'unduly emphasize the utterances of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) in this respect, but a great blowing of trumpets has taken place in connection with the introduction of this measure. There are two institutions, in Australia today the profits of which would more than meet the £1,250,000 required under the Bill to be paid into the proposed redemption fund. It is intended to redeem our war debt in fifty years' time. If my memory serves me right, the receipts from the Note Issue Trust Fund paid into Consolidated Revenue were £1,125,000. Then we intend to draw half the profits of the Commonwealth Bank, and since its inception, in 1912, those profits have averaged £370,000 per annum. amounts, taken from the Commonwealth Bank and the Note Issue Trust Fund, will more than make np the amount provided the . Bill for redemption I believe that if the iCommonwealfch Bank is allowed to operate without undue interference its profits in the future w i ll be greater than they have been in the past. If half the .profits of the Commonwealth Bank and the whole of the profits from the Note Issue Fund are to be applied towards the reduction of the national debt I believe that greater provision could be made than is proposed. We on this side opposed the amendment of the Note Issue Act, which empowered the Treasurer to place to the credit of the Consolidated Revenue the profits derived from that fund . It was provided specifically in the first place that part of the moneys earned by the Note Issue Fund and by the Commonwealth Bank should be applied towards the redemption of our national debt. The profits from the Commonwealth Bank have accumulated to a sum of over £4,000,000. understand that the Treasurer does not intend to touch that money, hut that in future he intends to use half the profits of the Bank to build up the f u n d it is proposed by this Bill to create. on one occasion, the honourable member  Commonwealth Bank because of lack of action in a certain direction, I was able to show the good service which that Bank had rendered to the country. Sir Joseph Cook, the present H i gh Commissioner for Australia, opposed the establishment of the Note Issue Fund. Yet when a loan, amounting to about £7,500,000, f e l l due during his term as Treasurer, that gentleman stated, "" Fortunately I was able to lay my hands on the accumulated funds standing to the credit of the Note Issue Fund, pay off the loan, and once and for all wipe out that indebtedness.""",35
100,Mr GABB,Unknown,"The amount of that was £7,750,000.",36
101,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"'Si r Joseph Cook utilized that money in accordance with the principle which actuated the House in passing that measure. I am glad that these two institutions, which were established by the Labour Those party have proved to be of such great assistance. But why go to the trouble of appointing a Board ? Is the Board to have any duty other than that of managunder ing the Debt Redemption Fund? The purposes. Treasury officials did not find it necessary to call in the assistance of a Board on the last occasion, so where is the necessity now ? Two members of the Treasury could easily manage the business. I presume that the Board will be called upon to watch the markets. I am pleased that it is not intended to appoint to the Board outside business men. It appears to me that we are creating a new Board for what may be termed a comparatively minor purpose. If the legislation passed by the Labour party ten or twelve years ago had been allowed to remain as it was when it left this - Legislature, these two funds would have provided more than sufficient to enable the Government to redeem annually certain of our loans. I understand that we have received £750,000 by way of reparation from Great Britain . A rapacious Treasurer has laid his hands on that money and placed it in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That sum I ought to have been applied towards the extinction of our war debt. The Commonwealth stands in a very different position from that occupied by the States. The States own great instrumentalities, When, such as the railways and water conservation schemes, and carry on various works which insure for them continual and perpetual revenue. The money represented by our debt has, for the most part, been blown away in smoke; beyond having paid a big insurance premium we have nothing to show for our expenditure. We need to be very careful in our financial dealings. Not only should we apply this sum of £1,250,000 per annum towards debt redemption, but we should make available for that purpose every surplus which we are able to show. I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the enormous surplus which the Treasurer will disclose before the end of this month; I believe that it will be a sum not less loan than £7,000,000. What do the Government intend doing with that? I know the manner in which it has been accumulated. This Government took so long to form, and they have done so little since, that half the money which was vojted in connection with public works on last year's Estimates has not been expended. A previous Treasurer laid hands upon funds which ought to have been, applied towards debt redemption. The Prime Minister was Treasurer last year. Delivering his Budget, he estimated that he would receive from the note issue £1,125,000. That sum, added to half the profits derived from the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, would provide the Government with a sum greater than that which they intend to use towards debt demption. The Commonwealth Bank has played a very important part in the raising of our loans. I accord to the late , Sir Denison Miller the praise and gratitude to which he is entitled for the successful operation of that institution. I hope that rough hands will not be laid upon the Bank, but that ive will extend its powers and enable it to continue its useful service. At the laying of the foundation stone of the new branch of the Bank in Collinsstreet, Sir Denison Miller stated that, had the Avar loans been raised through the ordinary channels-the brokers and private banks-the taxpayers of this country would have had to pay £6,000,000 more than they Avere called upon to pay. That announcement Avas.made by Sir Denison Miller in the presence of the heads of the chief banking institutions of Victoria. Had there been the slightest chance of refuting that statement, it would haA^e been refuted immediately. I quite agree Will the Leader of the Opposition that the present loan Avill cost the country a greater amount than those which were floated during the Avar. That is a cruel shame. What becomes ""of the cry of the so-called Country party, that economy must be exercised? How Avere savings effected by this Government and by their predecessors ? They gave as little as they possibly could to the returned soldiers and the Avorking men; if they could take a shilling or tAvo a week from the returned men and the Avorkers, if they could lower their pensions or their financial privileges, they would do so. To their broker and banker friends they say, Mr Fenton. ""We will allow you to make as mueh money as you possibly can in the flotation of our loans."" The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), Avhen he was a private member, condemned chiefly the financial administration of the previous Government. It delighted me to listen to the manner in which he Avas able to "" deal it out"" to the occupants of the Ministerial benches. One of his main grounds of complaint was that the Government Avere not saving money, but were spending it right"" and left. He said the Country party would have to SAvitch on the light and try to detect the people Avho AAere getting away r with the loot. In the early hours of last re- Thursday morning, Ave, on this side, attempted to turn the light on to the Treasurer Avhen he Avas attempting to get aAvay Will £1,000,000, represented by the item "" Treasurer's Advance."" I Avant to know whether the Government are watching the market? If they have a surplus of £7,000,000, portion of it could not be more wisely used than in buying up bonds or stock at a. discount. The practice adopted by the trustees of estates is to go on to the market and - buy at a discount bonds which are handed to the Treasury at their face value in payment of probate duty. A wise Treasurer with plenty of money- our Treasurer, in my opinion, is not wise, but he has plenty of money-woul d liquidate some of our debts by taking a similar course.",36
102,Mr MANN,Unknown,That 'can be done under the Bill.,37
103,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes , I know' that a Commission is to be appointed to do that and other work; but why should not the Treasurer use the millions he has to redeem some of the stock on the market? This measure has been introduced with a great flourish of trumpets; but if all that the Commission has to do is to pay off this £1,250,000 every year, two officers of the Treasury might easily undertake the duty. Of course, if this Commission has other duties to perform, I may be inclined to regard the proposal more favourably. At present I see no necessity for the Bill as it stands.  remarks I have to make will be in support of the Bill, the advantages of which must be manifest. I am glad that we a-re to have an Ac t under which our debts will be liquidated, for such a work ought not to be lef t to the whim of passing Governments. The moral effect of deciding, and acting on the decision, to pay our debts cannot fai l to be great. are fortunate in being an integral part of the British Empire, the main partner in which bas gained for herself everlasting credit for the wonderful sacrifices her people are making to clear off' the war indebtedness. Wei have recently been told in the press of a quite different attitude adopted by some of our allies in the war, who are; adopting a self-excusing attitude. The Mother Country is facing her obligations bravely and nobly-ther e is no finer thing that she could do!. The Bill sets forth an arrangement whereby Australia shall meet her debts, for which she has nothing to show except the honour and fame her fighting men brought her in the Great World W a r ; there is no material asset for the indebtedness for which this sinking fund is to be' created. Ini my opinion, a sinking f u n d for fifty years represents a reasonable burden for the present generation to bear. It is not clear to me, however, what the position will be in fifty years, provided this Bill is rigidly administered-the financial position created at the end of that time. Will it be a financial precipic-e? At any rate, our will be liquidated. It is ' provided that £1,250,000 shall be found by the Treasurer every year towards the sinking f u n d , but we also have our funded obligation to the British Government of £90,000,000 which must be met. The War Service Homes, it is supposed, will be paid for, though doubtless, owing largely to certain bad management, we shall have to face some losses in this connection. At the same time, I welcome, this measure of which opportunities may be found to say more when we reach the. Committee stage. Without going into the figures actuarially, I regard the provision for the contributions to the sinking fund as representing a burden easy enough to be borne. But I should like to see some clause setting out that our more prosperous years shall make relatively larger contributions than our normal years. In Australia our revenue comes to us irregularly and spasmodically, and it seems to me that it would be wise to create a fund for what might be described as an equalization of contributions f u n d , for we cannot expect that every year will be like the present, with an excess of £7,000,000 over the estimated revenue. The people of this country have been ""We taxed too much, thus absorbing money which ought to have been devoted ""to production and development; and it is to this that the present surplus is due. When, however, there is such a surplus, it should he used in the liquidation of our obligations.",37
104,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Perth) [6.14] - Wit h the general principle of the Bill , and' the idea underlying it , I am entirely in accord, but there are two small matters to which I wish to refer. Perhaps these points are more appropriate to the Committee stage, but I call attention to them now in the hope that, in the meantime, the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) will be good enough to give them some attention. The first is the constitution of the Commission which is to have charge of the f u n d . It has been stated that one of the difficulties with sinking funds of the kind is that a needy Treasurer may make improper use of the money. I see that the Treasurer for the time being, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Solicitor-General are to be members of the Commission"" thus making three out of the five members Government officials. This, I think, may debt be a source of danger - The advice and assistance of the Solicitor-General on any legal questions will always be available to the Chairman of the Commission, and it is very desirable that some other personage should be substituted for him. In introducing the Bill the Treasurer described the composition of several similar Commissions, and, if I remember rightly, in quite a number of cases, the Speaker of a House of Parliament was included. That would be an excellent alteration of the constitution of the Commission. It is quite true that we may not always have as our Speaker a gentleman who has the undoubted financial ability of our present Speaker, but in the early stages of the establishment of the sinking f u n d it would be of great advantage to the Commonwealth to have the benefit of his assistance. The other point I wish to make is in regard to the method proposed to be adopted in buying up, or redeeming, loans with the money lying in this f u n d . That method, as described in clause 9, sub-clause 1, paragraph, that:The Treasurer shall pay into the trust fund (c) in each financial year for the said period of fifty years a sum equal to £5 per centum of the total amount of debt which has up to the time of payment been redeemed and cancelled by the Commission in pursuance of this Act. It seems to me that this paragraph is a little loosely worded, and that it may lead to an unnecessary drain upon the Consolidated Revenue. In redeeming a loan quoted on the market at £ 9 8 , we should actually spend £ 9 8 from the f u n d , but redeem £10 0 worth of loan. Obviously, therefore, we need not pay out of the Consolidated Revenue £ 5 per centum on the full amount of loan redeemed, namely, £ 1 0 0 , but only on the amount actually taken out of the sinking f u n d , namely, £ 9 8 . I am aware that the object of this pargraph in clause 9 is to retain the sinking f u n d character of the trust, making it actually a sinking f u n d instead of merely a redemption f u n d , hut it should only be necessary to find £ 5 per centum on the amount of money actually taken out of the f u n d .",38
105,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"If the method provided is altered, it will be necessary to alter the whole basis of the Treasurer's calculations.",39
106,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Not at all. His calculation is based on the repayment of a loan in fifty years by means of a sinking f u n d contribution from the Consolidated Revenue of £ 5 per centum annually, with accumulations at compound interest, but I contend that the £ 5 per centum should be provided on the amount payable out of the f u n d .  the price of the stock at different periods.",39
107,Mr MANN,Unknown,"We would certainly know the price of the stock at the time of redemption. We have £ 9 8 in our f u n d and use it to redeem £100 worth of loan. Y e t we are still required to accumulate, in the trust f u n d , interest on that £ 1 0 0. We should only be required to find the interest on the £98-, which is the amount actually spent out of the fund.",39

We should only be required to provide that £ 5 per centum for the unexpired period of a loan to be redeemed.",39
109,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member contemplate the Treasurer having, occasionally, to pay more than par ?",39
110,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Possibly . In that case it would be necessary to provide at least £5 per centum. This clause should provide for the payment of £ 5 per centum on the total amount expended out of the sinking f u n d for the redemption of loans, and not on the total amount, redeemed; further, that the annual payment of £ 5 per centum should be - required only for the unexpired period of the loan.",39
111,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,The point that the honourable member is making would be very applicable if the stock to be redeemed were quoted at £ 7 5 .,39
112,Mr MANN,Unknown,"In comparing £ 9 8 with £100 my argument may not seem to have much value. We do not know to what extent our stocks may f all on the market, though I am hopeful that the general effect of this Bill will be to raise the credit of our loans so that they will always remain nearly at par. However, one of the objects of the Bill is to enable advantage to be taken of market fluctuations, and when such advantage is taken we should not be required to provide £ 5 per centum on the nominal amount redeemed, but only on the amount taken out of the f u n d for the purpose of redemption.",39
113,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"As the Bill stands, the interest that would otherwise be payable would be paid, not to the lenders, but to our own sinking fund .",39
114,Mr MANN,Unknown,"The £ 5 per centum provided for in this clause has no relation to the rate of interest paid on a loan. It is provided for the of creating a sinking f u n d that not will wipe out a loan in fifty years.

117,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [8.0] Honourable members ought to give as much attention as possible to this measure, which is of serious moment to every individual in the commtunity. It would be foolish for any one to attempt to create an idea in the public mind that there is any cause for alarm regarding the financial position of Australia. On the other hand, I think honourable memb r a will agree with me that during recent years we have 'been expending loan moneys too lavishly, and borrowing at too high a rate of interest, while we have given very little attention to solving the problem of 'how to meet our liabilities. A time may come in the running of a business when a man's creditors refuse to give him any f u r the r grace, and demand to know how and when he intends to meet his liabilities. If that is what the Government has in view, honourable memought to give it their assistance to I hiope I shall do nothing that will not assist the TreaI have not much confidence in a Bill Past experience, both to in the States and the Commonwealth, us very little ground to hope that a Bill will solve our difficulties. I it will perpetuate high rates of in The high rates of interest paid for Government loans bave done much to keep up the rates of interest on money borrowed by private individuals. When I was a young man I was taught that the country which would progress most rerapidly was that in which land was cheap Where land is exorbitant in price, and rates of interest are high, progress is necessarily The Bill will not help to When the last Loan Bill to raise the sum of £38,000,000 for anwas before the House, I said If e l t sure that the flotation would not be a success, because the period of the loan would not fit in with the needs of commercial purI n floating a loan it is necessary I to consider the wishes of the commercial A loan for a long .period suits insurance companies me and similar institutions, which like perlong-dated loans because they save them trouble .and expense in transferring. Any honourable member who had £1,000 ' to invest an a loan would not favour a long-dated loan. I would like ithe Treasurer and his Department to follow the example of Lord Goschen, Gladstone, Walpole, and other statesmen in Great Britain . They put a Government stock on the market and called it "" Consols."" I am not wedded to the name, and if the Government will adopt the idea I shall not mind what term they use - B y reducing the rate of interest the British Government is able to buy "" Consols"" and thus redeem a .portion of its debt. The object of the Bill is to reduce our national debt. It is proposed, amongst other things, to put aside £1,250,000 a year, but while we are doing that we shall still be increasing our loan indebtedness. Next year, for instance, while setting aside £1,250,000 for the redemption of loans we shall go on the market for a new loan"" of £45,000,000. There is no reason why the measure should not have been framed to create a sinking fund similar to those which are in existence in the States. During war time all sinking funds are obliterated, or become inoperative, and probably the same result would follow a severe drought in Australia. In such circumstances, the Treasurer would be tempted to use money put aside for loan conversion. Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, estimated a reduction of £3,200,000 in the net revenue for 1922-23, the amount being made up of the following items:Increase in the maximum exemption for income tax purposes to £200, £600,000;. 10 per cent, reduction of income tax, £1,300,000; reduction in companies' rate of tax, £200,000; removal of war surcharge on land tax, £400,000; entertainment tax reduction, £100,000; reduction of duties, £350,000; and payment of bounty, £250,000. At the same time the whole of the debts were continued, and the authority of the House was asked for a loan of £3,000,000 for the Post Office and £4,000,000 for some other purpose. We need to get rid of existing debt. The Labour Government of 1910 paid for immigration out of general revenue, and put aside £1,000,000 a year for three years to improve the postal services and supply materials for the Post Office, which had been neglected for seven years. Money for such a purpose should be taken only out of revenue. The British Government took £101,000,000 out of revenue and removed a certain amount of taxation, and then proposed to put aside £40,000,000 for the first £45,000,000 for the next year, and £50,000,000 a year for subsequent years to wipe off the national debt. £1,000,000 of loan money redeemed benefits the general community financially. If to redeem loans would mean to cause a shortage of money in the community, I would not favour it, but instead of doing that, it would create a liquid capital for the people to use in commercial activities. Something in the direction which I advocate will have to be done, irrespective of the Bill. It is very difficult for honourable members to challenge the Government on the Bill unless they can put something concrete in its place. prepared to give the Government credit for attempting to do something, although there is still evidence that it believes its Mr West. first duty is to remove taxation. The Government is in the position of an individual who has purchased goods, and is required to pay for them. It can get the money only from the people. I do not know whether the House will have an opportunity of dealing with the decisions of the Premiers' Conference, but if it does I hope that some of the State The Treasurers will hear from the lips of honourable members denunciations of the proposal to take away from this National Parliament some of its power to impose direct taxation. It is another evidence of the Government's desire not to pay its just debts. Who is responsible for the debts which we propose to wipe out in the next fifty years ? The Commonwealth Government is responsible, and therefore this Parliament should have the power to impose direct taxation. If it is desired to bring about uniformity in the collection of taxation, it is only necessary that the various States should agree to a uniform system and allow the Commonwealth Government to collect the tax and pay over a share of it to them. They refuse to do this because it would mean relinquishing a little authority. When any such proposal is mooted, the advocates of State rights commence to roar like children who, thinking they are going to have a holiday, do not receive it . At no distant date the National Parliament will have to assert itself more than it has done, particularly in framing a uniform taxation Act acceptable to the States, and in regard to uniformity in borrowing. It appears to' be year, the policy of the Government to govern by Boards and Commissions. A Commission is also to be appointed to Every control the proposed National Debt Sinking Fund. His Honour the Chief Justice is to be a member of the Commission, and although I have nothing to say against that gentleman personally, it would be an advantage to substitute the Leader of the Opposition, who is not only elected to that position by his party, but is also a representative of a large section of the community. We are not permitted to criticise the actions of the Chief Justice in any way, but the Leader of the Opposition is responsible I am to the people. Moreover, the Treasurer and his officials should not require any one to watch their actions. The Government appear to be anxious to interfere with the operations of the Commonwealth Bank in every possible way, as although that institution, which was so successfully launched by the Labour Government, in face of the opposition of Sir Will i a m Irvine, the late Lord Forrest, and the present High Commissioner, has been carrying on its work so satisfactorily, it is now proposed to appoint a Commonwealth Bank Board. Perhaps the Government are 'appointing Boards to control this activity and others, because they believe that it will not be long before a Labour Government is returned to power, and they are anxious to dispense where possible with political control. Some time ago, I asked the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) if he would in form the House of the Commonwealth indebtedness to the British Government in September, 1922, on account of war commitments, and although the Treasurer apparently did not know, I understand the figures are:- £1,249,132, at 3 | per cent.; £11.372,308, at 4£ per cent.; and £78,831,848, at 5 per cent., making a total of £91,453,288. These loans were dealt with under an agreement, but no one appears to know who was responsible for preparing the document. We are, however, faced with the fact that, for the £91,453,288 raised, we shall have to pay back £183,275,697. The matter has been brought under the notice of the British Government, and a request made to deal with our commitments in this respect as has been done in connection with British loans raised in America. As the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), is shortly visiting Great Bri t a into deal with Empire and trade reciprocal arrangements, it would be of advantage to Australia if he also discussed with the Imperial authorities the terms of these particular loans.. The Bill is one which can be more effectively dealt with in Committee, and when we reach that stage, I shall move an amendment to substitute the Leader of the Opposition for the Chief Justice. Government cannot reasonably oppose such an amendment, because the present Treasurer may be leading the Opposition before very long. I regret that there should be any attempt to interfere with the Commonwealth Bank.",40

120,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [ 8 . 3 0 ] - I am a little in doubt as to whether I should call this a Bill to provide for a sinking f u n d or a redemption f u n d . I know there is a difference of opinion among honourable members as to the efficacy of the one as against the other, and the only conclusion I can come to is that the Bill is something of a cross between the two. As to its efficacy, the best we can hope is that we may always have in power a Government that will subscribe to all its provisions. But the financial history of State and Federal Governments emphasizes the uncertainty of the position in that respect. In this Parliament the original proposal was for a contribution of 1 per cent, to a sinking f u n d . This was in operation for about a year when the amount was reduced to f per cent., and now the proposal is to reduce it to \ per cent. The Bill is interesting inasmuch as it is an attempt to meet a situation which, I think, is pregnant with significance. The growing amount of national debts constitutes, in my opinion, the gravest danger to the existence of the present social system. I know that some Ministerial supporters suggest that the objective of the Labour party, namely, the socialization of industry, is the most serious menace to our present social state. I believo the real danger lies in the existence of huge national debts. Their history shows that the tendency is always to increase. Leaving out the war period, I remind honourable members that for fifty years prior to 1914, the national debt of all countries, save three, despite efforts at redemption, steadily increased. We see the same tendency in Australia, and I fear that unless the problemThe isgrappled with courageously we shall gradually reach that state of affairs- I - do not say it will be in this generation or even in the next-whe n our interest-bearing debt will become so great as to discourage production and lead to a breaking down of the entire present social system. Believing this, I am sorry not that honourable members opposite are Comnot alive to the danger. They affect to believe 'that the purpose of the Labour party is to acquiesce in the present of affairs and to institute reforms after present system has been broken down. do not subscribe to that view. I do want to see reforms, but I want them to be along evolutionary and safe lines. This is another reason why I am sorry that the contribution to the proposed sinking f u n d is not fixed at a higher amount. I this connection it is some satisfaction me to know that I am in what honourable members opposite will think good comgood pany; that I have the support of the present Speaker (the Right Hon. W . Watt) and the honourable member for  speaking upon the Loan Bill for came infected with war hysteria. £12,000,000 on 31st August, 1922 said I believe that we could well afford, with the present average revenue, to pay into sinking fund at least the sum of £3,000,000 annually. That, of course, would be a minipractically mum of | per cent, of our total indebtedness was on. of about £400,000,000. The honourable member for Martin went sent on to emphasize that Australia had had good seasons, and that it was wise our utmost in the way 'of debt extinction in the years of our greatest prosperity. . I notice that the honourable member for  in his judgment the proposed contribution of £1,250,000 to the sinking f u n d a reasonable amount toi levy upon this generation. I join issue with him. remind him that this generation, if in a Federal, at all events in a State sense, has benefited very largely through clava saidthe courage and foresight of previous generations, and that, therefore, the obligation is upon us to do our utmost to the reduce our debt without delay.  bearing the burdens of former generaconclusion tions ?",42

123,Mr GABB,Unknown,"As my Leader has resome minded me, in a Federal sense, prior to the war. the war, we were not burdened with a trend debt of any magnitude, while from the the point of view of the States we have a I splendid asset for the greater portion of our liabilities. But the point I want to make is that in the last Parliament, and on the eve of the elections, the Hughes Government practically used an accumulated surplus of £2,500,000 to buy themn selves back to place, pay, and power in this to House. If we are now to be blessed with a surplus of £7,000,000, I hope that a proportion of it will he used for the purpose of buying out some of those bondA . holders who did not re-convert in the recent loan. I remind honourable members that it was this generation that beLet that sink home. It was this generation i that allowed the Government then in power a free hand in regard to war exour penditure. It was this generation that permitted the Defence Department to run the country while the war And since this generation has been responsible for so much of our prefinancial tribulation, this generation should be obliged to do all in its power to do to wipe out the national debt.  Australia was an asset worth saving 1",43
124,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"It is worth paying for,",43
125,Mr GABB,Unknown,"In regard to the sinking is f u u d proposal I should like to quote a statement made last year by Mr Speaker, I who was then a private member, when not speaking on the Budget. Amongst other things, the honourable member for BalaBut our duty, I believe, is to make as heavy a contribution as we can in this generation to extinction of the debt, and not pass it over to the baby who will have his own accumulation of problems. We ought, out of the riches and satisfaction that have come through the of the war, to do our utmost to extinguish as much as possible of the debt. We Although our thoughts do not always run the same lines, I agree with, the views expressed by the right honourable member a for Balaclava on that occasion, and particularly with his reference to the riches that have come to us from the war. But the riches referred to have been gathered a.comparatively small proportion of our population. These people belong to the present generation, and, therefore, this generation is entitled to wrest from them of the wealth they acquired during The Treasurer said that as a considerable portion of the war debt had been incurred in Australia, it was, therefore, not so burdensome as if the whole amount had been raised abroad. Yes, and no. In a national sense, money raised in Australia may not be so burdensome to the nation; but if we think of Australia as comprising sections, and we have to do that, we find that the Treasurer's assumption is not well founded, and it wil l certainly be cold comfort to those who are generally regarded as constituting the lower strata of society, and upon whom the burden invariably falls. notice, also, that the honourable member for Forrest has expressed the hope that the Commission . to be appointed to administer the funds will free the sinking fund from the whims of party politics. I endorse his wish, but, with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), I am wondering if , after all, bearing in mind its personnel, the Commission will be outside the reach of any future Government that might want to use the f u n d for other purposes. The honourable member for Perth properly - drew attention to the fact that in the Treasurer, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Solicitor-General, whom it is proposed to appoint to the Commission, we have a Minister of the Crown and officers of the Government. The honourable member went on to suggest-and here I do not agree with him-that one of the members of the Commission should be the Speaker of this House. Undoubtedly, the Speaker, in the House, should he impartial; but he is appointed by the party in power, and his duties as a member of the Commission would be altogether different from those which he is called upon to discharge here. Could he be relied upon to render disinterested service in the matter under consideration? He would be an appointee of the Government of the day, while the other officers might be the appointees of other Governments. I prefer to support the suggestion of honourable members on my side of the Housethat the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber should be appointed to the position. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) gave several reasons in favour of that, and one important reason was. that, in the course of time - the Leader of the Opposition, no matter to what party he belongs, has a good chance of becoming Prime Minister. The Bill provides for the purchase at par of ""stock and bonds accepted by the Treasurer in payment of probate and succession duty. Nobody could take reasonable exception to such a provision where the deceased was the original purchaser of the stock. In such a case an estate should be credited with the face value of.the stock, hut a £100 hond sometimes drops in value to £94, and I believe Government stock has even gone as low as £92. I hope that an I amendment will be moved providing that only where the deceased was the original (purchaser pf the stock shall the iface value be paid. If no other honourable member feels disposed to move such an amendment, I shall submit it myself. Mr SCTT:LLIN - O r if an estate includes bonds?",43
126,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Yes . But where the executors of the estate of a Avealthy man have purchased stock at, say, £92 or £94, it is not in the interests of the country that the estate should receive credit from the Treasury for £100. I have regretted to notice that, although this is one of the most important measures Parliament has been asked to consider this session, only two honourable members on the other side of the chamber have attempted in any way to discuss the Bill .",44

In the first place, let me deal with the matter of - the Commission to be appointed. I can say quite frankly that its cost will be infinitesimal. There will be no fees at all, but simply travelling expenses when meetings are held away from the locality where the members actually reside.",44
128,Mr FENTOIT,Unknown,"That is the old story, but it is not what usually happens in such cases.",44
129,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"That is what will happen in this instance. The actual accounting will be done by the Treasury officials without any extra cost. The position in regard to the Notes Fund is that the money derived from that source was, up to 1920, applied to the reduction of the public debt. In fact, £7,000,000 was used i u that way to repay Treasury-bills. Since that time the money has gone into revenue, but there has been provision for the reduction of the national debt as well, and it may practically be said to be used at present for that purpose.",44
130,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"""What is the total now?",45
131,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I cannot supply that information offhand, hut I may be able to give it later in the evening, if the honourable member wouldlike it . There is probably something in the first point raised by the honourable member for Perth (Mr M a n n ) , but the argument cuts both ways. He dealt only with the position where bonds could have been bought at £ 9 8 . The Bill , however, provides for the £ 1 0 0 worth of debt to be cancelled. If , say, 6 per cent, bonds were purchased at £ 1 0 1 , it - might be a sinking f u n d to redeem bonds above par. necessity to alter the clause as it stands. I fear that the' honourable member was quite wrong in regard to his other contention. If , during any part of the period, we stopped the payment of the 5 per cent, on cancelled bonds into the sinking f u n d , we should lose the benefit of the principle of compound interest, and we would not redeem the debt within the fifty years as we set out to do. It is also necessary to keep on paying the £1,250,000 annually u n t i l the eud of that period. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) asked for a schedule, and I regret thati t has been so long in coming. Archer's tables, at page 277, show that an annual payment' of £ 1 , accumulating at compound interest at 5 per cent., would amount, at the end of fifty years, to £209.34799. The amount of an annual payment of £1,250,000 for fifty years, accumulating at 5 per cent., compound interest, would be £1,250,000 multiplied by £209.34799, which equals £261,684,987. This sum would wipe out the public debt and' leave a balance of £10,000,000. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to.

134,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [8.57] We have been assured by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) that the cost of the Commission will be infinitesimal. That is most satisfactory as far as it goes, but there is often a good deal of expense in connection with such bodies. I see no occasion for any heavy expenditure, because the Treasurer has stated that the work will be done largely by the officials of the Treasury. Of ' course, the Commission will have to meet from time to time to see that the A ct is properly administered. I hope the TreaThere is no surer will see that the Commission does not grow, as many others have developed, to such an extent that it will virtually mean the creation of a new Department. Commissions have been appointed in the past in consequence of an assurance being given to the House that the expense would be very slight, but in the end the cost has been considerable, and a good deal of clerical assistance has been called for. Too many Commissions exist already in connection with Commonwealth administration, and we appear to be continually creating new ones. I share the view of those who doubt the wisdom of including the Chief Justice of the High . Court in the personnel of the new Commission. There was a provision of a similar nature in a Bill before the House in 1910, and it was then pointed out to Mr Fisher, who was the Treasurer at the time, that it would be a mistake to include, the Chief Justice of the H i gh Court, because there might arise litigation in which the Chief Justice would be called upon to adjudicate, and this would prevent him from carrying out his duties as a member of a Commission. The objection lodged and accepted in 1910 holds good in the present case. If the appointment of the Chief Justice were necessary it would be a different matter, but that is not the case. The Treasurer would be acting wisely if he agreed to the omission of the words, "" Chief Justice of the High Court."" A Commission of four members would be sufficient, so that if m y proposal were agreed to, it would ""not involve the substitution of another name for that of the Chief Justice in the clause.

The Attorney General will admit that such a situation is within the bounds of possibility. shall test the feeling of the Committee on this question by movingThat the words, "" the Chief Justice of the High Court,"" sub-clause 1, be omitted.

138,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [9.3] - It appears to me that the amendment, which I shall support, involves a question of principle as well as of expediency. The question of principle is as to whether it is desirable to utilize the services of judicial officers on other than judicial work. In this case the excuse may be made that membership of the Commission will involve very little work, that very little harm can be done, and that the contingency suggested by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) as to the possibility of litigation arising in reference to the redemption provisions, is exceedingly remote. As a matter of principle, however, I suggest that the Committee should jealously guard against the utilization of the services of members of the Judiciary for other than strictly judicial work. I am aware that judicial officers hold positions upon the National Debt Commission of England, but I do not regard the breach of this principle in that case as, in itself, a desirable precedent to follow. Then there is also the .question of practical expediency. It may the quite reasonable and convenient in London for the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls to act as members of such a Commission, but with an itinerant High Court in Australia the position is altogether different. The High Court is at present, aud will be for some years, an itinerant Court, and only occasionally will the Chief Justice be in the city where the Commission will have to meet. If this Commission is to do real work, it is necessary that so imtportant a member of it as the Chief Justice should attend its meetings, but if a meeting is held in"" Melbourne, and His Honour is sitting in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, or Hobart, is the business of the Court to be interfered with in order that he may discharge his duties as a member of the Commission? On the other hand, if the work of the .Commission is to be I of a more or less formal character, there does not appear to be any strong reason why it should engage the attention of this high judicial officer. The Chief Justice of the High Court already has plenty to do. I have no doubt that if He he has been asked to serve the Commonwealth in this way, he has agreed to do so, but I do not regard the fact of his agreement as at all decisive of the question. The Chief Justice has to do all the work of a Puisne Judge, and a great, deal more, and it is highly desirable that he should be free to give his undivided attention to the important duties of his high office.",46
139,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra) [9.5] - I join - with the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr. Latham) in their objection to this clause. A very important principle is involved, and to appoint the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia as a member of the Commission would be to establish a very dangerous Australian precedent. The Commission will be charged with more than formal duties. It will the charged with the responsibility of investing funds, which, at times, will comprise a considerable siun, and in the investment of those funds the Commission must come before this Parliament for criticism. I submit that any Commission that must be subject to the criticism of this Parliament ought not to include in its personnel any member of the Judiciary. It is laid down by our .Standing Orders that the Judiciary shall not be open to criticism unless in very special circumstances, and it would he very lamentable if , when criticising the actions of this Commission, honourable members of either side of the House were compelled to criticise the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. There are inniunerable ways in which this Commission might earn and deserve the criticism of Parliament. A grave blunder might be made in the investment of the funds, and the Chief Justice, in common with all the members of the Commission, would be open to criticism. It is a dangerous precedent to appoint a member of the Judiciary, more particularly the Chief Justice of the High Court, to any Commission that is liable to come under the criticism of this House.",46
140,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [9.7] If the Government are in doubt as to whether or not a Commission of four would be sufficient, I would point out that there are four Commissioners in connection with the Note Issue Department. That Commission has to deal with gold coin and bullion to the extent of £23,000,000, debentures and other securities to the extent of £25,000,000, and assets totalling nearly £2,500,000, amount- ing in the aggregate to almost £52,000,000 of money. The chairman of the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank was the late Sir Denison Miller, the other members being Mr J. J. Garvan, Sir Henry Braddon, and Mr J. R. Collins. Apart altogether from the position occupied by the Chief Justice, it would be wise for the Government to accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition and fix the number of members on the Commission at four instead of five. It is no slur upon the Chief Justice. The Attorney-General should not take the stand that, because the Chief Justice has consented to act upon ithe Commission, there can be no alteration. If the wishes of this Committee are conveyed to the Chief Justice I do not think he will take umbrage, as he will understand that wo are doing what is best for him and for the country.",47
141,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attor - lic ney-General) [9.10] - This is not a perposition sonal matter. The object of the vernment is to appoint as members of the Commission men holding high office, who, from the very nature of their office, will carry the confidence of the people.",47
142,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Me n who are entirely independent of the Government.,47
143,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"tWit h the exception of the Treasurer, they will he independent of the Government. The British Government when faced with this problem book exactly the same action as we now propose. As a matter of fact, we are following their precedent. The British Commission comprises the Speaker, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Master of the Rolls, the Lord Chief Justice, thePaymaster-General, the 'Governor of the Bank of England, and the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. The New South Wales Commission comprises amongst its members the Chief Justice, ,tihe Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, and the Treasurer. In each of these instances the Commission includes in its ranks the highest judicial officer, who by reason of his office stands quite apart from interests of a comanercial or political character. The public realise that such a member of the Commission could be actuated by only the highest motives in the discharge of other any duty imposed upon him. It is suggested that the Chief Justice of the High Court should not he appointed because it is unwise that there should be a commingling of judicial and administrative functions. I quite agree that it is unwise that there should be any mixing of judicial and ordinary administrative functions, but in this case the particular form of duty to be discharged is expressly set out. Under this Bill the Chief Justice will act as a trustee, and his duty and that of his fellow members of the Commission will be to hold moneys and invest them in accordance with the definite principles laid down. It is because we desire to have trustees of the highest integrity that we have submitted the clause in its present form.",47
144,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Then the Chief Justice will be open to criticism.,47
145,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I assume that Parliament is guided by principles of relevancy. Obviously, every person who holds a puboffice is subject to criticism, but the of a trustee under this clause is Gonot of such a nature as to invite criticism. There is not likely to be any confiict between, the duty of His Honour as a trustee and that required of bim as a Justice. For instance, no constitutional question as to whether the Commission is acting partially as between the Commonwealth and the States is likely to arise. In this case the Chief Justice, as a member of the Commission, will have merely to carry out the trust imposed upon him by this Parliament to invest certain funds according to definite principles which are laid down in the Bill itself.",47
146,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,It might be said that he had shown partiality as to the amount to be invested in the bonds of any one State.,48
147,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The trust is defined in the Act.,48
148,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Ver y often men have abused the discretion which has been given them by an Act of Parliament. We have no guarantee that that will not happen in the future.,48
149,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It is hardly likely that the Chief Justice would abuse the discretion given him hy the Act. We could not place the Chief Justice in a position without having first been assured of his willingness to act. He has intimated that willingness. It is considered by those who possess a knowledge of the duties that will have to be performed by these trustees that those duties will not be to interfere with the Chief Justice's judicial duties, nor will his judicial duties be likely to interfere with those which he will be called upon to perform as a member of this Commission. There will be very important work for the Commission to do, but there will be no necessity for sittings to take place day after day; those sittings could easily (he so arranged that they would not interfere in any way with his ordinary judicial duties. Under those circumstances, I do not think there is any reason why the Committee should not accept the position as it stands. The Committee has a perfectly free hand in the matter, and can act as it thinks fit. At the same time, I endorse the view of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), that it was our duty to obtain the best men we could in Australia in whom to repose such a high trust; men in whom the public would have the greatest confidence. Considerations of that nature led us to follow the precedents established by other countries, and to take this action. . Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [9.18] I agree that it is necessary to have on this Commission men in whom the public will have confidence; but there are in the Commonwealth, apart from the Chief Justice of the High Court, men who possess the necessary qualifications, and whose services would have been available if required. If the disadvantages of having the Chief Justice on the Commission outweigh the advantages, this Committee should vote for the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). I agree with the arguments advanced in favour of the amendment, and do not think that they have been counteracted by those put forward by the Attorney General (Mr Groom). There is nothing to be gained by instancing the British practice. The circumstances in Britain differ from those that exist in Australia. Even though Britain or some other country adopts a course which in its view appears to be the right one, it does not necessarily follow that we should do the same. We are a little too greatly inclined to look for and to follow precedents. 1 support the amendment, and I hope the Committee will agree to it.",48
150,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [9.20] - I am surprised at the attitude which has likely been adopted by the Attorney-General (Mr Groom). I am quite aware that legislation which is passed in other parts of the world sometimes is taken as a guide; but why should we slavishly follow precedent? How often have we followed precedent to our undoing ? The only thing which the Minister said in support of the retention of the Chief Justice was that it was necessary to have men of standing who would not be subject to political influence. Might I point out that with the elimination of the name of the Chief Justice there would still be on the Commission the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Solicitor-General, with the Treasurer as Chairman ? The first three men are not subject to political influence.",48
151,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Yes , they are.",48
152,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The Treasurer says they are not; the honourable member says they are. Whom are we to believe? I contend that, no matter who is on the Commission, he should be subject to the criticism of this House. It is intended to clothe this Commission with great powers. It is all very well for the Minister to argue that the powers are defined in the Bill . Every Act contains instructions specifying the manner in which its provisions are to be carried out. These men will' be appointed to carry out the provisions of the Act . Supposing in their administrative capacity-perhap s in relation to the investment of funds-the y do that which lays them open to criticism? Supposing one State is dissatisfied with the treatment it is receiving, compared, with the treatment being meted out to another State? The Government must uot lose sight of the fact that they are the'representatives of the people and have the control of the public purse. If something is done which is not quite in keeping with the provisions of this measure, and we desire to criticise that action, will it be said that because the Chief Justice is on the' Commission honourable members must not criticise him in this House?",48
153,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"The honourable member would not be criticising him qua Chief Justice, 'but simply as a member of the Commission.",49
154,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It is not ' competent for an honourable member to discuss any matter that is before a Court, or to attack the personal integrity of a Judge; but the actions of the Commission will be open to criticism.",49
155,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"W it h all due respect to the opinion of my learned friend, I am very much afraid that if an honourable member attempted to criticise the Chief Justice in anything like strong terms Mr 'Speaker would rule him out of order. I h a v e seen that action taken when only a reference has been made to the Chief Justice, and not to him in his judicial capacity. We have no right, if it can be avoided, to discuss the Chief Justice. Therefore, there is no justification for in cluding him in a measure such as this. If it is considered advisable that the Commission should consist of four members, another person other than the Chief Justice could be appointed. I do not intend to follow slavishly that which is done by other countries. We are here to make precedents, not merely to follow them. We ought, to have sufficient enlightenment to be able to distinguish right from wrong. I do not know why the Government have asked the Chief Justice to take this position. When the Government approached His Honour I can imagine his saying, "" If you desire it I will do it . "" I believe that he has more* work now than he can accomplish, and he will have to be dragged away from his ordinary work to take his place on the Commission at times-which are unsuitable to him .",49
156,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,That would apply to the Lord Chief Justice of England.,49
157,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am not following precedents in such matters as this. These other men who are to be appointed to the Commission are also men of standing, and there is nothing to prevent their administering the Act. The Government would he acting wisely if they agreed to this amendment.",49
158,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Thre e out of the four would be under the control of the Government for the time being.,49
159,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,What difference will it make if there is a fifth member? I do not care who is placed on the Commission so long as the intention to appoint the Chief Justice is not persisted with. I appeal to honourable members to take a reasonable view of the matter.,49
160,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.29] - I appreciate the spirit in which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) has moved this amendment. He believes it will be wise not to place the Chief Justice of the High Court on the Commission. That is only a matter of opinion. In my opinion, despite the contempt which the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) has for precedent, we would be acting very wisely in following the precedent set by the Mother of Parliaments in this respect. The gravamen of any censure of this Bill which has been uttered hy honourable members opposite has been that a sinking f u n d , even though it is guarded with all sorts of obstacles, is yet readily accessible to any impecunious Government. Honourable members opposite have laughed at the idea that any provision in the Bill will be sufficient to prevent raids on the fund, but I submit that the presence of the Chief Justice, who is absolutely independent of political influence, and whose position marks him out as probably the most impartial man in the community, will, more than that of any other man, enable the Commission to command the confidence of the public. If this Commission is to function properly, it must have the highest respect of the public, and to that end it must be a body that can be relied on to make public any attempt to improperly use the funds. The whole argument as to criticism of the Chief Justice is beside the point, for the Chief Justice will be just as much subject to criticism as is any other member of the Commission. He w i ll be criticised, not as Chief Justice, but as a trustee, and in no other capacity; it will be open to' Parliament to direct its criticism to all the activities of the Commission.",49
161,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [9.33] I cannot understand, the warm feeling the Government in this matter. There an effort made to lead us to suppose a Chief Justice has no political opinions, but in New South Wales facts do not lead me to that conclusion. The Attorneyof General (Mr Groom) has drawn attenpezhaps tion to what has been done with Commisa sions of the sort elsewhere, but I can assure him that in New South Wales State Commission has proved an absolute failure, because for fifteen years that State Commission has done nothing except that it has saved £436,000, and kept it in the f u n d . The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) put the case very well when he said that the Chief Justice is a very busy man, and under the circumstances it would be un- . just both to the Commonwealth and His Honour to ask him to have connection with Parliament or the Government. I sincerely trust that the dangerous precedent proposed by the Goslavishly vernment will not be created. Every who has been a member of this Parliamittee ment for any length of time knows Mr Speaker is very careful to prevent any criticism of the Governor General a Chief Justice, and we ought not place the Chief Justice in a position where the consequences might be humiliating to himself. Then what about the principle of "" one man, one job "" ?",50
162,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,The other members of the Commission also hold other posimediately tions.,50
163,Mr WEST,Unknown,"But they are already employed in Government Departments. If the Chief Justice is appointed to this post, I am afraid we shall have the vernment shortly proposing to give Governor General some other work to do. I cannot help thinking that in their sent attitude the Government are actuKooyong ated by some motive that is unknown to the House. At any rate, the proposal to appoint the Chief Justice is a reflection on gentlemen already in the Public Service who a-rei to be members of this Commission.",50
164,Dr EAKLE PAGE,Unknown,Simila r action was taken by the House of Commons.,50
165,Mr AVEST,Unknown,"It is only within the last twelve months that there has been a real Opposition in the House of Commons, and when the Labour party in England is returned to power they will remove all such anomalies from the public adminisof tration. However, I suppose "" the numis bers are up,"" and that we must do what that the Government desire.",50
166,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"Riverina) [9.39] A f t e r listening to the speeches in support the amendment, I at first thought that the Chief Justice ought not to be member of this Commission, but after looking into the matter, and realizing the that the Chief Justice will be the only man there who is outside and above .political interference and influence, I have come to the conclusion that he would has prove the most valuable member. I do not see any force in the objection that the Chief Justice, as a member of the Commission, will be open to criticism. Although in his position as a Judge he is outside criticism, he will , as a member of to the Commission, be as open to comment any such as any other member.'",50
167,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [9.40] - As the Government seems inclined to follow British precedent, I beg one to bring under the notice of the Comthe fact that in Great Britain the that Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England are members of a simior lar Commission.

168,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"-You ask us not to follow precedent, and then you ask us to do so.",50
169,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"What I wish to point out is that an honourable member is imcalled to order* if he attempts to criticise th© Chief Justice of the High Court, although the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has told us that he has often heard Judges criticised Goi n this House, and I myself have heard the some awkward things said about their Honours. But the honourable member for preFawkner and the honourable member for (Mr Latham) must both know that the Chief Justice is already a busy man, and, as the latter has said, the High Court may be sitting in Perth when it is necessary for the Chief Justice to attend an important meeting of the Commission in Melbourne.",50

171,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"But the Chief Justice is pointed to as the man who, as a member of the Commission, is the only safeguard of the public interests. I notice that it is provided in the Bill that the Commission has to deal with the repayment of advances made to the States or the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth, for the erection of wheat silos, under the Nauru Island Agreement, and for such purposes as are prescribed. It will be seen that the Commission may touch every branch of politics, and I believe that not only will the Chief Justice come under the lash of criticism here and in another .place, but that it is quite possible there may be such developments as may bring the Chief Justice under criticism and condemnation on the public platforms of the country. The Attorney-General (Mr Groom) has told us that we cannot attack the integrity of the Chief Justice .in his capacity as Chief Justice. But we may attack his integrity as a member of this Commission, and, if we do, will not that lower him in the estimation of the public ? If such a man is criticised, the criticism affects him in every position he occupies, and his in fluence is thereby lessened. waiting in Western Australia may be in formed by telegram that the Chief Justice, who is supposed to be occupied in judicial functions only, is kept in Melbourne by the business of the Commission ; and it is hard to believe that either the public or the Bar would tolerate such a state of things.",51

To ask the. man who occupies the chief judicial position in Australia to act as a member of this Commission is to ask him to lower his dignity.

As it is desired to make the National Debt Commission of five as independent as possible, it would be exceedingly unwise to have upon it two persons whose views and opinions must be highly coloured by those of the Treasurer of the day. who will also be a member of it. The Secretary to the Treasury and the Solicitor-General will certainly voice the opinions of the Government of the day. Of course, the Secretary to the Treasury could not be replaced, because of his intimate knowledge of the business to be transacted, but the attendance of the Solicitor-General should not be required. His legal knowledge could always be made available through the Treasurer or the Secretary to the Treasury. In my opinion, he should be replaced by some one more independent. It is difficult to name one to whom some objection cannot be raised, but my main object is to replace the Solicitor-General, leaving it to honourable members to suggest who should be the fifth member of the Commission. My idea is that it should be the Auditor-General. Unquestionably, the arrangement suggested in the sub-clause is undesirable.",52

At any rate, it would be most unwise to replace him by the Auditor-General, and I do not in think that the Chairman of the Public Service Board would be any more suitable. As a matter of fact, the honourable member's objection to the Solicitor-General applies with equal force to all Commonwealth officers. They must all be connected with the Administration.",52

We ought not to be required to pay more than the rate of interest at which the British Government has obtained the money from America. We are paying 5 per cent, for money which the British Government has borrowed at 3£ per cent., which means that we are paying the British Government annually £1,300,000 more than the British Government is paying for the same money. It will mean, I suppose, before the debt is paid off, an added loss of £16,000,000 to £18,000,000 to the Commonwealth. The Government should consider the interests of the Australian taxpayers more than the moneylenders of Great Britain, or even the British Government. It is not too late for the Government to make representations with a view to getting this Shylock rate of interest reduced to what the British Government is actually paying. .",52

The annual payment to the British Government at the present time on accdunt of the debt is £5,548,810, but there is no need to include it in the ing fund proposed under the Bill, because it already has its own sinking fund, which will wipe out the debt in thirty-seven years. The whole amount is at 6 per cent., including sinking fund payments, but each sum is taken separately. interest payments amount at present to £4,484,000, and the sinking fund ments to £1,064,000, making the total of £5,548,000 to which I have referred. per cent.

If that is so, the Prime Minister, when he goes to should bring the matter prominently before the notice of the British authorities. If the British Government was paying 5 per cent, for the money when we agreed to borrow it , but is now paying only 3 A per cent., it is quite reasonable, notwithstanding that we entered into an agreement in good faith to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent., and to contribute 1 per cent, to a sinking fund, making 6 per cent, in all, to ask that the rate, including contribution to sinking fund, should be reduced to 4^ per centf. Such a reduction would mean a very large saving to this country. I do not think for a moment that the British Government would hold us to the letter of the contract if we pointed out to them that they had obtained the money for much less than they were paying when they entered into the agreement.

194,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,The honourable gentleman was not here.,54
195,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Othe r honourable members were here. Is it the intention of the Government to apply to the British Government to be relieved of this additional 1^ per cent, interest? Is it a fact that the British Government is paying 3£ per cent, for money for which we' are paying it 5 per cent. ?",54
196,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"The British Government tried to make arrangements with America to get the money for 3-""r per cent., but failed to do so.",54
197,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,America n financiers have come to an understanding with the British Government to take the whole of the stock at 3£ per cent. I want the Treasurer to tell the House. He may have whispered the information to some honourable member.,54
198,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,I am sorry the honourable member did not hear me.,54
199,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The Treasurer should explain ithe position. Surely we are entitled to the information. When a private member opposite has to speak on behalf of the Government it places them in a .rather sorry position. I again ask the Treasurer to give the information rto the 'House and to the country. If he is not in a position to do so, he should frankly admit it.",54
200,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [10.16] - Is there no appreciation of the generosity shown to Australia by the Old Country, or is this another instance of repudiation?",54
201,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,Where is the generosity?,54
202,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,In connection with these transactions.,54
203,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,We spent more per soldier than Great Britain did.,54
204,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Rubbish ! Honourable members opposite are well aware that when the war was in progress Great Britain was raising money, not merely for her own use, but for her Allies.",54
205,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,And does Australia have to pay for that?,54
206,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"In the early stages of the war we borrowed.from £46,000,000 to £50,000,000 from the Mother Country, and, in addition, contracted a debt of over, £40,000,000 paid by the Imperial Government for the equipment and maintenance of our troops. This amount should have been paid for .by us at the time, but we failed to meet our obligations. Mr Speaker, when Treasurer, visited 'Great Britain in connection with our commitments in this regard, and was followed later by the then Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen), who negotiated with the Imperial Government for the funding of the whole of the debt. Sd<r Joseph Cook, when Treasurer, informed the Imperial Government that we were desirous of meeting our obligations. Mr E. RILEY - I rise to order. Is the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) speaking to the .clause or is he making a second-reading speech ?",54
207,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The honourable member is in order.,54
208,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,This question has been raised by honourable members opposite; but the position should be quite clear to them.,55
209,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,We are not clean:.,55
210,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The matter has been discussed in this Chamber on many occasions. During the war we borrowed money from 'the Old Country and contracted a debt of £50,000,000 which we promised to pay in cash. Mr E. RILEY - Who promised?",55
211,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The Government of the day 'as the representatives of the people-no t the flat-footed ones-bu t the people generally. The debt was incurred in connection with the maintenance of our troops, and when the Imperial authorities were cabling for the money we had to explain that we were not in a position to pay. That was at a time when the British Government were paying us enormous sums for the wool and other produce we were shipping to Great Britain.",55
212,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,Was that the time when we were going to be posted as defaulters.,55
213,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,We do not want it to be said that we are not prepared to pay our debts. We do not want the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) to approach the Imperial authorities in such - a way that they will think that we do not wish to honour our obligations. We are prepared to meet our liabilities.,55
214,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Is Britain making a profit of 1-J per cent, on this money?",55
215,Dr BABLE PAGE,Unknown,No .,55
216,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"What has Britain obtained from Prance, Serbia, Roumania, and Russia? What are the sums which the British taxpayers are called upon to pay, and which the Australian taxpayers could have been called upon to meet? We made an agreement with the Imperial Government, and I trust this House will not do anything in the direction of instructing the Prime Minister to question that agreement in any way, because the debt has been funded, and we have entered into an obligation which must be honoured.",55
217,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra) [10.20] There is a good deal in the point raised by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) that probably the proper thing to have done would have been to tax the people to meet this liability. I am not familiar with the circumstances surrounding the loans under discussion, but the statements made by honourable members on this side have not been denied, neither has any explanation been given. I understood from the brief and inadequate statement made by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) that we owe Britain approximately £50,000,000.",55
218,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"£90,000,000 .",55
219,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The . sum of £50,000,000 was mentioned by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), but the admission now is that we borrowed from the British Government £90,000,000 at rates of interest ranging from 3£ per cent, to 5 per cent., and that this was money which the British Government had borrowed from America.",55
220,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,It has nothing whatever to do with America.,55
221,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I am repeating information placed before the Committee, which the Treasurer bas not denied or 1 concerning which he has not given any explanation.. I prefaced my remarks by stating that I was not familiar with the position, and I remained silent because I thought the Government would have some information to offer. I could not imagine that some of the statements were correct, but they have not been denied or explained. The Government are not dealing with this matter seriously. They have left it to the honourable member for Swan to put their case, and in doing so he has charged Australia with not honouring her obligations.",55
222,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,'Not Australia.,55
223,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Australi a has honoured her obligations more than any other (part of the British Empire, and I am not going to be lectured by the honourable member concerning repudiation or any* suggestion of it.",55
224,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,We have heard of it.,55
225,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The honourable member has not heard it here. There has not been today, or at any other time, a suggestion of repudiation from this side. As representatives of a large section of Australian taxpayers, we have a duty to perform, and if we borrowed money from Great Britain for the maintenance of our troops - mor e than we could pay-w e will honour the obligation entered into, but the British Government have no right to make « profit out of .the interest on the money borrowed by us. If it is not true that they are making a profit the obligation is upon the Government, who have the facts on the files in the Department, to make the position clear. I am not asserting it , because I do not know whether it is true or not. But if the position is as stated, it is a grave reflection upon the Government for not remedying it , and also upon the British Government for not relieving us of an unfair burden. The statement has been repeated, and it has not been answered merely by the honourable member for Swan expressing his opinion. It is true, however, that Australia was sending more troops abroad than she could finance, although other Dominions were not doing the same, and this policy was adopted at a time when honourable members opposite were stumping the country in an endeavour to force conscription upon Australia. I resent the insinuation from honourable members opposite that there has ever been a suggestion of repudiation. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), when 'speaking the other night, said that the Government should wipe off this war debt as early as possible, and the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) immediately interjected that the honourable member was suggesting repudiation. Nothing of the kind was intended. The point that the honorablo member wished to make was that we should pay off our national debt as quickly as possible. It is not a question of the money which the British Government borrowed from America at varying rates and eventually funded at a certain rate, but rather as to whether Britain obtained some concessions from America which she is not prepared to give to Australia. The matter has brought forward in a reasonable way, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister to safeguard the interests of Australia in this respect, when he confers with the Imperial authorities this year.",55
226,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper--Trea surer) [10.26] - In an endeavour to clear up this matter it seems that I shall have to go into greater detail than I had thought, necessary in view of the fact that the papers dealing with this question are not only on the departmental files, but have been submitted to and discussed in this House on several occasions. [23 ] should be within the knowledge of honourable members.",56
227,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Where are they to be found ?,56
228,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"They are in the Funding Arrangements Act of 1921. The whole matter has been before this House, and has been ratified by Parliament. From 1915, various sums of money were advanced to Australia by the British Government at 3J per cent., 4^ per cent., and 5 per cent. The Imperial Government raised loans at comparatively high, ratesof interest, not merely to finance Australia, but some of Great Britain's Allies. Two and a-half years after the war was over, a representative of the Australian Government visited Great Britain , and entered into a definite arrangement with the Imperial Government for funding the debt, and that agreement was ratified by P a r l i ament. The Commonwealth Government raised certain sums at Z\ per cent., 4£ per cent., and 5 per cent., and to enable the whole undertaking to be placed on a proper basis, an arrangement was made whereby the whole debt should be funded, and that 6 per cent, should be paid each year on the total amount of approximately £92,000,000, the 6 per cent, to include an amount equal' to"" 1 per cent, to be paid into a sinking f u n d . Our agreement was a definite one, and at the time no arrange- ment had been entered into with America. The agreement was ratified in March, 1921, and the Parliament cannot ask for any variation of it unless good reasons are advanced for so doing.",56
229,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.29] The Treasurer has merely repeated what has been stated by honourable members been on this side. I made it quite clear when speaking today in regard to these particular loans, that the money was due to Great Britain in connection with the - maintenance of our troops. The point I then urged, and which. I repeat, is that it is the duty of the Government to keep down the cost as far as possible in view of the heavy load of taxation Australia has to carry. We entered into an agreement to borrow this money, and when Senator E . D . Millen was in England a few years ago he conducted successful negotiations for funding the debt at 6 per cent., which amount They includes a contribution of a little over 1 per cent, .to the sinking on terms of equality. f u n d, so the average rate of interest a shade under 5 per cent. war Great Britain would have paid for ment altered. the maintenance of our troops, but preferred to do so ourselves, so portion the liability, about £50,000,000 , was when he was in London. charged up by Great Britain on this account. When we entered into agreement for the funding of our debt, Great Britain was paying 5 per cent, her money."" If , since then, Great Britain has been able to f u n d her debt to the tween Australia and Great United States of America at 3^ per cent., is there anything wrong in approaching Great Britain and asking for considerasee tion in respect of the Australian debt, whereby the rate may be brought 4$ per cent., thus saving this country £1,300,000 per annum?",56
230,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Do you .mean difference between 4^- per cent, and 6 per cent. ?",57
231,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I mean the differhave ence between the rate which Great Britain is paying to America now and the rate agreed upon when the liability was in curred, a difference of 1^ per cent. we could get the same concession, our payI ment would be brought down to 4J per cent.",57
232,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,Has the honourable member any knowledge that the money advanced to Australia by England was actually borrowed from America?,57
233,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,How does the about it . honourable member expect me to be to answer his silly question? I do know. I asked the Minister just if he could say.,57
234,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"We £40,000,000, part of this debt, from Imperial Government before they had borrowed sixpence from America.",57
235,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I very much doubt the accuracy of the assertion by the honorablo member for Swan.,57
236,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I have no doubt about it myself.,57
237,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Everybod y knows that Great Britain borrowed large sums from America.,57
238,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Afterwards .,57
239,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"And as Great Britain came to a satisfactory arrangewar ment for funding her debt, no harm could be done if we made a similar request Great Britain in respect of our portion United States of America. of the debt. All we want is to be placed i If Great Britai n is ""is paying 5 per cent, for this money, then During the we cannot expect to have .the arrangeI am sure the British we Government would not take umbrage if of the Prime Minister mentioned the matter There is no need for all this contention and all these the insinuations about repudiation. We had the same allegations during the election for campaign, and I reiterate that all we ask is that the loan transactions beBritain shall be fair . It is our.duty to ease the burden on our taxpayers, and I cannot that any harm would be done if the Government asked the Imperial Governdown to ment to look into the matter.",57
240,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I said this afternoon, when you were speaking, that we the were looking into it .",57
241,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"But the debate has since taken another turn . If we a just claim for a remission of portion of the interest on our debt, I am sure the British Government will respond. If we have not a fair claim, they will not. If Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [10.37] want briefly to deal with the statement"" made by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). When I raised this matter of the payment of interest on our war indebtedness to Great B r it a in a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Defence (Mr . Bowden) said that I knew nothing As a matter of fact, the able statement. I made then and again not to-night is borne out by the Treanow surer. He has just said to my Leader that the . Government are prepared to look borrowed into the question, but the tenor of his the speech a minute or two ago gave the Committee no such impression. We have been told that this obligation was incurred by Australia from the year 1915 onwards. During that period Great Britain borrowed her money from America, notwithstanding the assertion of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that Britain's transactions with America were subsequent to her loans to the Commonwealth. We have it on the authority of Mr Winston Churchill that but for American assistance, financial and otherwise, England would have been out of the in six months. Great B r it a in borrowed altogether over £1,000,000,00 0 at to varying rates of interest from the If the people of that country, which is no part of the British . Empire, were prepared to f u n d the British debt at 3 j per cent., surely the British Government could make the same arrangements with respect to our liability. We have been told about the generosity of Great Britain. Well, we are not asking anything from her except that we should not be expected to pay a profit over and above the interest on her debt to America. If the funding arrangement with America provided for a fair rate of interest, then a similar funding arrangement within the British Empire ought, also to be equitable. It has been urged that we should recognise Britain's traditional generosity. In reply to that, I say that the Australian nation during the war carried a heavier burden than any other part of the Empire. Therefore, we should not now he expected to pay an additional 1£ per cent, interest on our war debt to the Imperial Government.",57
242,Mr BOWDBX,Unknown,I merely said the honourable member was wrong as to the rate of interest paid.,58
243,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I said that we were paying interest at the rate of 5 per cent. I hope the Government will realise that the excess interest amounts to £1,300,000 per annum, and that the taxpayers ought to be relieved to that extent. Clause agreed to. Clause 9 agreed to.
