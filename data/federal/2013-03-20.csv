When this scheme was conceived under the kind of strict non-compliance could easily put a swing tag on the items, so that the display customer-the article which a customer would making a transaction or decision to purchase There was not a swing tag on six of the articles, notice you have done a terrific job with all you reach for the packaged article to take it and your team-but on six items there are Someone might have lifted the swing tag off forbid, they might have gone through a Swedish are all very aware of where you are encouraged connect it up with the stock item that you familiar with that kind of experience, they may to the area where the WELS material is on the want because I've got the tag.'

So here parliament could ask of them in giving effect entirely in keeping with his business mode items that people would purchase-but on someone might have pinched the six tags and 'Okay, we've got one of those.' They go for the Great.' But that was on the tag you have got, happened to the tag, there was a $36,000 fine.

I believe that the July 2006. There was a six-month period which and dispose of stock that had previously come businesses were expected to comply with the legislation. The legislation is all about putting labels rating. If they have a higher rating, more stars very important. It enables consumers to make believe they make those choices on two very choices on the ground that they will save water. believe consumers are making those choices society and consume less water if that is at all we also consume less energy. I speak to people on a regular basis who the way we live today, and anything that they they care about the future of the planet. It has in the years ahead-by the year 2025 or thereabouts-we of domestic water use each year, 800,000 megalitres about 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions more efficiently than we are. We will do that by enabling products choices. Currently, there are about 18,000 market for the very purpose of enabling consumers are certainly taking advantage of that. It machines, dishwashers, shower heads and the to industry in a commercial sense as well. seen over the years in respect to water efficiency Industries also use a lot of water and many and an environmental point of view, have made efficiently. Those decisions come at a cost initially long term those costs are recovered as a result perhaps all of us see on a daily basis is of the country who today, instead of discharging allowing it to drain away, have systems in place used for the washing of other vehicles. The same applies with respect to many other their daily business operations. Many of investments that they have made to reuse that ultimately polluting our waterways when that regime that is currently being practised I certainly share his concerns if that is what is is my view that that was never the intention. in 2005 by the Howard government, is all about which will do several things. It was done in complementary legislation in each of the state intent to comply with the legislation started on 1 gave businesses the opportunity to adjust to in that was unlabelled but, after that, all on products to determine their water efficiency are attached to the product. The intent of that is choices about what products they buy and I important grounds. Firstly, they make the Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I because they want to do the right thing by possible. Also, in the consumption of less water are concerned about the environmental impacts of can do to reduce those impacts they do because been estimated that, through this system alone, will save about 100,000 megalitres of total water use across the country and each year as a result of using water much to be marketed so that people can make those products that have been labelled and are on the to choose which they use, and consumers is not only domestic products, like washing like. These efficiency products go right through Some of the most impressive changes that I have measures come from the industrial sector. of them, from both an economic point of view decisions that enable them to use water more upfront, but I have no doubt that in the of using less water. The classic case that the operators of the car-washing facilities around that water once it is used into the system and where they reuse that water and then it gets facilities that use washing down procedures in them are also now in a position as a result of water rather than seeing it go to waste and water reaches the oceans, into which most of it is discharged. I commend those businesses and because that is the way we should be going. The other area that I commend for the work in water efficiency is the irrigators on our and I notice the member for Riverina is here efficiency gains in the way they use water looking at the agricultural methods that investing in new irrigation systems and monitoring amount of water that they need without wasting it. I certainly do commend them because, as we could save water, water efficiency investment be making those gains. I believe that we can made those investments and also carried out the research. In a world where the population is growing combining that with climate change, there is parts of the world. So we know that we have In fact, it has been suggested that most of the water shortages. Therefore, if we are going have to look at systems that empower consumers why systems like the WELS system are so important: In order to rate a product it clearly has to be also has to be monitored. Whilst I appreciate does have to be monitored. Monitoring the system comes at a cost. To those costs is at about 20 per cent. The intent went into the House in 2005, to recover about costs. The intent of this legislation will enable cent cost recovery. My understanding is combination of state, territory and federal government cent, this legislation of course will mean compliance process that will be implemented. Dunkley quite rightly outlined, one where common not only on the federal government but also appreciate the fact that they will meet 10 per administer the program. Water efficiency labelling the community at large. But it is fair to responsibility when it comes to this. Finally, for the manufacturers of the products, strong and powerful marketing tool. I said efficiencies in terms of both cost savings and rating system will be used by consumers to choose tool for them. The last thing we want to see manufacturers-or unscrupulous retailers for those industries that have done exactly that that has been undertaken over recent decades farms. I believe that the irrigators on our farmsright now-have been at the forefront of making on their farms. They have done that twofold: by they use in the products they grow and also by systems which enable them to use the any and to get the most effective results from we looked at the Murray-Darling Plan and how was the priority in terms of how we should learn a lot from the irrigators who have already and there is a need to grow more food, and likely to be even less water available in some to be much smarter in the way that we use water. conflicts in the future will arise as a result of to be smarter in the way that we use water, we to use more efficient systems, and that is it rates a product on its water efficiency. assessed, and in order for the system to work it the comments of the member for Dunkley, it date, my understanding is that the recovery of is and always was, from the day this legislation 80 per cent of those monitoring and compliance us to move from 20 per cent to around 80 per that the last 20 per cent will come from a revenues. In order to get to that 80 per that additional costs will be imposed due to be The process itself should be, as the member for sense is applied. This is a responsibility on the state and territory governments. I cent of the remaining 20 per cent of the costs to is something that has been embraced by say that all people around the world have a the rating system will undoubtedly be a very earlier how consumers today are looking for more responsibility for the environment. Because the products, it will be an important marketing is the rating system abused by unscrupulous that matter-who simply want to rate a product at a higher rate than it is entitled to because them to sell the products. So it is important that if we are going to have the labelling. For that reason, the compliance have a system in place, it would be unfair complied with the rating system, carried out the to the claims made about it and who have to claims do not stand up to scrutiny. From both system can be relied upon and has integrity, are in place need to be carried through. compliance system that we can have confidence be applied with a degree of common sense.",197

The member for Dunkley, myself and who felt that this legislation has been misused. good purpose and a good design. It is at whether or not there has been a practice of inadvertent strike misuse. The second element that I want to raise, with small-business participants in the water is a legitimate question at this time to look system and the WELS system. Many plumbing feel there is a duplication. I do not come to think that both issues of the first-strike misuse between the WELS and WaterMark system considered by the Senate process. Both are from the implementation and the practice of the provided first hand to myself which need to be considered. Against that background we then have the recovery measure. I am cautious about any cost-recovery way of it through the House. We will look at it to be gouging then of course we would reject it. we will let the Senate inquiry take those examples, the honour and the privilege to introduce the into the parliament.
