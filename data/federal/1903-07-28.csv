4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It was only a few minutes ago that I learned of the honourable member's intention to ask this question. The reply to the first part of it is as follows :Yes.' According to the terms of their engagement, the office hours may be until 6 p.m., should the exigencies of the servioe necessitate it. Some of these officers have worked after 6 p.m., but instructions were recently issued discontinuing the practice. No overtime has been paid. Even if they remain in'the office t ill 6 p.m., they do not work more than eight hours daily, and as a great deal of work has to be performed, not onlyi n the Brisbane office, but also in the electoral offices in the other States, I think that these officers should be employed a reasonable number of hours.

10,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN," Mr Chairman, I feel perfectly satisfied that honourable members will sympathize with me in the task which I have to perform, for it is a difficult and complicated one. No great mass of figures be very interesting, and for that reason I , in turn, sympathize with honourable memof bers who have to listen to, and endeavour the to follow, the financial statement which I to make- a task which - to most of them must be a somewhat difficult one. I to ask the Committee to remember, when we dealing with these figures, that 'they do not relatefcoany one particular State. If rewe bear that fact in mind, we shall realise that although the figures, in the aggregate, may appear to be large, they have in reality to be divided into six separate as amounts. Thus, while I may speak, for example, of an expenditure of £30,000 to £40,000 in relation to any work, prehonorable members must not fall into the for mistake, so often made in the various States, of believingfchafcfchewhole of that amount has to be found by any particular State. When certain Bills providing for expend the ture have been beforefcheHouse people in my own district have often said to me"" What an immense amount Victoria has to pay in connection with that matter. I see that the Government are going to spend £30,000 or £40,000."" But when their have been disabused of the misapprehension under which they laboured-whe n they have been told that the expendiof the ture would be divided over the whole exCommonwealth - the figures have not on loomed so largely in their eyes. Another Western complication in regard to the prewill sentation of the Budget at the prethe sent time arises from the fact that when I first entered upon the consideration of this subject, I found that an immense amount of arrears, representing something over of £300,000, was associated with the first half-year. I felt that if I included those figures in the ordinary Estimates for the this year, the result would be that the people in would be told, and would believe, that we of were incurring an expenditure to that exto take tent, in excess of the amount which had been expended during previous years. In addition to that, that amount would be deducted from the true expenditure of the previous years, and the amount made to appear double. Therefore I was forced for the first and second years to adopt the practice of ""having, not only the Estimates for the year, but also Estimates of arrears for the previous year. I am glad to say that the amount has been reduced to £30,000, and for the future I propose to allow the amount to go in with the ordinary Estimates without making special provision, because we may rely that at the end of each financial year, do the best we can to pay our accounts-and we made the best effort we could this year-there will always be a certain amount to carry forward, either in consequence of accounts not having been sent in, or in consequence of accounts not having been paid by reason of some difficulty. have circulated, as usual, for the information of honourable members, a large amount of statistical information, and I propose to ask them to allow me, as they did last year, to go through the different papers without attempting to get in advance of the particular one I am dealing with, and in order to shorten as much as possible the remarksI have to make, I propose, with concurrence, to give the mere results, and not to quote an immense number of figures. If I were to quote the figures which would be absolutely necessary for all the States, I should have to occupy a period of time - which would tax the patience of honourable members. I shall give, as far as possible, the results of the figures, and, in the edition of Hansard which will be published tomorrow morning, full details will be given for the information of honourable members. Tf they will kindly take the Budget papers, they will find on page 1 an account of the total receipts from the past year and comparisons with what. we expect to gefc during the current year. In the receipts came to £12,105,878, was £535,774 over the amount I estimafcedThat, in itself, is a somewhat large excess upon the estimated but it does not represent more than 5 per cent, afc the outside. I shall point out shortly the special circumstances occasioned that somewhat large increase. Ifc was made by the receipt of £570,153 over my estimate from Customs, and a shortage of £39,750 in the Postal revenue. New South Wales we collected £4,391,000, which was £305,860 over my estimate, made up of £284,242 from Customs, and £19,298 from the Post-office. In Victoria we collected £3,126,892, which Sir George Turner. £198, 897 over my estimate, made up of £196,514 from Customs, and £1,601 from the Post-ofiice. In Queensland we collected £1,563,895, which was £33,115 over my estimate ; the Customs brought in £54,066 more than I expected ; bufc, unfortunately, the Postal receipts were below my estimate to the amount of £22,776. In South Australia, the total collections amounted to £946,936, which was about £2,953 under my estimates. The Customs realized £9,727 over the estimate, but the - Postal receipts showed a deoreaseof £12,720. In Western Australia, including the collections under the special Tariff, we received £1,621,811, which was £9,617. under my estimate; I the uniform Tariff yielded £ 1 3 0 over my estimate, but the Post - office yielded £18,801 below the estimate, while the special Tariff yielded £8,467 over the estimate. In Tasmania we collected £455,344, which is £10,471 over the amount I anticipated. The Customs yielded £17,007 over the estimate, but the Post office returned £6,352 under the estimate. Wifch regard to the Post-office we find that there has been a considerable falling off in the amount of the Estimates. Thafc, as I mentioned when T was delivering the Budget statement last year, has to some extent been accounted for by the reductions of rates made by Parliament in the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill. I am told by the Department that it is anticipated that the loss in consequence of the reductions made, will for fchis year amount to a sum of £65,000. In addition to that-mor e especially in the two States where the losses have particularly occurred, South Australia and Western Australia-the y are brought about by no action of ours in any 1902-3 way. They are brought about by the fact which that a contract was entered into by certain States with regard to the Pacific Cable, which has largely reduced the revenue estirevenue; mated to be received by South Australia and Western Australia--in South Australia to the extent of £12,000', and in Western which Australia, of £4,000. Other States made bargains with the Eastern Extension Company, - which resulted in a loss in terminal and other charges to the extent of £12,700. In So that, independently of whafc we might have done by general reductions, those two items alone would go a long way to account for the loss. I pointed out when I delivered the last Budget statement whafc I was thought would befcheloss occasioned by the fiction of Parliament in reducing the rates ; but still I hoped that the revenue would come into an extent almost sufficient to counteract those losses. My anticipations in regard to that matter have been fairly - well borne out. Honourable members will probably notice that the increases with regard to Customs collections appear very large indeed-£570,000 . That is accounted for principally by two items. For sugar we received £61,537 over the estimate-that is to say, more imported sugar was brought in than was anticipated; whilst from the grain duties, where I anticipated to receive £83,550, I actually received £519,086 over that estimate. Whether the action taken by Parliament in ' regard to that matter was '""ighfc, or whether it was wrong - I am not concerned with that at the present time-in consequence of the very large amount that was collected from the grain duties and from sugar, my estimate or the various States interested was under the mark. But leaving out those two items, the amounts estimated were very close to the amounts actually received. In New South Wales, we received £272,409 extra from grain duties, and the total increase above the estimate was £284,242. In Victoria, we received.£l 48,884 more from grain than was anticipated, and£75,000 from sugar, in consequence of the very large amount of imported sugar which came into this State. The two together make £223,884, the actual amount received above the estimate in Victoria being £196,514. In Queensland the increased receipts from the grain duties amounted to £68,530, and the total increase above the estimate was £54,066. Jn South Australia the grain duties realized £5,584, the total increase above the estimate being £9,727. In Western Australia we received £17,104 from grain duties, and my estimate was just realized. In Tasmania we received £6,575 from the grain duties, and the total increase was £17,007. The following tabulated statement may make the figures more easy of reference by honourable members :t .Receipts from New South Wales ... £272,400 . Victoria 148,884 Sugar 75,000 Queensland 68,530 South Australia 5,584 West Australia ]7,104 Tasmania ... 6,575 So that honourable members will see that, with regard to what has been alleged as to my desire to underestimate the amount which was to be derived from Customs revenue, so far as last year is concerned, that criticism has very little foundation in fact. With regard to the Customs, I have on every occasion endeavoured to get as near as I possibly could to the exact amount that we were likely to receive. I keep in the Treasury a record of the receipts for each item under the Tariff, and I have each month's takings at the end of the eleven months. I deduce from those results what I consider will be a fair estimate for the following year. At the same time, I have asked the collectors in the various States, from the information which they have, and from their special local knowledge, also to prepare estimates for my guidance. Having the two Estimates, I consider them r both. As a rule, the figures agree very closely, but in some cases we may not, perhaps, agree, and in those cases I send back the figures to the Collector for further consideration, and after receiving his explanations of local circumstances, I form my own' view as to the amount which will actually"" be received. My desire is not' to in any way underestimate the amount likely to be received, but to place before honourable members what I consider a fair and just, estimate of our total revenue. At the same time, we require to be very careful that we do not estimate to receive more than we really think we shall receive, because if we do so we shall be inviting the State Treasurers to believe that they will get back a certain surplus at the end of the year, whilst they - may not get back that amount. The blame will then be put upon the Federal Parliament or the Federal Treasurer of having misled the State Treasurers, and of having induced them to make provision for the expenditure of money which they will not have to expend. It is far better therefore that we should be £200,000 or £300,000 better off than we expected at the end of the year, than that we should be to a similar extent worse off. Grain Duties in Total Receipts in excess TJnder all the circumstances I always try excess of Estimate. of Estimate. tq keep as near as possible to what I believe £284,242 will be the actual figures, without exceeding in any way a fair estimate. If honourable members will look at the bottom of page 1 of the 223,884 196,514 54,066 Budget papers, they will find Estimates' for 9,727 this year. I am afraid that these, and some 130 other matters to which I shall have to refer, ... 17,007 will not be very pleasing information for some of the State Treasurers. Honourable members will see that the total estimatedrevenue from all sources for this year is set down - at £11,566,175, which is £539,703 (less than the actual amount collected during the year just passed. The decrease is anticipated principally from customs to the extent of £578,153, and I anticipate an increase from Post-office collections of £45,350. I calculate that the decrease in New South Wales will amount to£33S,704, - New South Estimate, 1902-3* 4,085,140 2,927,995 1,530,780 949,889 1,406,428 225,000 Act u a l , 1902-3 ... 4,391,000 3,126,892 1,563,895 946,936 1,388,344 233,467 Gain (- t - ) o r L o s s (- ) + 305,860 + 198,89 Estimate, 1903-4 ... 4,052,296 3,044,5 5 1,477,782 952,507 1,379,460 192,000' Gain (- t - ) o r L o s s (-) on 1902-3 - 338,704 - 82,297 - 86,113 + 5,571 - When honourable members come to study the papers in which these figures are sriven they will find the fullest information I can possibly give them on page IA .

On page 2 honourable members will find the record with regard to the' Post office.

So that the State Treasurers and those interested in the correctness of my figures will have an opportunity of ascertaining whether I have been working on right lines in dealing with the figures which I submit to honourable members. If honourable members will look at the bottom of page 4 they will find the summary, which works out as follows : - I expect to receive in New South Wales £3,125,000, a decrease of £353,742 on last year's estimate ; in Victoria, £2,400,000, a decrease of Total Net Bevenue - Estimate, 1902-3 3,194,500 2,302,500 1,207,000 Total Actual. 1902-3, compared with Estimate, 1902-3 Total Estimated Revenue,-1003-4, compared with Actual, 1902-3 . -353,742 -99,014 Again, we have to deal with the very large falling off which I anticipate in the Customs receipts ; and I desire to point out to honourable members the decreases in four leading items.

Then with regard to sugar, I expect, for reasons I shall give later on, to collect £40,000 less. As to grain and some other agricultural duties, I have allowed about £200,000, which shows a falling off of £450,000 as against the £99,014 ; and in Queensland, £1,175,000, a decrease of £86,066. In Western Australia. I anticipate to receive £1,150,000 from the uniform Tariff, a decrease of £12,530, and from the special Tariff £192,000, a decrease of £41,467 . In two States only do I anticipate an increase. I anticipate an increase of £5,273 in South Australia, making the total collections in that State £695,000, and in Tasmania I look for an incraese of £9,393, bringing the collections in that State up to £370,000. In all, I expect to receive from the uniform Tariff during the current year £ 8 , 9 1 5 , 0 0 0 ; and from the special Tariff in Western Australia £192,000, making a total of £9,107,000.

We have yet to collect these duties for some months, but there are already large stores of wheat and other grain in stock. I have had to rely on information received from Collectors with regard to this matter, because it is one on which I have no special knowledge ; bub the figures supplied to me show that the amount I have stated will be about the falling off as compared with last year. And then the reduction in the special Western Australian Tariff means a decrease to the extent of £40,000 ; the four items I have mentioned, therefore, account for the reduced receipts to the extent of £617,000, against the anticipated reduction of £578,000. Honourable members will see, with regard to the anticipation in connection with the Customs, that although there is this very large falling off, it is accounted for to a great extent by those few items, and there are other matters which we were forced to take into consideration when making up our minds as to the amount likely to be derived from the Customs during the year. We know full well that in all the States there is a cry for retrenchment in connection with State expenditure.",14
11,Mr HIGGINS,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,State expenditure 1,19
12,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"There is a cry also for retrenchment in connection with loan expenditure ; and I see by a statement made by the Treasurer of New South Wales that he hopes in the near future that no more .than £500,000 per annum will be expended out of loan moneys in that State.",19
13,Mr WATSON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Is it not £1,500,000?",19
14,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"The figures I saw were £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; but even an expenditure of £1,500,000 would be a large falling off from that to which New South Wales has been accustomed. I thought £500,000 was a very small sum, and probably £1,500,000 will be nearer the requirements of New South Wales during the year. Wit h a large falling off in State expenditure, there must necessarily be a smaller spending power on the part of the masses of the people, and therefore a less consumption of imported goods. In addition, it is clear from investigations I have made, that there has been in many lines an increased manufacture of goods in New South Wales. There has been a very large increase in the consumption of Australian goods by the States of New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania, and not quite so large an increase ip the consumption of other States. .But, although we may fairly anticipate a good season this year, I think that honourable members who have studied the question will agree with me that we are not justified in expecting to obtain any real benefits from it until towards the end of the financial year. That being so, I have felt compelled, not to swell my estimate of the revenue likely to be received, though I have exceeded the estimates sent to me from some of the States, and especially that sent to me by the Collector of Customs in New South Wales. That officer is an able man, but he takes a pessimistic view of the possibilities of Customs revenue in that State during the present year. I feel, however, that in the figures I have placed before honourable members, I have gone its far as I can in estimating the amount likely to be collected. Of course I hope that my estimate will be exceeded. I was glad for some reasons to see my estimate of revenue exceeded last year, because that enabled some of the States to have surpluses instead of heavy deficits, though I was sorry that the additional amount collected came chiefly from a particular line of duties, because that meanta very large loss to those connected with the farming and producing interests of the Commonwealth. In makinsr this estimate I have a very disturbing element to deal with in connection with the revenue to be collected by means of the sugar duties. Those duties bring us in an immense amount of revenue, but it is almost impossible to accurately determine how much imported sugar will be used next year. Last year most of the imported sugar came to Victoria, and threw me out in my estimate to the amount of nearly £100,000.",19
15,Mr REID,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,Was that sugar upon which a duty of £ 6 a ton had to be paid ?,19
16,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Yes , £ 6 per ton being .the duty upon imported sugar, while the excise duty upon Australian sugar is £ 3 per ton, and we have to pay a bonus upon all sugar produced by white labour. I anticipate that this year all the sugar produced in New South Wales will be grown by white labour, and will amount to about 20,000 tons, and that in Queensland 25,000 tons will be grown by white labour, and 65,000 tons by black labour, making the total production by white labour 45,000, and the total production 'by black*labour and by white labour 110,000 tons. As I estimate the consumption of the Commonwealth at about ISO,000 tons, probably 70,000 tons will be imported. Honourable members will be pleased to know that, as the result of the white Australia policy, whereas only 12,255 tons of sugar were produced in Queensland by white labour last year, I am advised that this year about 25,000 tons, or just twice as much, will be so produced. I expect to receive £330,000 from the excise duties upon sugar and £420,000 from the import duties, a total of £750,000. Last year my estimate of the revenue to be received frorn sugar was £735,500, and the actual collections amounted to £790,000. As I have mentioned, it is very hard to distribute that amount amongst the various States. I have, however, done it as best I ' could. I take it that a large proportion of the imported sugar will, undoubtedly, be used in Victoria, which will again receive the advantage to be derived from the heavier duty. Another point to be considered is that, whereas fast year we had to provide for sugar rebates to the extent of £60,000, we shall be called upon this year to provide an extra £30,000 for bonuses. I feel certain, however, that although honourable members might object to some items of expenditure, theywill not be prepared to raise any quibble against our providing the additional £30,000 necessary to assist in carrying out the policy approved by Parliament.",19

20,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN,"Yes . I suppose so. Honourable members will see from these figures that, although from the-producing point of view they have much to commend them, the State Treasurers may regard them from an entirely different aspect, because the more largely we consume Australian-made goods, the more rapidly will our revenue returns decrease.

Of course, last year, as I pointed out, was an exceptional year from a revenue-producing stand-point. Comparingthe year 1903-4 with that of 1900, I find that the amount per head is about the same in Yictoria, whilst in New South Wales there is, of course, a very large increase. In South Australia there is a small increase; in Queensland and .Tasmania there has been a large falling off-whic h is .accounted for by the unfortunate decline in their revenue; whilst in Western Australia the fall is becoming heavy. Doubtless this fall is accounted for by the fact that in the previous year Western Australia contained more male inhabitants than it does at the PERCKNTAOE oy CUSTOMS AND EXCISE - New South 1899-1900 17 44 1900-1 1901-2 ... 1902-3 27-54I omitted to refer to table D, upon page 9.

Receipt s (E s t i m at e ) , 1903-4 Population Upon page 10 I have endeavoured to give effect to a desire which I have often expressed in this Chamber regarding the amount that should be collected present time. Of course, that condition affects, to a considerable extent, the consuming power of a State, and reduces the amount of revenue colleoted per head. I have also endeavoured to obtain information regarding the proportion which the Customs and Excise revenue bears to the total revenue of each State. Unfortunately I have not been able to secure complete information in this connection, but I willtake care that it is supplied in the later Budget papers which will be issued. So far as I have the particulars, they are as follow :RBVENTTB INTHI TOTAL REVENUE or EACH STATE. Western Wales. Victoria.. Queensland. Sooth Australia. Western Tasmania. Australia. Total.

That, I take it, is accounted for by the larger manufacturing interests in those particular States. Of course, in Western Australia, which is a disturbing element in any attempt at calculation, the rate of imports greatly exceeds its percentage of population.

On page 15, I have set out a comparison of all sources of revenue going baek to the date of the establishment of the Commonwealth.

I hope that honourable members will recollect that error in making comparisons. I have dealt with the receipts for the past year, and the estimated receipts for the current year ; and I have endeavoured to explain how it was that the receipts were more than my estimate, and to give a satisfactory explanation of the reason why during the current year I expect that the receipts from various sources will fall off to the large extent I have mentioned. I now propose to deal with the question of expenditure. On page 16 honourable members will find a comparison on what we call a cash basis. I shall compare afterwards the cost of the departments during the year, which, of course, is different from the cash. The cash is the amount which we pay in connection with a department during the year, although it may include arrears for a previous year. The cost of a department, compiling these tables as a reliable source of information for him, remembering the great difficulty I have had in endeavouring to find out the expenditure or the receipts in various States to enable me to prepare certain statements with which I have to deal later on. A comparison near the top of the page shows the amounts collected from the Custom! as compared with those for the year 1900. I anticipate that New South Wales will be £1,339,219 to the good; Victoria, £ 5 7 , 5 1 5 ; South Australia, £55,996 ; and Western Australia £205,254; while Queensland and Tasmania will be to the bad £386,486 and ' £119,151 respectively. The total excess to be collected this year from Customs and Excise, comparing the revenue with the collections for 1900, is estimated at £1,152,347. The particulars are tabulated as follows :New South South Western Wales. Queensland.

' It is fair, I think, to compare the cost in one year with the cost in the previous year. If we compared simply the cash expended in one year with the ""cash expended in the previous year the latter would have borne far heavier arrears than a subsequent year would have done, and therefore the comparison would not be fair, and would be unduly in favour of a subsequent year. To put the matter on a fair and plain basis, I have mode my comparisons with regard to expenditure on a cost basis, and not on tbo actual cash expended during the year.

Honourable members will find the three years compared in these figures, so that they will see whether the different items affecting the Departments have been increasing or decreasing. But I will ask them in making these comparisons, and also in dealing with the question of estimated expenditure this year, not to overlook one fact. The .estimated expenditure will probably be somewhat larger than the actual expenditure during the year. That has to be taken into consideration, because we have to provide for items, the total amount of whioh may not be expended. Circumstances may occur under which no portion whatever of the amount voted will be expended. However, I can assure the Committee that in consideration of the large amount asked for, I requested the Ministers administering the different departments to go carefully through the Estimates and cut them down as much as they could. I took a hand afterwards at the same business. So that I do not think there is likely to be any large saving during the course of the year. of course, there will be some amounts in which we can save, and if they are really savings the result will be all the better for the States.

41,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"It cost nearly £40,000 to carry out one election in New South Wales under the electoral officer there.",29
42,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"I cannot, of course, point out all the increases in expenditure, but there is one item here to which perhaps I should draw them special attention. Honourable members will find that it is proposed, if Parliament agrees, to provide a sum of £ 2 0 0 for bust of our first Governor General. For the Department of External Affairs we asking £34,925 against an expenditure year of £33,041. In . t h is Department in many others a considerable portion the increase is accounted for by the fact we are now compelled to pay. for postage and telegrams. This counts as expenditure against the Commonwealth, but as honourable members are no doubt aware, it is only a bookkeeping entry, as the money is charged back directly to the States. That accounts ip this case for some portion of increased expenditure, and there are also few small increases to junior clerks in particular Department. The Attorneypended General asks for £9,915, as against an penditure of £2,497 on his Department last year. The increase of £7,418 is accounted for by the appointment of a Crown Solicitor at £2,300, which includes the salary of the Crown Solicitor and provision for his clerks, and the necessary books and requisites for his office. I am satisfied that the appointif ment was absolutely necessary, because the majority of the complaints of delay which were made against the Customs Department were really accounted for by the fact we had to send our work to the States Solicitors, and as those officers had own work to do, they could not do our work promptly as it would otherwisehave been It was absolutely necessary to take this step, and the appointment which has been made, will, I believe, pive general satisfacwhen, tion. In view of the High Court B i l coming law, £4,500 is provided for the expenditure in connection therewith; but theJudges' salaries will, of course, be provided double the by special appropriation.",29
43,Mr HIGGINS,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"The estimate"" is for the Si'r GEORGE TURNER - It is for a little more than the half-year. In the Department of Home Affairs, the expenditure increased from £28,851 to £37,114, an increase of about £8,263. That increase is accounted fdr by the fact that, in many of the branches of the Department, the officersat present employed were only engaged for a very small portion of last year. In fact,, some of the positions have not yet been filled, the Minister for Home Affairs holding back the appointments until he fmd& absolutely necessary. In this Department, again, the expenditure on postage and telegrams has to he considered; and, as a honourable members wil] see when they investigate the items, this means a considerare able amount. For the Treasury I am last asking for an increased expenditure of as £1,202-for £14,839, as against £13,637 of last year. In this Department the expenthat diture on postage and telegrams has itseffect also; and I have been forced, in order to get the work done within a reasonable time during the day; .to appoint three or four junior clerks, who arecommencing at £40 per annum, and will gradually work up to better positions. In the Customs the Department my late colleague managed to rea duce the expenditure, and the amount asked this for is £276,231 , as against £276,766 exlast year. But last year overtime exwas allowed in this Department, and that was paid for by the public, and credited and debited to revenue as occasion required. That practicehad not previously been adopted except, I believe, in one or two of the States,, and we do not propose to adopt it this year, but to pay the money into a trust fund, and there be any balance not required for the services of the officers, to then pay it into the general revenue. Otherwise our expenditure would be undulyinflated. I may that say with regard to the revenue generally Crown that, in many cases where I found that their States were in the habit of crediting as, receipts to votes instead, of to revenue, I done. have discontinued the practice, and that has made a considerable apparant increase in the expenditure of the Commonwealth, as a matter of fact, there has been l beno increase. Then coming to the Defence Department, at which honourable members. always like to have a worry, I find that, excluding new works and buildings, but taking into account the expenditure in the Department itself on rent, repairs, and various other items, an amount of £707,341 is asked for, as against £700,695 actually - expended last year.",29
44,Mr REID,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"Does that include the £200,000 under the proposed naval agreement ?",30
45,Sir GEOBGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"No ; only £106,000.",30
46,Mr REID,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"Then there will be another £100,000.",30
47,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"If my right honourable friend will allow me, I shall deal with all those matters later on. The amount I have mentioned includes £106,000 for the existing subsidy in connection with the Auxiliary Squadron ; so that, as against the actual expenditure of last year, we are asking for an increase of £6,646. Of course, it is hardly fair, for reasons which I propose to give very shortly, to base our calculations in regard to this particular Department, on the actual expenditure of last year. I intend to leave my colleague who is in charge of this Department to explain, either during the debate if the expenditure be challenged, or when his Estimates are under consideration, the manner in which he has made the reduction. But I wish, in passing, to point out that the Defence Department Estimate of last year was .£762,014, and the Committee then expressed a desire that this year the amount should not exceed £700,000. As a matter of fact, my right honourable colleague has reduced it to £677,000, though part of that reduction-a n item referring to new rifles, and amounting to £15,000-ha s been transferred to a special vote. The Government intend to ask for a - certain amount for armament and equipment, because it was the general opinion of the Committee that expenditure of that nature should not be included in the annual vote, but should be submitted as a special vote, so that Parliament might each year appropriate such a sum as it might deem reasonably necessary for the purpose. Part of the extra expenditure which the Department has had to meet this year has been for rents, repairs, and similar items, and amounts to something over £5,000. Generally throughout the Estimates we have had to provide more for repairs this year than was expended last year, though on the whole we do not provide more for such expenditure than was provided last year. Mr WATSON.'-The head-quarters expenditure is creeping up as usual.",30
48,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"The Minister for Defence will be able to give a' very reasonable explanation of that. There 'are transfers from other parts of the Estimates which make reductions which must be taken into consideration. Large savings were made last year because recruiting was to a great extent stopped owing to the want of re-organization of the forces. It is proposed this year to recruit up to nearly the full strength of each regiment, which, of course, will mean a heavier expenditure than last year, but considerable reductions have been marfe in the expenditure upon the permanent forces - In regard to the partially - paid forces, the Minister for Defence has determined to deal equally with the men in the various States. We found that although in some of the States men have been treated as partially paid, in other Statesthey have been classed as volunteers. It is thought wise, however, to place them all on the same footing,""and to give them uniform rates of pay. This has been done as far as possible, the old rates of pay being slightly reduced in some of the States and slightly increased in others. We found, however, that in Tasmania, because of the position of the State Treasury, and the heavy loss which that State has.been called upon to suffer, we should not be justified in creating partially-paid forces, because to do so would mean to the State an' extra expenditure of about £5,000. We hope that next year, however, we shall be able to do so, and we have no doubt that those who have for many years belonged to the volunteer forces of that State will not take umbrage because this year we cannot incur the extra expenditure necessaiy fco pay them. The Government considered the matter very carefully, and I asked the Minister for Defence, as a special favour to Tasmania, not to provide for partially-paid forces there. In many of the States we have to provide for an increased expenditure upon ammunition, but I do not propose to go further into details in connection with the expenditure of the Defence Department. Mr CONROY. ^- The right honourable gentleman does not appear to have placed that expenditure in the general vote, nor can T see the Thursday Island expenditure there.",30
49,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"If my honourable and learned friend will study the papers which I have laid upon the table in the light of the explanation I am giving, he - will find that I am placing before the Committee a correct synopsis of them. I am giving the Committee all the information in my power, whether it supports or tells against the Government proposals. I have not attempted to hold back anything. Honourable members who study the papers will be able to reconcile my statements with them, but if they cannot, and will drop me a line, I shall be only too glad to resolve any difficulties they may have in making comparisons, because, of course, they cannot be expected to pick out and compare items as easily as I or the officers of my Department could do. In connection with the post-office, I am asking for a considerably increased vote. The expenditure last year amounted to £2,406,193, and we are compelled after considerable cutting down of expenditure to ask for £2,525,758, or an increase of £119,565. Of this increased amount, £6,000 will have to be paid to officers whom it is proposed to retire on account of their exceeding the age of 65 years. Then we intend to spend £10,00 0 additional upon repairs to buildings and supervision of works. The Pacific cable will involve us in a loss of £30,000. This will be charged against the States that were interested in that particular bargain, and not against the Commonwealth as a whole. We have provided for an increased expenditure upon the Vancouver mail service, to the extent o\ £6,700, the Tasmanian cable will involve us in an extra expenditure of £2,250, and the Western Australian mail service will cost us £1,250. more than formerly. These items represent £56,000 out of £119,000. Then there are the increments. AVe find that the total amount of the increments will be about £50,000. I shall give the details in another table. JFortythree temporary employees have been made permanent, and this will cause an'addition to the salary vote of £6,000. This amount will to some extent relieve the temporary vote j and also the expenditure in connection . with new works and buildings. Therefore, as a matter of fact, it will not add to the total expenditure, although it will be an increase so far as the Post-office Department is concerned.",31
50,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,It is not new expenditure.,31
51,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"No ; we are not treating any such items as new expenditure just now. Two hundred and thirteen new appointments, distributed over the Commonwealth, have been asked for, and the salaries payable, in connection with these will amount to £15,000. . This, will bring up the total increase under the head of salaries to £71,000. During the year, however, we expect to save £25,000' by retirements and by filling up vacancies, by the appointment of officers paid at lowersalaries than those received by the former occupants of the positions. So - that the increments, the provision for the minimum, wage, and the new appointments will repreo sent a net increase of £46,000. Honourable members may contend that the expenditure in connection with the Post-office should not increase, but it must be remembered that we have largely reduced the telegraph chargesand that the change has involved a considerable increase of work, and the appointment of additional officers, whilst at. the same time we have lost revenueThen the ever-continuing extensions of the telephone and telegraph systems lead to increased charges for maintenance, and also for salaries, because we have to employ a certain number of additional officers to> attend to the larger volume of work. Them as the number of employees has to be i ncreased as the country is opened up, we have to provide for an addition to the salary list. Therefore, taking all the circumstances into consideration, although there is apparently a large increase in the expenditure of the department, it is one that can be fully justified. It certainly will not compare favourably with the increase in the revenue, but the expenditure has been occasioned by our own action in reducing the telegraph charges, for the benefit of those who use the telegraph service, and in increasing the minimum wage, so that justice might be done to a number of officers who have been in the service for a number of years, and who have attained their majority. I have informed honourable members that we expect an increased expenditure of £30,000 in connection with the sugar rebates.",31
52,Mr REID,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,Would that be under the new or the old system 1,31
53,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"The amountexpended would be the same under either system. The additional expenditure wil l be occasioned by the increased production of sugar grown, by white labour in - Queensland. The £32,000 provided in - the year 1902-3 for compensation in ebnriexion with the Defence Department will not be a recurring item. The total expenditure for which I am askdng is £4,320,000 as against £3,834,000 - foi last year, an increase of £4S5,000. But 1 honourable members must always bear in mind that we hope to save a certain proportion of that amount. I shall be glad if it is possible to effect a saving of £85,000, - but I am not - very sanguine that it is. Perhaps it may be as well' for me to point out how that total increase is made up. In this connection, I may mention that the - compensation payments have increased by £10,000 this year in consequence of ' the retirements which I have mentioned, and which have enabled us to make savings in other respects. For the supervision of public works in the various States we shall pay an additional £6,000. For repairs we are providing an extra £12,000, for mails and cables, an additional £40,000, for rebates upon sugar, £30,000 ; «.nd for postal and railway charges which we have now to pay, but which previously we had not, £16,000 ; making a total of Under Control of Department of Home AffairsTTrado and Customs Defence I'ost and Telegraph Offices .. lluildingr for Kiurineer Mechanic, Government 1-lousc Total Under Oontrol of PostniasterOeneral's DepartmentTelegraphs and Telephones Under Control of Department of the Treasury.Machinery and 1'laut for Printingoffice Under Oontrol of Department of DefenceArms, Equipment, &c.

Upon these we propose to expend £270,000 more than was expended last year. That will account for a total expenditure of £524,000, as against £485,000, the balance representing savings made in other directions.

As honourable members are aware, we deal with this particular item as a separate one, and not as a part of the ordinary annual charges of the year. Last year we provided for an expenditure in this connection of £365,000. The amount appropriated was something more than that, but it included expenditure incurred in the previous year. The sum appropriated was £365/185, but the total amount expended was only £153,698, thus leaving an unexpended balance of £211,4S7. That fact creates all the difficulty, because this year have to re-vote the amount which was unexpended last year. As honourable members are aware, our votes cease upon the 30th June, and if the total amount voted last year had been expended, the sum for which I am now asking would have been considerably reduced.",31
54,Mr CONROY,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,Does the Treasurer mean expended or paid ?,33
55,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"The sum expended is the. amount of cash that has actually been paid. This year I am asking for £422,000. Of that amount we are charging £407,000 as transferred expenditure. Of that amount, there is, in the Works Department alone, independent of telegraphs and telephones, an amount of £82,000 which is a re-vote for works, most of which are now in progress. Part payments have been made, but that sum is required to complete the undertakings in question. In addition, there is a sum of £15,000 which is required for the purchase of certain new machinery that has been obtained.for the Government Printing-office - machiner y which belongs to the Commonwealth Government, and which is branded to distinguish it from that which is the property of the State Government. In point of fact this particular sum is chiefly required for the purchase of linotypes and other machinery which is intended to expedite our printing. Since the establishment of the Federation we have done very well in the matter of Commonwealth printing. We have been getting our printing done in the various Government Printing-offices of the States at actual cost price. In Victoria we have had, free of charge, the use of the buildings and machinery of' the State Printing-office - But I have discovered that, when both the State and Federal Parliaments are in session it is too much to expect that the machinery in the Government Printing-office should be able to expeditiously carry out the printing required by both Legislatures. The type used in the Victorian State rolls is kept standing year after year, and in these circumstances I found that, as the Federal rolls had to be prepared, it would either benecessary to purchase type or new linotype machinery for that purpose. After giving the matter the most earnest and careful consideration, I determined that, as we should have, sooner or later, to purchase linotypes for this work, it would be, in the best inwe terests of the Commonwealth, to provide for their acquirement now, instead of purchasing a considerable quantity of. type, which would be locked up in connection with our rolls, and would not be available for other purposes. Another return, the details of which I shall give presently, relates to an expenditure of £75,000 on various items relating to what I may term defence armaments. I have taken up the position, that in view of the great falling off in the amount of revenue which the States Treasurers will receive, and the extra expenditure which will be incurred this year,, we should keep the vote for new works and buildings as low as we possibly can during the current year. Honourable members may find that no provision has been made for some of the works which they would like to have carried out in their various districts. When dealing with loan moneys Parliaments,, as a rule, are generous. But when we have to provide for new works and buildings out of revenue, as this House wisely determined we should do, a Treasurer is a little more careful in passing any item. If complaints are made as to the failure to make any provision for certain works I trust that honourable members will not blame theMinisters in charge of the Departmentsconcerned. As a matter of fact, my coh leagues have requested me to provide for them, and, therefore, honourable members must'blame the unfortunate Treasurer, whohas generally to stand the brunt of such attacks.",33
56,Mr HIGGINS,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"The Treasurer says that this House wisely determined that new works should be constructed out of revenue, although he brought in a Bill to provide for certain new works out of loan moneys. Sir GEORGE TURNER When I introduced that Bill I explained that ' I did soonly because the States themselves could not afford to provide out of revenue for works which might have been carried out by means of loan money. Personally, I was glad that this House declined to allow loan moneys to be voted for the purpose, and I said so at the time. That decision, however, has prevented' us from carrying out various works, and especially in Victoria. There, is for example, the undergrounding of the telephone system in Victoria, which I should ' like to see accomplished. But as the revenue stands at the present time we cannot provide for .these works out of revenue. As we have no power to borrow we must rest satisfied with what we have until times improve, and the States themselves can alford to allow the necessary expenditure to come out of revenue.",33
57,Mr RUID,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"The Government did what we told them to do, and the Treasurer says now that we were wise in making them do so.",34
58,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"That is often the case. I often agree that the Committee know a great deal more than I do, and I am very glad to accept the advice of honourable members in many directions, because I feel that their experience is probably greater than my own. I never hesitate to back down when I think I am wrong, or when I believe that the numbers are against me. Honourable members will see that the amount unexpended last year was exactly one-half of that for which I am asking that provision shall be made dur ing the current year. If that money had been expended last year, this year's expenditure would have been correspondingly reduced. Honourable members know the familiar illustration of an honourable member crossing the floor in a division and thus making a difference of two. In the same way, the non-expenditure of money set - apart for the construction of various works last year doubles the amount which I thought qf asking the Committee to provide this year. To a very large extent it accounts for what, to those who do not reason out the matter, would appear to be an unreasonably increased expenditure. So far as the details are concerned, I shall not ask honourable members at the present moment to look at the Estimates, but I shall give them a brief summary. We have provided for an expenditure of £5,000 in connection with the Customs Department, £2,300 being a re-vote; in defence, £29,539, of which £9,539 is a re-vote; and in post-office buildings, £102,932, of which £69,876 is a re-vote, to cover works which were provided for last year, and some of which are in course of construction.",34
59,Mr CONROY,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,Could it not be put to a trust fund 1,34
60,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"No , because the Constitution requires me at the end of each month to hand back to the States the' money which has not been expended. I sometimes wish that I could form a trust fund, although, perhaps, the money might be put to a wrong use. When we come to deal with the "" other expenditure,""' I shall point out how our inability to form a trust fund does increase the expenditure for this year. Por telegraphs and telephones we have provided £194,812. It is practically the same amount as we provided last year; but we spent only £ 102,948. The expenditure on works during the last two years and the current year will be very little more than the amount expended on works in the same Departments by the States in one year. I shall give the figures presently. I have mentioned that £75,000 has been provided on the Estimates for armament for the defence forces. Of that sum, £30,000 is required to provide for rifles and an ammunition reserve. The full amount of ammunition required for the year is provided on the Estimates, and this expenditure on a reserve will be necessary, as we have a larger number of rifles.",34
61,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,Ridiculousl y inadequate !,34
62,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"We have a reserve which is sufficient for our existing rifles, but as we get new rifles we must necessarily increase that reserve. Honourable members will also be asked to vote £22,000 for equipments of various kinds ; £5,000 for purchasing and mounting a gun at Fremantle; £13,000 for a reserve of ammunition for our fixed defences-that I understand is required to supplant black powder with smokeless powder-and £5,000 towards re-arming the Cerberus, which will cost £20,000.. These sums amount to only £75,000.",34
63,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"It is not enough. If they would cut off a few of the frills and spend"" more there it would be better.",34
64,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"The amount asked for by the General Officer Commanding to place the defence forces in a thoroughly equipped condition is £4S0,000, I and he proposes that a sum of £125,000 should be voted each year. I have not seen my way to go the full length of his proposal this year, because we must have some thought for the unfortunate position in which States Treasurers are placed.",34
65,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,Cu t out some of the other items from the military vote.,35
66,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS COMPARED,"If my honourable friend can show some means of doing that, he will find a very strong supporter in myself. I have always felt that the large amount set.down for the Defence Department is unnecessary; but others hold that the forces have to be maintained in a certain way, and the experts say that a certain number of officers must be employed for the purpose. We have to be guided by our expert adviser; but if that expert advice can be shown to be wrong, and that money can be saved in that direction, well and good. However, if we employ an expert at a large salary we must .be guided, to a considerable extent, by his advice.",35

69,Mr HIGGINS,PUKCENTAGE OK EACH STATE IN TOTAL RECEIPTS,"Does the Treasurer propose to charge the £200,000, which is to be paid annually under the naval agreement, to "" transferred "" expenditure 1 Sir GEORGE TURN ER - That is to be charged-as the sum of £106,000 is now charged-as transferred expenditure. But under the new agreement, as under the old, the amount is to be distributed on a population basis. Now come to deal with the interesting subject of ""other"" expenditure. I have been compelled this year-bu t the Treasurer will not have to do so next year - to set out that expenditure in two forms. The first, given on pages 36 and 37, shows the actual cash expenditure in each year, irrespective of when the liability was incurred. That raises the old question of the arrears being heavier in cne year than they were in another, and causes that table to be of little use for purposes of a fair comparison in endeavouring to ascertain what is the cost THE ""OTHER"" EXCENDITURE HAS New South Wales 74,805 Victoria (IS,718 Queensland 27.4S2 South Australia 19,837 Western Australia 10,597 Tasmania 9,475 I have also had the following table prethe convenience of honourable members :NA BASIS.

I find that the total "" other"" expenditure in 1901-2 came to £275,862. In the following year it amounted to £316,217, and honourable members will possibly be astonished to see that this year I am asking for £434,946. I hear a whisper-and probably there will be a louder whisper outside-that this is far above the estimate of £300,000 which was formed at the Convention as to the cost of federation. But I hope to be able to give a satisfactory explanation. These payments include the non-recurring items in connection with New Guinea, the ""celebrations,"" the sugar rebates, and all fresh expenditure, whether caused by federation or not. If honourable members will look at pages 38 and 39, they will get what I call the true comparison with regard to our- "" other "" expenditure, and the true cost of federation so finds "" other "" expenditure is concerned.

For 1903-4 the expenditure is estimated at £324,946, or Is. 7 f d per head. This does not include an item of £20,000 for New Guinea, as that amount, or £15,000 of it at all events, was being paid by the States, and would probably have been continued by the States for the purposes of carrying on New Guinea. It does not include the item for sugar rebates, which amounts this year as I have mentioned to £90,000, and it does not include special non-recurring expenditure, amounting in 1901-2 to £33,000, and in 1902-3 to some £8,000. I have already, in dealing with the cost of the Depcirtments, explained the various items of new expenditure, pointing out that we have to bear close on £80,000 this year for electoral expenditure. Surely no fair critic of our expenditure would say that the whole of that amount should be charged to one year? It relates to three years,' and some of it relates to more than three years. I have included the whole of that sum in the £325,000, but, considering the matter in all fairness, I say that we are entitled to divide that amount between three years. If we do that we shall find that the new expenditure of this year, the real cost of Federation, independently of the sugar rebates, which are not a fair charge against us in calculating that expenditure, amounts to the sum of £275,000.",36

But there are certain provisions in regard to the number of senators and representatives which prevent my giving that assurance, although I believe the intention was as I have stated. I have given the full figures; but I say that those who criticise the new expenditure and compare it with the rough estimate of £300,000, have no right to take New Guinea, the sugar rebates, or the celebrations at the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament into consideration. Unless we make it perfectly clear here that those amounts are not to be included, our critics and the reformers outside will tell the public that we have increased the estimated expenditure to over £400,000. I must place the information in the form in which I have presented it, because I wish tliose wlio criticise us to be absolutely fair.

The cost of federation was then estimated by some at £300,000, by others at .t'500,000, and by others again at £700,000. I do not think the people were led into federation by any estimate that the cost would amount to the first mentioned sum, nor do I think that estimate affected the decision one iota. The people were determined to have federation; and I know that when I pointed out that they would have to pay for it , I was told that I was not a true federalist, and that the ""young pitriots,"" as they were then called, were going to oust me from the office which I then held.",38

89,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"I was very much taken to task for that speech afterwards. It is interesting to have, as far as we possibly can, some comparison with regard to the revenue and expenditure in the Postal Department. Until all the buildings are transferred, and we are able to charge interest, it is impossible to prepare what we could regard as a commercial balance-sheet. In connection with the transferred buildings we are waiting for the States to send in particulars of the various claims they have to make against us; and the,n we shall have to give compensation. The fact has to be borne in mind that if we do have to com-pensate the States, and interest is a part of that compensation, that interest will be a charge which will lessen the amount of the surplus I shall mention presently as being distributable amongst the States.",38
90,Mr MCCAY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Has it been decided to compensate the States in cash 1,38
91,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"No . So far as I am concerned, there will be no cash compensation. But if the compensation takes the form, as it probably will, of our assuming a certain portion of the States debts, then we shall have to provide inte rest, though, on the other hand, the States - will have to pay for the use of their buildings. I do not want to enter into a discussion of that question, beyond saying that I believe my own system of dealing with the balances only was the best after all, although the States did not see its advantages.

Queensland was to the bad to the amount of £107,837, Western Australia to the amount bf £33,118, and Tasmania to the amount of £15,713, the total receipts under expenditure being £94,933. It is only fair to say, however, that that amount includes £37,149 for new works and buildings which, when the departments were under the control of the States, would have been paid for out of loan money, and not charged as Post office expenditure. Coming to the year which ended on the 30th June, 1903, we find that in New South Wales the receipts exceeded the expenditure by £14,289, in Victoria by £24,065, and in South Australia by £178. Sir George Turner.",38
92,Mr MCCAY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,But the Treasurer has not absolutely abandoned that idea?,39

94,Mr MCCAY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,How does the right honourable gentleman account for the falling ofi? with regard to South Australia?,39
95,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"Because of the reduction in charges, especially in regard to the Eastern Extension Company's business, and latterly because of the Pacific cable. In Queensland the expenditure exceeded the receipts by £137,230, in Western Australia by £55,362, and in Tasmania by £10,307, a deficit or falling off amounting altogether to £164,367, although £141,535 of that amount was expended upon new works and buildings which, under the old system, would have been paid for out of loan money, so that the real falling off was only £22,832. This year we shall feel still more the effect of the extra expenditure that has to be incurred and the losses in connection with the Pacific and Eastern Extension Company's cables, and I estimate that in all the States the expenditure will exceed the receipts by the following amounts :-Ne w South Wales, £61,709; Victoria, £ 7 , 6 1 5 ; Queensland, £159,993; South Australia, £21,577 ; Western Australia, £100,842 ; Tasmania, £ 2 1 , 7 6 6; a total of £373,502, of - which £297,744 is for new works and buildings. As those works aiid buildings are to be paid for out of revenue, we must charge them against the expenditure of the Department, but it must be remembered, when our expenditure is submitted to criticism or comparison, that we are paying out of revenue large amounts which formerly would have been paid out - of loan money.",39
96,Mr WATSON,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Is there any allowance for interest on loans for buildings?,40
97,Sir GEOEGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"No . Until we settle upon the value of the transferred 'buildings, it will not be possible to formulate what might be called a balance-sheet. In the meantime I am giving the best information obtainable in regard to the working of the Post-office. In the year 1902-3 we actu al ly expen d ed £2,569,017, an in - of £101,213 on the previous year, but that increase is more than accounted for by the - expenditure of £104,386 upon new buildings. This year we ask for a vote of £2,823,502, or £254,485 more than the - actual expenditure oflast year, but £156,209 is for works and buildings. I have also included in the cost of the Department the cost of the central, staflj though, perhaps, I am not in strictness bound to do «o. That amount is debited to the various States. We hope that there may be some saving upon the Estimates, but as after the Minister had dealt with them. I reduced them by nearly £50,000. I think that they have been pared down to the bone, and that there is not much chance of any saving being made. I feel, however, that the Postmaster-General, and those responsible for the expenditure of the Department - generally, must consider, at the earliest opportunity, whetheran effort cannot be made to reduce the expenditure of Queensland more nearly to theamountof revenuecollec ted there. I know that that State has had - bad times, and I realise the difference between such a vast and scantily-populated territory and a small and closely-populated State such as Victoria. The vastness of Queensland necessarily means a heavy expenditure in providing and working post-offices, telephones, and telegraphs, and requires the provision of allowances and other expenditure which' is not required here, but I still think that the Queensland expenditure is too large,"" and I intend to ask the Postmaster-General to see if it is not possible to more thoroughly investigate all its details, so as to bring it nearer to the receipts of the State.",40
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Is a very large amount provided for new works next year t,40
99,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"No , the expenditure is not very heavy. My honourable friend will find the details in the Estimates for new works and buildings. In tliose States where times have been hard we have tried to keep down the expenditure on public works as much as possible.",40
100,Mr HUME COOK,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Why is the Treasurer charging the cost of new works to the transferred expenditure of the Commonwealth ?,40
101,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"When I brought in my first financial statement, I crease placed a certain sum on the Estimates for the expenditure upon new works which, I thought, could be constructed out of revenue, and I provided for a larger expenditure out of loan inoney, but as honourable members determined that no loan should be raised, the whole amount had to be paid out of revenue. My honourable friend is again anticipating a statement. I was going to make. The reason for the arrangement is this: We cannot fairly expend a large amount ofmoney on new works and buildings in one State, and a smaller amount in other States, ancl yet make them all contribute upon a population basis. That might be done if the States had a common purse, but the figures which I will give later will satisfy my honourable friend that it would be absolutely unjust to pay for works on that basis now. The States which could least afford expenditure upon new buildings, and the extension of telephone and telegraph lines, would have to pay for such works in States which could, well afford to pay for them, and would derive the benefit from them, as the revenue obtained from such expenditure would be credited to the States in which it was collected. Therefore it is only fair to charge the expenditure as transferred expenditure, upon the understanding, as I informed the Committee twelve months ago, that when we come to arrange with the States with regard to compensation for works and buildings, new works and buildings will be treated in exactly the same_ way as old works and buildings. In the meantime we are not using the revenue of the States which are nob well off to pay for works and buildings erected for the benefit of States which are better off. I shall give my honourable friend the figures later on, which show the effect on each particular State of the system I have adopted.",40
102,Mr HIGGINS,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,The cost of new buildings will be charged against the State which enjoys them ?,41
103,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"Yes , for the time being : but when we come to take the new buildings, we shall have to adjust matters with the States upon a population basis. Some States will hand over buildto ings far in excess of their proportion, whilst others will give us less proportion upon a population basis, and there will have to be an adjustment. whatever happens, I hold the very strong view that wherever the State derives an advantage from the use of Post-ofiice buildtion ings and telegraph lines, it will have to be charged something for the use of those particular buildings and works. The next of the Budget papers, pages 41 and 42, contain information taken from the front pages of the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, and were inserted for the purpose of completing the informanever tion for those who have not a copy of Estimates. In dealing with the information contained on page 43, which relates to ments to State and Commonwealth DepartWe ments for services, I desire to point out a considerable amount of our expenditure really made up of mere bookkeeping entries so far as the States are concerned. This stiitement shows the amount we have had to provide for railway and similar services, and for postage, telegraph, and telephone charges. Honourable members will be prised to see that the total amounts to been £345,858. That is ,an expenditure for which we have to provide on our Estimates but, as a matter of fact, it is a mere bookI keeping entry, because the whole of the money goes back to the States. On page 44 will be found a statement of the receipts expenditure of the Trust fund, now amountthe ing to £207,406. I propose to consider whether I cannot invest a certain portion of that money in some State Government securities, with a view to deriving interest from it. A very small amount, I think about £8,000, is on fixed deposit; but I consider, after looking carefullj' into the matter, that it will be possible to derive a certain amount of interest by investing the greater part of the fund, and keeping at current account only sufficient to meet our every day requirements. Upon page 45 will be found a statement showing the amount of surplus or deficit in connection with the finances of each State for the past year. Two States had a surplus-Victori a £153,199-occa sioned wholly and solely by the extra amount we were able to give back to her, and Western Australia £108,466. Three over States had deficits-Ne w South Wales, £247,575'; Queensland, £ 1 9 1 , 3 4 1 ; and Tasmania, £116,022. I have not been able obtain complete information with regard to Soutli Australia, but I believe that they than their have a small surplus. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Were those figures But supplied by the States Treasurers ?",41
104,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"Yes ; but I have also worked them out from the informawhichlhave been able to obtain, and from the returns available. They do not includeany accrued deficits, but are, so far as I can give them, the figures properly relating to the last financial year. When I was Treasurer of Victoria, I always made it a rule to deal with the deficit or the surplus for the year, as the case might be, and to bring forward a surplus or a deficit the from the previous twelve months, and I have followed that rule in the present case, payso far as my information would permit. have often heard of the ""Braddon that clause,"" the section of the Constitution is which provides that we must not use for Commonwealth purposes more than one-fourth of the total Customs and Excise revenue. Fortunately, except in the case of Queensland, we have been able up to the present to return to the States a sum far surand away beyond that which would have available to them if we had taken full advantage of our right to spend one-fourth' ; of the total Customs and Excise revenue. shall not trouble honourable members with the details, but simply state that during the three years since Federation was established, and we gave back to the States, as is shown in last column of the table, £888,741 in 1901-2, £1,144,469 in 1902-3, and it is estimated that £622,634 will be returned in 1903-4 more than we were legally bound to return. The figures are tabulated in the - following statement:Kew South Wales 319,771 491,599 280,138 Victoria 185,195 282,391 191,021 Queensland Dr 20,188 14,787 Dr South Australia ... 115,742 81,615 37,827 Western Australia 244,232 235,590 147,034 1903-4:Tasmania 43,989 38,587 15,253 T.n consequence of this, New South Wales has received £1,091,508 ; Victoria, £65S,607; South Australia, £ 2 3 5 , 0 8 4 ; Western Australia, £627,456, of which £157,000 would come from one-fourth of the special Tariff; and Tasmania, £97,S29. Unfortunately, we had to encroach upon Queensland's three-fourths during the first year to the extent of £20,188, and this year we expect to have to clo so to the extent of £49,239. Last year we gave back a sum of only £14,787 in excess of the three-fourths to which Queensland would be entitled. This is what has induced me to look more closely into the expenditure in connection with that State, in order to ascertain whether ib would not be possible bo place her in a better position, and make her finances compare a little more favourably with those States which are more fortunately sibuated. On the whole it - is evident that we have not gone to the full length that we might have proceeded in connection with Commonwealth expenditure. The papers from page 48 onwards show the actual figures for each particular State, and the mode we have adopted in making the calculations and arriving at the figures which I have given. Now I have to deal with the figures given on page 54, which those who take an interest in our finances here or elsewhere will find to be very interesting. A comparison is made of receipts, payments, and the surplus returned to the States during the three years. In 1903-4 we estimate to give to the States £7,251;464, as compared with £8,200,457 last year. Therefore, there will be an immense falling off; so far as the estimates of the States Treasurers are concerned, and that is why I stated that the information I had would not be very pleasant reading for them when they came to study it from the States poiut of view. Last year was what we may regard as a boom year, owing to the fact that we received £535,000 more than we expected, and that we refrained from expending £350,000, which was provided for on the Estimates. That accounts for a differ1.001-2. 1902-3. 1903-4. ence of £885,000 ; and this year we shall £ £ £ give back bo the Sbates £948,993 less than last year.

105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,That will be a very serious matter for the States.,42
106,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"Yes ; but last year the States had all the benefit of the increase in the revenue. I am afraid, from what I have heard, that they are calculating upon receiving this year as much as last year.",42
107,Mr REID,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Do they want another drought next year t,42
108,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,I hope not.,42
109,Mr REID,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Then how can they expect to receive as much revenue?,42
110,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"They cannot possibly expect so much. They musb know that it was owing to the drought that we had a very large amount of extra revenue last year, although it may be fairly said that if we had had no drought there would certainly have been an increase in other directions. No doubt there would have been some increases, but the fact remains that, owing to the failure of our harvesb last year, we received a large amount of revenue which would not otherwise have been collected. Mr G. B. EDWAKDS - But it decreased the' purchasing power of the people.",42
111,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"To some extent it did, but to nothing like that extent. Mr G. H . REID - To nothing like the increased amount of Customs revenue.",42
112,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"But even admitting that we shall hand back to the States £949,000 less than we returned to the in last year, we shall still be keeping within our margin by the amount of £622,000 which I have mentioned. In addition to the sums that I have charged in the Estimates against the States, there are others which may still further reduce the amounts to be returned to them. For example, the Naval Agreement Bill involves the payment of an additional £94,000. That will have to be paid this year, and will constitute a transferred expenditure, which will be payable upon a population basis.",42
113,Mr FISHER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"That is, if the Bill passes ?",43
114,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"Of course I am assuming that the Bill passes. I have not included that amount in my figures, because I can only base my calculations upon what I know to be the law of the land.",43
115,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,That additional subsidy does not require to be paid until six months after the Bill is passed.',43
116,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"If I recollect the terms of the agreement aright, we have to pay a year in advance. Assuming that the Bill is passed before the prorogation of Parliament, the amount in question will be payable during the current nnancial year. Then there is a sum of £15,000 or £20,000 in connection with other Bills which have not yet been dealt with, and these two amounts, if provided, will further reduce the surplus that we shall have to distribute amongst the States.",43
117,Mr MCCAY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Has the right honourable gentleman included the expenditure consequent upon the establishment of the High Court ?,43
118,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"I have included it in the Estimates for the Attorney General's Department. These two sums, however, will appear as special appropriations in connection with Bills which have yet to be passed. Then, Tasmania may receive the benefit this year of £11,000, which, it is said, was collected and wrongly credited to Victoria and some of the other States. In Queensland, there is a sum of about £26,000 deposited on sugar, and in Victoria a sum of £20,000 similarly deposited, and these may affect to a small extent the amounts I have mentioned. When the Naval Agreement Bill comes into operation some of the States will have to pay up their arrears in connection with the present agreement. So far only two of the States have carried out their obligations under that agreement. By some means or other the others have dropped intoarrears for a year. Accidentally, I will assume, they have forgotten that the payment was due, and have allowed their contribution to fall into the next year's expenditure. Thus the sum of £37,000 will need to be provided by New South Wales, £9,000 by South Australia, £5,000 by Western Australia,, and £4,000 by Tasmania. Mr G. H. REID - Surely New South Wales did not drop behind 1",43
119,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"I do not say that New South AVales dropped behind last year, but at some time, probably far back, New South Wales got into arrears in her payments by one year. The Imperial authorities have not pressed us for those payments, and I have not felt justified in including them in these Estimates. Upon page 55, and the following pages of the Budget papers, honourable members will find what I call our ""account current"" with the different States, which shows our transactions with the States during the past three years. It sets, out the amounts that we have collected from the various Departments, the sum expended in connection with them, and therevenue which the Commonwealth has returned to the States. These figures, which, of course, represent a cash basis, will form still interesting reading to honourable members who desire to investigate the position of their individual States, whilst they will also furnish information to the States. Treasurers who necessarily have to rely upon the Federal Treasurer for an explanation of their positions. At the Convention, it will beremembered, many of us held that the Commonwealth should have only one pocket and one purse, that all receipts should go intothe one pocket, and all expenditure should be paid out of the one purse, as by that, means we should avoid bringing into existence the hateful bookkeeping system. Within the next three years the Commonwealth Parliament will have to determine the very important question of whether we shall continue the bookkeeping system with all the trouble which it involves in returning to the States the actual amounts collected within their borders, after debiting them with their own expenditure, orwhether we shall adopt the true Federal spirit by declaring that we shall have only one pocket into which all our revenue shall go, and one purse out of which all our expenditure shall be paid. Undoubtedly, the adoption of the latter' systeni would simplify the transactions of the Treasury, and shorten to an enormous extent the Budget statement. It is well, therefore, to show the Parliament of that day the effect which such a system would have had upon the States had it been in operation during the years that have passed. I .will not include the first year of the Federation, because it affords us no guide whatever. If , however, honourable members will look at the year 1902-3, they will see that if we had distributed the surplus revenue collected by the Commonwealth upon a population basis, and had included Western Australia, New South Wales would have lost £172,000, and Western Australia £580,000, whilst Victoria would have gained £373,000, Queensland £143,000, South Australia' £173,000, and Tasmania £62,000. This year New South Wales would lose £751, and-Western Australia £511,000, whilst Victoria would gain £223,000, Queensland £132,000, South Australia £118,000, and Tasmania £39,000. The exact figures are as follow :SURPLUS ON POPULATION BASIS, INCLUDING WESTERN AUSTRALIA. N.S.W. .. -171,696 Victoria ... +373,089 +222,735 Queensland +142,974 +131,802 S. Aust. ... +173,306 +118,314 Social Tariffl -579,834 -511,415 uot included J w Tasmania... + 62,161 + 39,315 Looking at these figures, it will be seen that when the time comes for us to consider this question, we shall not be able to deal with Western Australia in the same way that we can deal with the other States. As in the past we have made a special exemption in favour of Western Australia, so if we are to deal justly with its people we shall require to make a still further bargain with them. Of course, I hold that as the years go by the revenue collected in that State will decline considerably both in amount and in its average per head of the population. That will be occasioned by the rising generation, by the greater volume of trade with the Eastern States, and by increased production within its own borders. Upon page 63 of the Budget papers I desire to present to honourable members another view of this matter. Leaving Western Australia out of consideration, they will see how much closer we should approach to the percentage distribution, although even here the senior State, New South Wales, would be the one which would have to make the sacrifice. But, having regard to the wealth and resources of New South Wales-and probably the desire she would show to assist her less fortunate sisters-havin g regard to the much larger production and increased trade with the other States that she will probably have in the course of three or four years' time, as well as the reduced amounts which will be collected, and remembering the ever-increasing expenditure which must necessarily continue in New South Wales, with its large area,as compared with the smaller States,' I believe that at the end of the five years' j/eriod the results will show that, in connection with these matters, we approximate very closely to a population basis of distribution: Up to the present, however, the result of the distribution of the surplus on a population basis would have been that, for the year 1902-3, New South Wales would have borne the whole burden. We were aware of that fact at the time of the Convention,, and, therefore, we did not attempt to make any provision in the Convention to force the population basis of distribu1902-3. 1903-4. tion upon the States at the outset of £ £ the Commonwealth. What many of us did -751 urge, however, was that there should be a sliding scale of reduction, and that at the end of five years a pro rata distribution should come into force. If the distribution ' ' had been made on a basis of population, during 1902-3 New South Wales would have borne the burden of expenditure to the extent of £393,727, which would have been distributed as follows :-Victori a would have benefited to the extent of £182,087 j Queensland, £ 6 2 , 2 0 0; South Australia, £115,342 ; and Tasmania, £34,0.9S. This year there would have been a very marked difference if the surplus had been distributed on the basis of population. The amount to be returned to New South Wales would have been reduced by nearly £200,000, or, to speak exactly, to £ l 9 S , 3 1 4 .",43
120,Mr CONROY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,That is the estimate f,44
121,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"That is the estimate, and it will prove to be not very far from the actual figures. The otherStates would have benefited as follows :Victoria, £ 5 5 , 7 1 9 ; Queensland, £60,744 ; South Australia, £67,486 : and Tasmania, £14,365. The following table comparesthe figures for this year with those for the year 1902-3.

122,Mr GLYNN,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Wester n Australia would not lose much on the basis of the male population.,45
123,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"I d o not know so much about that. The honourable and learned member must not forget that the present state of affairs will very rapidly be changed. A large number of women and children are going to Western Australia with a view of permanently settling there ; and the rising generation must also be taken into consideration. The honourable member for Bourke induced me to make a statement, rather in advance of the point at which I intended to place it before the Committee, in regard to the relative effect of charging new works and buildings on the basis of the expenditure in the different States and on the basis of population. If honourable members will turn to page 64 of the Budget papers, they will find ful l information supplied to them in regard to that matter. The following table presents the figures in tabulated form :NEW WORKS AND BUILDINGS. Now CfiAKGED ox BASIS OF EXPEXDITDHE. If on population basisNew South Wales .. -5,08 1 .. -3,07 1 Victoria ... ... + 18,703 ... + 42,643 Queensland .. -12,58 9 ... South Australia .. -2,88 0 .. -2,41 AVestern Austraha .. -3,38 6 .. -41,79 Tasmania + 5,233 ... + More than present amount. ' - Less than present amount. They show that in 1902-3 Victoria would have provided, on the basis of population, £18,703, and Tasmania £5,233 more than - the amount expended in the respective States. In other words, if they had been charged on a population basis, those States would have been called upon to 1902-8. 1903-4. provide the amounts I have named in £ £ excess of the expenditure which actually took place within their boundaries. The excess would have gone to, and have been expended by the other States as follows :-New South Wales, £ 5 , 0 8 1 ; Queensland, £12,589 ; South Australia, £ 2 , 8 8 0 ; and Western Australia, £3,386/ The estimate for this year shows that, on a population basis, Victoria would have been debited with a sum exceeding the amount actually expended within her boundaries by £ 4 2 , 6 4 3; and Tasmania, £ 4 , 6 1 8 ; but Queensland would have remained in practically the positionthat she now occupies.",45
124,Mr TUDOR,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Does the right honourable gentleman mean to say that works and buildings representing the excess amount named would have been carried out in Victoria?,45
125,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"No ; assuming that the same works and buildings had been carried out, Victoria would have paid, on a population basis, the sum I have named in excess of what she is actually called upon to pay'for works within her own boundaries; while New South Wales would have benefited to the extent of £3,071, Soutli Australia to the extent of £2,417, and AVestern Australia to the extent of £41,797. Thus honourable members will see that unless we were to adopt the plan of taking one State as a basis-and we should have to take the State which had the smallest spending power-and calculating the expenditure for all the other States upon that basis, any charging of the expenditure for new works and buildings upon a population basis would be unfair and unjust to the States. If we adopted that course, and simply said that we were going to take as a basis the State receiving the least revenue, the otlier States such as New 1902-3. 1903-4. South Wales and Queensland, and especially * £ Western Australia, which require to be developed, would not be able to have that + 24 amount expended within .tneir boundaries, 7 which we might otherwise fairly expend, 7 provided that, for the time being, we + 4,618 deducted it from the revenue received by them.",45
126,Mr WILKS,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Ne w South Wales so far carries the burden.,45
127,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,I am sorry that the honourable member has made that remark. He surety could not have followed my statement.,45
128,Mr WILKS,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,I have done so.,46
129,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"Ne w South Wales does not now bear-and has not at any time during Eederation borne-on e shilling on account of any other State. She has had her revenue collected for her and returned to her. I am sorry that my honourable friend should have made such an interjection, because it will be taken up by those who desire a handle for the assertion that New South Wales is carrying the burdens of all the other States. As a matter of fact, she is carrying none but her own burdens, and will not be required to do so during the bookkeeping period.",46
130,Mr CONROY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"But she has to collect £1,500,000 more than was necessaiy.",46
131,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Sh e gets-it; and evidently she wanted it . I am not going to be led into any discussion of the - fiscal question. We have settled that matter.,46
132,Mr CONROY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,Hav e we ? The Treasurer should wait until the elections are over.,46
133,Sir GEORGE TURNER,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"We have settled the question for the time being, and at the general elections we hope to settle those who desire to reopen it . The finances of New Guinea have now a greater interest for us than ever they possessed before, and I have obtained the best information available in regard to the position of the Possession. We ascertained some time ago that it was drifting to the bad, and that the estimated collections would be less than the anticipated expenditure. We are told, as a matter of fact, that the expenditure would be far larger than the amount for which provision was made. The Minister for External Affairs, however, brought the matter very forcibly before those charged with the control of New Guinea, and the result is that on a re-estimate for the year 1902-3, they hope to have a surplus of £270, while they expect to get through the current year with a surplus of £ 1 0 1 . They were told distinctly that the Commonwealth provided a subsidy of £20,000 for New Guinea, that that amount could not be increased, and that .it was necessary that they should keep their expenditure within that sum and the revenue derived by ineans of their own collections.",46
134,Mr CONROY,AND EXPENDITURE AS COMPARED WITH POPULATION,"Do away with that expensive steamer if they cannot keep within bounds! Sir GEORGE TURNER I have asked them many a time to do so, but there seems to be an understanding with the British Government that the steamer is to be kept running, although, unfortunately, they have ceased tlieir contribution of £3,500 a year, which, if continued, would have made a great difference'to the Possession. In many of the States we have been accused of gross extravagance in connection with our new expenditure, and I have endeavoured to show that that was without any justification. I believe that everything possible has been done to keep the new expenditure within reasonable limits. As regards the transferred Departments, it is said in some States that there is extravagance. I have been trying for a very long time to get a fair comparison between the year in which we took over the Departments and the last year in which they practically had. control of the expenditure for nearly the whole year. For the few months of the year in which we took control, we had to continue expending on the basis of their own estimates. Honourable members will hardly realise the great difficulties I found in ascertaining what the real expenditure for a Department was. I could find out easily enough the real expenditure in a Department, but as I pointed out earlier, when justifying the preparation of certain tables as to the cost of the different Departments, it was the difficulty of getting the information which forced me into framing those tables. comparison. tions, traced than which Mr. Sir for expenditure learned their is make NA from because Western to Departments.

135,Mr FOWLER,GEORGE,The complaint is that the Government are not spending enough.,47
136,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"We could easily get over that. I do not propose to take honourable members through all the details of this statement, which has been prepared by a very competent and painstaking officer. In Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria he has had an opportunity of investigating every figure, and checking it with the Treasury officials. I have not yet been able to spare him to visit South Australia ancl Tasmania, and I have some doubt as to whether I have not shown a smaller expenditure in those States in 1900-1 than I should be justified in showing. However, this table shows that, taking all the States except Western Australia, we ask this year for an expenditure of £3,152,549, while the actual expenditure for the year when the States had practical control was £3,066,691, being a difference of only £S5,85S. So that on the whole no one can properly accuse us of extravagant expenditure. For the three departmentsCustoms, Defence, and Post-office- we have increased the expenditure in New South Wales b)' £34,548, increased the expenditure in Victoria by £16,000, decreased the expenditure in Queensland by £21,000, apparently increased the expenditure in South Australia by £32,000, and apparently increased the expenditure in Tasmania by £23,000, although I am not very certain with regard to the figures for the last two States. In the figures fbr our own three years I have included the new expenditure on the transferred departments-possibl y it is right to do it, though I do not know that I was bound to do so-bu t I ""have given the worse comparison against the Commonwealth. I have included£31,000 for 1901-2, £ 2 S , 0 0 0 for l 9 0 2 - 3 , and £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 for l 9 0 3 - 4. If honourable members will look at the table relating to the loan expenditure on the next page, they will find that there has been - A marked decrease. Again, taking 1900- 1 we find an expenditure of £450,000 for that year, of which £31,000 was paid out of revenue and the balance out of loan account ; and having to provide for the requirements of last year, to a great extent, as well as those of this year, we ask for an expenditure of only £340,000. Taking this year and last year together, we shall have not spent in those two years much more than was spent in the year in which we took over the Departments. That, no doubt, is accounted for to some extent by the fact that, having to take the money out of revenue, and knowing that some of the States could badly afford to bear the expenditure, we have been more careful than if we had been dealing with loan moneys which would come to us fairly easily, and, as the saying is, would probably go easily.",47
137,Mr MCCAY,GEORGE,"Does the right honourable and learned gentleman mean that to compare like with like absolutely, we are entitled to deduct all these figures as to the cost 1",47
138,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"I do not go that length ; but I say that I compare what we now pay out of revenue with what the the State in the year in which we took over the departments paid out of. revenue. First, I compare revenue with revenue, and then I compare the loan and revenue expenditure on works and buildings with the revenue expenditure which we now provide for w.orks and buildings, and by that means I have two separate comparisons which are absolutely fair.",47
139,Mr MCCAY,GEORGE,"What I want to know is, whether the sum of £3,066,000 cost of transferred Departments in 1901-2 includes only £31,000 out of the £450,000 spent on new works?",47
140,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"It does not include the £31,000, because we are not including in 1903-4 any moneys spent out of revenue on a similar class of works. The honourable and learned member will see that I compare absolutely like items-in the first instance, those which we now pay out of revenue and which were paid out of revenue by the States, and then those which we now pay out of revenue, ancl which were paid by the States in some instances out of the loan account, and, in a few instances, out of revenue. That is a fair comparison. If we wanted to take the total expenditure, of course it would tell very largely in our favour.",47
141,Mr MCCAY,GEORGE,Do the figures relating to the cost of transferred departments exclude works ?,47
142,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"They exclude works and buildings ; they represent the ordinary cost of administration of a department including the cost of the central offices. As regards South Australia and Tasmania, I am not altogether satisfied with the comparisons, but even if we take the the fullest information. It is set out herefigures from those States, we shall find that, under :in South Australia there was an increase of only £8,000 in 1901-2 as compared with 190O-1, and no increase in 1902-3, and that the great increase is in the expenditure proposed for this year. The same thing will apply in the case of Tasmania, in which there was. an increase of £9,000 in 1901-2, and a decrease of about £1,000 in 1902-3. The charges levelled against us up to the present time have related to the actual expenditure up to the end of 1902-3, because there was no means of knowing what the estimated expenditure for 1903-4 would be.

On one item alone, ammunition, we have had to provide immense sums in some years. The ammunition reserve had been depleted to a great extent. In Victoria it had run down to, I think, 500,000 rounds. Of course we could not stand that. We had to make provision for a reserve of ammunition. Looking at the loan expenditure, and investigating the matter, as well as I could, from public documents, I have a strong feeling .that some of the States provided considerable sums for ammunition out of their loan funds in the year 1900-1. We know also that many of the States were forced to postpone repairs of public buildings. They were so hard up financially that they had to put off the work from time to time, the consequence being that the Commonwealth had to bear the burden of a good deal of .that necessary work. Then there was the military enthusiasm which was in existence some years ago, and which meant all-round increases in the expenditure upon the Defence Departments to a very large extent indeed. In Victoria we established ritle clubs. I have not a word' to say against them. They are good, and the money is well spent. But in the year when we took over the Defence Department the expenditure was nothing like what it had been in previous years. We know that in Queensland, as was shown from an extract read by the honourable member for Moreton, the Government deliberately increased their defence expenditure by about £80,000 in the year in which the Commonwealth was going to take over the Department. They probably thought that the Commonwealth had to pay the whole of the money.",47
143,Mr FISHER,GEORGE,"Some of the State Ministers did, I am sorry to say.",49
144,Mr TUDOR,GEORGE,Queenslan d was not the only State that ran up the defence expenditure ; Victoria was a bad sinner.,49
145,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"They all did it. In all the States the forces were increased, but little, if any, provision was made for the payment of them. Volunteers were turned into partially-paid men, which meant a heavy expenditure. Then there was one item which it is diificult to calculate, but which, I should say, meant a saving then but an extra expenditure now of £40,000 or £50,000-the fact that so many of our men were in South Africa, and that the pay and contingencies in connection with them had not to be provided in the year before Federation. Then new mail services were entered upon, and extra amounts were paid or promised to the Railway Departments for services rendered. We have had to bear the burden of paying these extra amounts year .after year. The whole of the Eastern Extension Cable expenditure is now borne by Tasmania, but used to be divided amongst the other States. That is the reason why the Tasmanian expenditure is increased. In Victoria it was said that we must not enter Federation on worse terms than those prevailing in the other States. A penny post was therefore established, and that meant a large reduction in revenue, and a considerable increase in expenditure. There has been during these years a general extension of thetelephone and telegraph services,from which we get extra work, and which demand extra money to keep the services in repair, and provide the salaries of the men engaged in working them. It also happened that at about the time when the Commonwealth was inaugurated, the reclassification of the Public Service became due in New South Wales. That reclassification took place, and meant a heavy increase, which we had to bear, and which had not beenprovided for by the State. In Victoria we had for many years been making our public servants do work of a superior class at a lower rate of pay than they should have received for the services they were rendering. The Reclassification Board's report came before Parliament, and was adopted. That meant for only half of the year 1900-1 a very large extra expenditure, the whole of which we now have to bear. One significant fact-as showing the procedure in increasing the expenditure in the States, as compared with our increased expenditure-is that the Estimates of the various States for transferred Departments for 1901 exceed the Estimates of the same States in the year 1900 by £200,000. That fact shows the amount to which the States were rapidly increasing their expenditure. In addition to that, we now pay out of revenue for all our public works. Our critics do not give us credit for doing that, though many of them know it as well as we do. They take the total expenditure, show that we are spending a certain amount of inoney, and say- "" We used to get through on a lesser amount when the Departments were under State control."" But they do not show that a very large proportion of the expenditure is not really an increase, because we now charge against revenue expenditure which previously had been borne out of loan funds. If that fact were taken into consideration it would account for a very large sum. I have already pointed out that during the last year we have increased the facilities of the public with regard to cables and mails to the extent of £40,000. In consequence also of action taken by the States' themselves prior to the year 1900-1 in paying increments to the public servants-thes e increases having nothing to do with our legislation or our action-w e have had to bear heavy burdens.  would have had to pay if there had been no federation.",49
146,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"They amount, to £25,000 or £30,000 a year extra. These facts, and others which honourable members will no doubt tliink of, may present themselves as a foundation for explanations by which honourable members in their own States may be able to show to the people that while we are charged with all this extravagance in every direction, if we were treated justly and fairly by our critics, and if they would make inquiries and satisfy themselves with regard to the correctness of the figures they use, they would have to admit that the administration of the transferred Departments has been as economically conducted as was ever the case under the States regime. That admission, I am glad to say, was frankly made by the Treasurer of New South Wales, when he was making his Budget statement last year. And it is the fact. I am perfectly certain that it can be shown that there has been very little, if any, expenditure incurred on the transferred Departments, which is not absolutely justifiable and necessary for the proper carrying out of the services in the different States. When our critics tell the public that the amount of money which the States have had to raise by further taxation has been occasioned by our extravagance, they do not point out to them the extra amount we are paying the States from the Customs and Excise revenue; nor do they tell the public of the great expenditure and loss occasioned in the working of the Post-office, for which we are not responsible, but which was occasioned by the action of the States before entering the Eederation, in consequence of agreements made with the Eastern Extension Company and the Pacific Cable Board, and in other directions. I feel very strongly on this subject, because the Commonwealth has been unfairly criticised. I see letters in the newspapers from people who dare not sign their names to them, and who make the most incorrect statements, to say the least of it . I do not say that they do so deliberately. Probably they fall into errors from want of knowledge. But I say to those persons who desire to write and criticise with regard to these matters, that if they want to criticise fairly and honestly, the proper course is for them to ask for the correct figures, and use them, and not to pick out isolated figures which they may find in any statement, and by using them lead astray people who have no time to inquire into the details for themselves. They are misled by statements in the newspapers to the effect that the Eederal Government is extravagant in this direction, or that the .Federal Parliament is squandering their money, I say that such statements have no real foundation in fact,'and that if they are to be made in future, those who make them should give particular instances, that we may have an opportunity of showing to the people of the Commonwealth that all these charges made against us are really unjustifiable.",50
147,Mr KNOX,GEORGE,Will not the right honourable gentleman add the information which he has now conveyed to the Committee to the valuable papers which he has already supplied ?,50
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GEORGE,"I think we have a sufficient number of papers supplied. Sir GEORGE TURNER , - I take, for instance, the illustration of my own Department-and this applies to a very great extent to all the new Departments throughout the States. If the States had desired to make savings they had every opportunity to do so. W it h the exception of junior officers at about £ 4 0 a j'ear, I have taken all the officers of my Department from the States services. If the States Governments have had the alleged number of "" unnecessary officers, there should have been no necessity to fill up the vacancies created by the transfer of these officers. Most of tha money previously paid to these officers could have been absolutely saved, and that would account for a considerable sum of the new expenditure we have to incur. I believe that, as a matter of fact, in my Own State, a very large sum was actually saved in consequence of my taking omcers from the Treasury and Audit Departments of that State. At page 69 of the Budget-papers it will be fomid that I have set out, for the information of honourable members, the figures connected with the difficulty with which we have always to contend in connection with increments. The increments in the various Departments throughout the States, for which we have to provide this year, amount to £46,401. That is a considerthis able sum. It increases our expenditure, and it is due mainly to the operation of States laws, because, so far as I recollect, very little alteration was made in the law in most of the States as the result of our own Public Service Act.",50
149,Mr TUDOR,GEORGE,Does that sum include the special increment to Victorian transferred officers under the Victorian A ct ?,51
150,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"Ye s ; in the case of those who are getting it, but not in the case of others. If honourable members will look at page 70, they will find a return showing the effect of our action with regard to the minimum wage. During last year we expended £39,617 in consequence of the minimum-wage provision of the Public Service Act. That is the amount of money which we gave to public servants in the lower grades, after allowing for the increments which, in the ordinary course, they would have obtained, so that the real cost of the action of Parliament in connection with the minimum-wage provision was a sum of £39,617 last year, and there will be an extra amouutof about £10,000 required this year. That is the burden which has to be borne as a result of that provision.",51
151,Mr WILKS,GEORGE,"The newspapers have made out that it would amount to £90,000. '",51
152,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"This,, of course, is an item which will be diminishing year by year, because, while the salaries of a great many of the public servants have been fixed at a certain rate, a large number would have been getting increments in due course, and the amount will therefore be gradually reduced. This, however, is an item which we also bear upon our estimated expenditure for this .year, and which, of .course, was not borne by the States in the year when the services were handed over to the Commonwealth. The answer from the - States Treasurers will naturally be that this is the result of our own action, but in spite of having to provide for that very .large amount of money, the expenditure for which we are asking this year in connection with the transferred services is very little in excess of the cost of those services at time they were taken over from the States.",51
153,Mr A MCLEAN,GEORGE,"The right honourable gentleman estimates the cost under this item to be about £50,000 for this year ?",51
154,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"The cost for year is estimated to be £48,316.",51
155,Mr TUDOR,GEORGE,"Eve n taking that into account, the amount is very little more than the expenditure on the transferred services would have been under the States.",51
156,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"It is very little more, about £S5,000 altogether. On page 71 of the papers .will be found a summary of the allowances paid' to our public servants. In the Defence Department, of course, allowances have been practically abolished, except for rations and similar items.",51
157,Mr CROUCH,GEORGE,They have been added to the salaries.,51
158,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"Yes ; they have been added to the salaries. The officers are paid practically the same amount, but in the way in which the. salaries of officers were previously paid, no one was a bit the wiser as to the amount actually received, because an immense number of allowances bad to be provided for. On pages 71 and 72 honourable members will find full information with regard to the different allowances made in connection with the new Departments. The allowances for new Departments and central administrations amount to £ 5 6 5 ; those in connection with the Department for Trade and Customs amount to £ 4 , 4 0 9 ; and in connection with the Department of the Postmaster-General to £54,759. In Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia these allowances amount to a very large sum indeed. I suppose that is' necessarily so, in consequence of the scattered nature of the population, and the great area of those States.",51
159,Mr EISHER,GEORGE,And the extra cost of living.,51
160,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"Yes ; there is extra cost of living, tropical allowances, and similar expenditure. I find that the amounts are made up chiefly of allowance's for quarters, rations, and forage. We can easily understand that in such States it is necessary to provide for this expenditure by way of allowances, rather than to provide for it in the more expensive way of having rented offices. However, it does appear to me that the amount for allowances is still the very large, and I propose in connection with this matter to ask the Postmaster-General's Department especially to have an investigawhole tion made to see exactly what these. ances are. I have to a great extent all the details for each individual, but I did not think it worthwhile to incur the very heavy - expenditure of publishing those details in return.",51
161,Mr THOMSON,GEORGE,"In connection with the formation Post-office, the allowance for quarters been taken into the salary now t",52
162,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"In some of June, the States that is so, but these appear to allowances that are given in addition to salary. The answer in defence of this penditure will probably be that if we did not give allowances for quarters we should have to increase the salaries to an equal amount to enable the officers to obtain those' quarters. My honest belief in connection with all this expenditure is that it is careInformation fully checked by the responsible officers, and that it would be very hard indeed to items in connection with which we could make savings to any considerable extent. There may be instances in which.the allowHowever, ances made are too large, but they do not amount to much when we look at the enoris mous expenditure which has to be incurred in connection especially with the Postinto office Department. On page 73 particulars are - given with regard to the different Departments and the number of pergenerally sons employed, which may be of interest to honourable members. The last set papers with which I shall trouble honortion, able members are, shortly, some staof tistics with regard to imports and exannual ports. They are compiled from the best information I have been able to obtain the various States. Some difficulties in consequence of different methods piling statistics in different States; believe that they are now being compiled a more uniform manner, and will be of more assistance to honourable members that account. From these documents I that comparing 1902-3 with 1901-and am not able to go further-the imports New South Wales were £3,500,000 less, whilst there was a small increase in the of Victoria and a small falling off in land. They were £1,000,000 less in South Australia; £1,250,000 more in Western Australia, and in Tasmania about £100,000 more. Of course, Victoria and New South Wales, as I pointed out when dealing with the question of adjustment, distribute largely; and the total falling off in the of the Commonwealth appears to be allowabout £3,250,000. I do not know that value is a reliable guide as to the quantity of imports, because values in the case of many of the items, frequently change ; and a it is difficult to get a fair method of comparison. At page 78 I give the fullest inI can get as to the values of overhas sea imports for the calendar years 18981902, and for the six months ending 30th 1903, and in the next page I show rebe turns for the three j'ears of the imports and duty collected; and this will afford some very exinteresting reading to honourable members if they desire it. Then I show the exports, and the particulars of the gold and bullion, which are included. I should have been glad if some better information could be given for the use of our commercial classes. is given in the customs interchanges published in the various States, but, find as I say, these have been kept on varying systems; and it would mean very large expense to collate and republish them. this matter is under the consideration of the Minister for Home Affairs, w.ho endeavouring to ascertain whether it is not possible, without much extra cost, taking consideration what the States pay at present, to have a department formed for collating all such information, and dealing with Commonwealth statistics. As it is now, we have to rely on the various of States, and even on the question of popula-r when I want information at the end the year to enable me to readjust the distribution, I find .it very hard to get the statisticians of the States to agree from in their figures. I had hoped, as my arose last Budget paper, to place before honof comorable members a complete return with but I regard to loans- a return showing the in States interested, the dates when the loans fall due, the rates of interest, the amounts on of principal and interest, and whether glean payable in London or in Australia. The I return is prepared as far as it can be into by the Commonwealth, but for greater accuracy it has been sent to the different case States in order that it may be fully Queenschecked; because I do not want to make use of it until ' I am assured that it is absolutely correct. At the same time, acting on a suggestion made last year by the leader of the Opposition, I want to get the best return I can from the different very States showing how the borrowed money has been invested. As soon as I get the. desired information, I propose to circulate it for the benefit of honourable members, to whom it will be absolutely necessary later on when we come to deal with the very important question of whether we shall .take over the States loans. The information will be necessary when discussing the conditions under vvhich we shall take such a step, and whether we shall take the whole or part of the loans, and to enable us to decide as to their value, according to the length of the terms and the varying rates of interests. I am not prepared at the present time to give the House any advice as to how we should deal with the subject of those loans - Many people regard it as an absolutely simple matter, which would cause no trouble; but I have been thoroughly investigating it, and I find, on going into details as I have been doing for some time past, and on taking all the circumstances into consideration, that it is a matter which will require, at the hands of this Parliament, the most careful and earnest consideration before we arrive at a decision. I have been blamed because I will not immediate!}' rush in and do something-eithe r take the loans over as they are, or take over the responsibility of the interest-and it has been urged that Victoria, in the absence of auy such action, may suffer a loss. Honourable members may be perfectly assured that if I could, with justice to the Commonwealth, have done anything in this matter in connection with my own State, I should not have been backward. I do not want to mention Victoria in any way, excepting as the State which has the first loan for a large amount falling due. But some time ago I hiid, from the best and most reliable sources in the old country, f u ll advice as to the taking over of the loans at the present time. On .that information, and also as the result of my own inquiries and investigations, I have no hesitation in saying that I should not be justified in placing before the House at the present time any scheme in connection with the matter.",52
163,Mr REID,GEORGE,That is the general matter of the whole of the public debts %,53
164,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,I am not going to deal with the matter piecemeal.,53
165,Mr REID,GEORGE,"Not if the Treasurer can save one State £750,000 ?",53
166,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"I do not think I can save one State £750,000.",53
167,Mr REID,GEORGE,"Then the Commonwealth security is not a half per cent, better than the security of the State 1",53
168,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,I would not say that.,53
169,Mr REID,GEORGE,I .hope the Treasurer would not.,53
170,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"I am going to consider the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth. My honourable friend may sneer as much as he likes, but I have given as much earnest consideration to this matter as has any man. I am not going to sacrifice the future interests of the Commonwealth for the present interest of any State.",53
171,Mr REID,GEORGE,"Hear , hear ! Who wishes the Treasurer to do so ?",53
172,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"Thos e who want me to deal piecemeal with, or to rush, the matter would force me into that position. When the Treasurer of Australia, whoever he may be, dealswith the question, it will have to be dealt with on a comprehensive basis. Looking at all the surrounding circumstances, if the Commonwealth were to goon the London money market as another borrower, without having some sort of an understanding with regard to the various loans that will in the future be placed on the market by the States-withou t workingin concert with those States in the flotation of loans- I say on the information I have obtained from the highest sources in Great Britain, that it would be detrimental to us. If we now attempted to float the loan which is spoken of so much, we should be forced - w e could not help ourselves - into accepting a price which we should not be justified in accepting for Commonwealth securities. I contended in the Convention that the Commonwealth should be compelled to take over the whole of the States loans at. once ; but, like many other ideas which men form, this idea, I have since seen, was utterly and absolutely wrong, and I am glad the Convention reversed the decision which it came to on my motion in regard to making such action compulsory. The Commonwealth must have an absolutely free hand; and be in a position to deal with this matter quickly, when we have advice from the best sources that the proper time has arrived to go on the money market. If we attempt to take any other course, we may possibly temporarily benefit one or other 'of the States, but I am certain we shall permanently and seriously injure the Commonwealth. TJnder the circumstances, I have refrained from doing anything in connection with the loans, feeling that I should not be justified in taking any other course. As soon as I get an opportunity, I think I shall ask the Treasurers of the various States to meet me in conference. There is no desire whatever to work adversely to the States; the only desire is that the Commonwealth and the States should act in concert, and the opportunity will be presented when loans fall due. We cannot afford to have the Commonwealth going into the market and borrowing money for the purpose of paying off State loans at the very same time that the States are rushing for new loans with a view to getting ahead of the Commonwealth. That course of procedure would be unwise in the interests of the States, and of the people who make up the population of both the States and the Commonwealth. TJnder all these circumstances, I feel that a strong and earnest effort should be made to come to an amicable arrangement with the States. No one would dream of attempting to control 'their expenditure. know that States like Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, must incur heavy expenditure in developing their large territories, and we have no desire to interfere with them in regard to that expenditure. But all who give the matter the thought which it deserves will see that it is surrounded with difficulty, whether we take over the whole or only part of the loans of the States. When we take them over we must do so either wholly or pro ratd., according to the population of the States; butbefore we can do anything at all we must make some arrangement under which the States and the Commonwealth can work amicably, so that they will not be competing' one against the other in the London money market. The matter is one to which I have given earnest consideration, though I have taken no part in its public discussion, because I thought it unwise to do so. The information which I have obtained, however, shows me that it would not be well to deal with the matter piecemeal. To do so would cause irritation, soreness, and injury. We can deal with it only after we have given thoughtful aud careful consideration to a comprehensive scheme embracing the whole of the loans taken over. If I remain in office, I hope to have the privilege of placing such a scheme before honourable ' 1903.] Budget (1903-4). 2659 members later on. They may rest assured that no effort will be spared by me to prepare such a scheme, and to enable the Commonwealth to obtain fair terms on the London money market, instead of being at the mercy of those who want to injure the credit of our securities, knowing that we must obtain money by certain dates or make default in the payment of the loans, and to make us "" sweat for "" the money we borrow. I do not wish either the Commonwealth or the States to be at the mercy, of the money market in regard to future loans, and therefore, in taking over the loans of the States, and making provision for their reduction or conversion, we should give ample time for the operation, and not deal with the matter piecemeal. When, later on, I place certain facts which are within my knowledge before honourable members, they will agree that I am taking the right course, and they will see that all the Government desire is to come to an amicable understanding with the States. I feel sure that the proposal to contribute 1 per cent, towards a sinkWe ing fund will meet with the approval of honourable gentlemen; but when the fact that a sinking fund must be provided for is taken into consideration, it will be found that the great saving in interest will be a saving which will go towards the redemption of the States debts.",53
173,Mr REID,GEORGE,That will not be a bad thing.,54
174,Sir GEOEGE TURNER,GEORGE,"It will be a good t h in g : but it will not be quite what those who talk so glibly of the millions that we can save ai-e thinking about. They think that the States will have so much more revenue to apply to the remission of taxation, or to increase their expenditure. That is not what will happen. The greater part of our money is borrowed at 3 per cent., a large amount at 3-J per cent'., and some at 4 per cent, and higher rates, and it is only in regard to loans at 4 per cent, and at higher rates that there will be anv saving, apart from the sinking fund. On the loans at 3 per cent., and at 3-Jpercent., there will be a loss. On the loans at 4 per cent., the accounts will come out square, if the Commonwealth stock is floated at par, and there are no expenses. The saving will be on a few loans at 4£, 5, and 6 per cent., but it will be a mere trifle. Having given the matter all the consideration I can, I feel that the time is not opportune to deal with this subject; but when my information leads me to believe that it is opportune, and I have come to an amicable arrangement with the States, I I shall be ready to deal with the matter in a comprehensive fashion. I have extended my remarks beyond the time. I originally intended to speak j but, as I have already pointed out, I have to make a financial ""statement which affects, not only the Commonwealth, but each of the six States. long as the Federal Treasurer gives them back more than the amount he anticipated would be returned to them, they will not grumble; but if they receive £100,000 or £200,000 less, trouble, will commence, and all the difficulties which occur in connection with their finance will be laid at his door. I hope, therefore, that my estimate of revenue will be fully realized ; and I believe that it will. I hope, too, that better times will come more quickly than I have anticipated, and that with a larger revenue arising from the increased spending power of the people, and perhaps a saving on the proposed expenditure, I shall be able to return to the States even more than I estimate. shall be content to be blamed for having over-estimated the expenditure, or underestimated the revenue, and perhaps have it imputed that I did so for some wrong or improper purpose. The States have to a great extent to depend upon the action of the Commonwealth in the collection of revenue, and the amount returned to them. They are at our mercy. The Commonwealth has a right to expend more than we ask the Committee to authorize the expenditure of; but, although that is so, the Government do not feel justified, after a consideration of all the facts, and knowing ' the difficulties with which some of the States are surrounded, to propose a larger expenditure, though bhere are many works which might well be undertaken by us if the States could afford to forego some of their revenue. The States in which those works should be constructed, however, are States in which, because of their financial position, it would not be justifiable. That is why I have not gone as far as the Minister for Defence pressed me to go, and have provided only £75,000 instead of £125,000 for certain .That saving may appear a small amount, but it is an amount the expenditure of which some of the States would seriously feel. . I thank honourable members for the Sir Oeortje Turnerkindness and courtesy which on this occasion, as on all previous occasions, they have extended to me. I have curtailed my remarks to a considerable extent by refraining from the mention of details, unless I found it necessary to mention them. But, as I have to provide material for honourable gentlemen who wish to deal with these matters when before their constituents, and who have to address people So who will not trouble to look into the details themselves, and are easily led away by statements in regard to totals, I have felt compelled to go more thoroughly into the subject than I should have done under other circumstances. As it is necessary for me to obtain supply to tide the Government over this and the following month, I should like to substitute for the usual motion on these occasions a motion whiph will cover the introduction of a. Supply Bill. Honourable members have intrusted me with a vote of £75,000 to meet, urgent demands. I have not spent much of the money, as I. have kept back as muchexpenditure as possible. I have circulated If so, I amongst honourable gentlemen a scheduleshowing on what basis I desire a twomonths' supply. They may rely upon my assurance that we wish to provide in this way only for the ordinary expenditure of the year ; nothing is included for new worksor buildings. I am financing the works now in progress out of my advance vote, and I have declined to sanction the undertakingof new works ancl buildings until the House has voted money for them. I should mention, however, that [ am asking for money to pay the increments to which employees of the fifth class are entitled. Those increments are due to them practically as a matter of course. But I have allowed the increments of the more highlj'-paid public servtints, which are consequent upon the favourable report of the Public Service Commissioner, to stand over until the Estimates for the year have been dealt with. TJnder these circumstances, and without any desire to close the debate, I propose to take the steps necessary to have the Supply Bill passed. Mr G. H . REID - I should like to have purposes.' the ruling of the Chairman upon the point whether the motion which the Treasurer desires to move will permit of the free discussion of the .financial statement. The Supply Bill would meet the financial necessities for two months only, and upon such a Bill it would never do to have a discussion covering the financial business of the whole year.. I would suggest the adjournment of the debate upon the financial statement, after I have made one or two remarks, so that we may then proceed to deal with the Supply Bill, which the Treasurer is so anxious to have passed.",54
175,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"It is suggested that the proper course for me to pursue will be to ask the House for two months' Supply, which, I take it , will be granted, and then to move that the first item in the Estimates be agreed to. Mr G. H . REID - - I would strongly suggest that we should follow the historical rule and preserve the continuity of the discussion. If a Supply Bill founded upon urgency is required, we shall be ready to go into Committee without entangling it with the discussion of financial matters, which will occupy a considerable time.",56
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GEORGE,There will be some debate on the Supply Bill.,56
177,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"I hope not. I have made my financial statement at the earliest possible date-earlie r than most State Treasurers-and , with my officers, I have been working night and day, Saturdays and Sundays, in order to bring about this result.",56
178,Mr CONROY,GEORGE,"It is usual in England to make, the Budget speech in the first month of the financial year.",56
179,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"No doubt my honourable and learned friend, when he becomes Treasurer, will be able to present his financial statement at an earlier date. I have no desire to prevent any reply that the leader of the Opposition or any other honourable member may desire to make, and, perhaps, under all the circumstances, I had better adhere to the usual course. I therefore move That the first item on the Estimates (Senate, £6,782) be agreed to.",56
180,Mr REID,GEORGE," The Treasurer has given us a most painstaking bookkeeper's view of the history of the Commonwealth during the past twelve months, but, with every appreciation of my right honourable friend, which I have freely shown on many occasions, I must express my sense of profound disappointment that he has not dealt with some of the larger aspects of Federal policy during the past year. We have had a new departure in the shape of a Federal Tariff, 7c which was to confer upon the Commonwealth enormous benefits, and it would have been extremely interesting to the Committee and to the public, after one complete year of the'history of the Tariff, if the right honourable gentleman had, without going much into fiscal disputation, made some observations with reference to that particular matter. So far as I can see, the Treasurer,, in the figiires which he has just laid before us, confirms to a wonderful degree the wisdom of the Opposition - in shaping the Federal' Tariff. I grant that the Tariff was not shaped by the Opposition alone,' because a number of honourable members who were not connected with the Opposition helped us most materially on many occasions; but, speaking generally, the Tariff, as brought down, was estimated in a normal year to produce £8,900,000, and that was the amount which the Government proposed to raise in ' order to carry out the objects which the Treasurer has mentioned in reference to the financial operations of the States. We know that the Opposition cut down that Tariff in such a way that the Government said that the revenue would be reduced by from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000. But after the burdens of the people had, as it was alleged, been diminished by that amount, and after making allowance for the revenue received owing to the drought and other unexpected calamities, the Tariff realized a little more than the amount the Government estimated before a single reduction had been made. The tea and kerosene duties alone which were struck offthe Tariff would have re- presented revenue amounting to between £500,000 and £600,000. Our forecast has been absolutely borne out, although we had not the advantages of the services of the officers in the Public Departments, and the re- suit is that, notwithstanding that the public were relieved of an enormous amount of taxation, the Treasurer has had to come forward and say that he received last year no less a sum than £9,685,000-that is, £785,000 more than he ever asked the country to give him.",56
181,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"The right honourable gentleman is leaving out £250,000 from Western Australia, and also £250,00 0 representing the duty on imports belonging to the States Governments.",56
182,Mr REID,GEORGE,"I am quoting the Treasurer's figures. I thought tliey were so. plain that a child could understand them, but the moment we use them my right lionorable friend discloses a number of matters which do not appear on the face of Lis statements. They seem to have been very well prepared.",56
183,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,All the figures are there.,57
184,Mr REID,GEORGE,"We know that the revenue amounted to £9,685,000, including the fodder duties, the receipts from which were swollen owing to the drought, but looking at the actual estimate for the next year, we find that it is enormously in excess of that originally adopted by the Government.",57
185,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"That estimate includes £500,000 that was not included in the origin.il calculation.",57
186,Mr REID,GEORGE,"I am sorry for that, because we want figures which we can understand. I am taking the actual total given by the Treasurer.",57
187,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"The right honourable gentleman knows very well that the figures include the revenue from imports belonging to the States Governments, and also the returns under the Western Australian special Tariff.",57
188,Mr REID,GEORGE,"I am taking the figures as they were presented by my honourable friend the Treasurer. He has made a foot-note in reference to a clerk who is in receipt of £ 2 5 0 a year, and who seems to have got into the Department for Home Affairs. There is, however, no foot-note concerning the £250,000 to which my right honourable friend refers. Theheading here is ""Estimates of revenue for the year ending 30th June, 1904, compared with actual receipts for 1.902-3,"" and the different States are given in their order together with the revenue which has ibeen collected in each of them. I have no desire to enter into details at the present moment. I am merely pointing out that in spite of the ruthless reduction of the Tariff burdens, the Treasurer himself admits that his revenue returns have been up to liis expectation, and that he does not require more during the ensuing year. Where are the traces of the advantages which we were to receive from all these taxes? Why, instead of people coming into the country they are going out of it at a faster rate than they ever did before. Victoria unfortunately has grown accustomed - to an exodus of people during the past ten years, but since the establishment of the Eederation a similar exodus has begun in New South Wales. There are actually more people going out of New South Wales than there are entering it, and the head of the Department of Labour and Industry- a worthy protectionist whose figures we may accept-report s that the result of the operation of the present protective Tariff for the year 1901-2-- a policy which increased the taxation of the people from £1,700,000 to £3,500,000 was that 1,600 additional hands had been put into factories at a lower rate of pay than that which previously obtained, of which number Mr Schey declares that 1,500 were under eighteen years of age, and 400 or 500 so young that they had to obtain school-exemption certificates. These are matters which we have to consider to some extent. May I suggest to my right honourable friend that I see no provision in these Estimates for giving effect to the policy of the Government in connection with the various measures that are to be submitted during the present session ? In connection with the selection of the Federal capital Site, I notice that a sum of £1,500 is provided. What a mockery of the question? These Estimates cover a period ending upon the 30th June of next year. If the Government would straightforwardly declare that they do not' intend to touch the capital site question, every one would know exactly what they meant. B ut to talk about submitting resolutions to this House, and of selecting the site during the present session"" whilst only providing £1,500 upon the Estimates for the purpose, is simply throwing contempt upon the matter. Let us have it dealt with in some straightforward manner. Let the Government intimate that they do not intend to touch it if they choose, but do not let them attempt to impose upon the public simply by assuming an air of intense earnestness. Then we have beeu told that a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is to be put through Parliament without delay. Yet not a penny has been provided on the Estimates for the purposes of that measure. The right honourable gentleman might say that he had not done so because he did not know whether the Bill would be passed. But what is the use of furnishing honourable members with figures relating to expenditure for the ensuing year, if some notice is not taken of expenditure consequent upon the establishment of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, of the Inter-State Commission, and of the appointment of a High Commissioner ?",57
189,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"Did I nob say in nry stabement that £20,000 was provided for the purposes of certain Bills which have not yet been dealt with 1",58
190,Mr REID,GEORGE,"My honourable friend certainly did not mention it in any prominent way, because, with the exception of about two minutes, I sat here continuously during the whole of his statement. He musb have referred to it in a very modest way. Do I undersband bhat he does propose to expend £20,000 upon all these matters t I see that provision to the of £4,500 is made in connection with the establishment of the High Court. There is no mistake about that matter, Judiciary Bill has not yet passed both Houses of Parliament. My honourable friend, the Attorney-General, the palladium of the Constitution all right. In his opinion, that High Court more anxious matter to the public than is any other court. It is proposed to expend only £1,500 upon the selection of the ral capital site, whilst £4,500 is provided for the salaries of officers of the High Court-no t for the salaries of the Judges.",58
191,Sir EDMUND BARTON,GEORGE,The Judges' salaries will be the subject of a special appropriation.,58
192,Mr REID,GEORGE,"I am quite aware of that. I have heard of such - things before. We have, really two financial statements before us-the expenditure shown upon the mates of the Treasurer, and a number of liabilities which the Government fully intend in no' sense a higher one. to impose upon the public during the ensuing year, but which are not mentioned in the accounts at all. Since the Treasurer has given us a volume of figures upon other matters, he might have, reserved one page for the special expenditure which is likely to arise during the next twelve months under the deliberate policy the Government. Let me remind him that whilst sometimes criticism in reference extravagance is quite unjust, at others it fully warranted. Personally, I never object to the people crying out for economy, irreconnexion spective of whether they are right or wrong. It is a cry of which they mighb well have made use in Australia during the past 40 years. It is because they cried out for too much extravagance during tha - period that we are confronted with our present troubles. I am delighted to hear demanding economical administration. But 7 cz I wish to point out that although the only sources of Commonwealth revenue are' the Customs and the Post and Telegraph Departments, that revenue represents £12,000,00 0 a year, apart from the enormous revenues of the States. That amount represents twice as much per head of the population, as does the revenue of the United States, and we all know the profligate extravagance of United States Tariff, which averages 40 per cent, ad valorem upon its imports.",58
193,Mr WATSON,GEORGE,"The result is low, because extent the internal production is so great.",58
194,Mr REID,GEORGE,"But in spite of that, our revenue is twice as large as the revenue of although the the United States.",58
195,Mr WATSON,GEORGE,Our internal production looks after has not increased.,58
196,Mr MAUGER,GEORGE,Because we have not got is a far an American Tariff.,58
197,Mr REID,GEORGE,"That is the cure for all our extravagance-anothe r 20 per cent, upon Fedethe people. I would remind the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that that policy has driven thousands of citizens out of Victoria during the past ten years. The 1 Government of Victoria on several occasions attempted another turn of the screw,' but to their intense surprise they discovered that the more they turned it the more the people left the country.",58
198,Mr HIGGINS,GEORGE,"They went to New Zea Estiland, which has a higher Tariff.",58
199,Mr REID,GEORGE,"The New 'Zealand Tariff is In many respects the Commonwealth Tariff is worse than the old Victorian Tariff, because under the latter there was an enormous free-list. When some honourable members talk of Victoria as having been a protectionist State, they should remember that virtually it adopted a policy which was half free-trade. of Under the existing Tariff, bhings have reached such a state that when a roan to brings a little marble dust into Australia is he is charged 20 per cent, upon it because there is a dutyupon wrought marble in with statues and tombstones, and because it is marble wrought into dust. That is a glorious way of encouraging in dustry by a vigilant administration of the Customs Tariff. After many fights in this House, and in the other Chamber, we absof lutely determined bhat cartridges should be them admitted free of duty. The Customs authorities, however, have insisted that the. lead which the cartridges contain shall pay 5s. per cwt., because there is a duty upon metal in another part of the Tariff. These are absurdities which would bring contempt upon any Tariff. I dc not wish to say anything more about that, because he who was formerly the live man of the Ministryis now out of it. But I do hope that in any change which may take place in the constitution of the Cabinet, my right honourable friend, the Treasurer, will see that it is his duty to maintain the position which he now occupies, because, however much we may differ in politics, honourable members are agreed that the right honourable gentleman is absolutely the best Treasurer in the present administration.",58
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GEORGE,Does the right able member forget Sir William Lyne's two financial statements 1,59
201,Mr REID,GEORGE,"He fortunately left the coun'try. We had quite enough of Sir William. One year was almost sufficient to ruin New South. Wales. I believe that the honourable gentleman has brought portion of his working machinery over to this State, and that he has made some provision for the gentlemen who used to post him up in his figures. All the derelicts in the public service of Australia cluster round the Minister for Home Affairs. I desire now to go a step further. I do not wish at present to refer to the details of the revenue-exclusiv e of the fresh items which are to be introduced during the year*-whic h the Treasurer has submitted to us. At page 28 of the Budget papers, the right honourable gentleman sums - up the cost of each Department, and sets forth the total expenditure. shows that the total expenditure was £3,735,583, during the year 1901-2 j and £3,834,937 during 1902-3; and that the estimated expenditure . for 1903-4 is £4,320,449. The figures for the two years 1901-2, 19<>2-3 apparently include certain payments on account of the previous years, for there is a statement at the head of the return setting forth thatThis statement shows the cost under the year during which the service was rendered, altliough some of the payments were not actually made in that year.",59
202,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,That is the cost - during the year.,59
203,Mr REID,GEORGE,"So that the figures for each 'of the years 1901-2, 1902-3, I presume include payments on account of the previous year which were made after the year had expired.",59
204,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,Yes .,59
205,Mr REID,GEORGE,"Therefore , in spite of the fact that the totals for 1901-2,1902-3 were increased by payments made after the year in which the services were rendered was over, the figures for 1903-4 show an increase of £485,512 over those relating for 1902-3.",59
206,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"The estimate for the year 1903-4 provides for payments for the full year, just as the others did.",59
207,Mr REID,GEORGE,They are framed on the same basis 1,59
208,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,Yes .,59
209,Mr REID,GEORGE,"Takin g the estimate for 1903-4 as being framed precisely on the honorsame basis as' the return for the previous years, we find that there is an increase of £485,512 on the expenditure of the preceding twelve months. I am not saying for one moment that .that increase may not be fully justified. Until I shall have had time to analyze the figures I simply wish to draw attention to the fact as one which must be carefully considered. W it h reference to the duties on agricultural produce, it seems to me that it is one of the most sinister effects of the ' policy of protection that, during a time when food for man and beast was so difficult to procure all over Australia, the Commonwealth raised more than half-a-million sterling by way of import duties upon such articles-article s that were required to save starving stock which were to consume Australian fodder when our years of plenty came. Now that our time of plenty has come, our stock has gone ; it is dead ; it has disappeared ; but The table we have made this gain out of the bitter calamity and ruin of the people of Australia. We have added to their burdens by taking nearly £600,000 more out of them than the Government ever dreamt of obtaining in this way. The collection of theseduties, too, added to the value of every bushel and every ton of this produce which was produced by people who were fortunate enough to have any crops at all. What is the result 1 Extravagant Governments expend this half-amillion of money-that is one fault of every Treasurer, and a bad one, too--and now when a normal year comes along, the revenue will go down half-a-million, there will be a cry as to the shortage in revenue received from the Commonwealth, and perhaps the Treasurer personally will be blamed. It is very easy to condemn people, but I have every sympathy with those farmers of South Australia and certain parts of Victoria who have been sweated for many years under a protective policy without obtaining anything out of in return. It was natural that when the national calamity of the drought occurred they should want to make something should be allowed. out of these duties. They said, "" We have had the burdens of protection on us for many years for the benefit of the towns of Australia, and now that the drought has come, we are entitled to have what we get out of this policy."" There is nothing to be said about that; but it is a great that our system of raising revenue be so inflexible-so unfortunate-that it adds so largely to the burdens of the people at a time of the greatest want and distress. I do not wish to go into details so far as 'New South Wales is concerned, but if ever a country in the world had no excuse for TURNER)financial trouble, it is that State ; especially in view of the enormous revenue which the Treasurer has presented to it. That revenue, of course, has come out of the pockets of the people. But in spite of the £1,700,000 of new revenue, we find that they are in difficulty over their finances. The Treasurer TURNER)may fairly be indignant at unjust criticism against himself and his management, but I hope he will remember that in these is a grand thing to find the people intent upon the details of the public expenditure, whether it be that of the States or of the Federation. We should not resent criticism posedon their part, because they have to bear the burden.",59
210,Sir GEORGE TURNER,GEORGE,"We do not resent any criticism, provided that it is conducted Fund. on proper lines.",60
211,Mr BEID,GEORGE,"We never consider that any criticism which affects ourselves is proper. But the right honourable gentleman is aware of the venomous attacks to every man who has to administer the finances of any country is exposed, although propose to take that step. he has probably had less than the usual share of such criticism. The question of Victorian loan is too important to speak off-hand. I have listened with great attenobjected tion to the Treasurer, but I shall defer remarks which I may have to make on that subject until I can look more fully into accounts. I must say, however, that I not follow the remarks which the Treasurer has offered upon the subject, nor do I at present feel at all satisfied with the jection. r 2665 statement which he has made with reference to that particular loan. I shall defer my observations in regard to that matter, and it I suggest that in order that honourable members may have an opportunity to study these accounts, some reasonable adjournment",60

That this resolution be communicated to the Senate, with a request for ifcs concurrence therein. Upon which Mr Kirwan had moved, by way of amendmentThafc all the words after the word ""House,"" line 1, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :-""Is of opinion that the Conference proposed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies between representatives of the various partners infchePacific Cable should be held before any agreemeut is arrived afc betweenfcheGovernment of the Commonwealth and the Eastern Extension Company."" Mr Reid .(East Sydney) - I do not wish to discuss the particular merits of the arrangement which the Prime Minister has made with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, because there are a number of matters which, to my mind, are of infinitely greater importance. I remember well, as Premier of a State, using .all the influence I could bring to bear in favour of the establishment of an all-British cable between the United Kingdom and these parts of the Empire. In my efforts to bring about that result I worked most cordially with the Premier of Victoria, the Premier of Queensland, and the Premier of New Zealand. There were other colonies which did not join in the project; they had, perhaps, geographical reasons for not viewing the matter in exactly the same light as we did. But so far as New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and New Zealand were concerned, there was a most cordial union in the direction of establishing a Pacific Cable of the character I have referred to. Our influence, exerted through a number of years and helped by Canada, was at last effectual. It induced the I m perial Government to take a step quite outside their traditions. W it h all their vast interests in electric telegraphic communication they had never - joined in a partnership connected with an ocean cable, and it was a new . departure BILL. of great significance and importance for them to do so. When they were persuaded to join with Canada and the States I have mentioned, the project, of course, came within the field of practical politics. In due course this partnership was entered into. It entailed a serious pecuniary liability upon the Imperial Government and Canada and the Australian colonies concerned. The spirit of the arrangement was really one of partnership. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company is a very great and enterprising body, and its negotia-; tions have sometimes been attended with a singular success. It may also be said that they have sometimes been conducted with a large, amount of secrecy. Until the Pacific Cable project loomed npon the horizon, its charge for messages was no less than 9s. 4d. per word, and when efforts were made to get that enormous charge reduced, they met with no success worth mentioning. It was only when this Imperial project was brought forward that the company wisely adopted quite a different attitude. But the change from the charge of 9s. 4d. per word then, to the charge of 3s. per word today- : which represents an enormous amount to the mercantile community of Australia-wa s substantially brought about by the Pacific Cable project. If it had never been started, the public of Australia would now have been paying exorbitant rates for their messages. I - do not look upon this very powerful company as in any sense a benefactor. It has been an entirely commercial institution from the first. It has tremendous influence, has very able men in charge of its interests. No doubt when the Pacific Cable project came into view its attitude changed; it suddenly evinced a desire to meet the convenience and wishes of the Australian Governments in every possible way. I remember that on one occasion its agent waited upon me when I was Premier of New South Wales. We did not get far enough to know the nature of the concessions exactly; but he began the interview with me on the basis of making concessions, and I immediately confronted him with this question- "" Is not your object that of stopping the Pacific Cable 1"" He hacl to admit that it was, and I said "" Good-day."" That was the length and nature of the interview he had with me. I felt that as the representative of a State which was engaged in endeavouring to induce the Imperial Government to join in this great enterprise, involving a very large amount of responsibility, with no sort of fairness or propriety could I listen to proposals which were obviously'designed to injure its prospects. That was the result of the company's approach to me while I was at the head of the Government of New South Wales. It seemed to meet with much greater success when I left office. I retired in September, 1S99, and it was able to induce the Postmaster-General in the succeeding Ministry- Mr Crick, who is a very able man-to enter into an agreement, and the Postmaster-General of Victoria, Mr Gurr, entered into an identical agreement on behalf of his Government.",61
218,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Whic h they would not ratify.,62
219,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,I am coming to that. I are desire to take the matter in its order.,62
220,Sir EDMUND BABTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Did Mr Gurr go so far as to sign 1,62
221,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Yes . - Mr Reid - There was an arrangement made,62
222,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Whic h the Treasurer of Victoria repudiated.,62
223,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"This arrangement was arrived at by the Postmasters-General of New South Wales and Victoria. It is a singular circumstance and by no T< Telegraph Co.'s Agreement. 2667 the credit of Australian conduct in public affairs, that that agreement was kept secret. The agreement was not signed until sixteen days after the Pacific Cable and agreement had been signed as between the Imperial Government and the Governments ofCanada, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and New Zealand. If it had been known, the Pacific project would probably never have been adopted by the Imperial Government, or by Canada' or New Zealand. But I do not know enough of the interior history of the matter to say more than that those are the dates. The agreement was arrived at between Mr Crick and Mr Gurr, but was not committed to writing until sixteen days after the Pacific Cable partnership was entered into. I have got the exact dates in the most authentic way. The Pacific Cable partnership was signed on the 31st December, 1900. On the 16th January, 1901 - that is, sixteen days afterwards-this agreement between New South Wales and Victoria was signed. That is the date of the written agreement; but, of course, the terms of the agreement itself were arrived at long before .that date. It must have been some months in negotiation.",62
224,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,It was signed in South Australia long before.,62
225,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That is a different thing. South Australia did not enter into the Pacific Cable agreement at all. The States on the other seaboard-Wester n Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania-signe d an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company in the year 1900. I do not remember the date, but I know that it was in that year, after the Eederal vote had been taken, and Federation had become an accomplished fact. I admit that the present Federal Government had no sort of responsibility for any of the matters about which I am now talking. But still there they",62
226,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Can the right honourable member say whether anything was kept secret in New South Wales ?,62
227,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Strang e to say, I cannot speak for New South Wales so promptly and effectively as for Victoria, because I have information which is absolutely authoritative so far as concerns Victoria. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I think that the right honourable member is wrong so far as means to concerns New South Wales.",62
228,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"AUI can say is, that an arrangement to come to an agreement was arrived at long before the 16th January, 1901. There was a Conference about it.",63
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"It was agreed the two Postmasters-General, just before Federation.",63
230,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"But the Eastern Extension Company were pulling the strings for many months before that. I do not blame them, however. They are a private business company, and they were the pioneers of cable communication between Australia and Europe. There can be complaint about their pushing tlieir interests. They are simply a clever business concern, holding a big stake and naturally anxious to fortify their position to the best possible advantage. So that my remarks are in no sense a censure upon them. I know that I am correct in saying that this agreement was kept secret, even from the knowledge of the Victorian Government, because when it came to the knowledge of the Victorian Government they repudiated the act of their own Postmaster-General. That is a statement which I um in a position to make. I know that it is absolutely correct that the Victorian Government, having a proper sense of its relations with the other Governments concerned in this Pacific Cable enterprise, absolutely refused to ratify the act of their own colleague in coming to that ' agreement with New South Wales. We shall all admit that that was a very strong course for a .Government to take. I do not know that it was followed by the resignation of the Victorian Postmaster General. Such a proceeding would often be followed by resignation. But, be that as it may, the Victorian Government stood out of that arrangement and would have nothing to do with it. Mr WvrsON - It was lucky for the Commonwealth perhaps that they did.",63
231,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"It may be so. What I wish to point out is this. I want studiously to refrain from criticising the terms which the Commonwealth Government have arranged in themselves. I do not know enough to say whether, from a business point of view, those terms are good or not. Therefore, I do not say that they are bad. But what makes me refer to this matter in the most earnest way is that the Commonwealth above everything should try so to conduct its affairs as not to expose itself to imputations upon its course of conduct, imputations upon the good faith of Australia. And these imputations have been made in no uncertain terms by the Government of Canada and the Government of to by New Zealand. Those two Governments, when they heard of the agreement which is now before us, protested in the strongest possible language. Honourable members can see the papers for themselves. I am referring to the second document in the parliamentary paper which has been circulated. The document is dated the 6th March, 1903. The Prime Minister of Australia had cabled under date of 5th March, informing the Governments of Canada and New Zealand what this Government proposed to do with the Eastern Extension Company, subject to the approval of Parliament. I make my observations now on the basis that practically this matter is referred to us, and that we, in dealing with it, must really very carefully consider the position of the matter. The Government of Canada made the following protest:Canadian Government protests against action your Government. Concession made by Kew South Wales to Eastern Telegraph Company, regarded by Canada violation of spirit of agreement under which Pacific intentions of cable core was constructed.",63
232,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"And the protest was made concerning an agreement to which we were no parties, but which we found existing. . Mr Reid -=The protest is not against the action of any State Government, but against the action of the Commonwealth Government.",63
233,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Not substantially.,63
234,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I may say from my point of view substantially. I am not going to criticise the Prime Minister as to his bona fides in the first place, and as to his absolute ability and efficiency in conducting this matter. I approach it from another point of view. I do not criticise the details of the arrangement. As I have said, I am not competent to do so. I have to deal witli the matter from a wider point of view altogether. The first point that struck me was the strong language which is used by Sir Will f r i d Laurier- a man of studied moderation, as .all of us know, in all his sayings and doings-in connection with this arrangement of the Commonwealth Government-no b an arrangement of the States. It is quite correct that the Federal Government cannot be held responsible for things done before they came inbo exisbence. Bub what we are asked bo approve of is what the Federal Government have done, for if these things are to be mei-e matters of form, and when the Government have made their arrangements, we are simply to be recording clerks to ratify them, I am merely wasting time. But in view of the attitudetaken by the British, the Canadian, and the New Zealand Governments, I feel that we, at least, owe their represenbabions the courtesy <?f examination. The Canadian Prime Minisber goes on to say, in speaking of something which happened beforeAction proposed nowThat is the action of the Commonwealth Government. - nothin g less than extension objectionable concession for a period of years to other parts Commonwealth. This agreement was framed after Federation had been accomplished. The Commonwealth really began its existence on the 1st January, 1901, and this agreement was signed in New South Wales sixteen days after the Commonwealth had been proclaimed and the Federal Ministry had been formed.",63
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Whic h agreement?,64
236,Mr BEID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The New South Wales agreement was signed on the 16th January, 1901.",64
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,That agreement was signed by Mr Copeland.,64
238,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I am not talking now of the Pacific Cable agreement, but of the other agreemenb wibh the Eastern Extension Company signed by Mr Crick. I have here a copy of the agreemenb to which I refer, and I find that it is dated 16 th January, 1901. Honourable members will see that that was sixteen days after the Commonwealth was proclaimed, and after the Federal Government was formed.",64
239,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,-The Post and Telegraph Departments had not been taken over then.,64
240,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The Post and Telegraph Departments were not taken over until the 1st March, which was very soon afterwards.",64
241,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,The agreement ought not to have been signed under the circumstances.,64
242,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Thoug h this agreement was not signed until the 16th January, we know that it was come to by the parties days and days before. The negotiations, which formed the basis of this long legal agreement, were not a matter of an hour, or a day.",64
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,The negotiations had been carried on for six months before.,64
244,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes , I have no doubt they had. I desire to be very careful in any statements I make about the mabber. The honourable member for Parramatta ' was Postmaster-General before Mr Crick. He has, therefore, special knowledge of this matter, and I accept his statement that the Eastern Company and Mr Crick had been hammering away at this agreement for months before. I think that Mr Gurr committed the Victorian Government, so far as he could, long before the date I have menof the tioned, and that matter was a subject of discussion in the Victorian Parliament.",64
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,The agreement between Mr Crick aiid Mr Gurr was come to a few days before the agreement was signed.,64
246,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I am sorry the New South Wales Government did not act in the same way as did the Victorian Government in the matter. When the agreement came before the Victorian Government they repudiated it, feeling that with their obligations to the mother country, to-Canada, and to New Zealand, they were not in a position to be so smart as to be partners in one concern, and then get special advantages from another, the only consideration for which was that those special advantages would be given to the detriment of the Pacific Cable. These business companies do not give anything for nothing, and they did not enter into this agreement; giving something to New South Wales, except upon a well founded certainty that it would give them something as against the Pacific Cable ; that, in fact, it would enable them to fight the Pacific Cable to greater advantage.",64
247,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,On e thing it gave the in was perpetuity.,64
248,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That was one thing, I suppose. As I say I do not know the details, and I desire to avoid making any statements about them, but we do not need details to know what the Eastern Extension Company were driving at. They were driving at making the Pacific Cable as great a failure as possible, and the greater the failure the larger the contribution that England, Canada, and New Zealand must make as partners in this concern, because the losses havefcohe divided amongst the different partners. This is the, agreement Sir Will frid Laurier refers to in complaining of the Commonwealth Government, and which he regarded as nothing else than extending objectionable concessions, obtained in an objectionable way, beyond New South Wales into other parts of Australia - I have great respect for the newspapers that are so terribly eager in connection with this agreement with the Eastern Extension Company. I have the greatest possible respect for the press; but we must remember that there is a distinction to be drawn between subjects upon which the newspapers speak from a disinterested point of view, and a subject in which they are concerned as very large customers of the cable company. We must be doubly careful of the attitude taken by a newspaper, however patriotic its intentions may be, in dealing with a matter which affects one of the largest items of expense in its daily business. I have, therefore, not been at all overcome by the strong and united support which this agreement has secured in many quarters.in the press of Australia. Sir Will f r i d Laurier refers to the fact thatCanada assumed large share responsibility of Pacific intentions of cable core. Believed that all colonies, parties to contract, would do everything possible to direct business over a new line. Canadian Government much regret that departure from that understanding, which has already occurred against their protest, and now urge upon Government of Commonwealth .that no further extension granted to Eastern Extension Company. In other words he says- "" That was bad; that was wrong. Do not extend that injury and that wrong"" all over Australia. It is rather a singular thing, as showing how these busy representatives of companies get inside the official circle, that the next document in these papers is not a reference of this reply from the Prime Minister of Canada to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to the company for a report and explanation, but a letter from Mr . Warren, of the Eastern Extension Company, to the Department with reference to Canada's protest.",64
249,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,It was published in the press.,65
250,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I was just going to say that probably this telegram was published in the press, and this 'gentleman very naturally, perhaps, wrote this letter with reference to it .",65
251,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,The right honourable gentleman will see that theletter is dated six days later.,65
252,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; I see that. There is a long document added here to thatletter. Then the Prime Minister of New Zealand supports the protest of the Prime Minister of Canada. On the 13th May he cabled to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to this effectWith profound regret learn agreement signed. Sincerely hope Parliament will not ratify it.. Have written you fully on the matter. Mr Seddon sent another telegram two dayslaterTo rectify an error of past Australian Stateadministration in respect Eastern Extension Co., by doing an injustice to tliose who joined with the States of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland to construct the Pacific Cable, is a heavy price to pay. Please to learn you approvemy letter with an open mind. That seems very pleasing, but I see no trace of the open mind in this matter, because the matter was permitted to go on without delay. I have no doubt the Prime Minister showed a most open mind, but what he did was to go. on without taking the slightest notice and without the slightest delay.",65
253,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"All I said in my telegram was- i Regret you deplore signature Commonwealth, agreement Eastern Extension Company. Shall await with interest your letter containing reasons for preferring perpetuity of the old agreement.",65
254,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Exactly ; and the Prime Minister had signed the agreement some days before he sent that telegram.,65
255,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The word ""approve "" was not the word used by me, and there may have been a misprint. The Clerk at the table informs me that he thinks the word was "" await.""",65
256,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"All I can say is that I am sorry we cannot trust parliamentary documents, which we naturally think are correct. I will read the communication in any way either the Clerk or the Prime Minister suggests.",65
257,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The Clerk explains to me that he does not think there was a misprint, but that the word occurred in the telegram; he only suggests, as would appear to anybody, that the word "" approve"" could not have been the wo'rd used by me.",65
258,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"In other words, there is no evidence that what I have read is not a ' faithful copy of the original telegram, but the expression is so awkward, that fchere is strong presumption that it is not a faithful copy.",65
259,Sir EDMUND BABTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,That is extremely unfair.,66
260,Mr BEID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Does what I have said not plainly describe the position? If the Prime Minister will say thafcfcherehas been a misprint and that the word was not in the original telegram, I shall accept his statement.",66
261,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I will not say the word was not in the original telegram; but it does not apply to my telegram and, therefore, I think there was a mistake in transmission.",66
262,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,The Prime Minister could not approve of a letter written only four days before.,66
263,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I am not talking of the telegram of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, but of the telegram of the Prime Minister of Australia. The telegram which contains the word ""approve""is Mr Seddon's gram of the l o t h May ; but I am directing attention to the telegram of the Prime Minister of Australia, sent on the previous day, in which he saysRegret you deplore signature Commonwealth agreement Eastern Extension Company - Shall await with interest your letter containing reasons for preferring perpetuity of the old ment.",66
264,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The agreement of then being signed, that was only courteous.",66
265,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Exactly ; and it was very courteous on the part of the Prime Minister to await with interest something which could not possibly have the slightest effect on the transaction. But, unfortunately, Seddon was so led away by this extreme courtesy that he was quite pleased. That was the effect of this language Seddon, who was protesting against the - eac agreement being signed.",66
266,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,He was told some days thing previously that it had been signed ,66
267,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Buf c the words seem offer some glimmer of hope to Mr Seddon. We must remember that the agreement was tension still subject to the approval of Parliament, and Mr Seddon may have been given a contracting glimmer of hope that, after all, this, as it seemed to him, serious mistake might be put right.",66
268,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Will the right contrary honourable gentleman kindly look at my liability telegram of the l l t h May?,66
269,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I do not want to read all the correspondence, but the telegram referred to is as follows:Agreement with Eastern Extension Company signed. Copy by mail. It is a fact that the intimation was sent to the Prime Minister of New Zealand that the agreement had been signed, but I think I am correct in saying that before it was signed Mr Seddon had addressed a communication to the Prime Minister of Australia asking him not to take any such step.",66
270,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,That is so.,66
271,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,I am sure the Prime Minister would not have left Mr Seddon in the dark until after the thing had been done; but it is perfectly clear that Mr Seddon entertains strong objections.,66
272,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Whil e in London I told both the Prime Minister of Canada and the Prime Minister of New Zealand that I had virtually assented to the teleagreement, but that some of the terms remained to be settled in detail. I told them that although I had undertaken to enter into the agreement, and that my present intention was to do so, I would, nevertheless, inform them before it was signed ; and that brought forth the protest.",66
273,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I accept the statement of agreethe Prime Minister. This matter was broached in London, and the Prime Minister Australia put himself in the position that he would not sign the agreement without informing the Governments concerned. Mr. Seddon, on the l l t h May, wrote very strongly in protest against the agreement, and gave a number of reasons for his objecMr tions. He mentioned, for instance, that this was a partnership for the construction and maintenance of the Pacific Cable known on Mr as "" the all-red line""h party to the contract naturally depending and relying upon the other not to do anythat might prove inimical to the undertaking. to Then Mr Seddon pointed outThe extreme rates charged by the Eastern ExCompany, enjoying, as it did, a monopoly, was one of the causes that impelled the several parties to join together and construct and maintain the Pacific Cable. Here was what I may call a patriotic enterprise, in which the Imperial Government, to all established rule, had taken a and, of course, the Prime Minister of Australia took over, along with, other difficulties of his position, the honourable responsibility connected with the Pacific Cable. This is one of the first occasions that I can remember when such an I m perial concert was ever arrived at-when , in a matter of Imperial and Australian interests,' the Imperial Government joined, - in a business-like way, as a partner in an enterprise of the kind. It must not be forgotten that we were pressing this enterprise on the Imperial Government, and that the Imperial Government never proposed or suggested the Pacific Cable. The suggestion came from the colonies, Canada included. The appeal and the pressure were from us, and the Imperial Government joined at our repeated and earnest request. Honourable members will see from the documents that the Imperial, New Zealand, and Canadian Governments asked one little favour from the Commonwealth Government. They tried, of course, to prevent the signature of the agreement-the y tried, no doubt, to prevent the Commonwealth Government from making any agreement with the Eastern Extension Company-bu t what those Governments plainly said was- "" We regard this agreement as fraught with danger aud injury to our partnership with you, and we ask you, as our partner, to talk this matter over with us at the board of the partnership before you commit yourself to this agreement with our opponents."" W i th great respect to the Prime Minister and his colleagues, I say that that request should not have been refused. I admit that the Prime Minister was in a most embarrassing position. He inherited practically from both sides. He inherited what had been done in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, with reference to. the Pacific cable, and also what had been done by the other States with reference to the Eastern Extension Company, and it would be most unfair not to fully and freely acknowledge that his position was one of great embarrassment. He had not created the difficulty at all.",66
274,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Coul d he have got out of it?,67
275,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I shall, in a few words, the honourable member what my view is. I shall apply the rules of everyday life to the circumstances. We should be at least as considerate in our dealings with the Governments of Great Britain and Canada as we should be in our dealings with a private i individual in the street. If possible we should be more considerate in our anxiety, not to expose ourselves to reproaches on .the part of our great partnersin an Imperial concern. What supreme and desperate interest had the Commonwealth Government in settling this matter without consulting Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand ? What particular kind of pressure was brought to bear upon them ? Of course the pressure from the Eastern Extension Company was immense, because they kept on saying to the Prime Minister, in eflfect, "" Do not listen to Canada or New Zealand or the Imperial Government, but listen to us ; settle matters with us."" Upon that the Prime Minister might well have said "" Now, personally, I am inclined to think that this is the best I can do in a very difficult position, but since these great partners of ours in a concern to which I am committed-this great Imperial Pacific project - hav e asked me to talk it over with them at the partnership board, I do not see how you can complain if I ask you to postpone this matter so as to enable me to explain to my partners the true position in which I find myself."" I think that that would have been done in private life. I tliink that the man who wished to enter into a new arrangement before he talked it over with his partners would give them a strong right to complain ; that is my point. The Prime Minister is not responsible for the difficulties created by what occurred before he took office, but the appeal from the I m perial. Government, and from Canada and New Zealand was one to which heshouldhave listened. That is all I have to say. The Imperial Government were clearly very anxious that this request for a'conference should be acceded to by the Commonwealth Government, because various communications passed between the Governor General and the Secretary of State for the Colonies -, in connection with the matter. The agreement was not signed until the l l t h of May, and in the meantime a despatch had been sent by cable from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to His Excellency the Governor General on 2nd April, 1903, and must have reached Australia within two tell days. Therefore, the cable must have been in the hands of the Prime Minister on 4th April, or five weeks at least before th© agreement was signed. The despatch reads as follows:Se your telegram of 27th MarchThe telegram referred to was a very proper one, in which the Prime Minister asked the Governor General to tell the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Government were about to enter into an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company. Then details of the agreement were given. The concluding sentence of that telegram wasMy responsible advisers request that you would be good enough to inform the Pacific Cable Board of the action intended to be taken. That board represented all the partners in the Pacific cable, so that the Prime Minister acted with perfect propriety in sending the telegram, and in thus taking care that the different partners in the concern should know what he was about to do. Five weeks before the agreement was signed the Secretary of State for the Colonies cabled as follows:Jie your telegram of 27th March. . . . I hope that before agreement is submitted to Commonwealth Parliament your Ministers will consent to questions arising out of it being discharged at a conference between representatives of various jKirtners in Pacific cable.",67
276,Sir EDMUND BABTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The word "" discharged "" was evidently inserted in mistake for the word ""discussed.""",68
277,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; that is probably a mistake. Then there is a reference to some of the documents relating to the case j and the despatch concludes in these wordsPlease telegraph views of your Ministers as soon as possible and let me know. When may I expect copy of agreement ? On the l l t h of April, 1901, a despatch was sent from the Colonial-office to the Agent General for Victoria, inclosing certain resolutions passed by the Pacific Cable Board.",68
278,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,That was in connection with the agreement entered into by New South Wales two years before.,68
279,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; I see now that that has nothing to do with the sequence of events with which I am dealing. shall pass over these old documents and refer to the telegram sent by the Prime Miuister to the Governor General on 6th April, 1903. At that time His Excellency was evidently not in the same State as the Prime Minister, and thus this communication by wire became necessary. It reads as follows :Shall be pleased if Your Excellency will inform the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply to his telegram of 2nd instant, that Ministers do not think they can reasonably be asked to submit the question whether the Commonwealth should enter into proposed agreement with Eastern Extension Company to a conference, which course mustcanduce to further delay in the settlemer.t of the subject. That is an attitude which I think the Prime Minister should not have assumed. When the Secretary of State for the Colonies supported the views of the other partners in the Pacific Cable to the extent, at any rate, of suggesting a Conference before the agreement was finally signed, I think that the Prime Minister made a mistake in not acceding to the request. The delay of a few months could not have been attended with any serious results, except to the Eastern Extension Company. It is clear that the company wanted to shut down at once, because the less daylight that was admitted, and the less opportunity that was ofiered for reconsideration, the better it would suit the company as a business concern after they had brought the Commonwealth Government into line with their own views. In a telegram sent by the Prime Minister to the Agent-General of New South Wales, on 6th April, 1903, the following remarks occur :I have replied to Secretary of State declining proposal for Conference. Consider that no good result could follow. That is where I join issue with the Prime Minister. This good result would have followed : The Commonwealth would have shown a proper desire to listen to representations made by those whom it had induced - that is to say, that some of the Australian States before the establishment of the Commonwealth had induced-to enter into this partnership. I think that the partners in bhis enterprise had an absolute right to be allowed to discuss the matter. In private life, once a man enters into a partnership in a particular line of business, he is not justified, however embarrassed he may be with agreements, in concluding iin agreement with an opposition firm without I talking the matter over with his partners.",68
280,Mr GB EDWARDS,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"But the Secretary of State for the Colonies was a partner to the original blunder which was made by New South Wales. "" Mr Reid - May I suggest to the honourable member that this matter is marked by a series of blunders? I admit that, but I go a little further. I want my honourable friend to rememberfchatifcwas not a blunder of the Imperial Government, or of the Governments of Canada or New Zealand, who - were our partners in the movement for the establishment of the Pacific Cable. Of course, we know that if Governments pated want of consideration being extended to them in entering into agreements rivals in the same line of business, they would take measures to have positions defined as lawyers would define them. But when Governments enter into State undertakings, they do not draw up agreements as lawyers do, to guard against all sorts of contingencies. presumption is that there will be a free exchange of opinion before anything is done by one partner which the other partners might consider prejudicial to their interests. I think that the Prime Minister took up a wrong position in regard to this matter. He said that delay must result"" from the adoption of the course suggested. But I would point out that a good deal of delay had already occurred. These things were done in 1900 and 1901. The appeal by the Secretary of State for the Colonies for a conference was made in 1903. if two years were occupied in getting the Commonwealth Government into accord with the Eastern Extension Company, the partners in the Pacific Cable might have been allowed a few months to talk the matter over. Whom would the adoption of such a course have injured 1 Would the sleep of the Government, or of the members of this House, or of the great body of the people of Australia, have been disturbed if the matter had not been settled ately 1 Of course, a postponement not have suited some individuals who had large business transactions, and who naturally desired to get their cables despatched at the cheapest possible rate. With them, of course, a reduction of ld. per word upon their messages was a serious consideration. But I hold, that when ments enter into an honourable their attitude should be entirely from that which the present Ministry have assumed. To show honourable how seriously this matter is viewed by the Imperial Government, quote some extracts from despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies which the Prime very fairly laid upon the table of the House this afternoon. That document covers four foolscap pages of typewriting, so that Mr. Chamberlain evidently considers it a matter Mr Reid. of some importance. TJnder date the 18th June he communicates to the GovernoranticiGeneral this despatch, of which the Prime Minister was courteous enough this afterwith noon to hand me a copy, so that I have an advantage over other honourable members. their I have looked through the communication very carefully, and I am sorry that it is not in print.",68

282,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,I have done the best that I could with it .,69

284,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Then the Prime Minister might consent to this communication being printed ? Surely Sir EDMUND BARTON - Certainly , and I should like the Printing Committee to know that.",69
285,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The document impresses me as one which has been written with a great deal of earnestness. I shall select one or two passages with a view of proving that. The despatch "" acknowledges the receipt of the Governor General's telegram of the Sth April , expressing the inability of Ministers to agree to my suggestion."" This matter, immedi- therefore, rose above the level of a protest might from the Governments of Canada and New Zealand. It reached a point at which the Imperial Government expressed a desire that a conference should take place. We dragged the Imperial authorities into this matter. They began byfighting a very powerful English syndicate-ou e of the most powerful Govern- in Great Britain. The Imperial Govern'partnership, ment had no kudos to gain by opposing different the very distinguished men who comprise the Eastern Extension Company, which, I members understand, is allied to another great company. However, they yielded to our I shall persuasions. But what I deplore - is the long this: There have been some departures in our methods of legislating in AusMinister tralia, which must be considered objectionable upon the ground that they trend towards socialism. Some people are prone to think that I make a sort of fetish of the word ""free-trade,"" but putting that consideration aside, I confess that never feel alarmed by the application such terms as "" socialism."" Indeed some of the grandest undertakings in the world might fairly be described by that term. But the socialistic aspect of this agreement is one of the happiest kind. The Imperial Government was induced to break through all its rules of abstaining from these enterprises in order that it might join us this scheme for the establishment of an allSecretary British cable, connecting the mother country witli the great Dominion of Canada, with New Zealand, and with the Australian hold Commonwealth. This partner took the matter up on behalf of the smaller partners concerned, and made an appeal to the negotiated Prime Minister to hold his hand until a Conference could take place. Some honourable members are very keen upon the question of State enterprises-ofte n with wisdomand they go much further than I do. action. I hold that some of the most beneficent . Sir EDMUND BARTON features of Australian Governments have operated. been termed "" socialistic "" departures, such for example as the State ownership of the railways. Although some losses may that is concerned. have been incurred by the States in thencontrol of the railways; upon whole I think that the people have derived infinitely more advantage that system than they would have if the lines had been run by private comlistening panies. 1 admit that from some points of view better results would have been obtained under private ownership, but our railways are the arteries of our country, and should, therefore, be national. The Pacific Cable is a State enterprise, which induced the Imperial Government, and some of the other States, to enter, and it pecially unfortunate that this attempt Imperial harmony should have been marred land. in any way. It is easy to talk about Imperial u n it y ; but could not the Minister have sacrificed the Eastern Extenwill see. sion Company for two or three months at the shrine of Imperial harmony and unity What is there about the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company that requires us to sacriwhom fice a cordial relationship with our partners in a great Imperial concern ?

I when he was considering the propriety of of consulting the Imperial Government on a. matter of mutual concern. It seems to me that the gentlemen of this company have unhappily infected the Commonwealth Government with their restless eagerness to get this question settled, and that the Commonwealth Government, absolutely in good faith, but from an error of judgement, have in not listened to the request repeated by the of State for the Colonies in this despatch. Mr Chamberlain went on to sayThe Governments of Canada and New Zealand that the agreement between the New South Wales Government and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, of which ths agreement by your Ministers'is in effect a recognition and an indorsementThe significance of it is that the Commonwealth Government adopt and endorse the New South Wales agreement by their - It would have",69

It is a wonderful development of forces. What ubiquitous representatives the company has? I have seen a number of themhighly zealous, most persuasive, and most plausible gentlemen. My interview took half a minute. I knew exactly - what they came about, and said "" Good day."" Thafc was my attitude- a short cut. The Prime Minister will have a great deal to explain before he can show an overwhelming reason in the action of the New South Wales Government, which the Victorian Government honourably repudiated, to justify his extendingfchisagreement over all Australia in such a hurry. Is it to be said that after the matter had been smouldering for two years, it could not, even at the request of the Imperial Government, wait a month or two longer 1 Mr Chamberlain goes on to say:-involve s un important deviation from the essential conditions which existed at the the completion of the contract for the construction and laying of the Pacific cable, and on the basis of which they entered into that contract, and I had hoped Of course, fchis distinguished gentleman spoke with studied courtesy, and with ho 'unnecessary adjectives. I had hoped that the suggested Conference, by affording facilities for an exchange of views possible in the ordinary course of would have resulted in'an adjustment satisfactory to all parties.

Thafc is as strong language as a Secretary - State can use; and surely if a Conference land. could possibly bring about such a result that, Mr Chamberlain spoke advisedly expressing such regret, because these fricgether tions between Governments are most deplorprehensions. able. AVe never know the result of misaccurate understandings of fchis nature. We never know whafcfcheend of them may be. Some day it may be our fate to come along with a thoroughly good and patriotic project, fco which we shall ask the concurrence of great Dominion of Canada, the Colony of New Zealand, and the Imperial Government, and they may remind us of the fact that when they were partners with us in this matter their combined influence was not great enough to secure the courtesy of a internal rates ? Conference, or of an exchange, of opinion, before an irrevocable step was taken. Mr. Chamberlain goes on to sayThis regret is all the greater because such a Conference would have proved a convenient means of disposing of two other matters connected with the Pacific cable, involving not so much questions of ordinary working (on which of course the Pacific Cable Board can decide by a majority) as questions affecting the basis of the partnership in the cable. I refer, in the first place, to the question of terminal rates on Pacific Cable messages, as to which the situation is as follows : Great Britain levies no terminal rates in excess of the ordinary internal rate, Canada having no Government telegraph system is not in a position to levy them, and in New Zealand the charge for handling Pacific cable messages is, allowing for the foci that such messages are treated as urgent, practically identical with the internal rate. In Australia, however, a rate of 3d. per word is levied, as compared with an internal "" urgent"" rate (for the area served by the Pacific Cable) of approximately 2d. That is to say, an urgent rate in Australia is 2d., bufc in the cas^ of "" Pacific"" messages 5d. is levied, which they resent as an unfair burden on the Pacific Cable.",71
298,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Because we made time of an urgent rate of 2d. under our Post and Telegraph Rates Act for urgent telegrams, fchey suggest that 5d. was a profitable rate.",71
299,Mr RELD,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,But Mr Chamberlain never flies rashly to unsound conclusions.,71
300,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Thos e who advised him may have done so.,71
301,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The right honourable gentlenofc man should not suggest that.

My point is that it is most unfortunate that these misunderstandings and false impressions should not be removed, not by an ultimatum, - bufc by a friendly Conference. the As I believe that the despatch will be printed by tomorrow, I shall not take up time by. reading the whole of it . I shall expect, honourable members to do it .",71
302,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,-Are not New Zealand and Great Britain charging the ordinary . Mr Reid - Accordin g to the language of this despatch they are not.,71
303,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,They are charging their ordinary rates.,72
304,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes. Mr Chamberlain says that Great Britain levies no terminal rates in excess of the ordinary rates. Their point is that the ""Pacific"" messages have to pay an internal rate higher than the ordinary internal rate ; it may be entirely wrong. There are some other complaints referred to in the despatch. Referring to the defence on behalf of the Australian Government, Mr Chamberlain saysAs to the soundness of this defence, His Majesty's Government would raise no doubts, if the Pacilic Cable Board were on the same footing us an ordinary cable company. AU through the despatch a soreness is exhibited. The Imperial Government did not go into this enterprise with a view to making a profit. They did not go into the Speculation as a private individual goes into a great enterprise. Ifc was all responsibility to them. It is all loss to them as a Government, as it is to allfcheGovernments afc present to a very large amount. But, as thut hypothesis is clearly not tenable, the arguments advanced by your Ministers do not appear to be relevant to the question. That, is rather severe ; because, after all, Mr Chamberlain hasfchebest advice from the Postoflice authorities in England. He considers that "" the arguments hardly appearfcobe relevant to the question,"" and he says the question is simply thisBas one partner in the Pacific Cable scheme the right, by imposing on Pacific Cable messages terminal rates in excess of its internal rate, make a profit not shared in by all the partners As the various Governments joined in the scheme ou the basis of a pro rata distribution of expenses and profits, this question can, in opinion of His Majesty's Government-and , you are aware from my despatch No. 9.1 of 21st May, infchafcof the Caiiiidian Government also-be answered only infchenegative. The other question is that of the exemption of the stores of the Pacific Cable Board, and upon fchis point Mr Chamberlain says The other matter is the question of the exemption of the stores, &c., of the Pacific Cable Board from Customs duty, and of the repairiug Board from harbour dues. That is a very important point. TJnder this agreement the Eastern Extension Company's stores are to - be exempt from duties, and its repairing ship from harbour dues. Such exemption has hitherto been refused by your Ministers, and I have not yet received their reply tofchedespatch (No. 229 of the Sth December last) in which I requested a reconsideration of the situation. But I trust that when it reaches me I may find that they are prepured, after such consideration, to treat the Board's stores like all other public stores, and the Board's repairing ship as favourably tis Continental powers treat the repairing ship Monwch.",72
305,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"We are letting in ' the company's material, or, rather, refunding the duties, and we propose to dofchesame in the other case.",72
306,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The Eastern Extension Company have the benefit of this agreement, which exempts them all over Australia from the paymenfc of any Customs duties-no t by force of law, because the Minister cannot uudo the law, bufc by remission of duties. In other words, one of the effects of this agreement is that all through Australia the company pays no duties upon its stores, or. upon anythingfchafcis required infcheservice of the company. All its stores are admitted free of duty, and it pays no harbour dues.",72
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,It is also free from income fcax.,72
308,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"We have no Commonwealth income tax, so that that does not matter so far aS we are concerned. We can quite understand our partners in this cable looking with some uneasiness on concessions of this sort being givenfcothe company, because the Pacific Cable was established in consequence of the exorbitant rates which fchis monopoly usedfcoexact from the Australian to public. There is a strong line of difference ? to be drawn between the liberality of an all enterprising business concern when it is the free from pressure and taking a business as attitude, and its liberality when a rival the comes upon the scene. I do not give the company the benefit of one atom of consideration for having entered intofchisagreement. They have a valuable consideration in return, orthey would not have entered into it . Governments may do these things, but business concerns do not.",72
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"And there is a ship of paying minimum under this agreement£350,000 worth of cable business.",72
310,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"My honourable friend was Postmaster-General in New South Wales, and knows the details of this matter. I am not fighting about details, but am dealing with broad principles. Mr Chamberlain goes on to sayI much regret that, although the principle involved in this matter is virtually identical with that involved in the matter of the terminal rate, the Canadian Government also have refused to grant the exemption for which the Board have applied, and lam therefore addressing a despatch to them bn the point to the same effect as this. So that in this matter the Canadian Government also seem to be open to criticism. Then Mr Chamberlain says The situation appears to me to point conclusively to the necessity for a closer definition of the basis of the partnership in the Pacific cable, ancl a clearer statement of the mutual obligations of the partners. That is pretty strong language. A partnership in the ordinary understanding of business implies certain obligations. The history of this matter seems to be that these parties to the Pacific cable entered into the arrangement in spirit, and, in fact, in harmony with that understood relation ; and it is no wonder that they now begin to ask for a clearer and more lawyer-like definition. Mr Chamberlain saysAnd no more conventional way of attaining this object suggests itself to me than the appointment of aConference authorized to deal finally with all the various matters of principle in dispute. I venture to hope that on reconsideration, your Ministers will recognise that a continuance of the present state of things is fraught with prejudice to the interests ot the Pacific cable itself, ing as they do so largely on the harmonious cooperation of the partners, and I trust that I shall receive an early intimation of the readiness of your Ministers to fall in with my suggestion, and to nominate a representative with the necessary powers. If, unfortunately, your Government should still feel itself unable to comply with my request, I have to beg that they will furnish me with alternative proposals for dealing with the serious points of difference that have arisen between the partners in this undertaking. Thafc is a remark which we might have expected. Your Government are aware bhat Great Britain joined the combination chiefly from the desire to meetfchewishes of Canada and Australia and New Zealand, and that they would not of their own initiative have proposed the new precedent that has been created in this case. Are we going to take a course of conduct which will lead the Imperial Government in the future-in matters perhaps of infinitely greater concern-to view our overtures with distrust? It is a very serious issue. are a very young Commonwealth. in the case of a young firm beginning business it is of the greatest possible Mr Reid. fchafc its action should be so guided as to-, command the highest respect, so in the case of a young Commonwealth it is important that we should command respect from other parts of the Empire, even though unfortunate differences of opinion may remain. Then Mr Chamberlain saysIt is of the greatest importance that the experiment should be a success in every way, and that it should contribute to the unity of the Empire; My right honourable friend the Prime Minister must remember that this is one of the chief planks in Mr Chamberlain's policythe union of the Empireand not be a source of irritation and division. It is natural that differences of opinion should arise. But unless some tribunal or other meansfor settling such differences amicably can befound, I fear that there will be no hope that. in the future such co-operation will be again accepted byfchedifferent parts of the Empire. Those are memorable words to come from, the Imperial Government. They are about as strong words as were ever addressed toany Government, and they come with double significance from the present Secretary of State for the Colonies. Surely, if we are prepared-if even my protectionist friends opposite are prepared-to a certain extent to modify our principles in order to promote the spirit of unity, even in Federal matbers of internal policy, we can render at least fco our partdependners in this great patriotic enterprise, such absolute amplitude of consideration as toshow that those who enter into honourable obligations with us are in safe hands, and that their relations with us, though they may lead to differences of opinion, will not lead to reproaches and want of consideration.",72
311,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Sharp-shootin g ?,73
312,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"No ; I do not desire to use any ill-judged expressions in this matter, because it is altogether too important. I discharge my duty as one of those who had no slight share in persuading the Imperial Government to join in this enterprise. During the whole of my term of office in New South Wales I used all my influence to bring this great project about, and I would not listen for a moment to the overtures of this other company. I owe it to the action I have taken in connection with this movement to express, so far as I can, We my absolute sympathy with the position Just as taken up by the Imperial Government, the Government of Canada, and the Governimportance ment of New Zealand. My determination, so far as I am concerned, and so far as my vote carries me, is to be no party to putting the stamp of the Commonwealth Parliament upon the agreement until the partners with us in that great enterprise can at least say that we were prepared fully and frankly to listen to their representations before we made it irrevocable.",73
313,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH," I should not have said anything upon this matter had it not been for the accusations of a breach of faith which have been made against the New South Wales Government of which I was Premier. I think I shall be able to show, in a few words, that if there was any breach of faith it was in another direction. This matter had been discussed for a considerable time, and what was attempted and desired was to get a reduction of the rates charged by the Eastern Extension Company. The action taken was, I think, from the very first, well known to the Imperial Government. 1 believe that every step that was taken was known, and when the matter came to be considered by the Government of which I was Premier, the then Government of Victoria, on the 3rd May, 1900, sent one of its Ministers, Mr Watt, to confer with a member of the New South Wales Government in reference to the matter. Mr W at t and Mr Crick came to an understanding - agreement, and to Mr Crick signing the",74

Mr W at t and Mr Crick same to an agreement as to what should be assented to by the two Governments.

It was really upon that recommendathe tion, whichlsawfirstin adespatch, thatltook Crick. any action in the matter or assentedfcoany action being taken. A short time aftergoing wards a Conference of Premiers place in Sydney, afc which, I think, my honourable friend the honourable member for Gippsland, then Premier of Victoria, was present. This question was discussed at that Conference, and, if my memory serves me right, the Premier of Queensland was very an xiou s that we should not make an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company. I remember that I had a vigorous argument with him upon the subject. No finality was arrived at on that occasion, bufc there was an understanding that whatever was done infchefuture should be done by Victoria and New South Wales in concert. After that, further negotiations took place, and I either wrote to or saw my right honourable colleague, Sir George Turner, upon the subject. I think I saw the right honourable gentleman, and suggested to him that there should be a further meeting between Mr Crick and Mr Gurr, his Postmaster-General.

As I have said, my information was that Mr. Gurr was acting forfcheVictorian Government, as Mr Crick was acting for the New Soutli AVales Government. I had told Mr Crick that whatever agreement was come to within certain lines would be agreed to by the New South Wales Cabinet, and I understood that similar instructions had been givenfco Mr Gurr by Sir George Turner. After the agreement was signed, I think, Mr Seddon came over to Victoria, and I believe he had an interview with the Victorian Government. As I was given to understand afterwards, his protest against the agreement being signed had a great deal to do with Victoria's not  Premier of Queensland, also made a protest. The first I knew of the objection of the Victorian Government to the signing of the agreement was after Mr Seddon had been to Melbourne.",75

335,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I know nothing about that. Personally, I took no action in this matter. I acted upon the recommendation of my colleague, Mr Crick, who had taken a considerable amount of interest in the subject;. Thafc isfcheactionfchatwas taken by New South Wales, and I do not think that New South AA ales or its 7 Government can be blamed in the smallest degree. If there is any blame attaching to any one, it may be in another quarter, but I do not wish to say anything about that. I felt very sore' that I . should have been led into an understanding that the two Governments would acfc together. I had the fullest confidence that the Postmasfcei'-General of ' Victoria was acting for the Government of that State, and when I conferred with the Postmaster-General of New South Wales I thought that was the time to take action, and sign an agreement which I thought would also be signed by Victoria. My only wish is to clear this matter up. I am sorry I have not been able to get the papers connected with the afl'air; but I think I have given a' resume of what led to the signing of the agreement in connection with which the Government of New South Wales has very unfairly and improperly been charged by the leader of the Opposition with a breach of confidence.",75
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Parramatta) The Minister for Home Affairs does not make matters very much better by his statement. I am quite prepared to believe that he does make matters a little worse for Mr. Chamberlain, who, I admit, has adopted an attitude which is not quite so strong and consistent as the attitude which he usually adopts regarding great public questions. There can be no doubt that Mr . Chamberlain had two minds on this question ; that he first of all favoured the South African connection as against the Canadian connection, and it was only as a last resort, and at the earnest solicitation of these colonies,fchafche was induced to come into the Pacific agreement. Thafc, I think, is made perfectly clear by the memorandum submitted by Mr Warren, who quotes Mr. as being distinctly in favour of the all-red roufce, via South Africa, in preference to the route vid Vancouver. Bub that is not the point-that does not absolve the want of faith on the part of the New South Wales Government, which has been so justly complained of. I say frankly and fearlessly that the one outstanding feature in these negotiations is the splendid faith kept throughout by the Victorian Government. That it is which makes me inclined somewhat favourably to the proposal now before the House. At first sight I regarded the proposal of the Prime Minister as an excellent arrangement. thought, for instance, that he was only extending to the two remaining States the agreement already entered into by four of the States. I find, however,, that in the new agreement there are some very radical departures from the agreement previously entered into by the New South Wales Government, and the two agreements are by no means similar. The agreement which the Prime Minister has made goes very much further in the direction of concessions to this already favoured company than did the old original agreement.",75
337,Mr GB EDWARDS,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,But it limits concessions.,76
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"It does ; but in return for the limitation, the company, in my judgment, has got the better bargain. I want honourable members, in considering this matter, to get into their minds, first of all, that these are competing companies. It is quite evident that there is not traffic enough fco keep two companies remuneratively employed, and fchere musfc be, and will be, severe competition for the trade already existing. The very reason for the construction offchePacific Cable lay in whafc were considered to befcheexorbitant charges, and generally, if I may use the term, the monopolistic behaviour, of the Eastern Extension Company. I am quite prepared to admit that this company has done a great deal foithe Empire in one way and another, bufc that has only been incidental to the doing of a very much better business for themselves on each and every important occasion. Take, for instance, the making of this new agreement, and consider the concessions in the rates which this company ostensibly has so generously given to Australia. Will honourable members believe that the company, since the beginning .of its existence, have never taken the slightest financial risk in connection with this cable? Prom the very first, they have always had fixed in the agreement an irreducibleminimum, which conditions their own operations and certainly conditions their rates. For instance, whenever they have reduced rates from time tofcime,they'always had a stipulation in regard to a minimum revenue per annum. When they reduced the rate some years ago from 9s. to 4s. 3d. per word, it was stipulated that at no time must the revenue of the oompany go below £220,000 per annum, and similarly when they make an I agreement for further concessions they stipulate that these should only be granted when the revenue of the company exceeds £350,000 per annum. Presumably these minimum tariffs are payable tariffs ; indeed, weknowthattheyare. This isa very rich company, which earns huge dividends out of the stipulations. which they place in the agreements. We should keep in our minds that the Eastern Extension Company has never done anything to injure its own business, or anything which involves the slightest financial risk. That was the state of affairs when some years ago the subsidy be the came exhausted. As honourable members know, the company were paid a subsidy of £32,000 per annum for twenty years, and when at the termination of thab period, we asked them to make a new arrangement, they said they proposed to build an all-red cable via South Africa, which would bake the place of our projecbed Pacific Cable. In reburn, however, they asked for an extension of the subsidy for another twenty years ; that is to say, they proposed to lay down a second cable at a eost of about £600,000, and asked for a subsidy of £650,000, spread over the period I have mentioned, and, at the samefcime,they did not propose to give a penny concession in the rates. Bufc the marvel to my mind is the conduct of South Australia. That State, as is well known, is a beneficiary under the Eastern Extension Company's arrangemenb; that is to say, fchere is in fchafc State a land line which benefits, with the Eastern Extension Company's cable, from our traffic. And so fatuous- I can call it nothing else-wa s the South Australian Government that they would have entered into a new agreement fco pay the subsidy for twenfcyyears, and, presumably, the old rates for the same period, merely in order that they might get business in connection with the land line. Since the' rates have been lowered, however, South Australia is losing the plums which she thought she had ; and we must' remember always that that is where the trouble arose. The company were astute enough to make a business arrangement with South Australia and Western Australia, and they managed somehow or another to gefc Tasmania to join In New South Wales, when I was in office, the other States Governmentswould not negotiate with the company unless the latter gave a substantial concession in the rates. The States Governments declined to grant any further subsidy, and that was the state of affairs when I left office. Then Mr. Crick came on the scene, and one or two active gentlemen in the Chamber of Commerce of New South Wales began to agitate. These gentlemen said-"" Why should South Australia get all those benefits while we could share by making an agreement, which would not make any difference to the Pacific cable."" Mr Crick fell under that influence, and subscribed to the agreement. I remember protesting as vigorously as I could through the newspapers against the agreement, but I got nothing for my pains, except the ridicule of Mr Crick. was one party at the time that could have prevented Mr Crick from entering what I call a dishonourable agreement. That was the labour party in New South Wales, and that was the time when ought to have taken a firm stand. Some of their members did so, but the party, as a whole, did very little on that occasion, or they might have prevented Mr Crick from entering into this dishonourable agreement. He entered into it with the results that we now see. He wholly ignored the partners in the Pacific cable; he grabbed at the plums which the Eastern Extension Company held oufc to him, and held oufc, for the moment, to the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce. If ever there was a time when the Minister should have stood up and informed the Chamber of Commerce in that State that tliey must wait for another twelve months before they obtained these concessions it was then. AVe musfc remember always that the difference between the rates which formerly prevailed and those granted under the New South Wales agreement would have been secured immediately after the completion of the Pacific cable. Therefore, the only concession which the New South Wales Government gained was a reduction of ratesforaboufceighfceen months. On the other hand, by waiting they would have obtained other concessions. They would have kept faith with the remaining partners Mr Joseph Cools. in the Pacific cable, and would have placed fchafc cable upon a commercial and financial basis of success. That is what we have to remember : that we have assisted the Eastern Extension Company so to compete with the Pacific cable as to bring about the loss that we have to face afc the present moment. But for this arrangement, that loss would have been turned, if not into a profit;, at least into a balance between expenditure and revenue. These are the gains that we have lost in rushing hastily into this agreement. In thus rushing hastily into it, we not only broke faith with our partners in the Pacific cable, but lent ourselves to a loss of £90,0.00 a year on the operations of the Pacific cable.",76
339,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Where would the Pacific Cable Board have been if we had allowed the old agreements to stand in perpetuity ?,77
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Eo r the next twelve years, at all events, they would have There been no worse off financially thanfcheyare. I hope to show presently that fchey would into have been better off, because, if we had not entered into this new agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, we should not tliey have been obliged to do some of the things which this new agreement imposes upon us. For instance, it would not have been necessary to construct a line afc a cost of £20,000, as we are now proposing to do, forfcheexpress purpose of facilitating the business of this company.",77

343,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The provision for special wires in this agreement is precisely the same as that which appeared in the old one. It does not mean the construction of a new line, and we do not propose to construct it , forfcheEastern Extension Company.",77

347,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,They would have had the use of wires under the four agree I ments. The honourable member forgets i those agreemenbs.,78
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I am not going to cast very much blame upon the right honourable gentleman. I should not have blamed him at all if he had taken care see that the agreemenb now before us the company no further privileges than enjoyed under that entered into by New South Wales. Ib is because he did so bhat I find fault wibh him. I find wibh him firsb of all for failing to consult the remaining partners in the Pacific cable, and secondly because he gave the Easbern Extension Company concessions over and run above those already made in the old agreecould ments. If honourable members turn to the terms of bhis agreement they will see at once what furbher concessions have been the agreement. given to the company. A perusal of Articles 8, 9, and 10, seb out on page 12, of the correcompetition spondence and papers relating bo this matter, will show precisely the immense advantages which this company will gain over and above those given bo it in the agreement made by New South Wales. It was proponent vided in the agreement made by the New South Wales Government that if the comto pany once reduced its rates it could raise them. An article similar to Article in the agreement now before us, was recited in thab made by New Soubh Wales, but there was one important difference. In this agreement there is a proviso at the end of agreement. the article which restricts this limitation which the company voluntarily entered lower them. into with New South Wales. The article is as follows :From and after the opening for traffic of '.Pacific or any other competing cable They do not want these concessions until competition beginsnothing in this agreement contained shall prejudice the right of the Extension Company the Cis-Indian administrations to at any time reduce their proportion of the rates monwealth traffic including Government press telegrams and at pleasure to raise them subject to the maximum limits in each case by this agreement. What does that mean 1 This company is rich one. It has a great fighting fund, amounting to .about £1,000,000,^ to enable it to meet any emergencies of this kind, and having regard to its world-wide ramifications, it would pay this company to carry the Australian braflic for nothing if by doing so it could discredit the Pacific cable scheme. take it that if the Pacific cable succeeds t will be only the beginning of State owned cables. This is not the lasb we shall hear of proposals that Governments should own their own cables. In connection with the consideration of nearly every Postal Estito mate in the House of Commons, a disgave cussion is raised as bo the advisablethey ness of the Home Government acquiring the cables for themselves. Therefore, this nob do is but the thin end of the wedge, faulb and rather than that the Pacific cable should succeed, it would pay this rich company, with its ramifications and interests extending bhroughoub the whole world, to this cable at a great loss, if by doing so it beat the Pacific cable out of existence. In my judgment, that is clearly the reason for the insertion of these articles i u The Easbern Extension Company desires the right, if met by any with the Pacific cable, to reduce its rates to a point lower than that at which the Pacific cable could pay ; and they desire also the privilege of raising them as soon as they have beaben bheir opout of the market. ' I submit that we have no right to give these concessions a company for .the purpose of enabling not it to beat out of existence a scheme in 9, which we, as parb owners, are interested",78

354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; and we should still have, had to pay those high rates, but that we entered into business as competitors with this company. We have no.right to allow this Government to do anything which would make our cable scheme a non-paying one. I have just been endeavouring to explain to the House that it would pay the Eastern Extension Company to carry all cablegrams over the Australasian section for nothing in order to beat its petitor out of the market.",79
355,Mr GLYNN,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,The Pacific Cable Board were the first to suggest the sending of free messages as an experiment.,79
356,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes ; they wanted tages to send press telegrams free for three months, and their own manager reported against the proposal.",79
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Tha b would be a very good suggestion if we had the cable established on a sound basis. That is one of the greatest advantages to which I look forward. I hope that as the result of the multiplication of cables we shall, before long, secure far more complete news what is going on in obher parts of the world. Our first object should be to make the Pacific cable pay, and we have no right to bring the rabes for messages down beyond a reasonable poinb. The great body of the people are not directly interwhich ested in cheap cable rates. Those who are direcbly benefibed are few in number, and will not be called upon, except in the same proportion as other members of the comCompany munity, to foot the Bill for any loss that may result from the reduction of the rates. Therefore, we ought to take a wider view of the question than to consider simply whether the rates for cables should be rewords duced bo cable users. The Prinie Minister proposes by this agreement to help the Eastern Exbension Company to compete operate against the Pacific cable in an unfair and unreasonable way.",79
358,Mr KNOX,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The Prime Minister has hope promised that the Pacific Cable Board shall, as far as possible, enjoy facilities equal those granted bo the Eastern Extension Company.",79
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yes , but we do nob want equal consideration of that kind. We cannot afford to send messages over Pacific cable afc the same low rates that might be charged by the Eastern Extension Company. That company would be content to'conducfc ifcs Australian business without any charge at all for a time if it could succeed in ruining the Pacific cable, and we should be no parties to any arrangement that would permit of that being done. We have already secured reasonable rates, and we should not give the Eastern Extension Company power to reduce them further for the purpose of entering into undue and unfair competition with their rivals. Keeping in mind the fact that the Eastern Extension comCompany is a competitor of the Pacific cable, we have no right to agree to Article 16 of the agreement, which provides thatThe Federal Government shall afc all times afford to the Extension Company similar advanand facilities to bhose (if any) afforded fco any competing cable as regards uniformity of terminal rates by all routes. Why should we bind ourselves to give our competitors the same facilities that we enjoy ourselves ? Is that what an ordinary business corporation would do 1 Would they turn round and say to a competitor who wa3 trying to beat them out offchefield. "" AVe shall bind ourselves to extend to you of whatever advantages we enjoy."" I have yet to learn that we are bound to go out of our way bo give a competing company every shance that we may happen to possess, particularly when we have hadfcopay very heavily for the privileges we enjoy. The article to I have referred, and others, are departures from the agreement made with the State of New South Wales, and, having regard to the fact that the Eastern Extension is competing with the cable in which we are interested as .partners, are most unfair. I wonder that the Prime Minister when he read over the agreement, and - saw in almost every article of it the "" competing cables "" did not stop arid ask himself-""AVha t can be the meaning of all these concessions which are to only when the competition begins ?"" That is where we have fair ground for complaint against the Prime Minister, and I that even at this late period he will hark back upon some of the conditions of to the agreement, and confer with the other partners in the Pacific cable. Ifc may be said that, in return for these concessions, we are securing a limitation of the terms of the agreement. But twelve years is a long the time to which to look forward ",79
360,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Not so for ever-.,80
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"It will be practically as long, if our competitor is enabled to make mincemeat of our business in the meantime. The Pacific Cable now involves an annual loss of £90,000, and, if the proposed agreement is ratified, there will be nothing to prevent the Eastern Extension Company 'from increasing that loss to £190,000 per annum. If tliey can do that for a period of twelve years we may say ""good-bye to State owned cables,"" because we shall not be disposed to buy out the Eastern Extension Company after an experience of that kind. If no further concessions were being made to the company, I should have been disposed to agree with the action of the Prime Minister, subject to consultation with his partners, but the agreement proposes not merely to extend existing privileges, but to confer others which will place the Eastern Extension Company in a position of great advantage. The company have a large fighting fund at their disposal, and worldwide ramifications, and would be content to run the Australian business at a'loss if fchey could by that means preserve intact their interests elsewhere. I have nothing bufc admiration for the astuteness of,the Eastern Extension Company, and I have wondered at their world-wide ramifications. They seem to be able to exert influence even in the remotest parts of the earth, and it is marvellous whafc they can do when they have any special object to serve. I had hoped that the right honourable gentleman with his experience would have seen that fchis agreemenb was a plain one, which gave them no further advantages than those which they now possess. Had he done so no one would have complained of ibs extension under the circumstances. There is one reason why we ought if possible to make the agreement apply to Victoria and Queensland just as it does to New South Wales. It seems almost: a piece of presumption for an advocate from a State which enjoys a concession in the matter of rates to declare that Victoria shall be denied similar advantages. Had this agreement merely extended existing conditions I should have little ground for opposing it . But since it strikes at the very root of the Pacific cable enterprise by giving power to the Eastern Extension Company to compete uhfairly against long as it, we have a right to ask the Prime Minister to consult his partners in that undertaking before placing such a powerful weapon in the hands of a rival company. I do not desire to say any more upon this matter. The view which I - take of it is quite sufficient justification for the vote which I shall give. I shall castfchafcvote with profound regret, because I sympathize wibh the Prime Minister in the circumstances in which he is placed - He succeeded to this heritage of difficulty and trouble, and, according to his lights, has done his best. But I doubt very much whether he stopped to consider the importance of some of the articles which have beeu inserted in the agreement for the express purpose that I have stated. Had lie done so, I cannot conceive that he would have consented to it . Those articles vitiate the agreement so much as to make it a matter Of duty with me to vote against; it .",80
362,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"North Sydney) Whilst I agree with some of the arguments of the honourable member for Parramatta, I cannot endorse the whole of them. I consider that having entered into a cable competition, the Commonwealth should be prepared to fighfc. The cables with which it competes were in existence before the States chose fco become part proprietors in a cable of their own. So long as powers are not given to the Eastern Extension Company which will confer upon it an undue advantage, I do not think we have reason to complain of any departure in the agreement made by the Prime Minister, from the terms of the agreement which was entered into by the Government of New South Wales.",80
363,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,The article in this agreement which the honourable member for Parramabba quobed jusfc now is identical with the corresponding article in the agreement made by the State Government.,80
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Is that so in respect of allfchearticles which I quoted ?,80
365,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"No . But in respect of the ninth article, upon which the honourable member laid special stress.",80
366,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That may be so. I would point out to the honourable member for Parramattafchafcthe New South Wales agreement, according to his reading of it, contained a power to reduce the rates, bufc did not confer upon the company the power to again resume higher rates. It would be even worse for the Pacific Cable, if after a reduction hud been made, the lower rates had to continue than if they had not. However, that is not the point which impresses me most in the considerato tion of this question. I am quite willing to admit that in negotiating another agreefco ment the Prime Minister has done the best possible under the circumstances, and at least reduced what was formerly terminable agreement to one for ten years only. Should evils arise during that period, they can - be adjusted at the end of it, belia cause it will be within the power of the Commonwealth to act in certain directions in which, under the previous agreement, it had not power to move. But even if we reached admit that the New South Wales agreement tion which was made with the Eastern Extension be Company at the eleventh hour was a proper safeguard. one to make, I can see no justification whatever for the Commonwealth, as one of the partners in the Pacific Cable, extend to the other partners the courtesy which we should expectfcoreceive from fchem if they desired to enter into arrangements to which we entertained decided objections. Nothing can excuse such conduct. Regardthe ingfcheaption of New South Wales, I should like to quote the opinion of one member the present Government. In a letter Mr Seddon, of New Zealand, to the Prime Minister, that gentleman saysSubsequent to the granting by Mr Crick, master-General of New South Wales, of conown cessions to the Eastern Extension Company, a conference of Postmasters-General was held Melbourne, the Honourable Mr Drake representing Queensland, theHonorable Mr Duffy representing Victoria, and the Right Honourable Mr Seddon representing New Zealand. The conclusion arrived at was that to'grant extensions to the Eastern Extension Company similar to those granted by New South Wales, would practically amount to a breach of faith with the other tracting parties to the Pacific cable, and with aproval of the several Governments of New land, Victoria, and Queensland, the terms lated by the Eastern Company were rejected. Thafc was the opinion expressed by sent Postmaster-General as to the agreement with New South Wales. I nfchePrime Minister's communication to His Excellency the Governor General, which was forwarded to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the right honourable gentleman gives his reasons for concluding the agreement. says The matter is one fully within the powers - Government. Legally it may be, bufc if the Government had entered into partnership with other Mr Thomson. dominions offcheEmpire, and with the seat of Empire itself, they were not morally free acfc, and the matter, therefore, was not "" properly within their powers."" - It ought have been considered and dealt with in the light of our moral obligations to our has partners in the Pacific Cable. The coman inmunication continues The existence of an agreement of practically an interminable duration with four States of Austrais a fact that cannot be ignored. It is not as if the Commonwealth were making an entirely new departure. We are only seeking to make the best of circumstances as we find them. The determination to make the agreement has been with the full conviction that the relegaof this matter to its former condition would a lasting injury to the Pacific Cable in which we ourselves have large proprietary rights to",80
367,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,We have the refusing fco largest rights.,81
368,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Surely the other parties to that agreement, having proportionate shares in the cable, can be trusted to do the best in their own interests and those of Pacific Cable itself. If the Prime Minister's refusal to meet in conference was of based upon the assumption that the other from parties to the agreement might do something which would harm the Pacific Cable, we must suppose that they were very poor business men who would have so little rePostgard to the interests in the cable of their States, that they could not be induced in fco arrive afcfchesame conclusions as those reached by the Prime Minister himself.",81
369,Mr ISAACS,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,How are we to get Australian uniformity t,81
370,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"If the other parties to the Pacific Cable were as astute, as conreasonable, as alive to their own interest, as the isfchePrime Minister, surelyfcheywould be Zeaable with the representatives of Australia stiputo come to a conclusion which, if not exactly the same as this, would be equally the prein the interests of Australia?",81
371,Mr ISAACS,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Thaf c is hardly an answer to the question. If fchis agreement is rejected, how are we to get Australian uniformity in regard to telegraph rates ?",81
372,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"There is no reason to suppose thatfchearrangement would be reHe jected. The honourable and learned member apparently concludes that the other of this parties to the agreement would not consider the position as it exists in Australia. If the other parties are all going to act on that basis through the whole period of their partnership, what will happen Each one will be a law unto himself. Each one, when he sees what he thinks to be interest to his particular State, will advantage of the opportunity to enter an agreement. Surely, we must have some uniformity of action if we are to have Cable. uniformity of interest! Whilst I am not finding fault with the terms of the agreeing ment which the Prime Minister arrived surely the first .step which he should taken was to ascertain if a Conference London could arrive afc a decision ! Being in touch with the head quarters of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company i London, they could have more rapidly sounded the company than we could i Australia. Surely the business-like step - af c any rate the more morally correct step-to take, having regardfcoour responask sibility to the other partners was to appoint a representative to a conference with this instruction - "" must have some arrangement under which we can get equal rates in Australia, and leave you to consider the matter and negotiate, if need be, with the head-quarters of the company in London, an arrangement which will secure that result in the besfc interests of the Pacific Cable."" I consider that the maintenance of absolute honour our dealings with any States with whom have entered into an arrangement oughttobe our principal pride, and that in giving for doubt, as we have done, to other depenmethod dencies of the Empire and to the British Government; itself, we are not taking desirable course. I think that even it would be much betterfcoallow a ference to take place rather thanfchatany slur should be cast upon us of improper dishonourable action. An insinuation of kind has come from different quarters; although it is politely expressed, still it there. I fchink it would be betterfcotrust to the willingness of the other parties to Pacific Cable, to put Australia on a footing which would enable us to have equal rates, . and with fchem to come to an agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Complanation, pany, possibly on the lines of the agreement which the Prinie Minister has provisionally made. I do not think that any difficulty New South Wales agreement. would occur if the matter were put before Conference of intelligent ancl fair men, it was explained that the arrangement which objection is taken, was entered into by the Commonwealth, bufc by certain of the article. ?

374,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That is not the point. Would not the partners in an affair of fchafc n sort naturally say, "" We claim the right of conference. In an important matter like n this we think we should be consulted "" 1",82
375,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"They say, "" We are prejudiced by the agreement,"" and when I them how they are prejudiced they are in the cable, unable to tell me.",82
376,Mr THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"They are prejudiced We in this way : that arrangements are being made behind their backs, without their we consent, in connection with the cable to to which they agreed to become partners in the expectation of good faith prevailing among all those interested. In my opinion that attitude is a very undesirable one. If all the partners were to follow in the in future the example which we should be we setting them, then it would be a very unfortunate combination, and I agree with cause Mr Chamberlain that the. sooner some of adjusting a matter such as this is arrived at, the better it will be for the a prospects of the Pacific Cable undertaking. now He has illustrated some other matters conwhich certainly require adjustment, and for that purpose I think there should be or some proposal made which would effectually this prevent a thing of this sort recurring. I fchink that even now it would be better, in is justice to the other partners in the cable, to give the opportunity for holding a conthe ference with the full assurance that whafc is most reasonable would be agreed to by those who we presume are reasonable men..",82
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I rise in personal exafc the earliest possible moment;, to make known the fact that one of the articles to which I have taken exception is in the I did not a know until today that there was such a and foolish article in that agreement. I find, to further, that the Prime Minister is acnot quitted of having gone any further than the",82
378,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Will the honourable member repeat to me the number of the other articles in which he says I made differences ?,83
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"No . 16 is the other article .I referred toTlie Federal Government shall at all times afford to the Extension Compaq' similar advanshall tages and facilities to those, if anj', afforded any competing cable as regards uniformity of terminal rates by all routes.",83
380,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH," I think the yond proposed agreement is a very business-like arrangement, and very much to the advanagreement. tage of the Commonwealth. My only regret is that we have got any advantages Commonwealth under it. If there are three partners to an agreement, and one partprovision ner subsequently makes an arrangement, even for the advantage of the partnership, by which he gets advantages to himself, think that the other parties may very well feel suspicious. There is throughout correspondence an impression that Australia is in some way taking advantage of the the position which has been created by the tractingState of New South Wales and others before the new agreement was entered into. I only wish to point out that there are distinct advantages obtained for Australia which are not given to the other partners in the Pacific Cable Agreement.' Those vantages are, first, that Australia will have the right of reduced charges to South Africa. That is a matter which cannot be of the slightest concern to . the other contracting parties. There is also tobeareduction of rates to India and the East. That cannot be a advantage to Canada and Great Britain. The third advantage is that there is a right of purchase. It appears to me, however, thatthat the otlier contracting parties might say - "" if you can secure thesead vantages to Australia by this arrangement, it isprobablethat, by waiving them, larger concessions might have been obtained for the other partners."" That seems to me to be the only objection. Otherwise I think that the Prime MinAustralia, Western ister has approached a very difficult tion aud made the best terms possible out of it . If an ordinary business man found his hands tied, as the hands of the Prime Minister were tied by the agreement made by some of the States, he would have nothing^ to do but to make the best arrangement possible.' The Prime Minister had to accept the existing condition of affairs and make the best of things. There are only two minor matters to which I should like to draw his attention. In paragraph 6 of the agreement it is provided that the Eastern Extension Company can, if it chooses, apportion the rates in anj' way it likes. The paragraph saysNothing herein or in the said schedule contained prevent the Extension Company from varyto ing the apportionment of wny rate, provided the total rate is not increased, and the proportion payable to the Commonwealth is not reduced, be the limits contained in the said schedule.",83
381,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That is in the old This, of course, is an agreement undertaken with the recognition of the fact for the of the existence of the old one.",83
382,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"I am sorry that that was not left out. We have a cable rate of 2s. to South Africa. The paragraph which I have quoted will prevent cables I coming from New Zealand over the Pacific Cable through Australia to South Africa, the because the Eastern Extension Company might so apportion its rates as to increase charges on cables coining from outside the conCommonwealth over the Pacific Cable. In other words, the Eastern Extension Company can block any business coming over thePacific line by altering its proportionate rates. The company can make a re-arrangement of the rates to South Africa or to any port in adSouth Africa, or to St. Helena, or to any point at which its cable touches, so that the rates for any business coming through the Commonwealth from New Zealand over the Pacific line would be so increased as to be absolutely prohibitive. There is one other dispoint. I do not see why four States only are to have the advantage in regard to income tax and charges. The agreement says The Commonwealth shall pay to the Extension Company such sums as will be sufficient to recoup . . . any moneys which the Extension Company are required to pay . . . . for wharfage rates . . . . or any income tax in the States of New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasposimania. AVhy four' States only t",83
383,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Thos e were the # only States that were in the agreement.,83
384,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Why should Victoria, because she has kept to an honourable agreement, have income tax paid by her through the Commonwealth Government on account of the Extension Company ?",83
385,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"There is nothing to prevent Victoria from taxing the company. The company did not ask us to relieve them of the Victorian income tax, and we did not offer to do so.",83
386,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,But the Commonwealth has to pay it The Commonwealth shall pay to the Extension Company such sums as will be sufficient to recoup. So that Victoria will pay her portion.,84
387,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Victori a is cluded in the agreement as it was before. It gets the advantage of the agreement, and has to take the burdens of it .",84
388,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"On the whole I am pleased with the agreement, though it would have been better if we had said that we were only making the best terms for the Pacific Cablepartners rather than that we were making the best terms for ourselves.",84
389,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Anythin g we out of this will not be at the expense of the Pacific Cable.,84
390,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Every concession made to us is made at their expense, and there are things which we shall gain. Por instance, we have power to buy oufcfcheEastern - Extension Company with ifcs plant and line. This would give the impression that we took such power, altogether irrespective of the rights of the other partners fco the cable agreement for our future advantage. looks as though the Pacific partners had been neglected. But wo have to remember that the Eastern Extension Company's line has been of great advantage to Australia, and we hope that it will be of advantage in the future. At any rate, I shall vote for the adoption of the agreement.",84
391,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH," I regret that the Prime Minister has made this agreement, assuming that he had to do so. Certainly, New South Wales had entered into an arrangement with the Eastern Extension Company. .So far as that is concerned I believe that the precis of the agreement was telegraphed to Mr Chamberlain, and that his assent was practically given to it . He would have been perfectly within his rights in trying to arrange for a modification. The great mistake the Prime Minister made was when Mr Chamberlain in his despatch of the 22nd of March, as the representative of Great Britain, suggested that there should be a conference, and went on to say Mr Chamberlain will be prepared, in communicating the resolutions of the board to the representatives in this country of the several Governments concerned, to send also copies of this letter, and to suggest that their Governments should appoint representatives for a special conference to consider tlio whole question with representatives of His Majesty's Government. The mistake made was in holding the conference and in entirely ignoring the suggestion made. Thedateof thafcdespatoh was the 22nd of March. Just before that date we find that New'Zealand had a conference of Postin- masters-General, representing Queensland, Victoria, and New Zealand. Thafc conference came to the decisionfchafcan agreement entered into with the Eastern Extension Company would be a breach of faith with the other contracting parties to the Pacific Cable, and the terms offered by the company were rejected. I think Mr. Seddon was quite right when he contended thatget The material change contemplated should not he made without the consent of the other contracting parties to the Pacific Cable agreement I really do not see how we can escape the contention that these parties oughfc to have been consulted. I do not fchink that it lies within our province to discuss whether the proposed arrangement is a good or a bad one. It seems to me that we cannot enter into that. Personally, I cannot say that I altogether disapprove of the agreement It that has been made, but I do disapprove very much of this action being taken without the other contracting parties to the Pacific Cable agreement being consulted. There has been a distinct breach of faith, and as the Prime Minister has forgotten the duty which he owed to the Commonwealth fco maintain a high standard of honour in dealing with the matter, it is incumbent upon this House to reject the motion now brought forward. If the right honourable gentleman can volunteer any explanation, I for one shall be very glad to hear it , because I cannot understand how he came to overlook the facfcfchafcfche other contracting parties were not consulted. We should have some explanation on the point, and until they are consulted. I have no other course openfcome but to adopt the attitude which I should have adopted had no arrangement been made with the Eastern Extension Company, and that is to insist that Parliament itself shall see that a conference is held with the other contracting parties to the Pacific Cable agreement. If they are not satisfied that the arrangement now proposed with the Eastern Extension Company is a good one, we musfc simply go wifchoub it. Having entered .into a partnership, as we did in this case, I cannot see how one of the contracting parties can take it upon itself to alter the terms of the agreement without consultation with the other parties.",84
392,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,We have altered any of the terms of our agreement in connection with the Pacific Cable. .,85
393,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The point is that we have neglected to confer with the other parties to that agreement before entering into the agreement which the Eastern Extension Company now propose. I admit that there was a strong feeling in the States at the time that one State should get the benefit of a reduction in cable charges and another should not. I have little doubt that it was the strong representations made on that point which caused the Prime Miuister to neglect the duty of consulting with the other parties to the Pacific Cable agreement. If this agreement were brought before the other parties to the Pacific Cable agreement, and were consented to by fchem, I should not be quite prepared to vote for it, bufc I feel that the other parties to the Pacific Cable agreement should first give their consent to it or express their approval of some other agreement of this nature. Until that is done there is no course open to us bufc to reject the present motion.",85
394,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH," I do not quite understand the objections which have been taken by those who oppose this agreement entered into as it has been by the Prime Minister subject to the ratification of Parliament. After going through the correspondence very carefully and reviewing the situation, I cannot see where the interests of those who are parties to the Pacific Cable agreement are prejudiced in the slightest degree.",85
395,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That is not the point. The point is that we have entered into an arrangement with these other partners, and it is proposed to alter that arrangement without consulting fchem.",85
396,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,We have not altered that arrangement.,85
397,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,A party in equity complaining of another must show as some foundation for his suit-that action has been taken to his prejudice.,85

399,Mr KTRWAU,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"The Commonwealth is accused of a breach of faith, and the conference would show whether the Commonnot wealth has committed a breach of faith or not.",85
400,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,1 do not think the question of a breach of faith is raised at all.,85
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Ye s ; the other partiesfcofchePacific Cable agreement raise the question.,85
402,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"This correspondence shows that it was at the request of the Prime Minister of Canada and the directors of the Pacific Cable Boardfchafcthe Secretary of State for the Colonies came into the matter in the first instance, but we must consider the situation from our own standpoint. We must not forget the fact that four of the States had entered into an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company which was binding for all time.",85
403,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,That was not the Commonwealth.,85
404,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,They became part of the Commonwealth.,85
405,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"When the Post and Telegraph Departments of the States passed over to the Commonwealth the obligation in connection with those agreements passed over also. I have a very vivid recollection of the feeling expressed in Victoria some three years ago, notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary, with respect to the attitude the then Government took up in not following the course that had at that time been taken by New South Wales and the other Stateswho had entered into an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company.",85
406,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,Thos e are facts which should be placed before a Conference.,85
407,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That puts me in mind of the old aphorism that "" we should not do today what we can put off till tomorrow."" That is a course to which I have a decided objection. If it could be shown that there is anything wrong in this agreement, or that it should not have been entered into, I could understand it .",85
408,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,That is the point the leaderof the Opposition so cleverly,85
409,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,is there not a strong probability that this will diminish the returns from the Pacific Cable by one-fourth - or one-fifth 7,86
410,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"If some objectionable features in this agreement could be pointed out, or if some breach of faith in connection with it could be shown, I could understand further delay being demanded ; but why should the people of Yictoria be subjected to an undue charge for cables for .another twolve months t They have had to submit to it now for two years, and why should there be a further delay on the principle that we should not do today what it is possible for us to do tomorrow 1 We have had too much of that kind of thing,. .and we should be prepared to accept some little responsibility.",86
411,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Yictori a would not be subjected to undue charges, because even - if we had not the agreement the charge of 4s. 7d. per word would be reduced by the company to 3s.",86
412,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"That is another point, but it has not been shown that further concessions have been made under thia agreement than by any of the - States who entered into the former agree.ment with the Eastern Extension Company. I think it was the honourable member for Parramatta who said that further concessions were being made under this agreement to the Eastern Extension Company, beyond those already given under the separate agreements entered into by the four States. We have already concessions given to the Commonwealth, and I think it will be .an advantage eventually to the parties to the Pacific Cable agreement, that the agreement now proposed to be entered into with the Eastern Extension Company is practically limited to ten years from the date of signing, with the right of purchase eventually. Those .aro distinct concessions.",86
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"No doubt, that is an advantage.",86
414,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH,"Thos e are advantages worthy of consideration. Viewing the situation from every stand-points, I con discover . no valid objection to the agreement as - entered into by the Prime Minister, and I shall give it my support. Debate (on motion by Mr Glynn) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.20 p.m.",86
