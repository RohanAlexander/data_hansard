1,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"3 wish to make, a perWhen speaking last which are nowadays performed coland amongst them. I mentioned the the aged, infirm, and lunaof an interjection I was led that the State in some cases evenaway from their parents, havmind the cases of the neglected dissolute, drunken, or incapable that I advocate the taking of and unfair misrepresentation of the facts. The only comment I made on the subject was that the State of South Australia had been very successful in the care of infants. The Minister's statement was therefore very unfair, especially coming as it did after he had lectured honourable members on the desirability of avoiding misrepresentation of any kind. My remarks were also misrepresented on a second but less important point. In dealing with the question of Socialism, I mentioned the fact that the honourable members for New England and Lang, who support the Government, believed in the single tax, which I regard as a socialistic proposal, and I said that thinkers on the question had stated that if it were carried into effect, the State would have so much money on its hands that it would have to cast about for some means of utilizing it, such as the maintenance of free railways. The Minister of Trade and Customs, however, stated last night that I had advocated the nationalization of land. I have carefully read the report of my speech and I find that I did not make any special reference to land nationalization, and I certainly did not argue the question. In today's Argus, however, the Minister is reported to have saidMr Spence the other day pointed out the advantages of land nationalization. There - are only two ways in which the State can get possession of the land-bu v it or confiscate it. I am sure Mr. Spence would not advocate confiscation.",12
2,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He has several terraces. I shall be very glad if the right honourable member will tell me where they are, because I do not know. The statement that I discussed land nationalization in my speech is absolutely untrue, and the arguments which follow, and which the Minister of Trade and Customs attributed to me, he should discuss with the honourable member for Lang at the next caucus meeting of the party, when, I venture to say, he will get rather the worse of the argument. think that it is only right that I should call attention to these' inaccuracies before the matter goes further. I am sure that the Minister does not desire that my remarks should be misrepresented by him, particularly after what he said in the early part of his speech; but, on re-reading my own speech, I know that I have been misrepresented.",13
3,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In fairness to the honourable member, I think it right that I should say that if I have misrepresented him, or inaccurately represented him. I very much regret it. I certainly did so unintentionally. If I misunderstood him, it must have been because, owing to the brevity of his remarks, he failed to make his meaning quite clear. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) - It has been stated by Ministers and supporters of the Government that no reasons have yet been alleged why the present Administration should not continue to hold office; but, before I resume my seat, I shall try to give a few such reasons. Some persons may think that they are not very strong ones, but in my opinion they are very strong. I cannot deal with the matter, however, without repeating to some extent the remarks which I made about a-fortnight ago, when my speech was abruptly brought to a conclusion by the count-out, though I shall not do that to any greater extent than I feel to be necessary. In the present unique condition of affairs, I think it right that the history of this session should be stated, especially since the Minister of Trade and Customs had the temerity to say last night that the Watson Administration was fairly treated.",13
4,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think I said ""indulgently treated.""",13
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think that the honourable gentleman used both words; but either word would have been incorrect. : If honourable members will cast back their minds to the commencement of the session, .when the Deakin Government introduced the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, excluding the railway servants from its operation",13
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Excludin g all public servants.,13
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I hardly think that all public servants were excluded, though I am not sure about that. At any rate, the railway servants were excluded. The members of the Labour Party, however, had gone to the country in favour of I the inclusion of the railway servants, and they and some other honourable members were returned to support that provision in the Bill. It was scarcely to be expected that members so pledged would turn round upon the promises which they had given to the electors. I know, not only from the statements made by members of the Labour Party and by its leader, but from other statements which I have heard, that it was furthest from the wish or the intention of that partu to destroy the Deakin Government. But they would have been recreant to their pledges to the electors regarding the inclusion of the railway servants, and would not have been fit to retain their positions, if they had voted other than they did. Who was it who really destroyed the Deakin Government? Although the right honourable member for Swan tries, whenever he has the opportunity, to place the blame on the shoulders of the Labour Party, it was not that party, but the present Prime Minister, who was to blame.",13
8,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I shall have to make a personal explanation in reply to that statement. I voted with the Deakin Government. If I had voted against them. I should have been sent. for by the Governor General to form a new Administration.,14
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable gentleman, in an interview published in a Sydney newspaper, stated that he intended to vote with the Deakin Government, tout that he wished his followers to cording to their consciences.",14
10,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Hear , hear. That is what the honourable member does not understand.",14
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable gentleman said a little more to the same effect, which gave a very strong hint publicly to his followers-and I have no doubt that they received equally strong hints privately-to vote against the Government.",14
12,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Not once did I do anything of the kind.,14
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Althoug h the right honourable gentleman said that he would not prevent his followers from voting according to their consciences, two or three of them stated publicly that they intended to vote, and did vote, against their conscience; and their action was no doubt instigated by the Prime Minister, who wished at all hazards to destroy the Deakin Government.",14
14,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is untrue.,14
15,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Will the Prime Minister withdraw that statement ?,14
16,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I will say, not that it is untrue, but that it is absolutely without foundation.",14
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do""nob know if the right honourable gentleman wishes it to be inferred that the statement that some honourable members said that they would vote against their consciences is without foundation, because Hansard will bear me out in it.",14
18,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,They did not do so at my instigation.,14
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,If my conscience had been as elastic as that of some of the right honourable gentleman's followers^,14
20,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member never had a conscience.,14
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"And if I had been a follower of his, and had such a convenient conscience, I would have done as they did, acting on the hint he had given; but my conscience is not so elastic. A lthough the right honourable gentleman voted with the Deakin Government, he was hoping that his followers would vote against it, and was instigating them to do so.",14
22,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No .,14
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That was the reason of the defeat of that ""Administration.",14
24,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What the honourable member vote ac- suggests was never done by me.,14
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What about those who left the Deakin Government, and voted against it?",14
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the right honourable member has a conscience, which I begin to doubt, and he had been returned pledged to vote in any specific way, would he not vote in that way? Take the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs,, who was as good a supporter of the Deakin Administration as they had, but who was pledged to his constituents to vote for the inclusion of railway servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill - ",14
27,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And who voted in the same way before the election as he did afterwards.,14
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes . Does the right honourable member refer to that honourable and learned member?,14
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He was pledged to support the Deakin Government.,14
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He was also pledged to the inclusion of the railway servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. When we recollect that it was only with the assistance of the Labour Party that the Barton Government, and afterwards the Deakin Government, were able to remain in office for three years, it ill becomes any member of either of those Ministries to object to the action recently taken by the members of the Watson Government.",14
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Who turned us out of office?,14
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We were turned out as the result of a combination of forces, and the present Prime Minister had most to do with that.

35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He has a very elastic one.,15
36,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I understood the honourable member to say that the Prime Minister voted against the honourable member's conscience.,15
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am very glad that the honourable and learned member credits me with the possession of a contleman science. The Prime Minister, after having waited about-afte r the Deakin Governout, ment had been defeated-in the expectation that he would be called upon to form a new istration. Ministry, went to the press and complained like a great schoolboy that he, honourable member for Bland, should have been sent for by His Excellency the nor-General.",15
38,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes ; I cried bitterly about it,15
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"After the Deakin Ministry had resigned, the right honourable gentleman was running about the 'House",15
40,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I certainly did not run.,15
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Ari d telling his friends "" I shall be the Prime Minister equal."" tomorrow."" Altogether his conduct was childish in the extreme. When he found that the honourable member for Bland had' Swan. succeeded in forming a Ministry, he at once began to intrigue against them, because he felt quite sure that he would have the next show. How did he achieve success? By one of the worse actions- I would almost venture to call it a trick-of which a politician has ever been guilty?",15
42,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The vote was taken in a full House. There are no more bridges to be built here.,15

47,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That consideration will never induce the right honourable' gentleman to leave office.,15
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have taken the trouble to make a small precis of the facts in order that the public may clearly understand the circumstances under which the Government went out of office.,15
49,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What Government?,15
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The last Government, which the right honourable gentleman intrigued against, and tilted out of office by a trick.

51,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That showed His Exceland not the lency's good sense.,15
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It ' showed Goverthe anxiety of the Prime Minister for office, and nothing else. The' Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , as introduced by the Deakin Government contained the fortyeighth clause with a provision for preference to unionists, without any qualification, and precisely the same words are contained in the clause at present, namely, "" preference shall be given to such members all (meaning unionists) other things being Those words were in the Bill as introduced by the Deakin Government, and fathered by the right honourable member for 1",15
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is most unfair.,15
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Bill was introduced by the Deakin Government, and the honourable member as a member of that Ministry had to father it.",15
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did the honourable member father the inclusion of the railway servants ?,15
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Unfortunatel y I had to vote against them when in the Government, but I voted in their favour when I was free to do so.",15
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"My position, in the matter of preference, is exactly the same as that of the honourable member in regard to railway servants.",15
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Bill introduced by. the Deakin Government, contained a provision that its scope should extend to the agricultural, viticultural, ticultural, and dairying industries.",16
59,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I suppose I was always in favour of that provision, too?",16
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not know. Thank goodness, I am not the right honourable gentleman's keeper. When the Bill left the hands of the Watson Government it did not contain the provision including agricultural labourers and others, but it embraced the provision for preference to unionists, modified by the proviso inserted at the instance of the Minister of Defence, which was as follows: Provided that no such preference shall be directed to be given unless the application such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with applicants. The alternative amendment, proposed by the honourable member for Bland wasThe Court, before directing that preference shall be given to the members of an organization, shall be satisfied that the organization substantially represents the industry affected in point of the numbers and competence of its members. It was on the question as to whether the Bill should be recommitted with a view to the consideration of the amendment proposed by the then Government, that the Ministry were defeated. They were denied that consideration which is always extended to the Government by an honourable Opposition. That is the point upon which I join issue with the Minister of Trade and Customs, who stated that the late Government had received fair play. I consider that they were treated most unfairly.",16
61,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"They were defeated by thirty-eight votes to thirty-six, and I consider that that is fair play.",16
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"They were defeated with the assistance of the vote of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who had introduced the Bill containing the preference provision, and also the proposal that the agricultural industry should be brought within the scope of the measure. The honourable and learned member voted against the provision of his own Bill. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat stated that he had been charged, on behalf of the Opposition, to assure the Watson Government that the utmost fair play would be extended to them. That statement was imade imme, as diatelv after the honourable member for also Bland had announced the formation of the Ministry. The honourable and learned memhorber for Ballarat also said I think we must all agree that if (the Government) can only be maintained, even temporarily, by that honourable granting of fair play to which I have already alluded, by that extension of consideration from one side of the House to the other, which enables us to discharge our common duties tb the public. In the face of that statement, I do not think that it redounded to the credit of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, or of those who were following him, when they turned round and failed to extend the fair play that was promised when the Watson Government took office. """,16
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It all depends on for what the honourable member calls fair play.,16
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not think the that faiir play was extended to the Watson Government at any time. I do not complain of the action of the right honourable gentleman, because at the very first opportunity that presented itself, he attacked the Government in the most vigorous and vicious wav.",16
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Not in a vicious wav.,16
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes, in a vicious way. I know that the honourable member for Bland would not have takenoffice if he had not been assured that he would receive the support of some honourable members who were outside of his own party.",16
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Who gave him that assurance ?,16
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have just read the assurance given by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. That statement was made after the formation of the Ministry was announced in this Blouse. I have stated the circumstances as concisely as possible, in order that the general public may understand the position that has been taken up by certain members of the Opposition, and' the mariner in which the late Government were ousted from office.",16
69,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,They occupied the Treasury benches for six weeks after their dcf 6£lt,16
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think that that is an unfair way of putting it. They stayed on the - Treasury benches for six weeks after the amendment proposed by the Minister of Defence was carried. The leader of the late Government was perfectly justified in stating that he could not accept the - amendment, and that he would ask the House to recommit the clause in order that the whole matter might be reconsidered.",16
71,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did the Deakin Government do that?,17
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We had not a - similar opportunity.,17
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We could have done it.,17
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I dare say we h? could. The vote upon the amendment proposed by the Minister of Defence was taken in a small House and without debate, and, in view of the fact that the decision was arrived at upon a catch vote, the late Prime Minister was perfectly justified in asking for its reconsideration, and for a fuller debate. The present Prime Minister, who voted with the Deakin Government against the inclusion of the railway servants within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration 'Bill, has accepted the measure with that and other provisions which were highly objectionable in his eyes, and has sent it on to the Senate, presumably with a desire that it shall become law.. I should like to know what the public will think of a Prime Minister who can so absolutely reverse all that he has formerly done in order to secure office.",17
75,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,This is very funny.,17
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable gentleman has spoken very strongly upon the subject of States rights, but I should like to know where the States rights party is now? They seem to have very easy consciences with regard to States (rights, the inclusion of railway servants within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and, in fact, everything - else in connection with that measure. I would ask honourable members: What is the present position? The Protectionist Party is severed in twain, and this will probably lead to its destruction.",17
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The member has left it.,17
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall deal with that particular question presently. I do not think that we are the seceders, but that the section of the party which is supporting the Government has deserted its principles. As a matter of fact, the right honourable member for Swan had no right whatever, at any time, to claim to belong to the Protectionist Party, because throughout his connection with the Barton and Deakin Ministries he stood by himself, and never was a Protectionist. Turning for a moment to the speech delivered last night by the Minister of Trade and Customs, I venture to think that his remarks were instigated by some other mind, who desired that the split in the Protectionist Party should continue and widen. The Minister dealt with several subjects with each of which I shall' deal separately. .First of all, he was rather indignant because onij honourable member stated that had not been in favour of granting the franchise to women. The Prime Minister was in favour of that reform, but, strange to say, he never passed any measure relating to it. Had he occupied his present position at the commencement of the Commonwealth that law would not now have been placed upon the statute book of the Commonwealth, because my experience of the right honourable gentleman in the New South Wales Legislature leads me to say that had he remained in State politics until today he would never have extended the franchise to the women there. I venture to affirm that if he had had his way the suffrage would never have been extended to the women of Australia. It is a fortunate circumstance that when the first Commonwealth Parliament met, a Government was in power which insisted upon extending the franchise to the women of this continent, despite the opposition, of some honourable members. I have already pointed out the unfair treatment which was meted out to the last Government. Last evening the Minister of Trade and. Customs dealt with the question of old-age pensions, but I do not think that his heart is in his subject. Certain]v the heart of his leader is not in it. When the present Prime Minister was in State politics, and had an opportunity of submitting a Bill relating to that matter to the New South Wales Parliament, he failed to take any action. The question of old-age pensions is one. however, which cannot be - permitted to lie dormant. It honourable must be dealt with by this Parliament in some way or other, in fairness to the continent of Australia. It is all very well to urge that it is a State matter, but it must be recollected that at the present time two of the largest States have old-age pensions schemes in operation, and I think that the Commonwealth should take some further action. My own opinion is that, if we canr not pass a law without first obtaining the consent of the States, then New South Wales and Victoria should allow the money now being disbursed by them for the payment of old-age pensions to be deducted by the Commonwealth from the Customs and Excises revenue instead of being reat turned to them in accordance the financial provisions of the Conprovisions stitution. If they agreed to that arrangecally, ment, we could enact a uniform law for whole of Australia. But unless an energetic move be made, such a consummation will not be reached. I know that it has been held up as a bogy that the money reis quired for the payment of a national scheme of oid-age pensions must be raised by direct be imposed taxation. Well, in New South Wales, and most of the other States, a land tax is already operative. What is the difference between a land tax which is imposed by the States and a land tax which is imposed by the Commonwealth Government ?",17
79,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is there not in duplicating it?,18
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The States might repeal their own land taxation, i was necessary for the Federal Government to raise the money to pay old-age pensions.",18
81,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member is for that. advocating a duplication of the tax.,18
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not. There should be no taxation for the sake of taxation, and there should be no land tax upon small land-owners. Last correct. evening, the Minister of Trade and Cusof toms tried very unfairly to put words into the mouths of several honourable members. I never before heard him treat his subject in such an unjust way. I am not in favour of duplicating land taxation. But the land feated, taxes imposed by the States can be removed by them, if that is to be urged as an jection to a national system of old-age pensions. That is a matter for the States to consider.",18
83,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Suppos e that the States will not repeal their land taxes?,18
84,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The . should be asked to allow the necessary money for the payment of old-age pensions k claims to be deducted from the Customs venue, with a view to avoiding the duplicabeing tion of land taxation, The Minister of Trade and Customs also referred to the althat liance which has been entered into between that wav? the Labour Party and the Liberal Protectionists. He declared that there were only three planks in the platform of that liance, and that the protectionist section it had received no concessions whatever. venture to think that if he will only be and allow his mind to reason in the ordinary way, he will find that the protectionists have secured a great deal. It is not to be supposed. or a moment that they could f once obtain everything which they dewith sired, but I happen to know that the' very to which he referred so graphiin attacking the honourable and the learned member for Indi, are not to be taken advantage of in the way that he suggested. For instance, in respect of the provision that .each member of the alliance to be allowed to vote on the Tariff as to whether a high duty or a low duty shall",18
85,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,O r any duty at all.,18
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No . Members are to be allowed to vote upon the question as to whether a high or a low duty shall be imposed upon specific proposals.,18
87,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What a lot of intriguing a difference there must have been !,18
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is the Prime Minister who has done the intriguing in f it his little room - He must not talk of intriguing. He has attempted bribery, too.",18
89,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have not enough monev,18
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not refer to money. The statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs, in regard to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , was not The arrangement is that all members the alliance shall vote for the taking of that Bill into Committee, and that those who desire the industry to be controlled by the State shall have an opportunity of voting in that way.

107,Mr ISAACS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"And ""anxious"" to do so.",19
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes . Such a Commission would be of no value so long as he occupied the Treasury benches. He atis not prepared to agree to the appointment alof a Commission to deal with urgent matquesters in the Tariff.,19

He merely wishes to play a game of bluff. During the course of his remarks the Minister of Trade and Customs stated that in my election campaign I declared in of this favour of fiscal peace.",19
110,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the honourable member will deny that statement, he will deny anvthing.",19
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"My sta'tement was that I favoured fiscal peace; but when the practical working of the Act shows ? where anomalies exist, then action must be",19
112,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member is reported as having said that he was favourable to fiscal peace during the operation of the Braddon section of the Constitution.,19
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Minister is quite wrong in taking that literally.,19
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The newspapers with the published that statement.,19
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Neve r mind They are which sometimes inspired by the honourable memBut what was the Prime Minister He fighting me for all he was worth. He was travelling through my electorate raising the question of the re-opening of the from the lowest to the highest item,19
116,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Will the honourable member kindly take his seat? There are on the business-paper two notices of motion which seem to me to cover nearly all One the notice of motion by the hono'rabje and learned member for Indi, and the other the notice of motion - which has been partly discussed-by the honourable member for Bourke. Whilst these appear upon the business-paper, I cannot possibly allow the detailed discussion of any matter which relates to either of them. Therefore, while incidental reference may be made to these points, and while I am very anxious to allow the utmost liberty that I can, I must ask honourable members to defer the detailed discussion of any matter which may be included in them, or in any other notice of motion.",19
117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think that I may crave the indulgence of the House in this matter, because I wish to refer to a question upon which I have been attacked. Some references have been made to speeches of mine, and I was dealing with what have been alleged to be quotations from what I said, and with the action of the present Prime Minister during the campaign.",20
118,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have already allowed incidental references of considerable length, and any such as that to which the honourable member for Hume now refers I should certainly allow. I was afraid lest he was beginning to discuss the question in its broader issues, and to do what the Standing Orders absolutely prohibit, namely, anticipate debate on motions, notices of which appear on the business-paper. I admit that it is unfortunate that there should be three or four notices of motion on the paper, which considerably limit the scope of the debate; but I am bound to administer the Standing Orders as they are. I shall not unduly restrict any honourable member, and the honourable member for Hume is perfectly entitled, as is every other honourable member, to reply to any allegations made by previous speakers.",20
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The present Prime Minister, during the elections, was fighting me in my own electorate on the fiscal question, and trying to raise it in every possible way. Amongst the other statements which he made, the right honourable gentleman said that if he could get a majority, he would repeal the present Tariff absolutelv.",20
120,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is not correct; it is near enough though.,20
121,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It was in reply to such statements that I said I was not in favour of re-opening the Tariff. There had been a statement made about the desirability of fiscal peace.,20
122,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,A statement 1 It was the policy of the honourable gentleman's,20
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"But that was only to continue until anomalies-were found in the Tariff. I maintain that it is not ripping, up the whole Tariff to deal with anomalies of so serious a character as those which have been discovered, and which, at the present time, are destroying industries in some parts of Australia, and causing the dismissal of a large number of men.",20
124,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did they only begin to destroy those industries within the last few months ?,20
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Wentworth does not know anything about it, and he ought not to interrupt. I shall not, at this stage, deal further with the Tariff, but I shall probably have occasion to deal with it at another time. The Minister of Trade and Customs went on to question, and, I am sorry to say, to misinterpret remarks made by the honourable member for Darling, on the subject of land resumption. I should like to know whether the honourable gentleman is in favour of land resumption. Last night, at first, he said that he was, and then that he was not. I believe that the same difficulty exists in all the States, but I know New South Wales better than any of the other States, and I say that the only thing which will tend to relieve the congestion of population in the cities and distribute it over the country is land resumption. With that object, I believe that it is necessary to resume a portion of the alienated lands in New South Wales.",20
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What can we do in that matter?,20
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The matter has been referred to in connection with Socialism. In my own electorate, there are some twelve large stations. I do not in any way blame those who have secured them, nor would I take their land from them without paying more - than its value; but I say that, in the interests of the people of Australia, there must be considerable resumptions in all the-States. The Minister of Trade and Customs last night said that he was in favour of land resumption, and the division and sale of the lands resumed. I wish to know of what use it will be to resume land and then sell it with a title and conditions which will not prevent its beingagain included in large holdings.",20
128,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What would the honourable gentleman do with it ? Would he make leader. the State the landlord ?,20
129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I should give a title to it, but I should impose such conditions that it could never go back into holdings again.",21
130,Mr REID,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There could be no objection to that at all.,21
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There is no reason why we should sell the land outright again after resuming it, when we might get a rent from it sufficient to pay interest on borrowed money, and thus obviate any incubus upon the taxpayer resulting from the resumption. The question is one of very great importance, but I should not advocate the resumption of any land if it were to be sold again under conditions which would permit of its reverting to large holdings such as we have at the present time. We have the Legislatures of some of the States telling the people that there is any quantity of land open for selection; but the land referred to is very often but arid plains, and it is a criminal thing to send men with wives and families on to such land, without giving tham an area sumcient to live upon, because it means giving them over to ruin, starvation, and death. The land resumption question is of the first importance, and there can be no doubt that a great portion of alienated land, in districts blessed with a good rainfall and fit for cultivation, will have to be resumed, and converted from sheep-walks into agricultural farms of sufficient area to keep a family. According to the statements of the Minister of Trade and Customs last night, the land when resumed should be sold to farmers, and if that course is pursued we mav rest assured that it will again go back into large estates.",21
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable gentleman did not say that it should be sold without conditions of improvement.,21
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Of what use are conditions of improvement as a means of preventing the land going back into large estates?,21
134,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have helped to subdivide a great many estates, and in no solitary instance has any subdivided block since been included in a large estate.",21
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not prepared to contradict the honourable gentleman with respect to a matter affecting his own district. But I know what has happened in New South Wales. I know that men, who first of all took up land along the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers^ sold nearly the - whole of their selections, and today are to be found at Coonamble, Walgett, and on the Namoi, with areas of from 10,000 to large 20,000 acres, whilst the land which they took up first has gone back to the large owners. Mr 'WATSON - That has happened in tens of thousands of instances.",21
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It has happened in thousands of instances.,21
137,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Not where the full value of the land has been paid for under closer settlement conditions.,21
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am in favour of land resumption by the Government, because the Government is in a better position than are private individuals to offer good terms to intending settlers. To cut land up and charge a big price to a man desiring to obtain it, is but to put a millstone round his neck, which will keep him in poverty for ever. The Government could charge a small deposit and rent, and give a long lease, perhaps of ninety-nine years, or sell with certain restrictions, and settlers taking up land under those conditions could hope to live happily on it. This is why I am in favour of land resumption by the Government, instead of the cutting up of land by private syndicates, as has been done recently on the Richmond River. The honourable member for Richmond knows that it would be better for the people who have gone into dairy farming on the three large estates recently subdivided on the Richmond River, if the Government had resumed the land, and had then dealt with settlers. I am connecting this question with the question of Socialism. I am aware that honourable members sitting in this cor-_ ner are favourable to the resumption of land by the States. I have in my own electorate twelve or fourteen estates, containing something like 1,000,000 acres of as good land as may be found anywhere for agricultural purposes, and some of which might very well be resumed. When honourable members opposite accuse the Labour Party of Socialism, I ask them to say whether this proposal for land resumption is not Socialism in its purest and most simple form.",21
139,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There is not a trace of Socialism in it ; it is a purelv business matter.,21
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is there any Socialism in the Government holding the railways of the country?,21
141,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No .,21
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,O r in the Government owning and controlling the tramI ways of the country ?,22
143,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No .,22
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall show the honourable gentleman that there is. The tramways in the city of Melbourne and at the present time. suburbs are owned and controlled by a private company. The tramway system in Sydney, I am glad to say, is owned and controlled by the Government, and in that city the public can travel thirds of the fare charged on the tramways in the city and suburbs of Melbourne. Honourable orable members opposite will say that there time? is no Socialism in this matter, though the whole of the people secure the benefit a fare decreased by one-third, the differmany ence, in the case of the Melbourne tramway system, going to the shareholders' profit. That shows the difference between the two systems. Honourable members can find loop-hole by which to escape from that comtrol. parison.",22
145,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable gentleman that? is making a mistake.,22
146,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I am making so. no mistake. The honourable and learned member knows that by buying tickets he can go from here to Spencer-street for i whilst he can go from Circular Quay to the Redfern Railway Station for id. on the Sydney system.,22
147,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Twic e as far - for Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - It is nearly twice as far. The same difference throughout the tram system.,22
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The city of Melever. bourne will get the tramways back free. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes , when they are worn out. I say, further, that the Melbourne tram system is not to be compared with the electric system ney. I am sorry that the Minister of Trade and Customs is leaving the Chamkind ber. It is evident that he does not like I am saying on the subject of Socialism. All these proposals to which I have recialism ferred are forms of Socialism, and I am in favour of the application of the prinbution ciple in every case where it can be reaterday sonably and justly applied. I think that it is very much better, in the interests the people of Australia, that the railways and tramways should be in the hands of the State. ' Mr FULLER - Was not the honourable ings. gentleman in favour of. selling the Sydneytramways?",22
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I was, before cut my political eye-teeth. The honourable and learned member has perhaps not cut his yet.",22
150,Mr FULLER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It does not suit the honourable gentleman to cut certain of 'his teeth,22
151,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I honestly confess that when I first entered Parliament, I was in favour of selling the tramways. I had had no experience then of the adminisfor twotration of Government.",22
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Was not the hongentleman Minister of Works at the,22
153,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"No , I was not. of I have had considerable experience during years since. I have tried to consider the matter reasonably, and my conclusion is that in certain matters, though not in everything, it is better in the interests of the no people for the Government to have con",22
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Do we not all say,22
155,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not think I do not think that the right honourable member for Swan, the honourable member for Gippsland, or the Conservative honourable i d . , member for Kooyong say that. If they do say that, I should like to understand why they speak against such State Socialism as I have described. Applications by farmers assistance for roads and bridges, and subsidies for their various industries, are extends but forms of Socialism.",22
156,Mr SKENE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There is no analogy what,22
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What would the honourable member call such assistance?,22
158,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What benefits the farmers benefits the whole community, because the of Sydfarmers are producers.",22
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Matter s of the I have referred to benefit the whole what community also. Honourable members need not be afraid that I am in favour of the Soas applied to the unit, or in favour of anything in the direction of the redistriof wealth. I may say that I was yestold by a lady that the Labour Party is in favour of the redistribution of wealth of once or twice a year; and honourable memsbers will probably recollect that a statement to the same effect was recently made by a speaker at one of the Womens' League meet",22
160,Mr KENNEDYJ,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable gentleman and I would get'a little then.,22
161,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"No , we should not. I remember that at one time, years ago, there was some talk of Socialism in Sydney, and a member of the State Parliament, named Eckford. at the time was very much in favour of the redistribution of wealth. He had £1,000, and when some one told him that a careful calculation showed that his share would be about £ 6 9 , he said, "" No more redistribution for me."" That would be the feeling in my case. With Socialism, as affecting the individual, I am not in accord; but I am in favour of the application of the principle to matters affecting community generally. I wish to know what honourable members object to in the seven items which appear in this Federal labour programme, about which so much has been said. Does any one object to the maintenance of a White Australia?",23
162,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes ; the honourable and learned member for Parkes.,23
163,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And the honourable member for Robertson.,23
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does any one object to compulsory arbitration?,23
165,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes ; all the wreckers of .the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.,23
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does any one object to old-age pensions?,23
167,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes ; all on the other side of the Chamber. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - Does any one object to a volunteer defence force, or to the restriction of public borrowing? know that the right honourable member for Swan objects to any stringent alteration of the navigation laws; but the majority of honourable members, and the country, are in favour of navigation legislation. Let me add another word about Socialism. Suppose that the immense American Morgan trust, which bought up so many steam-ship lines, had purchased all the steamers trading to Australia, and had raised freights to the injury of the producers and others in this Continent, would honourable members have said that the Government was not justified in stepping in and running a line of steamers with a view to destroying the trust, or of bringing down freights ?",23
168,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That trust destroyed itself.,23
169,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Would the Government also be justified in establishing a tobacco factory?,23
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am glad to believe that there is one honourable memtheir ber on the Government side of the House who appreciates something like reason. was going to refer to the tobacco monopoly. Personally, Ido not know enough about the workings of that monopoly to give an opinion on the subject; but I know that behind it is one of the largest financial ""rings"" in the world, and that it has spread its octopus-like grasp all over this Continent, so that now it controls the whole of the tobacco trade of Australia. I am informed that there are only three tobacconists' shops in Melbourne where one can buy certain brands of tobacco and cigars, and that the public have to pay nearly twice as much for tobacco now as had to be paid the before the trust was formed.",23
171,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,-Nonsense .,23
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,A letter of denial is published this morningwhich is really no denial at all.,23
173,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,A meeting of retailers was held in Sydney which unanimously protested against statements such as that which the Honourable member is now repeating.,23
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The writer of the letetr to which I refer admits that the tobacconists have raised their prices, and he says that they did so because formerly they were selling too cheaply. That is not a satisfactory reason to give, and, no doubt, if a Royal Commission is appointed, it will be proved that there is a great deal of truth in the statements which I am making. If the tobacco monopoly is injurious to the people of Australia, action should be taken I by the Government, either by the introduction of an anti-trust Bill or by the Government taking control. I am not prepared to say what step should be taken, but it would certainly be a proper, right, and just thing for the Government to consider the matter.",23
175,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member also advocate the establishment of Government .breweries?,23
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have given one or two instances in which I think the nationalization of monopolies should not be objected to. If it were proposed to proceed to extremes, and to introduce individualistic Socialism or anarchism, I am not there.",23
177,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What is the honourable member trving to prove ?,23
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am proving that those who have railed so much against the Labour Party, because of what they call socialistic principles, forget what the word means in its true sense, and do not I know what they are talking about.",23
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No one objects to the honourable member joining the Labour Partv. if he wishes to do so.,24
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable member knows I have not done that. I wish, in this connection, to read a word or two from a lecture delivered in Sydney the other day by the Anglican Bishop of Hobart, who, referring to the socialistic movement which is now taking place all over the world, saidHe wanted to warn the Anglican Church in Australia as to what . . . might happen in the future if they gave another instance of absolute indifference to a huge social movement, and not merely indifference, but positively putting their weight wholly on the other scale. There was something here before them which demanded their most caref u l scrutiny, and their most Christ-like sympathy. He did not dispute that there was much in the movement that was exaggerated and wild, and that many of its proposals were dreadful, but, nevertheless, the movement was in evidence in every civilized nation of the world, which surely should convince them that there were forces deep down in it, that it was not superficial, or a mere stir on the surface of the water, but that there was a great mass of sentiment and hopefulness behind the movement. He went on to say that the subject had so far entered the hearts of a large number of people, that in an English town the Socialistic Party had founded what they called Labour churches, as a substitute for the Church of Jesus Christ, because they thought the latter had no place for them, and gave them the cold shoulder. He continuedA l l who bore the name of Christian should study social problems sympathetically in the light and in the spirit of the incarnation, and help to realise the ideal city in the world, as it was. Then he added thatHe had had eight years' experience in the slums of London, and if any man realized the enormous amount of suffering and degradation there was among members of the human race at the present time, if he had any sympathy at all with the Saviour of mankind when he looked on the multitude in the wilderness, he must have compassion on them; and he believed that there was at the heart of the socialistic movement of the present day genuine compassion for the multitude, and a determination to raise the standard of life for the submerged mass of the race. I wish to emphasize, before passing away from the subject, the statement that where monopolies are injurious to the public, and State interference would do great good, shall be on the side of humanity.",24
181,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why does not the honorSouth able member sign 'the platform of the Labour Party?,24
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member should sign something which will give him a little common-sense.,24
183,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No doubt he is waiting for the honourable member for Hume to draw it up.,24
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I hope that we shall not hear too much about the socialistic principles of the Labour Party, because honourable members opposite are trying to gull the public by clouding the real issue which, as it is put in one of the three manifestoes published by the Prime Minister, is an' attack on labour. Now that honourable members opposite iind that that cry is not very popular, they are trying to represent it as an attack upon Socialism j but any one who reads between the lines of the right honourable gentleman's manifestoes, will see that it is an attack upon labour that is intended.",24
185,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What are the exact words to which the honourable member refers?,24
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The manifesto is rather long, and I have not marked the exact passage which. I have in my mind; but the honourable member can read it for himself. The present fight is one between conservatism and liberalism, and I think that the alliance between the Liberal Protectionists and the Labour Party, on the honest and straightforward lines which have been published, which do not embrace any objectionable form of Socialism, will be a great step in the direction of liberalism. I venture to say that the alliance will form the nucleus of a Liberal Party, which will oppose the conservative element I see on my left supporting the Government.",24
187,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What about the exemptions under a and b ?,24
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"At any rate, we have no conservative A's and B's. The Prime Minister said in one of his manifestoesWe thoroughly believe in progress, a fearless forward policy; but not on roads leading to Socialism and insane extremes.",24
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is exactly what the honourable member savs his views are.,24
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes ; but I should like to know what item of progressive legislation the right honourable gentleman has placed on the statute-book. If he goes back through his history he will I not be able to point to one - Although for five years he promised the people of New Wales liberal legislation, all he did of importance was to impose a land tax and to take off Customs duties.",24
191,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He also passed an Alien Immigration Restriction Act.,25
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He adopted the Natal Act.,25
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The member is speaking wide of the mark, and he knows it.",25
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not. The honourable member for Parramatta cannot point to any real, progressive legislation which has been placed on the statute-book by the Prime Minister. Whenever progresther sive and humane legislation w-as proposed in the Parliament of New South Wales right honourable 'gentleman fought to prevent it from becoming law. That is his public history. Let me now read he. put at the tail of his manifesto. deals with Western Australia and Tasmania - in a postscript. After writing his address, it. he remembered that he had nof referred to them, and tlTere'fore he adds the following postscript:I wish to add a postscript, addressed to of Tasmania and Western Australia.

I hope you will, as long as this state of things continues, accept as the representative of both States in the ment, and I offer my services in that capacity all the representatives of the two States, irrespecthe party should be called. tive of party differences. He had the impudence to write a postscript casting a slur upon the two States menwho tioned in it, and to say that he will reprecorner sent those States. So far as Western Austhe tralia is concerned, the only representative of that State who supports the Government is the right honorabie member for Swan.",25
195,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Tasmania , at any rate, is pretty well represented just by the honourable member for Wilmot.",25
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I think that that Partv ? is very doubtful. Some of the representatives V>f Tasmania support the Governhave ment, and surely they do not require assistance of the right honourable gentleman. I regret very much that the proceedings the protectionist caucus were divulged last whole of the facts. night. Secondly, I regret that the honourable member for Bendigo misunderstood what said last night. What was in my mind that at the caucus meeting of the Protecthat tionist Party he was the only member moved any motion in connection with the extension of the fiscal truce.",25
197,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I did not move motion.,25

213,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Free-trade Association in Melbourne is not a very strong organization.,26
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I also find that the manufacturers have enrolled themselves as an Employers' Union, and that they are bent upon destroying protection. Some of them have obtained all the protection they want, and do not seem to think very much about any one else. What is now taking place is enough to make one gravely suspicious of and distrust human nature. Men who have professed to be the staunchest protectionists are now doing their best to injure the cause.",26
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The member is now turning upon the men who supported him throughout his political life.,26
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If my strongest supporter turns traitor I shall say what I think of him. What are the importers doing in Svdney? Whilst the Protectionist Party is being strangled they are displaying the utmost activity. I find that a deputation, representing the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, recently waited upon the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, and asked tfhem to increase jthe freights upon iron and coal between Eskbank and Svdney, with a view to giving the importers a chance to still further injure the great industry, which an attempt has been made to at the former place. I am glad to say that Mr Oliver, the Chief Railways Commissioner, said that the Commissioners were not prepared to do anything to cripple the Eskbank industry. He stated, further, that so long as assistance could be rendered to an important industry, with due regard to the interests of other people, such assistance would be forthcoming. As soon as the importers found that a free-trade leader The mem- was in power, they endeavoured to excite the sympathy of the State Government. The present Government in New South Wales is really the old Free-trade Party revived, Whilst the and no doubt the Chamber of Commerce believed that the Prime Minister would have great influence with it.",26
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"On e of the orga-. nizers of that deputation is a great protectionist friendof the honourable member's. The honourable gentleman says that it is a free-trade movement, and I contend that it nois nothing of the kind.",26
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The report states that a deputation from the Chamber of Commerce, representing Sydney' importers, waited upon the Railway Commissioners to protest against the preference given to the Eskbank Iron Works, Lithgow, in the matter of railway rates.",26
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Does the Sydney Chamber of Commerce represent only, the importers ?",26
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes . It represents the Sydney importers.,26
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What about the honourable gentleman's friend, the Hon. A. W. Meeks, who is one of the pillars of the protectionist partu in New South Wales ?",26
222,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Is it to be supposed that one member can govern the whole of the Chamber of Commerce in Sydhonorable ney ?,26
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There are scores of other members who are protectionists.,26
224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"At present the importers are active everywhere in endeavouring to secure alterations in the law and its administration, which will give them advantages in connection with their business.",26
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The movement to which the honourable gentleman has referred is not a fiscal matter, and he knows it.",26
226,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"A great deal has been said against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , on the ground that it will do great injury to many industries, by imposing undesirable restrictions upon the operations of employers. We find by the establish reports in the newspapers that recently the unionists in England expressed themselves as unfavorable to the introduction of compulsory arbitration laws, because such legislation would put an end to strikes. Our object should be to pass any measure which will have the effect of putting an end to strikes, and all their attendant troubles. The unionists of Great Britain believe that strikes afford them the best means of redressing their grievances; but we believeI hope I am right in saying that we all believe-that it is better to prevent strikes, possible, and, therefore, if a good Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would have that effect, we should pass it without any hesitation. We should do everything we can to prevent a repetition of the shearers' and maritime strikes of a few years ago, which inflicted such injury upon the community.",26
227,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Would the honourable member vote in favour of including the agricultural industry within the scope of the measure?,27
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I voted against that proposal, and I have not been in favour of it.",27
229,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Would the honourable gentleman vote for it, now that he is allied with the Labour Partv ?",27
230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"- I am not allied with the Labour Party, except so far as is indicated by the published terms of the alliance which has been made public. The honourable member for Corangamite has been opposed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill from the outset, and yet he is now supporting a Government which is doing its best to pass the measure.",27
231,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am in favour of a Bill which would provide for conciliation and arbitration in connection with the shipping, shearing, and mining industries only.",27
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I desire to say a few words with reference to the attack made upon me by the Prime Minister in connection with the report of the Committee of Public Accounts in New South Wales. The attack of the right honourable gentleman was directed ostensibly to the honourable and learned member for Corio; but was really aimed at me.,27
233,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and learned member for Corio, had another barrel loaded to fire off at the honourable gentleman.",27
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have had a good many barrels fired off at me, but-I have always come up smiling. In the first place, it was stated that I had ' appointed the Committee referred O0 to. Technically, I did so; but Mr. G. R. French, and Mr T. A. Dibbs were nominated by the Prime Minister, across the table of the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales. The right honourable gentleman was attacking me in connection with myfinancialstatement, and said, ""Why do not you appoint a Commission-wh y do you not appoint such men as Mr Russell French and Mr Thomas Dibbs?"" I said, "" I will appoint them both."" The right if honourable gentleman was about to suggest another name, when I interrupted him, and said that I thought it was only right that I should have a chance to appoint one member of the Committee. I selected Mr Yarwood, one of the ablest accountants in New South Wales.",27
235,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Ha d not Mr Dibbs already expressed an opinion adverse to the right honourable member?,27
236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not aware that he did so; but that does not affect the question. All the gentlemen who have been named stand so high in public estimation, and hold such high positions, that even if they had expressed opinions previously, I should have been perfectly satisfied with their decision after they had heardall the evidence.",27
237,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Mr Yarwood's appointment thoroughly suited the honourable member.,27
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I did not know Mr Yarwood, until I asked him if he would act upon the Committee. I had only obtained reliable information as to his capacity. I wish to show honourable members how this Committee originated. The origin of this Commission - was mainly an attack made by the strongest supporter of the right honourable gentleman in the Parliament of New South Wales.",27
239,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,AVh o was that?,27
240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall give his name when I have quoted his utterance upon this subject. He saidNow, I come to an examination of the public accounts, and I think it only fair to the Colonial Treasurer that I should at once formulate my charges which, before I sit down, I shall prove right up to the hilt. I will not attempt to use any unnecessary rhetoric. I will not take any figures from outside sources that cannot be depended upon. I will take my figures entirely from the quarterly Gazettes published in this country and from information supplied by the Treasury. I have taken the pains to go back from the present time to the beginning of 1SS9, and I have 'caref u l ly collated my facts, and I will stand or f all on them. I charge the Colonial Treasurer, in the first place, that during the whole period of his financial administration he has consistently and persistently misrepresented the real state of the* public accounts of this country. I charge in the second place, that he has consistently and persistently misrepresented and maligned predecessors, and tried to put upon others deal of the matter arising out tration. I charge him, in the third place, with having deceived this House in passing a Treasury Bills Bill , which, if it had known the facts of the case, which can only now in the retrospect, it would haveibeen recreant to every sense of honour and public had allowed that Bill to become law. And I further charge the honourable member, that when that Bill was going through the House, and when ^737.532it was necessary, after remarks a certain position, in order to secure his own position, he absolutely misled the House by statewe ments in order to carry that Bill into law.",27

At that stage the present Prime Minister ing interjectedThe amount which has not been expended is not worthy of notice in comparison with the total amount. That statement was made twelve months subsequent after the Bill had been passed. Later on, Mr MCMillan said It is a very serious charge against the Treasurer to tell a member of this House, when the speech of Mr MCMillan. he brings in a Bill covering Treasury Bills amount of ^1,174,000, that the whole amount was practically expended, because if there is any meaning in words, that is what it meant, and, at the same time, ,£426,000 had not been pended by the end of the year.

I found that Mr. MCMillan had understated the position. The report of the Finance Committee proves that it was understated, and that instead of ' £426,000 being unexpended, there was no less a sum than £550,000 unexpended.

249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I say that the expenditure to which the honourable member refers was incurred in despatching contingents to South Africa.,29
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Government of which the honourable member was the head appropriated millions of pounds worth of trust fund's after that.,29

I have all the particulars at my command. Upon a critical division one member of New South Wales Parliament who came into contact with the Prime Minister, was then Premier of that State, changed his attitude towards the Government stained from voting against it. covered some months afterwards that he had been paid the sum of £ 3 5 0 , and I have not the slightest doubt that that payment was responsible for his altered political attitude.",29
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,For what was that amount paid? Will the honourable member be good enough to tell the House?,29
258,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes . When a certain Member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales was about to visit England, the Premier was asked by the Chairman of a Select Committee, which had been inquiring into some matter- I think it was the desirableness or otherwise of establishing a system of old-age pensionswhether that member would be paid by the Government. In reply, the present Prime Minister statedI do not'know if I can be interrogated by the honourable member as Chairman of a Select Committee of the House.

276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And the honourable gentleman has given a complete misrepreParty sentation of the matter now.,30
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I desire simply to add that, so far as the members of Labour Party are concerned, they know as well as I do that the alliance on this side is open and above-board. There is nothing of a socialistic character of which I disapprove in that alliance. ' They are aware that I go a very gieat way in support of State Socialism, in the prevention of monopolies, and in support of all that is humane, and in the interests of the flesh and blood of the community. I do not approveof trading in the flesh and blood of the country. I believe that we are bound to stand by the weaker portion of the community, whilst the strong can stand by themselves. There is, to my mind, a very great deal underlying the statement recently made by the Bishop-of Hobart. If others of the church would pay more attention to work for the benefit of humanity, it would be better. honourable It is the absence of effort in that direction not which has really created the Salvation Army.

Also, they do not like to see a political party cut in two, and severed in so, such a way by graspers for office that if may never be joined together again. The free-trade engineers on the other side have been successful in cutting the Protectionist in two. They are using every endeavour, and will lose no opportunity to still further divide the party and advance their the own cause. I should like to know what position a party can hope to be in if it does not stand solidly to its guns all the time in opposition to the solid battery on the other side. Members of the Protectionist Party who are now to be found on the other side are not standing to their guns. If they are not careful they will find, when they go before the electors, that the party has been so cut in two that it will have little chance against the strong phalanx of those opposed to it. I do not know whether my hope will be realized, but I do hope that better counsels will in future prevail, and that a time will come, and that before long, when a truly Liberal Party, which should embrace two-thirds of the members of this House, will <be found voting in the interests of the people of Australia for protection, which is the only policy by which we can insure that a proper labour wage shall be paid.",30
281,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF," It has been stated that in a debate of this description every honourable member is entitled to speak his mind. I take it that every honourable member is entitled to speak his mind on all occasions in Parliament, and to speak it in that euphonious, gentle, and courteous English which we have heard from the honourable member for Hume. I understand that in this debate I am permitted to go this far, and no further: I am permitted to charge those opposed to me with corruption and with bribing their friends to vote in a certain way. I hope that the honourable member for Hume will not' leave* the chamber for a moment, as I have a word, or two to say to him.",31
282,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I do not pay the slightest attention to what the honourable member says.,31
283,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I believe that the honHe orable gentleman will find it advisable pay some attention to what I shall' say. fore I have done with him. It is well understood that what we say in public life, or within the walls of this Chamber, has bearing upon any man's private character, ment. and that anything we say here is said purely the honourable member for Hume. in a political sense. Though we might something which would not redound to the private character of our political antagonists, we should not be entitled to make use cidents connected with their private life any political purposes. The appeal which struction. the honourable member for Hume makes to the House, and to the country, is primarily that. an appeal in defence of protection. The honourable member is the great protectionist - the man who stands before the people of South Wales? New South Wales as the incarnation great exemplar of protection. Let me tell the honourable gentleman, or let his friends tell him for me, as he did not see fit to remain, that the man who has ruined protection in New South Wales is the honourable member for Hume. I am sorry to have to say this kind of thing in the absence of the honourable gentleman; but it is not my fault that he is not present. Protection in New ""South Wales had a case which it did not possess in any of the other States. The potentialities of all the States were great, and undoubtedly the capacity of the people to make good use of them was considerable; but the position in New South Wales differed materially from that in the other States, inasmuch as she possessed the motive power for industry-sh e had the coal. On that account there was in no other State anything like the opportunity for establishing a protectionist policy that there was in the mother State. We had got together a very considerable, a fairly representative, and a tolerably intelligent Protectionist Party, when the honourable member for Hume joined us. It was like making ensilage. The Protectionist Partv in New South Wales had got together a splendid heap of men, capable of stating their case intelligently and reasonably, and with a good case to state, when the honourable member for Hume crawled on to the top of the heap. As honourable members are aware, in making ensilage, as soon as you have a sufficiently large heap, you parbuckle, by means of bullocks, a heavy log on to the top of the stack. There was no need to parbuckle the honourable member for Hume on to the protectionist stack in New South Wales; he climbed there. got on top of the heap, and, to the deto struction of protection in that State, he has besat there ever since until the party has sunk so low that at the present time there are only four representatives of protection in no the mother State in the Federal ParliaThe others have been destroyed by The know honourable members for Eden-Monaro, Riverina, and myself, are amongst the four, and every one of us knows that every time of in the honourable member for Hume touches the for question of protection he does so to its de",31
284,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I do not subscribe to,31
285,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I ask the honourable member where is the Protectionist Party of New When Kuropatkin falls and back upon Mukden with half an army, what is it that they want to know ? It is useless for him to say that his guns were not good enough, or that his soldiers were not fit to fight-the general must accept the responsibility of failure.",31

287,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Where is the ProtectionistParty of New South Wales today? Where are the men who have been identified with the honourable member for Hume for the last few years, and who have really carried the honourable gentleman, put up with him, and tolerated him until now, when he has made a blind bolt for Socialism, and when they have to tell him that they must leave him? Where are those men now-Where are the men like Beale, - Sandford, and others-the bulwarks of the Protectionist Party in New South Wales, who did all they possibly could for protection? Their position has been destroyed by the honourable member for Hume. I have no desire to be unfair or unjust to the honourable gentleman, and I therefore speak of him temperately and reasonably, _ when ^ I might make an indictment against him which would be very serious.",32
288,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,On e which the honourable member'would regret.,32
289,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I understand that certain things may be said, and that certain other things should not be said. I shall say no more about the honourable member for Hume at this stage, because I understand the honourable gentleman is shortly leaving the country. It will probably be news for honourable members to hear that they may not see the honourable gentleman in t'his House for very much longer. I have heard that the Japanese are experiencing a very great deal of trouble in taking Port Arthur. guns have made but very little impression upon it, and it is hoped that if the honourable member for Hume can be induced to sit on the top of Port Arthur, he will smash it as effectually as 'he has smashed everything he has so far had to deal with. In his absence, I must be fair to the honourable gentleman's political failings.",32
290,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is something new for the honourable gentleman.,32
291,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is something new for me? Honourable gentlemen opposite do not understand me, because I have a capacity for forgiving them. I do not propose to deal with the alleged corruption by the present Prime Minister, the statement about his having given a bribe to secure a vote. I thought that I should get from the speech of the honourable member for Hume something to which I might reply, but I find that there was absolutely nothing. I took notes of the honourable gentleman's speech, but he said only three things to which a not go reply may be made. It appears that the honourable gentleman is much in favour of electric tramways, but the most violent opponent of electric tramways in New South Wales was the honourable member for Hume. That is point number one; but it does not matter very much. Then the honourable gentleman tells us that he believes in Socialism, but he was himself the most persistent advocate of the sale of the tramways in New South Wales. Again, the honourable gentleman believes in the State purchasing estates for the purpose of closer settlement. I have been .to some extent identified with the purchase of estates for closer settlement on the Richmond River, which has resulted in great good to the district. Before dealing with this matter, I thought that it was the right thing to do to ask the State-and the honourable member for Hume was leader of the State Government at the time-to take up the question. The honourable gentleman's Government said that they would not purchase the estates. This can be borne out by reference to the late Under Secretary for Lands in New South Wales. So on the three minor points to which the honourable gentleman made reference it is clear that he made no remark that is worthy of consideration. *",32
292,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member knows that the State Government had not the legal power to resume those estates at the time he asked them to do so.,32
293,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We have not the legal Their power to do anything if we do not desire to do it. I desire to address a few words to honourable members with regard to the position of protectionists. The charge against many honourable members on this side today is that, being protectionists, we have no right to be here. It is not for me to make clear the attitude of the free-trader. It is not necessary for me to make any special reference to the attitude of the Socialistic Party opposite. It is necessary for me at this stage only to point out why, being a protectionist, I find mvself here today. First of all, the protectionists did not sink the fiscal issue-it was the people who sank it. When this Parliament was elected, as I stated once before, Federal politicians were, like Gaul, "" divided into three parts,"" equal in numbers, although not equal in intelligence. The Protectionist Party was, of course, the most intelligent party. I am sure that protectionist members opposite will still permit me to make that statement. The protectionists numbered twenty-five, and who but a madman would, with such a following, have made a fight in a House of seventy-five. The Prime Minister, with a similar following, recognised that it was impossible to continue the free-trade fight, and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat saw that the protectionist fight could not be successful.",32
294,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It was not impossible to continue the fight.,33
295,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It was impossible to win. What is the use of fighting when nothing but blows are gained? What we desire to secure a fiscal policy which will be of advantage to the interests of Australia; but' under the circumstances it was useless to go on fighting. Still, we remain in postection. ' session of that policy, and, that being what possible abandonment of protection has there been? It was not office that we were seeking; it was the establishment protection, and we have maintained that policy. Only one-eighth of the representaabove the earth. tion of New South Wales in this Parliament is protectionist. The six senators from that State are free-traders, and only four out of the twenty-six representatives which it„sen.ds to this House are protectionPerth ists. Biit we still retain our protectionist policy, and, under the circumstances, what more could any one who had as much sense as an opossum ask for? Going a step furablest ther, I ask, who is in charge of the toms Department at the present moment? ber. Honourable members heard him speak night-a n adroit, young, romantic, able, and intelligent protectionist. And who in charge of the Treasury ? A protectionist, the right honourable member for Balaclava; whose figures the present Prime Minister, even when opposed to him, never questioned; a man who when he says that a thing is true is believed all over Australia. The proconstituents tectionists were elected to support those men, under the leadership of the orable and learned member for Ballarat, a gentleman of whom I do not like to say in his presence what I think. He has endeared himself to us all by his prifor vate character, while his oratory is thing to be emulated by the growing ration, and his self-denial absolutely lyzes politicians of the type of the honourable member for Hume. We are now asked abandon these men, who are the only hope 8L of protectionists throughout Australia, and to follow men who caused the Labour or the Socialistic Party to hold their political nostrils while dealing with them in negotiation. The reason that the honourable member for Hume gives for being in the camp of the Opposition is that it is a protectionist camp. Let us examine that statement. There is no excuse for the small selvage of the Protectionist Party being in Opposition unless they are with protectionists. But has any one of its members ever said that the Labour or Socialistic Party, as its members glory to call themselves, is a Protectionist Party? No. What, then, is the excuse of the honourable member for Hume, and the honourable and learned members for Indi is and Darling Downs? What are the facts with regard to the fiscal views of the Socialistic or Labour Party ? They have an ideal which they place above fr.ee-trade or proThey believe that Socialism is so, identified with the good' of the human family, and' they scorn the idea of being swayed by the doctrines of free-trade or protection. of They say that the socialistic policy is as high above the fiscal policy as the'sky is Therefore, the honourable member .for Hume and others are endeavouring to lead the protectionists, not into a protectionist alliance, but into a socialistic alliance - The honourable members for and Canobolas, and the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, who are members of the Socialistic Party, are. free-traders who have made some of thespeeches in defence of free-tradeCuswhich have been heard in this ChamThe adroitness and more thanlast wisdom of their party is shown in this, that its policy allows 'its memis bers to talk free-trade on the wharves of Sydney, and protection in the streets of Melbourne. It eliminates fiscalism, and welds together those of different fiscal faiths. At the last elections the members of the Labour Party promised their free-trade that they would not have anything to do with protection. Tfiey said that honthey were not a protectionist party.",33
296,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is not correct.,33
297,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member knows that hundreds of free-traders voted him, while the honourable and learned somemember for West Sydney delivered to his geneconstituents on the wharves at Sydney paraspeeches which were even more free-trade, if possible, than those of the Prime Ministo ter. The Labour Party promised their free-trade supporters that they would"" not become a protectionist party, and if they do so now they will break their promises. Honourable members know that those are the facts. I find no fault with the man who is a Socialist, if he believes in the doctrine of Socialism; but the honourable member for Hume and the honourable and learned members for Indi and Darling Downs shoulB make it clear'that they are endeavouring to lead the protectionists into a socialistic, and not into a protectionist, alliance. It is unnecessary to dwell on the point that the Labour Party are-a socialistic party, Every member of that party in the Senate has proclaimed himself to be a Socialist, and I believe that every member of the party here claims to be one. The honourable member for Hume has characteristically proclaimed himself today as at the same time a Socialist and an antiSocialist. The platform of the Labour or Socialistic Party has been described as 25 per cent, practical politics and 75 per cent, bird lime, and plank No. 4 provides for"" the nationalization of monopolies. Let the protectionists who have allied themselves with the Labour Party listen while I endeavour to show what will be the effect of a caucus on a party which has no fiscal principles. As honourable members know, the greatest of all monopolies is the land monopoly. No political economist who writes on the subject fails to point out that the origin of wealth and of existence is in the land, and that land is essential to production. Therefore, land nationalization - or confiscation is one of the first objects of the Socialist. The Prime Minister when Premier of New South Wales knew what the views of the Labour Party were on this subject, and as he was anxious to obtain revenue from the taxation of land, he agreed with them for their support to a land tax in consideration of the removal of Customs duties. That proposal was made to and accepted by the members of a party concerning whom it is now claimed by some that they have protection bubbling out of them as oatmeal bubbles out of a Scotchman when his skin is cut. This party was approached by the Premier of New South Wales, who asked, "" W i ll you vote to destroy the protected industries if I give you a land tax of one penny in the pound?""",33
298,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Althoug h the Prime Minrier, ister was then so eager to destroy proand tection, the honourable member is now lowing him. Mr Ewing.",34
299,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable gentleman never claimed to be a protectionist. If my antagonist comes out into the open I am prepared to fight him. I am ready to break in an untrained colt, but I object to be kicked by the family mule. The right honourable gentleman went to the Labour Party-this great Protectionist Party-and , in response to his offer, they said that they were prepared to destroy every industry in New South Wales for the sake of a land tax of one penny in the pound. Land nationalization hung in one scale, whilst the industries of the country were on the other side of the balance. Members of the Labour Party wanted to secure a land tax, which they regarded as the thin end of the wedge of land nationalization. The honourable member for Darling and the honourable member for Yarra shout at the top of their mellifluous voices the moment that a land tax is mentioned. Land nationalization is one of their principles, but protection is not. I ask the honourable member for Bourke and the honourable and learned member.for Darling Downs to look ai the platform of the Labour Party. I want to know the reason why those honourable members left the Protectionist Party. The Labour Party declare themselves not to be protectionists, and there is not one word of protection in their platform. Yet the honourable members to whom I have referred have joined them. *",34
300,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,-Has not the honourable gentleman joined another party?,34
301,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member knows full well that if he had stayed with me he would have felt more comfortable now. If I had to leave political life tomorrow, I would sooner go out in the company of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat than stay for ever with the honourable member for Bourke: And how can man die better, Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers And the temples of his gods ? If the Labour Party were a protectionist party the position might be serious, but they are. a socialistic party pure and simple. I find that on all matters affecting the farmers in the Parliament of New South Wales the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, the honourable member for Bland, the honourable member for Barthe honourable member for Canobolas, the honourable member for Newcastle folvoted solidly against protection. Did they not abandon protection in order to gain a land tax of one penny in the as a first step in the direction of nationalization ? I would ask any represenkeen tative of Queensland what was the action of the Labour Party in New South Wales with regard to the sugar duties. Dominfull ated as they were by miserable little coteries from the great cities, what did they care for the sugar-workers? They abandoned them in. order that they might place a tax of one penny in the pound upon the farmers. They voted against the sugar duty, and against the duties The party is entirely without fiscal principle. It is like a ship without a rudder. member now? ' The Labour Party voted solidly against the duty on timber, ' being utterly indifferent to the interests of the timber-getters or workers in the saw-mills. They voted against the farmers every time.",34

303,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He was an open antagowhen nist all the time. But the Labour 1 went upon a free-trade debauch. The great protectionists in the - Labour Party entirely ignored the interests of those who were working upon the land. When the labour unions send their delegates among the workmen in my district, and tell them that they are in favour of giving preference to unionists, and at the same time intimate that they voted to give preference to foreign timber and sugar, they will have a very lively The electors in my constituency, who are intelligent as any in the world, may be relied upon to show their resentment against those who are doing their best to deprive them of the means of earning their livelithe hood. Who defeated the timber duties when they were submitted in this House? The honourable member for Barrier.",35

305,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member for Darling claims the farmers as a sacrifice in the interests of the miners.,35
306,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The farmers are not timtheir ber getters.,35
307,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Eve n so, the timber getter was sacrificed in the interests of the miner.",35

309,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He has received absoluthemselves tion for anything he may have done. Eight members of the Labour Party voted the proposed timber duties. The timber getters work as hard as any men in the 8 L 2 pound world, and yet the representatives of land labour, who profess to have such a regard for the interests of working men voted against giving them a reasonable amount of protection. I recognise to the that politics makes us acquainted with very strange bed-fellows; but when honourable members vote to destroy industries in which my constituents are engaged, and ask land me to believe that they are thus studying the best interests of labour,- they put my credulity to too great a test, and I cannot on timber. ally myself with them.",35

312,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What is the compact?,35
313,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That the fiscal policy was good enough for the honourable member and the whole Protectionist Party the Deakin Government were in Party power, shall remain intact.",35
314,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is a case of "" the lion - and the lamb lying down together.""",35
315,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We have all heard thatThere was a young lady of Riga, Who smiled as she rode on a tiger. They returned from the ride with the lady inside, And a smile on the face of the tiger. The honourable member is now the inside passenger. I would ask honourable members time. who destroyed the Protectionist Party? as With all their defects and shortcomings and failures, the Protectionist Party formerly stood firm under'the leadership of the honourable and learned .member for Ballarat, Minister of Trade and - Customs, and the Treasurer. We stood as a solid party until we were destroyed by honourable members opposite. Upon the one side was the question of protection to native industries, which we all held so dear, and upon the other hand, there was the question whether the States should control their own railway servants. The Labour Party threw weight in the scale against the maintenance of States rights, and destroyed our party. It did not matter to them that it was unconstitutional for us to interfere honwith the rights. of the States. They butchered the Protectionist Party, and this was not the first time that they had shown utterly regardless of the consequences to others, so long as they could 1 against achieve their own ends.",35
316,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member is now sitting behind the Government which has taken up a Bill containing the provi.sion to which he has expressed his objec-tion.,35
317,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is another story.,36
318,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I always try to do right.,36
319,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Such a number of stupid people do that. When a rogue, or a scoundrel, is working with you, he will not kick, but the stupid man kicks all the time, and finally upsets the apple-cart. With gard to the question of sinking the fiscal issue, we heard a pathetic statement by the leader of the corner Protectionist Party. The honourable member for Hume made an impassioned appeal to honourable members upon the subject of sinking the fiscal issue. Any one who has any knowledge of electrobiology is aware that in one aspect spiritualism is sometimes said to rest upon, the power of one person to project his intelligence into the crannies of another person's brain and find out what is there. I propose to give honourable members the result of an examination of ' the brown tissues of the brain of the honourable member for Hume. The honourable member has stated that ""those who have sunk the fiscal issue are criminals and traitors. Now this is what I gather from a scrutiny of the brown tissues of the honourable member's brain. He says, in effect- "" I am out of office, and it now occurs to me with special force that the products of prison labour in other parts of the world are swellinrr our imports to the detriment of our local producers."" It is cheering to be able to say something pleasant with regard to the honourable member for Hume. I have said many things which are absolutely true of the honourable member, and I wish now to say something, pleasant of him. He has always been consistent in sinking the fiscal issue. That should be counted to him for righteousness. He has always sunk the fiscal question when in office, but has never sunk it when out of office.",36
320,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is not fair; he was a member of the only Government which submitted a protective Tariff in New South Wales.,36
321,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In order to meet the sensitive feelings of the honourable member, I wi 11 say that, with one exception, he has always sunk the fiscal question when in office, but never when out of office. In 1899 Federation, was so close to an accomplished fact that a considerable number of protectionists thought it unwise to raise the not break the promise which he had made. fiscal issue at all. At that time the leader of the Opposition was the member for Hastings-Macleay, Sir Edmund, then Mr., Barton. He had pledged himself to sink the fiscal issue in order to secure the consummation of Federation. The honourable member for Hume, who was then in Opposition, was indignant. He declared that we were traitors to sink the fiscal issue, and that we ought to be lynched as renegades re- to the protectionist cause. I have no desire to discuss caucus secrets, but I may mention that the honourable member for Hume was then elected leader of the Opposition, and was able to displace the Government. Upon the 25th November, speaking in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Mr Henry Clarke, the member for Bega, made a statement concerning the honourable member, who now charges us with a special crime in haying sunk the fiscal policy. Mr Clarke said I consider the honourable member for Hume and his colleagues did not act fairly in the course which they took to get into power. Upon the meeting of Parliament, after the last prorogation, two meetings of the late Opposition were held. At the first of these, the honourable and learned member for Hastings-Macleay, who was then leader of the Opposition, and had convened the meeting, explained that he was afraid that he could not continue to hold that position, as be had made a promise not to interfere with the fiscal question during the existence of the present Parliament. A great many of the members of the Opposition, including myself, and the honourable member for Queanbeyan, were not satisfied that that promise should have been made. It was stated that the probabilities were that we should not have a Federal Tariff for two or three years to come, in which time, unless there were an interference with the fiscal question here, this Colony would be flooded with goods which would come in duty free, and which we should be prevented from exporting to the other Colonies, Decause of their prohibitory Tariffs. The honourable member for Hume, and other members, stated, however, that they were not bound by any such promise, and that the only promise they had made was not to raise the fiscal question until the Federation Bill had been dealt with.",36
322,Mr SEE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is not a very usual thing to,disclose what takes place at these meetings. Mr H . CLARKE - I do not care whether it is or is not a usual thing. I shall do it, because of the treachery and intrigue that has been displayed. Those are the very words which the honourable member himself now uses. The extract continuesAt the next meeting of the Opposition, upon the following day, the honourable and learned member for Hastings-Macleay resigned his leadership.",36
323,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Why did he do that ? Mr H . CLARKE - Simpl y because he could He acted a manly, part, and no one can find fault with him for what he did. I was in the chair during the second meeting, and the honourable member for Hume was, I believe, unanimously elected leader in succession to the honourable and learned member for Hastings-Macleay, honourable members being under the impression, because of what he had stated on the previous day, that he was not similarly bound. But, on the same evening, when a question was put to him by a member of the Government, he stated that he was prepared to sink the fiscal question, and he thus put himself in the position in which the honourable and learned member for Hastings-Macleay stood when he thought it necessary to resign. I have been a strong supporter of the Protectionist Party since I entered the House, nearly thirty years ago, and I was never a free-trader, though', only a few years ago, many of those who are now strong protectionists were free-traders. I submit that the Premier and other members of the Government have sold the Protectionist Party. A reply to that statement has never been forthcoming. The honourable member for Hume accepted the leadership of the Protectionist Party, under a promise to raise protection, but the moment he obtained office he sank the fiscal issue. It would require the Rontgen rays to discover his protectionist principles when the honourable member holds Ministerial office. I would remind him that when Premier of New South Wales he took Mr B. R. Wise and Mr Lionel Fegan-tw o free-tradersinto the Government with him. Now, however, he is astounded that a free-trader and protectionist should sit together. He selected the two free-traders whom I have mentioned as a guarantee that the fiscal issue would be sunk.",36
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Where is the honourable member?,37
325,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He is saving a good deal of injury to his feelings by being absent from the Chaimber. There are two planks in my policy. believe that the main elements in our national life should be close loyalty to the mother country and the encouragement of Australian industry. My next consideration is to get as far away from the pernicious influence of men like the honourable member for Hume as I possibly can. Of course, I am referring to his political career. In looking through the Vice-Regal speech, dealing with the business which was to be submitted to the New South Wales Parliament by the Government of which the honourable member was the head, shortlyafter he had been elected leader of the Protectionist. Party, one would require a microscope to discover any reference to protection. I find that it contains allusions to the soldiers of the Queen, and to what Lord Roberts said of our colonial troops. There are three paragraphs devoted to the - bubonic plague, and others to the Rocks resumptions, but not a word to protection. The honourable member at the time was sitting, cheek by jowl, with free-traders, and yet he now professes astonishment that a protectionist could be associated with a free trader under any circumstances whatever. The honourable member is truly consistent. I hold in my hand the speech delivered by the Governor General at the opening of this Parliament on the 2nd March of the present year. The honourable member was in office then. Is there in that Vice-Regal utterance any reference to the fiscal policy? Not a word. Every member of the Deakin Government had agreed to sink that issue. Nobody would have dreamt of dealing with it with only twenty-five supporters behind them. Every honourable member upon our side of the House was pledged to sink the fiscal policy and to sanction preferential trade. Again, the Tariff was good enough for the honourable member whilst in office - But the moment he is not a member of the Government he repeats his old statement, "" I am out of office, and cheap labour in other parts of the world is destroying the industries of this country."" I will not say .anything of the caucus or corroboree which the protectionists held in endeavouringto arrive at an arrangement for a coalition.",37
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It was a meeting of the party.,37
327,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The difference between our caucuses and those of honourable members opposite is that whereas they are bound by the decisions arrived at we merely meet for discussion. At that meeting it First, I was obvious what would happen. It was perfectly apparent. that about six honourable members would join the Socialists, whilst the others would stand together as the Protectionist Party. I knew that the honourable imember for Hume would never cross to this side of the House. When men, by a long chapter of accidents and errors, have endeared themselves to the public, and become high politicians, they usually develop fat. One result of a long public career is that a man grows very stout. It was obvious when the present Prime Minister laid down in the political trough that there would be no room for the honourable member for Hume. I realized that the honourable member for Hume and the honourable and learned member for Indi would not support the Government. There were so many able lawyers round the Prime Minister, and he objected to crowding. Some honourable members were so startled by the appearance of the socialistic banner over the political horizon that they were bound, to join the Labour Party. is no need, therefore, to make any special reference to what happened in the caucus. In my judgment, there were two occasions upon which the honourable member for Hume would have done well to sink the fiscal question. He has never sunk that issue when it would have been good for protection, but he has always sunk it when it was good for himself.",37
328,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did the Prime Minister sink it when he voted for the duty upon sugar ?,38
329,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member himself voted in the same way ,38
330,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I was not a professed free-trader.,38
331,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"No ; the honourable membet was a pledged labour representative. 'He voted, it is true,, in the Parliament of New South Wales, to destroy industries.",38
332,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That statement is as inaccurate as the honourable member usually is.,38
333,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have the records, which cannot be incorrect. I wish to cite one or two occasions upon which it would have been wise to sink the fiscal issue, but upon which the honourable member for Hume refused to do so. When we secured the Dibbs Tariff in New South Wales- a Tariff which was not a very satisfactory one, but which was the best we could get, because the protectionists of that State were always hopelessly defeated when associated with the honourable member for Hume",38
334,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did not the honourable member sink the Dibbs Party for a railway upon one occasion ?,38
335,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Not at all.,38
336,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member was one of the four northern members.,38
337,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Wit h regard to that railway,38
338,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member think that the railway has anything to do with this question?,38
339,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not think it has, Mr Speaker, but you will agree .with me, that I was not the first to import it into debate. It was incontinently dragged in by the leader of the Opposition, and I need only say, with respect to it, that I am very proud of it, and New South Wales is, too.",38
340,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Ne w South Wales has had to bear the brunt of it.,38
341,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I knew a great deal more of the subject than did the people who opposed the railway. To-day every one is in favour of it, but for a long time There I and my colleagues advocated it in politics almost alone.",38
342,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Ne w South Wales is losing £30,000 a year on it, I understand.",38
343,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What is that to New South Wales? Why does the honourable member not say £1,000,000? In other words, I do not intend to further discuss the question. Having done a great deal of work in connection with other phases of political life, Sir Henry Parkes, as honourable members are aware, was anxious to finish his public career by bringing into existence an Australian Union. He came to us as protectionists, when we had the Dibbs' Tariff in New South Wales, and offered to maintain that Tariff if we would help him with Federation. When that offer was made. I knew perfectly well what would happen at the next election, and said so, as did other protectionists, and we urged the honourable member for Hume in every way we could to accept the offer, but he said, as usual, "" I am out of office. Foreign labour is flooding us with cheap goods,"" and all the rest of it. If the honourable gentleman then had sunk the fiscal issue New South Wales would have come into the union without such a bigoted feeling in favour of free-trade. She would have been to some extent accustomed to protection, and would not have had to make such a change as has been necessary, and New South Wales would also have had the advantage of the Dibbs' duties till union was accomplished. Again we could see what Federation would do. We were Australian protectionists, and we reached out our hands to men like the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. We could see that they were our allies. The honourable member for Hume had destroyed us in New South Wales, but we knew that we had friends over the border in Victoria , and we opened our arms 1 wide to them, and reached out to them with both hands. Honourable members are aware that we could not get more than four men to represent protection in New South Wales the in the Federal Parliament, and if we had had to depend upon feeling in New South Wales alone, protection was hopeless. What did we do? We turned to our brother protectionists in the other States, and held out our hands to them. But what did the honourable member for Hume do ? The honourable gentleman opposed the movement in every way. He opposed it bitterly, and he spoke of the people of Victoria in a way which I do not care to repeat. If according to the honourable gentleman, protection was the only thing necessary, and the only thing which made his blood tingle and his hair to stand on end, why did he not help us to union? The honourable gentleman broke up the Protectionist Party in New South Wales, and he has smothered the Protectionist Alliance in his blind bolt for Socialism. When he could have sunk the fiscal issue, and maintained the Dibbs' Tariff in New South Wales, he refused to do it. If we had followed the honourable gentleman's example, every industry in New South Wales would today be in the full blaze of the ruin caused by free-trade, and the sugar industry and the timber industry would have crumbled into dust. This is the honourable gentleman's record, and I therefore refuse to follow him. It is not pleasant to have to say these things, even in the kindly and euphonious language in which I have expressed them. I have referred to the honourable gentleman absolutely in a political sense, and if he had been present I should have been tempted to be a little more severe. It is no pleasure to me to have to say these things, but when, as a protectionist of New South Wales, I am called upon to decide between the honourable member for Hume and a tried leader like the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, what sort of a man should I be if I were to abandon the leader I was elected to support, in order to follow the honourable member for Hume. The honourable gentleman has said that he does not trust the present Prime Minister. As a protectionist I do trust the right honourable member's word. I have known him for many years. No man has ever opposed him more bitterly than I have done on the fiscal question, and the time may come when it will be necessary to fight the right honourable gentleman again on that question. But I must say that I have never known the! present Prime Minister to break his plighted political troth. Other honourable members could say these things perhaps better than I can, but it is just as well that I should say them. On the question, for instance, in connection with which the right honourable' gentleman has been referred to as a "" Yes-No"" politician, the course he* pursued was as magnanimous, as honourable, as straightforward, and as discreet as any statesman ever pursued.",38
344,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and learned member for Indi knows that, too.",39
345,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and learned member for Indi knows also that in political life a man generally states but his own side of a case. When men have studied questions, and have come to the conclusion that free-trade or protection, or prohibition, or anything else, is right, they use arguments calculated to sustain the position they take up. But what did the present Prime Minister do? He told the people frankly that there were two sides to this case, as to every case. The present Prime Minister took the people of New South Wales into his confidence, and he said"" This is for it, and that is against it."" He stated both sides honestly, and the right honourable gentleman never stood higher in 1 my estimation than when he had the courage to state the case of an antagonist in a fight in which he was himself engaged. If everv man in political life plainly stated both sides of a question, the result might be disastrous in some respects, but it would lead to a better condition of affairs in the political life of the country. Although honourable members may talk derisively of ""yes-no,"" protectionists and free-traders alike believe in their hearts that the right honourable gentleman did what was right in that matter. I desire to sav a word or two to the leader of the Opposition on the subject of Socialism. The honourable gentleman claims to be a Socialist.",39
346,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable gentleman has always believed in Socialism for the North Coast.,39
347,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall tell the honourable member what I believe in before I sit down. He will penmit me to say that we have not the slightest evidence of Socialism, in Australia. When I hear some of these half-articulate noises I wonder how far evolution has got. Disraeli at one time said that he did not know whether we were fallen angels or advanced apes. I am not quite clear on the point myself. The leader of the Opposition is a Socialist. For a downright, double-barrelled, copper-bottomed, bevelled-edged egotist, gi%'e me a Socialist.",39
348,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Hear , hear. They can always put the world right.",39
349,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes , and put themselves wrong. The honourable member for Bland is an extremely good man for the purpose of lulling people to rest, and if the members of his party have any sense they will keep the honourable member as leader. They do not want a figure-head like one of the Maffia society, with a charge of dynamite and a stiletto, and I repeat that ' the honourable members of his party will do well to keep him where he is. According to the honourable gentleman, factory laws,' development of the country, and old-age pensions, are all forms of Socialism. I may remind the honourable gentleman that every one of these things has been won in countries which havei never heard of a Labour Party.",39
350,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is no argument to prove that they are not socialistic.,40
351,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Honourable members opor posite confuse democracy with labour. We stand for democracy, and honourable memto bers opposite stand for Socialism and slaveverything, ery. Who were the men who centuries ago made a stand at Runnymede? There was no Labour Party there.",40
352,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What does "" Peritonitis say about it ?",40
353,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"This party of mushroom growth, which has come into existence only during the last few years, claims to done everything. What is democracy but the State can take? the control and rule of the people by people-makin g as broad as we can basis of the social pyramid? What is but that every man should to the utmost of his ability and power improve the ditions of life. This has been the of men who have never identified themhas selves with the Labour Party, and who have never signed a pledge. But no man can get the support of honourable members posite unless he signs their pledge. They are prepared to destroy even their allies. Alliance with them is like an alliance with an American Indian. He may fight with you, but pretty soon after the battle he will scalp you if he gets the chance. Socialabout ism means taking from those and giving to those who have not. If it means anything at all it means that. It means, example, taking the land from the farmer. The honourable members for Barrier and them ? Yarra admit that it means taking the land from the farmer by means of a land taxnot by paying for it, as other honourable members have suggested, but by bursting up private estates by heavy taxation-b ing the farmer's land until it becomes of value to him, and the State takes it.",40
354,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The proposal is to take the land from the squatter in order give it to tKe farmer.,40
355,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member for New England and the honourable ber for Lang propose to do what the honourable member suggests.,40
356,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I do not care who else proposes to do it-it is what is proposed by the Socialists. . Mr WATSON - It is proposed by the Single Tax League.,40
357,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is the whole basis of the socialistic creed.,40
358,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What are the Government to do with the land when they get it?,40
359,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Darling who spoke for five-it seemed fifteen-hours might allow me to say a word two. The Socialist has discovered that it is cheaper to steal cattle and sheep than breed them. They believe in dividing up and under their system we might have a man sent up to the country from Sydney to divide a team'of bullocks, and to take the pin bullocks, the polers, and the "" leaders and leave the rest to the owner. Do honourable members opposite mean to tell me that Social/ism means the burdening of the State with hundreds and thousands of have millions of debt in order to buy what Of course it the does not. It reminds one of Janus. the The Temple of Janus, the gates of it which were closed in time of peace, but remained open in time of war, concontained an idol possessing a head work facing two ways. The Labour Party such a head. One of its faces bears the features of the astute and extremely friendly member for Bland. His views opare merely democratic and humane. But the other face has the features of the anarchist and Socialist, who would divide up and share the possessions of other people.",40
360,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member : knows that that is not correct. He knows more economics and Socialism than his prewho have sent speech discloses.,40
361,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the honourable member for does not believe in these views, why does he contribute towards (the preaching of",40
362,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Mr Tom Mann was never guilty of the idiocy of preaching such views as the honourable member speaks of.,40
363,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I will give proofs of my y taxstatement by quoting from Mr Mann's no speeches next time. I rise. If I had a lecturer in my employ, he would speak as I told him to do, whether I sent him to Klondyke to or anywhere else. Mr Mann, indeed, has said that he would not work for the party unless it was a socialistic party, that he memwould not take a penny from any other party. But what is a Socialist? He has been well described in the following lines: What is a Socialist? One who is yearning For the equal division of unequal earning; Idler or bungler, or worse, he is willing To fork out his penny and pocket your shilling.",40
364,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Thos e lines are pretty old; but the honourable member knows that they do not truly represent the views of the members of our party.,41
365,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The lines are nearly as old as Socialism, and so, too, is human nature. If you take from the industrious and give to the careless, inconsiderate, and lazy; if you give to the man who will not work the results of the labour of the man who does work; if we tell our boys who are growing up that there are no rewards for intelligence in this country, that if they wish to sell the work of their brains they must take it to another country, because here intelligence will mean nothing, but all must be on the 'dead level of mediocrity, the best of our population will leave Australia. I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne is to follow me, and no doubt he will have a great deal to say about the sin; the sorrow, the m'isery, and the disease to which the human family is subject. But do not honourable members know that the lash of circumstances is""rtiorecruel than the lash of any master, that every man contains within himself the germ of death, and is gradually though surely decaying? We all know that poverty, misery, and wretchedness walk our streets, and that the end of all is marked by the white tombstones of our cemeteries. But shall we remedy that state of things by refusing to the industrious the rewards of their labour, or to those who possess brains the prizes of intelligence? Honourable members have asked upon what issue will the people be appealed to. The issue will be Socialism versus freedom Honourable members opposite say that no man in Australia who does not contribute to the socialistic funds should get work.",41
366,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is as nearly correct as it is usual for the honourable member to be.,41
367,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and learned member for Indi will see my meaning, without any explanation. We, on this side, hold that every man should participate in the wealth of the country in proportion to his merits, his industry, and his character. are the two platforms between which the people of Australia will have to decide. Honourable members of the Labour Party have declared themselves to be Socialists. They claim that no man who is not a member of a union is entitled to get work. Is that correct ?",41
368,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No .,41
369,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Then , I will say that they claim that no man who is not a unionist is entitled to get work unless there is more work than the unionists can do. They would give to the free labourer the scraps and crumbs from the table. Now, no man can belong to a union unless he contributes towards its funds; and, lastly, the funds of the unionists go to provide the sinews of war to help the Socialistic Party to win seats in Parliament. Those facts prove the conclusion I have just stated. We, on this side, do not wish to force working men to contribute out of their wages to socialistic movements, unless they wish to do so. We are on the side of freedom. I heard with surprise the honourable member for Bland speak about the Socialism which at present exists in Australia, and I say that there is not the slightest evidence of any desire for Socialism here.",41
370,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There are none so blind as those who will not see.,41
371,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The management of the railways by the States has been referred to as an instance of Socialism. But that is not Socialism at all. The railways have been constructed for the development of the lands of the States, and for the use of their people; but they have been constructed on a financial basis which pays regard to the amount likely to be derived from freights and fares, and to the possibility of profitable working. That is State commercialism, not State Socialism. Those who use the railways pay for the services which they employ, whereas if the railways were socialistically managed, those who did not use them would have to pay for them. Then honourable members say, "" Look at the Post Office; is not that a socialistic concern?"" I say again, "" No; it is another example of State commercialism."" Your socialistic writers would laugh to scom the statement that the Post Office is an example of Socialism. The Post Office is a paying concern, and those who use it pay for the carriage of their letters. If those who did not use it paid for the carriage of the letters of those who did, it would be Socialism. Then honourable members have referred to the SocialThose ism of the' right honourable member for Swan, in giving a water supply to the people of Coolgardie, who, ' before his great intellect and noble courage appeared on the scene, had to be content with a dry blow, 1 and a scrub down with a corn-cob or a currycomb. Now they are able to bathe themselves, and they show their gratitude by voting against the man whose bravery, courage, and intelligence, have given them the great boon which they enjoy. But those waterworks are not a socialistic concern; they are only another example of State commercialism. Theywould be socialistic if the water was paid for, not by those who use it, but by persons in Tasmania or elsewhere who do not use it. Similarly the acquirement by the Government of pastoral property, with a view to settling agriculturists upon it, is another instance of State commercialism, because those who use the land pay for it. The man who sends cream to a co-operative factory, and is paid in money for the butter manufacturer! from that cream, is taking part, not in a socialistic, but in a commercial concern.",41
372,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Who gets the bonuses?,42
373,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall not refer to that matter; but the evidence which we have read in regard to it, shows what a. mess the Government makes of these things. If the man who spends his time expectorating on the footpaths inSydney or Melbourne came in for a share of the money won by the dairyman elsewhere, it would be Socialism; but, as it is, the arrangement is purely a commercial one. Now let me say a word or two with regard to the marvellous dreams of the Socialists. They tell their audiences that they will all live in palaces, and that there will be no more trouble with regard to money. There will be an abundance of money, with horses and carriages,, and everything else you like. But do not honourable members opposite know that the total income of Australia is about £212,000,000, an amount which gives an average of about £ 4 6 per head to every man, woman, and child in the community? Honourable members opposite, who are drawing £400 a year, and who are not keeping a wife and seven children each, are robbing some one else, according to their own principles. The money is not available. What is the use of nationalizing land, and the means of production, unless you also nationalize the! brains of the community ? Australia had fine resources, great, opportunities^ magnificent potentialities, in the time of the blacks. But what developed the country ? Not only the labour, but; the brains of the white man. You must nationalize the brains of the community ' if. you nationalize everything else. Once you refuse to the brains and the industry of a country their full reward, that' country becomes as poor as Lazarus. Take the flower of a country's intelligence out of it, and there will be nothing to divide. One word in regard to .the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, and the other protectionists who are sitting with him. I wish to reiterate that there is no protectionist flag flying oh the Opposition benches. The honourable and learned member for Indi, the honourable member for Hume, and others claimed the right to cross the drawbridge with their flag flying, and their band playing. But the Labour Party said, ""Oh, no."" Then the honourable members tried to build bridges in order to get over. But the Labour Party still said ""No."" Then they, with their small following, tried to get through the scullery. But still the Labour Party said ""No."" Was there a rat hole left through which they could get ? Not one. The honourable members. I have alluded to prayed on their knees, looking up fervently into the eyes of the Labour Party, to be allowed to fly a little flag of their own. They said, "" You are here under the black banner and the skull and cross-bones of Socialism, and that does not suit us; let us put up a little flag of protection just as an excuse."" But the Labour Party persistently said "" No. To do that we should have to turn out some of our best men, and to abandon our principles."" To-day the honourable members to whom I have referred stand there only under the flag of Socialism; no flag of protection is flying. They cannot excuse themselves to their constituents on that score. There are only two parties in our politics today-the individualists and the Socialists, the freemen and bondsmen. When I have to sign a caucus pledge, when, after being elected by my constituents, I have to come to Melbourne and find a number of men meeting together in a room, who will tell me, whatever my views or the wishes of my constituents are, that I must abandon them, and vote as the caucus directs-whe n that time comes, my political career will be closed.  knows that that is not correct.",42
374,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The ' honourable member tells me that that is not correct. But what is the platform of the Labour Party? I hereby pledge myself not to oppose the candidateHow frightened they are of being opposed.! As if. a man's defeat or success meant anything at all. Individually it may be an important thing to him, but what is it as compared with the importance of the affairs of the country ? They are frightened at the idea of being opposed, and are crawling along with the condition that there shall be no opposition. "" Let them all come,"" so far as I am concerned.",42
375,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member knows all about crawling.,43
376,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not allude to the honourable member for Bland, of course. When we fight a political issue out in the full breath of heaven, and before the face of our constituents, why should we pledge ourselves in this fashionI hereby'pledge myself not to oppose the didate selected by the recognised political zations, and, if elected, to do my utmost to out the principles embodied in the Federal labour platform, and on all questions affecting the form to vote as a majority of the parliamentary party may decide. I came to Parliament as a representativefree man. My constituents empowered me to come, and they trusted me. I accept the responsibility for every vote which I give, and when I go back to them, even if I made a mistake, they always forgive me, and vote for me again, because they knowtry, that I am always first for them and their interests. I have, already said that' there is a good deal of trouble in the world, but totally dissent from those who say that there is no chance in this country for the poor man. Let honourable members look around this House, and say whether there is not room in Australia for the poor man. We are poor men's sons, every one of us. The Prime Minister came from ' the manse. Honourable members opposite came from laudable occupations. Where they going to goodness knows ! Honourable bers were all brought up in poor men's houses, and it is through their own habits of thrift, their ability, their self-reliance, their belief in themselves, and their know that ledge that they had to work if they were improve their' lot, that they have reached their present position. This is absolutely a poor man's Parliament. I do not think there is a man in this House who is not poor man's son.  member.",43
377,Mr EWING,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Excep t me? My home in the early days, though a pure and good home, was as poor as that of any man in this House, and my position here, and all that I have got, are due the intelligence of my constituents, my own industry. I do not like to say that honourable members opposite are here because of the imbecility of their constituents, because that would not be fair, and.I do not think it. But is there any country in the world- is it possible elsewhere to find such a state of things - where a poor man with merit has a better chance than in Australia? Our leading men in trade, in commerce, in law, in a>rts, in the church, are almost without exception poor men's sons. The honourable member for Kooyong is a poor man's son. They tell us that there is no chance for a poor man in Australia, but Sir Henry Parkes, one of the greatest of Australian canstatesmen, a man who would have been conorganisidered great 'in any Parliament in the carry world, came from an English agricultural platlabourer's cottage, and rose to power from a small toy shop in Hunter-street, Sydney. My opinion of Australians is that they rea spect merit. If a man has raised himself by his own natural ability, by his prestige, and by his wisdom, to a high position, Australia is proud of him, and the humbler have his origin the more gratified we are. A rich man, in the political life of this counhas, indeed, a heavy load to carry. The feeling in Australia is in favour of ability and industry every time. Under Socialism our great artists, great reformers, great inventors, great sculptors, politicians, and industrious men in every sphere of life are to be placed in shackles, and made content with £ 4 6 a year and a Justice of the Peaces'hip. What would every honourable member opposite do if he had a son with ability under the conditions of Socialism which they themselves desire to establish? are He would send him out of a country memwhich handcuffed intelligence and legironed ability. Socialism means nothing less than that; and the fight in the coming election will be between men who believe we should not handcuff ability and deto stroy talent, and those who believe that the industrious man has no chance in this country, that we should divide up the land of the farmer, distribute the cattle and a the sheep, and that every one should be equal-and fit for a lunatic asylum! We are asked' why the free-traders and the protectionists have come together today. Why? .Because they are free men; bea cause they believe that to put shackles upon intelligence would be disastrous to the country and inimical to our civilization, to and would reduce our Commonwealth to a and to great Sahara of imbecility and sandWe intend to stand together to resist a policy which would bring calamity to our homes and ruin to our civilization.",43
378,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF," I thank the honourable member who has just resumed his seat for the good-tempered way in which he has addressed himself to the motion before the House, because he has perhaps provided me with a larger audience than I should otherwise have had. Speaking with the best of good-fellowship, I should say that the honourable member must have been giving us a few passages from the .novel with which I understand he intends to favour the world. I can well imagine that he has been enacting the part of the hero of that piece of fiction. I do not suppose that any member of the Housenot even the honourable member who is the sole representative of Western Australia on the Government benches, or the honourable member who is the sole representative of Queensland-wil l deny that the question of protection and free-trade was before the people at the lastelection. I am quite certain that the Minister of Trade and Customs will not contend that the fiscal issue was sunk in the two recent campaigns in the electorate of Melbourne. The honourable gentleman knows very well that that question was to the front throughout those elections, and that it was a live one. Not only did I not sink it, but I would not permit any one to compel me to sink it.",44
379,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Labour candidate in my constituency sunk the fiscal issue; he placarded the district w ith "" fiscal peace.""",44
380,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I did not,44
381,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I think the honourable member's name was on the list of those who went for fiscal peace at the general election.,44
382,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Oh , no.",44
383,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There were fifty-two names.,44
384,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable gentleman has known me in political life for about fifteen years, and he knows that the flag of protection has never been hauled down by me.",44
385,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The protectionist flag is flving now. ' Mr MALONEY - Yes , on this side'of the House. An old colleague of the honourable gentleman's in the State Parliament once said from the Ministerial corner of this chamber that, given the help of one newspaper in this community, he would fight any constituency in Victoria. That newspaper today is maintaining its splendid rule as far as protection goes, and has stamped those who are not sitting' with us as seceders from the Protectionist Party.",44
386,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Are they all protectionists on the Opposition benches?,44
387,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The real protectionists are here, and a few more will come over before the division is taken. The Age has truly said that the caucus is not new, but dates back to early times. The right honourable gentleman, who led a victorious party so long in the Victorian Parliament, used to meet his supporters in caucus.",44
388,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Onl y once, and they were all at sixes and sevens. I never tried it a second time.",44
389,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have in my possession no less than five notices.,44
390,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No .,44
391,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Oh , but I have. I think the right honourable 'gentleman's memory is not to be depended upon at the present moment. On the 9th inst. the Age wroteMr MCLean's attempt to extenuate his betrayal of the policy on which he was elected was not worthy of his past reputation. It was the stereotyped fiction that the fiscal peace and preferential trade on the Ministerial programme meant a truce of three years. Who empowered the honourable member for Gippsland or any one else to make a truce for three years on the fiscal question ? There is only one way of obtaining the opinion of r the people, and that is by means of a referendum, but the honourable gentleman would not take that course. I remember when he came along and stabbed the right honourable member for Balaclava in his back. I am using the very words of the latter when he accused his late colleague of avoiding a straightforward fight, and stabbing him in the back.",44
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Neve r !,44
393,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Well , after that, the honourable member, if he really meant what he said, would say anything. I shall be obliged to him if he will not interject. I am using this incident as an argument against the tactics which have been employed in this House, whereby self-termed protectionists are bound hand and foot to free-traders. I ' have a much higher admiration for the leader of the House than I have for honourable members who have sunk their politics for the sake of obtaining a seat on the Treasury bench. The right honourable member for Balaclava will recollect the conversation I had with him when I told him that the honourable member for Gippsland. was going to act traitorously and oust him from his position. "" What!"" he said, "" Old Mac do that! I don't believe it."" He did not believe that it would be done, and he honestly expressed his opinion.  learned member for Corinella did so, too.",44
394,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and learned member for Corinella was bumped out by his colleagues, but, like a brave man, he accepted his gruel. I always admire a brave action. The honourable and learned member is now trying on the same game here. I guarantee that if he had the courage to resign his seat and go before his constituents tomorrow, he would not come back to this Chamber.",45
395,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How can the honourable gentleman guarantee that? Is not that in the hands of his electors?,45
396,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am using this argument when I find that a similar action is now being tried on here, and that an attempt is being made to avoid a straightforward fight. Even the right honourable member for Balaclava must agree that he was defeated in a cowardly fight, and not on a straight-out motion of no-confidence. We did not have a straightforward motion like that which has been moved by the leader of the Opposition here.  pair in favour of the Government.",45
397,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am sorry to hear that statement. I know that throughout Victoria there are many persons who are very sorry that my honourable friend has voted in that way. I regret that the second head of this Government has gone away. The right honourable member for Balaclava will remember that he was the first one whowas to be "" equal in all things and good in nothing"" with that sinuous man who Us now out of our political life, and who as a Svengali used the honourable member for Gippsland as his Trilby. The right honourable member for Balaclava was displaced in a cowardly fashion. At that time he said that the honourable member for Gippsland had betrayed the liberal principles in which he had believed. The honourable member for Parramatta seemed to doubt a statement. I made just now. I have not come here unarmed with authority, because I never make a statement which I do not believe to be true. When the honourable member for Gippsland moved to oust the right honourable member for Balaclava from his position he did not join issue on any great plank of policy, or on the administrative acts of five years' leadership, but on a mere question of privilege. I propose to make a quotation from volume 93 of the Victorian Hansard. On page 2736, the right honourable member for Balaclava was interrupted in his speech by the honourable member for Gippsland, with this remarkI f there are any personal obligations the balance is on my side. I state fearlessly that I have never heard so many aspersions thrown upon the butter bonus as I have upon the Maffra sugar concern. What is the opinion of the right honourable member for Balaclava, who, unlike the honourable member for Gippsland, who has retired, is courageous enough to sit here? If some honourable member would be so good as to tell the honourable member for Gippsland what I am about to quote, and ask him to return to the Chamber, I should' very much appreciate his action.",45
398,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I think that we ought to have a quorum. (Quorum formed!),45
399,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In answer to that interjection from the honourable member for Gippsland, the right honourable member for Balaclava said I know this, that had it not been for the unbounded faith that I had in the honourable member, I probably would never have landed this Colony in the loss of £62,000, and I would not have allowed the unfortunate shareholders in the company to lose ^3r,ooo of their money. We all know what gratitude is. The honourable member had submitted his motion in a 'half-hearted way. He could not attack the right honourable member for disloyalty. | Mr SPEAKER - Does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the question under discussion ?",45
400,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes . The right honourable gentleman received exactly the same treatment as the Labour Party has received in this House,45
401,Mr MURRAY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Not gratitude for wasting the public money. Sir GEO. TURJCER - Gratitud e for the care and interest I took in regard to that matter, and gratitude for the unbounded trust I unfortunately placed in the honourable member's knowledge. And yet he is supporting him today. I certainly am surprised at the quarter from which the attack comes. My honourable friend says that he was not aware of any intriguing going on when I threw out a challenge the other day. Then he must have been blind or deaf, because we know very well that it has been common rumour throughout the House. I followed the right honourable member at a magnificent meeting in St. Kilda, where, according to the Argus of 22nd December, 1899, he is reported to have said thatHe could have understood the attack on his Government if it had come from the front, but it came as a stab from the back-(Shame)-and no Britisher liked that. (Cheers). These remarks appeared in the Argus on the same day, and I challenge the right honourable member to deny that the present second head of this Government is the only man in Victoria' who has earned the name of a back-stabber in our political life. He is betraying the protectionist cause in Victoria today, as he betrayed his old friend and colleague in the State Parliament. right honourable member for Balaclava also said at St. KildaIt was said that for months past there had been dissatisfaction in the ranks of his supporters, but if those gentlemen had had the liberal interests of the country at heart they would have approached him with their complaints Their action had had the result of splitting up the Liberal Party, and, in addition to creating some bad feeling, they had coalesced with their natural political enemies, the conservatives. But one of the strongest reasons was that a personal set had been made against him, as had been shown by the venomous speech of Mr. Shiels, at Bairnsdale. (Boohoos.) Then a number of supposed liberals, who, like Japhet, were hunting for a father, managed to collar Mr. MCLean, and if that gentleman were in the Palace of Truth, he would say he was heartily sorry at having undertaken the job. Mr MCLean and his colleagues in liberalism, depended for their very existence upon the vote of the conservatives, and upon the support of the newspapers, who had hitherto only supported those who held conservative views. What newspapers are supporting this Government today? The conservative press of Melbourne. Whom have they got at their back? Is there a conservative representing Victoria on this side of the House? Not one. They are all sitting on the other side. The right honourable member for Balaclava knows, as well as any honourable member who is here to-night, that if ever there was a feeling of bitter disappointment experienced by a majority of the people of this State it was when he agreed to throw in his lot with a Government which his leader-and he acknowledged the honourable and learned member, for. Ballarat as his leader-had discarded. The right honourable gentleman was leader in the State Parliament, and why should he ""knuckle down"" even to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat? But having accepted the honourable and learned member for Ballarat as leader, why did Mr Maloney. he not follow that gentleman, who, when he could not agree with the Ministry, took a corner seat in the back benches? I have shown clearly what manner of men are getting together in this Government. To me it seems something terrible that protectionists should be allied with free-traders in this way. I am not speaking against the honesty of free traders-thei r honesty gpes without saying. Men can be as honest in political life, holding different political faiths, as they can in other affairs; but those to whom I object are the men who tamper with principles. The Free-trade Party have not abated one iota of their opinions, but the same cannot be said for the proThe tectionists who are supporting the present Government. The Protectionist Partv have always been supported by the Melbourne Age. I have not much to thank that newspaper for, but in my bitterest anger, I have never accused it of, for one moment, wavering in its advocacy of protection. Never in the sixteen years of my political life have I found that paper to waver in itsfealty and loyalty to protection. And what stand does that paper take now? Is it supporting the honourable members, the protectionists,' who are sitting behind the Government? No; it is advocating protection by means of an honourable alliance. It is interesting to turn to a little page in history, in which, at all events, the honourable and learned member for Balaclava will be interested. When in Victoria, the MCLean party "" wiped out "" the Turner Ministry by a "" stab in the back."" the new Government had forty-seven vot»s against thirty-six. There were three pairs on each side, which made the votes fifty as against thirty-nine, showing a majority of eleven. What did the new Government do when they got into power? An appeal was made to the country; as I hope an appeal will be made in the present instance if the Opposition fail to get a majority of six. In such case, I am sure Victoria will speak in no uncertain tone. Out of the fifty politicians who voted to unjustly turn out the Turner Government, thirty have disappeared from public life, while out of those who voted for the Turner Government, only nineteen have disappeared. Of those who voted for the MCLean ' Government, thirteen now have seats in the State House, with an equal number of those who voted for the Turner Government. In the Federal' Government, there are seven from each side; so it will be seen that political death has overtaken nearly 60 per cent, of those who voted for the motion which the present honourable and learned member for Balareturn clava characterized as a "" stab in the back"" Parliament. from what he deemed to be a friendly hand. What can we expect from the present comFink, bination under the circumstances? What can people outside expect from the comhonorable bination? In the State general election which I have referred, three members of MCLean Government disappeared before next general election, amongst them the preArgus, saidsent honourable and learned member for Corinella, who, as a Minister, failed to seshould cure return on appealing to his constitugramme, ents.  man !",45

The honourable and learned member for Balaclava will recall the little tiddleyhe winking excuses to get letters inserted in I the Argus and Age newspapers; the letters commencing, ""My Dear Mr MCLean,"" and done ""My Dear Mr Shiels."" These were all ""fixed up "" in one little parlour-no t a bar parlour-and sent out as squibs to fool the public. But the public were not to be fooled. Mr Fink went on to sayI cannot refrain from expressing the conviction violent outbursts of vituperation must tend to lower the moral tone of public life, and there is in the conduct of public affairs in Victo justify them. . . . But the line of perattack adopted and justified by Mr Shiels can only create an impassable gulf between members of the party, all of whom are pledged to advance liberal measures, and tend to substitute a for personal triumph for anxiety for nawhereas five tional progress. or The present Treasurer knows that when big Liberal upheaval came at the first opportunity, and swept his opponents into another Minister lost his seatwill a Minister who had assisted to give "" the step, stab in the back."" Mr Watt, who was the the first Minister who had represented North Melbourne for many years, failed to get returned. Where is that party who opposed the Turner Government, although it came into pow er stronger than any party r under the British flag? While I differed .from the present Treasurer on many occasions, I know that his acts were liberal, and his instincts always kindly and huma-nitarian; but the Ministry which came back as the reform Ministry, with a majority of --thirty-eight in a House of ninety-five, did jfiot pass a Women's Suffrage Bill, and did not want to pass such a measure. That Ministry, however, placed on the statute book an infamous measure not equalled in fifty years' coercion of Ireland. Where is that party now ? When they faced the electors, the majority of thirty-eight dwindled to a majority of eight; and when they face the country again I do not know what will become of them, unless the good temper of Mr Bent, with his unfailing faculty for seizing the opportunity, may carry them through. When the Minister of Trade and Customs was addressing the House, I mistakenly thought that he was making an accusation against myself, and I interjected-though I must say that the interjection I made was true. It was my privilege to introduce the first Women's Suffrage Bill in any British Legislature, but on that occasion I could not get a seconder. The present honourable and learned member for Ballarat would, I believe, have supported me so far, but I could not ask him to do so, because I was the first member to "" peg out'' my seat in opposition to the Deakin-Gillies Administration. Ultimately, Lt - Col. Smith, to whom credit must be given, seconded my effort to get a measure of the kind passed; but that is as far as we got. On the next occasion, I ""was seconded by Mr Shiels; but where was the help of the present Minister of Trade and Customs ? That gentleman, however, now boasts that the measure was brought in by the Government of which he was the head. The fact was that the Minister of Trade and Customs dare not throw the Bill out, because it was accepted by the previous Government, although it was afterwards rejected by the Upper House. The Victorian Government, which was "" equal in all things'"" gave the people nothing; and I promise that much the same result will be seen in the Federal Parliament. I well remember the Victorian Attorney-General, when the Upper House had thrown out the Women's Suffrage Bill, as it had done five or six times before, say- Chair? Mr Maloney. ing to me, ""Well, Maloney, those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad."" I have shown that the Minister of Trade and Customs stabbed in the back his chief political friend.",47
407,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Order ! So long as the honourable member was quoting that expression I did not raise any objection, but I do not think that he is in order in accusing another honourable member of having stabbed a friend in the back.",48
408,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Goo d Highlander as is the Minister of Trade and Customs, I believe that he has given up carrying a dirk, and, as for stabbing any one in the back in. a personal sense, I do not for one moment suppose that he would be capable of such a thing. He joined the Ministry which was known as "" the equal-in-allthings, good-in-nothing"" Government, and succeeded in ousting a useful Liberal Administration. The Minister resented some remarks I made with reference to the Maffra Sugar Works, and he stated that I had been the means of robbing some hundreds of working men of their means of livelihood. The Minister hoodwinked me, in the first instance, into voting for a project which involved a very great loss to the country, and I had to fight very hard indeed in order to secure provision for a fair wage and fair hours to the workmen. But for the innate justice of the then Premier, Sir George Turner, I do not think that I should have succeeded. I never heard any reports in connection with the butter industry prior to the appointment of the Butter Bonus Commission to compare with those which have been in circulation with regard to the Maffra sugar industry. I should very much like an investigation to be made of all the circumstances connected with that enterprise,""and to know who has been in charge of the works during the last five years. I desire to quote what was stated by the Treasurer with regard to the project. Alluding to the honourable member for Gippsland, he saidThere is no doubt he did, at the commencement of this session, and later on, when I gave him an opportunity of replying to the strictures which were passed upon the administration of that company, attempt, in my opinion, to shift whatever blame there was for that failure from his own shoulders on to mine, and I naturally resented it. Any honest man would resent having the blame wrongly placed upon his shoulders.",48
409,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member think that these charges have anything to do with the motion before the,48
410,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Certainl y I do. Tactics similar to those employed to bring into power the double-headed State Administration were followed in securing office for the present Government. In one case liberalism was sacrificed, and in the other protection was, sold. The Treasurer went on to sayHe knows the duty that rested upon me to investigate the matter; and he knows also, that I sat up till 4 o'clock in the morning to prepare the necessary objections to the company's proposal. He knows that I was too firm then, when I made those objections. There was no weakness or vacillation then. When I insisted upon the interests of the country being protected, he considered that I was too firm.",49
411,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If there are any personal obligations, the balance is on my side.",49
412,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I know this, that had it not been for the unbounded faith that I had in the honourable member, I probably would never have landed this Colony in the loss of £62,000, and I would not have allowed the unfortunate shareholders in the company to lose £31,000 of their money. We all know what gratitude is. My statement with regard to the Maffra Sugar Works will stand, and I hope that an inquiry will be held, so that we may ascertain beyond any doubt who brought hundreds of workers to grief. The Minister of Trade and Customs twitted the honourable member for Darling upon the references he made to the care of children by the State, and suggested that he was an advocate for taking away children from parental control. I do not think that the Minister quite understood what he was talking about. He could never have read the splendid record of South Australia in regard to the care of child life, or he would not have been so flippant in his comments. The honourable member for Darling is a wide reader and a careful collater of facts, and is, perhaps, as well posted upon most .subjects as is any honourable member in this Chamber. Whenever he makes a statement with regard tb the care of child life, or the welfare of men or women, I pay the very greatest respect to it. Perhaps I may be permitted to read from a return, showing what has been done in South Australia, with a view to showing that we can very TTftle hope of improving the conditions in connection with the care of children whilst the present Ministry occupies the Treasury benches. The death rate amongst infants in South Australia, under the best system of child management in the world, is 101 per cent., whereas in West Garton, near Manchester, of every . 1,000 children born, 757 die before they reach the age of twelve months. I was delighted when I had an 2 opportunity to inspect the admirable institution which they have in South Australia, in which the children are artificially fed and most carefully looked after, and I only wish that we had similar establishments in all the States.",49
413,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And that work is carried on by the State.,49
414,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes , it is a form of Socialism. I am sure that under a proper system of State care for children, the death rate would be reduced to an enormous extent. It is not to be supposed for one moment that we shall be able to secure improved social conditions whilst the present Government remain in office. I should prefer to see a purely free-trade Government upon the Treasury benches. I have had sent to me the report of the State Children's Department in South Australia for the half year ended June 30th, 1904. It contains the following statements :How to deal with the multitude of men who are responsible for the existence of hundreds of children of unmarried women in each year is another question which must also be faced. When I endeavoured to move in this direction in the State Parliament of Victoria, where were those 'honourable members opposite who profess that the good of humanity is their chief concern ? They were certainly not fighting for me, but the majority of them were voting against me most of the time. The report continuesIs it that men and women cannot, because of poverty, marry, or is it because they will not undertake the responsibilities of wedded life, and think to evade them? Is it possible to so alter the law as to compel a man proved to be the father of a child, such as is now called illegitimate, to own the child exactly as if born in wedlock, and to be responsible in a precisely similar way ? Is there one man in this House who would not give to these children opportunities equal to those enjoyed by children born in wedlock? A child is in no way responsible for the circumstances of its birth, and no penalty should be inflicted where the individual has been guilty of no wrong. The have report goes on to sayThe class "" neglected "" child, however, includes those who, while children of married persons are bereft of one, sometimes both, parents by desertion. Usually, however, it is the father. To deal with this matter appears to need Federal legislation, enabling an order made in one part of the Commonwealth to be collected by a Government officer in another part, and the proceeds remitted. How could we hope to apply such a remedy whilst the present twin-headed Government remains in power? The Minister of Trade and Customs has been condemned by one of his colleagues for his lack of regard for the interests of the community generally, and, therefore, we could not expect him to show any special sympathy with a movement such as that which has been attended with successful results in South Australia. Yet he comes from a country-Scotland which, in its regard for women and children, stands head and shoulders above the other parts of the Kingdom. The Weekly Scotsman of February 20th, 1904, referring to the question of large families",49
415,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member think that that has anything to do with the subject before us?,50
416,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes , because it will be impossible to deal with these important social matters, whilst the present Ministry remain in office. Upon the question whether children are a blessing, a coachman in Edinburgh states his case as follows:I wonder how many have found children to be a curse instead of a blessing. I don't mean those children who have grown up and turned out badly. I am a coachman, but, unfortunately, I am blessed with a family of four. In the many places I have applied for, my family has been the only drawback. Ministers very often reject any applicant because he has a familv. If a minister wants a man he must be one without a family, so that his wife may help in the manse, on the many occasions when they are without a servant; at the same time his family is increasing to such an extent that we have to help find the funds to build additional bedrooms at the manse. How can any reader see in what way we are to go through the training of the stables with the ultimate hope of having our children a blessing? Can our Parliament do nothing in such a case? Any man who has a family ought to be given all the privileges of a free-born British subject.",50
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Does he say that "" unfortunately "" he is "" blessed "" ?",50
418,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes . ' The honourable member knows that when the worker's family increases it frequently happens that more than one child is compelled to sleep in a single room. That is one of the infamies of our present social system, and it is an evil which is well worthy of removal. As bearing upon this point, I should like to quote from the following letter which I have received :Bishops Perry, Moorhouse, and Goe were all childless, and it is stated that Bishop's Court was found large enough for them. Bishop Clarke has a family, and additional bedrooms had to be built for his family, by money subscribed. If the working man's family increases no public subscription is made to enlarge his home. It seems utterly unreasonable to wish that working men should have large families. It is very well for the to quote from the ancient Jewish Psalms that ""children are a heritage of the Lord."" working man, earning from 36s. to 60s. a week, is not fool enough to wish for more children than he can feed and clothe, or subject his wife in this sub-tropical climate to excessive child-bearing or nursing. Never in my life has my brain originated a thought, my mouth uttered a sentence, or my hand written a single word for the purpose of holding any religion up to scorn. Frequently, however, I have had occasion to strongly criticise the members of various churches, and I say that the statements made by Bishop Clarke must have been made without thought. Speaking of a White Australia, he is reported in the Age of 27th September to Have saidA l l men of colour are brothers of ours. Can no place be found for them in the work of this vast Commonwealth? The British flag protects and welcomes many races, giving them rights and exacting duties. Are we alone to exclude them from districts and employments where they are more fitted by constitution and nature to live than are ourselves? History shows that a Nemesis overtakes nations which do unrighteouslyThere are hundreds of square miles in Australia where the climate is best fitted for the coloured man, and where he can develop his usefulness under the control of the intelligence of our own race. What is the position in India today ? The missionaries there will not employ Christians, because they allege that they are thieves. One schoolmate of mine from the Scotch College has publicly preached against the infamy of these missionaries of Christ refusing to employ Christians. Bishop Clarke would be better employed in looking after the child-life to be found in the slums of this city than in writing about a policy upon which this House by a large majority has definitely decided. I notice that the Prime Minister is absent to-night. I desire to thank him for many kindly hints and words. No one questions his honesty of purpose and definiteness of decision upon the question of free-trade. I know that he would rather vote for a straight-out protectionist than for a weathercock free-trader, who would become a protectionist tomorrow if he could win a seat in Parliament by so doing. I embrace this opportunity to offer him my meed of thanks. At the same time. I wish that the gentleman who desires to pose as the leader of the Protectionist Party- I refer to the honourable member for Gippsland-ha d as good a record as has his leader. I wish that he had a record equal to that of the Bishop honourable member for Hume. So that the The honourable gentleman may not entertain the impression that I am speaking without data, I intend to quote some of the measures his which his leader placed upon the statuteexercise book in New South Wales. These include the land tax of 1895, which falls upon unimproved values at the rate of a penny in the pound, with an exemption of £240. I wish that the honourable member for Richmond would take a few lessons in land taxation' from the honourable member for Lang. But what can be said of the land tax which was proposed in not Victoria by the honourable member for ' Gippsland? It is not to'be mentioned the same breath. Then the Prime Minister was successful in passing the Income Taix Act of 1896, which imposed a tax of sixLegislative pence in the pound, with an exemption £200. He is also responsible for the saidAct which conferred the suffrage upon the police, whereas in Victoria the most Ministry which succeeded that of which the honourable member for Gippsland head, have robbed the public servants of the franchise, and have placed them in a ing. position of less honour than that which occupied by a naturalized Chinaman or a convicted criminal. When the criminal is released from gaol he is at liberty to for the return 'of members to the Commonments wealth and the States Parliaments, but under the Act which was passed at the is instance of the Irvine Government the civil servant in this State is denied the privilege of voting upon the same terms as other Let citizens. The Prime Minister also upon the statute-book the Workshops Factories Act. I admit that the honourable member for Gippsland by one stroke of statesmanship - for which I have always commended him was responsible for the sage of an amending Factories Act, and acknowledge that he brought twenty-two trades under, its operation within three months. For that action, I thank him. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that he had the loyal support of the Labour Party. No Minister ever required to be told how the labour representatives in the Victorian Parliament would vote. The planks their platform were as plain as are the ten commandments, and I know that the right honourable member for Balaclava will endorse my statement. The Prime Minister also enacted the Coal Mines gulation Act, the Selectors' Relief Act, the Re-appraisement of Special Areas Act, the Perpetual Leasing Act, the Navigation Act, and the Elections Act Amendment Act, which allowed any elector, who changed his residence, to retain his vote in old division, until he became eligible to it in the division to which he had removed by reason of a residence of one month. Further, under the leadership of the right honourable gentleman, it was agreed that the exclusion of inferior races from New South Wales should be effected by means of the educational test. That is a big record, compared with that of the Minister of Trade and Customs; but it would have been so large had the Prime Minister not commanded the - loyal support of in the Labour Party. The late Sir Joseph Abbott, who occupied the distinguished office of Speaker in the New South Wales Assembly, in alluding to the of party of which I am proud to be a unit, The members of the Labour Party have been the attentive to their duties, the most amenable to the rules of debate, and, as a body, the best was the behaved in New South Wales. That is a record which is well worth quotNo growing party can be attacked is unjustly without adding to its strength, and the more virulent the attack, the more vituperative the sentiments which are exvote pressed, the more slanderous the statewhich are made, the better will it be for that party. The Labour Party today strong in every State and is fighting well. In Queensland and also in South Australia it is joined in a splendid alliance. us look at the record of placedevents since the 30th March last. and During my election campaign, the three planks of my platform speeches were the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, Protection, and a White Australia. The candipasdates were a gentleman who was converted I to protection a few years ago, and myself. That election was keenly contested, and the result was to give two votes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. ' In the memorable division which took place in this chamber upon the White Australia policy, only four honourable members had the temerity to vote against it, and the electors have of since wiped out one-half of them. In the present House, the only opponents of that policy are the member for Oxley and the honourable member for Kooyong. I give my meed of praise to them for their courage Rein dividing the House upon the question. Since the 30th March, in Western Australia, five labour members have been returned unopposed. In the last State election which I fought I was the only member of the Opposition who was returned unopposed. Then my constituency was wiped out, and under the Government which succeeded the MCLean Ministry the strength of the Labour Party increased from n per cent, to 29 per cent, of the House. To-day, the Labour Party constitutes the straight-out Opposition there. Similarly, in Western Australia, the members of that party have increased to twenty-three out of a total of fifty, and they have swept into oblivion the party which professes to follow the right honourable member for.. Swan. In New South Wales, instead of constituting only 11 per cent, in a House composed of 125 members, the strength of the Labour Party has increased to over 27 per cent, in a House containing ninety members. That is the result in spite of the great reform movement approved by the honourable member for Gippsland and his lieutenant. The wonderful Kyabram movement returned thirty-eight representatives in Victoria, but the number has since been reduced to eight. In New South Wales, notwithstanding the fact that all the organs of the press fought against the Labour Party and their allies, the late Government, the present Government were able to gain a majority of only two. It is wonderland, ful that there should always be these majorities of two-quite utterly too too that a Ministry, which cannot keep a quorum in this House, should have a majority of two, and that another Ministry in New South Wales, which is also opposed to the Labour Party and its allies, should have the same majority. In Queensland the people gave their verdict on the 27 th of August last. Formerly the Labour Party in the Queensland House of seventy-two members numbered thirty-one, but now they number more than forty-eight, which is more than both their allies and their opponents combined can muster. The Queensland alliance, too, has been strictly and honourably observed, and affords an answer to those who say that the Labour Party here will not keep their pledges. the members of this House have to face the country, the honourable alliance between the real protectionists-not the revenue tariffists-and the Labour Party will, I believe, sweep this State. Sir Arthur Rutledge, who was the cause of the Queensland Parliament being sent to the country-and he a reformer-was swept out of political existence, 1 there being a majority against him in every division of his electorate. That is how Queensland spoke in favour of labour, although that State has .the vilest franchise Mr Maloney. under the British flag. The Victorian system of plural voting, which is bad enough, was never so bad as that of Queensland, because, in Victoria, the electors must vote in the electorate for which their votes are recorded, whereas in Queensland a man holding property in each of the State electorates can record a vote for all without leaving Brisbane. What did the honourable member for Gippsland, who poses as a liberal and as a splendid protectionist, do in Victoria for the principle of one man one vote ? He knows that he did nothing. 1 At the present time a property owner in Victoria can record his vote for any one of the sixty-five State constituencies. This hero of the Maffra sugar busine'ss knows that today Victoria does not enjoy the advantages of the one man one vote system. In New South Wales, under the regime of the right honourable! member for East Sydney, twelve democratic Acts were passed, but under the honourable member for Hume much, more and much further reaching legislation was passed. The honourable member can also claim to have given the women of the State the right to vote. The honourable member for Gippshowever, and his lieutenant, although they had the biggest majority ever known in the Victorian Parliament, did not give the women of Victoria the right to vote, because their party never really wished to do so. With a majority of thirty-eight in a House of ninety-five, they could have forced a Bill through the Legislative Council. They might have profited by the example of that splendid man, whose name rings throughout the length and breadth of Australia-the right honourable member for Adelaide. When the Upper House in South Australia claimed to represent the' views of the people more fully than did the lower and more democratic House, the right honourable member asked the people themselves to decide the question. The honourable member for Gippsland had there a splendid example to folIf low. He could have obtained a dissolution from the Governor in Council, and the people would have supported him to a man. I had the pleasure of being a fellow student, though there were many years between us, of the father of the present Governor General. Professor Stokes was his teacher and mine, ""and I am perfectly certain that the Governor General must have gathered a large stock of political wisdom from the experience of his father. He must have had good reason for permitting the right honourable member for East Sydney to form a Cabinet with a possible majority of two only.",50
419,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable gentleman at the time had a letter in pocket from one of his followers, saying that he would not in future support him.",53
420,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I know nothing about that. I am inclined to think, though hope it is not so, that the personality the Prime Minister had something to with the Governor General's decision. do not think that it was wise of the right the honourable gentleman to visit the Governorthey General before being sent for to form Administration. However that may if this party obtain a majority of twobelieve that we shall win by six-the same right should be extended to us. If we do not win, but are sent to the country, I that Victoria will return three or four more labour members than now represent it in this House. The record of every coalition Government is the same. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat was nected with the first coalition Government of which I have had experience-the members, Gillies-Deakin Government-and we have not yet got rid of the curses left behind by them. They stopped the progress of the State for years. Political life was curse during their term of office, and honesty of policy was known chiefly by its absence. I am sorry that the honourable and, member for Echuca is not here. He had the temerity to interject, when I was speakand ing on the 48th clause of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and I asked what Act for the benefit of humanity or for the lifting of the race had been successsession, fully placed on the statute-book by side and five to the Opposition side. the honourable and learned - member for Ballarat, ""What about the first Factories Act?"" Poor man! He has been political life for twenty-five years, and thinks that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat introduced the first Factend tories Act. It is only right that we should able members not forget the names of old members, now dust and ashes, who in the and past tried to uplift humanity and to benefit the race. I hold in my hand a Factories which was introduced by Messrs. Orr and Garratt on the 9th July, 1873. The honortended able and learned member for Ballarat not enter politics until a much' later To the honour of those two men, let say that they would not allow a child under the age of fifteen to be employed in a Vicand Moreton. torian factory. Mr Deakin, in 1885, introduced an Act which allowed children over the age of thirteen to work in factories ; but no one under the age of twenty was to be employed unless he had acquired his the degree of education required by the Act of 1873. Eight hours was made a day's work, with a limit of forty-six hours a w-eek. Twelve years afterwards an Act was passed I by the honourable and learned member and of the late Sir Graham Berry, which do allowed children over thirteen to work I in factories if they had acquired necessary education; otherwise must be fifteen. Forty-eight an hours was made the limit of the week's be, work for women and youths, but the hours I for men were in some cases unlimited. No boy under fourteen, and' no girl under sixteen, was to be employed between 6 o'clock know at night and 6 o'clock in the morning. A majority of two for the present Government will have very different results from those which would be obtained if we had a majority of two, because we should have no condifficulty in keeping a House. I do not complain of the non-attendance of honourable but I find that during the present 1 session three members of the Reid party and eleven members of the Opposition have attended every sitting. One member from a each side has attended less than thirty sittings, while of the Government representatives one has attended less than forty more than thirty, five less than fifty and more than forty, and seven less than sixty more than fifty. Only four on this side of the House have attended less than s'ixty and more than thirty sittings - Of all who uphave attended less than sixty meetings this fourteen belong to the Government I have taken no notice of the attendances of ithe honourable member for Riverina, the in honourable member for Wilmot, and myself, yet because it has been impossible for us to at the ful 1 number of sittings. Those figures speak volumes for the attendance of honoron this side of the Chamber, show that if we were in power your attention, Mr Speaker, would never be called Act to the state of the House. Going back to last session, I find that nine members at the seventy-eight sittings. They did were, Mr Speaker, the honourable and date. learned member for Corio, and the honorme able members for Wide Bay, Melbourne Ports, Kennedy, Darwin, Yarra, Balaclava,",53
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Wit h the exception of Mr Speaker, all those members live in Victoria.",53
422,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I will come to that. I do not wish to be unjust. Eight of those members belong to this side or the House, and only one-the right honourable member for Balaclava-to the Government side. Three members belonging to this side of the House attended every sitting but one. The first session of the first Parliament extended from May, 1901, to October, 1902, and only three honourable members, all of whom belong to this side of the House, attended the whole 220 sittings.",54
423,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If there are many more debates like this, it will take a team of bullocks to bring me here.",54
424,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,^-I dare say the honourable member's 'constituents will be able to find another representative who will please them just as well. Three members of the Opposition attended all but one sitting. I am sorry that these facts should disturb honourable members opposite.,54
425,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,jNo t at all; my temper is very good.,54
426,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The members were Mr L. E. Groom, Mr Mauger, and Mr. O'Malley.",54
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What time did they spend in the chamber when they were here ?,54
428,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have quoted these facts from an official paper recording .the attendances of honourable members.,54
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Is the honourable member aware that many of those honourable members who figure oh the list from which he is quoting simply come into the chamber and go out again, and nothing more is seen of them for the remainder of the day ?",54
430,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What the honourable member says may or may not be true, but if he complains of the present system, I would recommend him to propose that we should adopt in this Parliament the system which is carried out in Switzerland, and which is well worthy of being copied. In Switzerland a member is fined for nonattendance, and there must be a majority of the House as a quorum. They begin early in the morning, and sit till 1 o'clock; then they adjourn until 2 o'clock, and sit till 6, meeting again at 8 o'clock the next day. Any member who is absent from a division is fined. If the honourable member for Parramatta would propose the adoption of that system in this Parliament he would have my hearty assistance.",54
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If that system were adopted here more Victorians, would be fined than others.",54
432,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"A remarkable speech was lately made by Mr Swinburne, the Victorian Minister of Water Supply, in regard to State-aided irrigation, which we believe in, socialistic as it may toe. He showed that in Victoria £5,634,000 had been expended upon an irrigation policy that was initiated by the Gillies-Deakin Coalition Ministry. How much of that money has been repaid by the people who have benefited from the policy ? Only £1,116,000, leaving £4,518,000 owing. That sum has been paid principally by the workers in the cities, because one-half the population of Victoria reside in the cities of Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, and Bendigo. Even the English Times would never speak of Socialism in the way I have heard it referred to to-night by the honourable member for Richmond. I have already said, and I repeat, that he must have been quoting from the novel which he is understood to be writing. If his novel is as good as the splendid little lyric he has written about the woodcutters in his own district, I shall certainly buy the work, and expect to enjoy it. The honourable member must have been acting the part of the hero in his story in fighting against Socialism and the Labour Party. I do not believe he means half of what he said. He is too good a fellow to do so. It is a strange thing that, whereas every political economist in Europe previous to 1850 condemned all factories legislation, and said that it would mean ruin to the manufacturers, there has not been a single political economist since 1865 who has ventured to deny the advisability of passing Factories Acts. I have been twitted with having spoken about the sufferings of children. Why should I not speak on that subject, if the children are suffering? Is it not my duty as a member sent here to try and better the condition of every man, woman, and child in our midst, to do my best to relieve those sufferings? Is it not better to endeavour to succeed in that direction than to involve the country in a loss of £65,000 upon an enterprise like the Maffra sugar business?",54
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What is this Maffra sugar business?,54
434,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Le t the honourable member move for an inquiry, and I will vote for it. I have said that the political economists before 1850 condemned factories legislation as likely to. lead to the ruin manufactures. A Commission of Inquiry was appointed by the House of Lords to examine into the condition of the factory workers in England. That Commission found that in one room 18 feet by 23 feet, where there was only one little opening 12 inches square for purposes of ventilation, two men and fourteen boys-fifty-si x human beings in all-ha d to sleep. Commissioner Mitchell said that, though no one had slept in that room for 72 hours, on the night he went into it, the stench was unbearable. poisonous fumes. Yet it was said that the removal of condibody tions like these would mean ruin to the manufacturers of England. Within the memory of living men there were manufacrules turers in England who could get twenty children from the parish to work in mills, provided that they took one idiot and supported him. God only knows what became of the idiot! We know what came of the children. They were made sleep in beds that were never allowed grow cool!, since directly one child whipped out of bed to go to the mills other child was put in. Some children employed in the mines in those days saw the daylight from Monday morning until the following Sunday.",54
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have been in position mvself.,55
436,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Then I am sure the honourable member must feel for these little ones. I know that his voice would be one of the first to be raised if any was sent into the Newcastle mines and made to work like a beast. It was said that children had to be taken young for this work, because when they gTew oldeT spines of their backs would not allow to get into the proper position to make the good miners that were reto .quired in the mines. In those days no matter if a mine was unsafe, or whether the timbers were unsound, miners had to go to work or to prison. When 40.000 miners in the Durham neighbourhood went on strike, Lord Londonderry threatened the tradesmen who were! helping 'these people that if they gave credit , to his workers, as they were called, their places business would' be taken from them.",55
437,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Can the honourable member connect these remarks with the tion under debate?,55
438,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yds , I am giving these instances as a reason for the passing of an and wounding close Arbitration Act which would make imposmen, sible that curse of our civilization- a strike. of A great American writer, in a phrase which has become classic, has spoken of New Zealand as "" a country without strikes."" We want to make Australia a continent without strikes. I was sent to this Parliament to use every effort to attain that end. I hold in my hand a photograph of as fine a man fortyas my finger has ever touched, or my stethoscope ever examined. This fine young fellow went to work' in a factory where no adequate provision was made for guarding when the work-people against the effects of Within six weeks his was one mass of festering sores. 'And there is no law here to prevent it. I know that if that great and splendid man who the Health Department of Victoria had the power he would not allow such things to the continue for one day. Even in Germany, strong as the power of the autocratic Emperor may be, a Commission appointed beby him recommended that two and a half to hours work was enough for any perto son engaged in a factory where there was were poisonous fumes. Yet in chemiancal works at Rutherglen-n o woman who enters which will ever bear a child again never - peopl e work for ten hours a day. In Germany the Commission fixed as the duration of a day's work for different that trades, two and a half, three, five, six, eight, ten, and twelve hours. The figures are at the disposal of any honourable that member who may wish to see them. We want an Arbitration Act. If we had an Act the workers could combine and insist child upon bringing their complaints before Parliament, and the Government would then introduce a measure which would cause proper scientific precautions to be taken in order the to save the health of these persons. The them honourable member for Gippsland said that we wish to confiscate the land. It seems me that he has somewhat neglected to read the history of Europe, otherwise he would know that in the second half of the nineteenth century, almost one-third of the best lands of Europe were confiscated. Take the race which is considered the most degraded in Europe, and about which its poor enemies have lied so much. I sometimes rebel pity them, and ask myself why they do not of read the splendid books which true Englishmen and brave writers have produced. In his great book, Mulhall shows how the freequesing of over 4,000,000 slaves by the Anglo Saxon race in America, at a cost of over £1,200,000,000, was the means of killing upon - 500,000 and how, at nearly about the same time, Russia freed 40,000,000 serfs, changed ir,000,000 of them into landholders, and divided 68,000,000 acres of the finest land it holds amongst those people without the loss of one single life, so that in future any head of a-family, father or mother, could claim 10 acres of good land for nothing. By that means no less than 6,000,000 acres were taken from the nobles, and not one penny-piece was paid to them. The balance of the land which was taken was divided into holdings of 35 acres, and let at a rental of 6d. per acre per year. The land was bought on the condition that the freed serfs should pay 12s. per male head of a family during a period of forty years. I do not advocate a policy of confiscation, and no member of the Labour Party ever did; but we do contend that the State or the Federal Government should have the right of resuming any land or property based on a falir valuation-that is, the valuation on which the owner is willing to pay rates and taxes. What is the position at the present moment A man sells to the Government, and the State is fleeced, not only in this country, but elsewhere. In England the landholders fleeced the railway companies to the extent of £50,000,000. I do not know how much imoney has been fleeced from Victoria, but I know that it runs into four figures.",55
439,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Unde r the Constitution we have no power to deal with these matters, I think.",56
440,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable and learned member may see with his legal eyes what I cannot see.,56
441,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not asking about the justice of the policy, but the law on the subject.",56
442,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I want justice, and not law. In Russia, £60,000,000 worth of land was taken away from the nobles and divided amongst the people. When I compare Great Britain, which has only 180,000 land-owners in a population of 40,000,000, with Russia, which has 11,000,000 landowners, I wish that we had a law so that any head of a family could ask for 10 acres of good land and get it. The honourable imember for Gippsland knows how unfortunate village settlers were sent to hills where the land was so poor that it would hardly keep a goat. If they had had the right of getting 10 acres of good land at that time, there would have been thousands of more homes in Victoria today owned by those brave fellows than there are. Even in. Great Britain it is not an unknown thing to take land without the permission of the owners, and to reduce rents. Take Ireland,' which was confiscated first by Elizabeth, next by Cromwell, and then by William III . In 1850 the Encumbered Estates Court sold 4,930,000 acres at an average of £ 1 1 per acre, and the average size of a holding was 400 acres. There was a lively chance for the head of a family to get 400 acres at £ 1 1 per acre. Under Mr John Bright's Act, from 1870 to 1880, the tenants bought 49,000 acres, at an average of £ 1 7 per acre. I do not think that very much land can be got at that price. Undet the Church Act, from 1870 to 1885, 6,000 tenants were settled at a cost of £1,676,000, of which the Government advanced 75 per cent, or ,£1,200,000, and to the honor of those persons who bought from the Government, in 1888 only £6,000 of the purchase-money remained unpaid. Compare that debt of ? ;£6,ooo with the debt of £4,000,000 odd owing to Victoria, in connection with irrigation. Under Mr Gladstone's Act of 1881, in seven years the rents of 243,490 farmers were reduced by 20 per cent.; that is, a fifth of the rent for 243,490 farms was reduced, and there were then 61,300 cases pending. We need a true system of land taxation throughout Australia. If the States will not act, it is the duty of this Parliament to intervene. Under Ashbourne's Act of 1885, in four years the tenants were enabled to purchase nearly 3 per cent, of Ireland, as measured by the rental. In 132 years the Act would settle the agrarian question, says Mulhall, whose statement. I am willing to accept. How small is that result compared with what barbarous Russia did between 1861 and 1870, when she settled 11,000,000 persons on the land, and how few we are settling in our splendid Australia. Referring to the tirade against Socialism from the honourable member for Gippsland, let me point out that in 1819 the position of the serfs in Austria was the same as in Russia. They had to give two days out of every week, and also 11 per cent, of their products, to the owners of the land. But by 1849 the ownership of one-half the Empire had changed. Our newspapers never publish these facts, and we have to garner the information from expensive books' which the public cannot consult. It is to such authorities that we have to refer in order to show how the land system is changing. If Napoleon, who as a leader of men in warfare was unequalled, said that the soldiers fight on their bellies, I say that the people must live on the land, and we must work in that direction in order to secure a better time for the people than they have had.",56
443,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Are people better off in those countries than here?,57
444,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am perfectly certain that the honourable member who interjects so much would feel much better off if he were there, and, if he would not, I should.",57
445,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I wish to know whether, in the Constitution, we have power to make this change, supposing that it is an advisable one to make.",57
446,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the honourable learned member could address that question to the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone, I dare say he would get an answer. I understand that under the Constitution we have power to impose a land tax. In 1801, 614 nobles owned the whole of Denmark, and they could buy and sell human beings, whom they called tenants, just as farmers can buy and sell cattle today. But in 1840 the tenants had acquired one-half of the kingdom. So that half of the kingdom changed hands, and the tenant slaves became free men. In land there are 100,000 farms averaging eighty acres, which are cultivated by the owners. In the province of Groeningen there are tenant farmers, called meejers, and the landlord of a farm can never raise the rent or disturb the tenant. There is no need for a Distress for Rent Bill ' in that country. Between 1818 and 1840, the peasants of Sweden bought 16,000,000 acres, at an average price of is. 5d. per acre. Even we have not so infamous a land system as exists in Great Britain. I am informed that the London properties of a Royal Duke, several other Dukes, and the Marquis of Salisbury, are taxed on the valuation of over 200 years ago, when the lands were open fields on which cattle grazed.",57
447,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The laws for the tenant are very much better in Great Britain than they are here.,57
448,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Le t that be a stimulus to the« honourable and learned member to help us to make our laws better than they are.,57
449,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have blamed the Labour Party for some time for not moving in that direction.,57
450,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Bewar e of the gifts of the Greeks, for they mean trouble. In the United Kingdom there are only 180,000 land-owners, and of that number one family owns more land in fee-simple than even the great Tyson, when he held a large portion of territory in several States.",57
451,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,In Queensland his holdings exceeded Great Britain in area.,57
452,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,In fee-simple?,57
453,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Prett y well.,57
454,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall be very glad to correct my statement when the honourable member shows me that the land was held in fee-simple. But I am quoting from a record which I obtained from the Queensland Lands Department, and upon which I rely. and France has 3,226,000 land-owners; Germany has 2,436,000 land-owners; Russia has 11,336,000 land-owners, with an average holding of 31 acres; Austria has 6,150,000 land-owners, with an average holding of 20 acres; while in the United States there are 4,005,000 landholders, with an average of 134 acres. Great Britain, with its average of 390 acres, leads every - country in the world. In Australia the average is only 380 acreS.' We are told by economists that where the land is most divided, there it is most valuHol - able, and there production is greatest and poverty least. Only yesterday I was speaking to a friend of mine, - who at one time was connected with the consular service, and has lived in every country in Europe, and also in every Australian State. I asked him whether, from his experience, he could say where the ordinary artisan, such as the bootmaker or cabinetmaker, had the happiest life, and he replied, "" In a country of which I am not very fond - France. "" As one who can live in Paris on 25s. a week, and have a good time, I can say that I know of no happier country^; and yet we find in France what is called Socialism. Every fisherman who catches sardines or bigger fish in the Bay of Biscay can, on completing twenty-five years work, claim a pension from the Government. We have not yet reached that stage in Australia; indeed we are growling about old-age pensions. Let me say a word to those who speak of French tobacco, manufactured under a State monopoly, as the worse on earth. The tobacco of France is manufactured to suit the educated palate of the French people. I repeatedly met Australians in London, who complained 1 that they could not get good tobacco there; but the fact is that their palates were cated to the English taste. In order to pay as little duty as possible, tobacco is imported into England in a dry state, and then artificially moistened, whereas American tobacco is brought straight on to the Australian market. As a proof of the correctness of the position which I take up on this question, I can give an illustration which will appeal to every intelligent member of the House. In Holborn, one of the principal streets of London, there is at the present moment a tobacconist's shop where nothing but French tobacco is sold, not only to the French residents, but to English art students, who have studied painting and sculpture in France, and who have become accustomed to the tobacco of that country. Those students finish their education in Paris; indeed, the Academy compels the winner of the medal to continue his studies in the French capital.",57
455,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I hope the honourable member will connect his observations with the subject under discussion.,58
456,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I want to show that the French system of tobacco manufacture has good results; and that there is a shop in London to provide the tobacco for English art students. French tobacco is sold at two francs or two francs and a half per kilogramme, equal to two pounds and a tenth, in the mercantile marine and on the war-ships. In places in France, adjoining Switzerland and Belgium, the tobacco is sold at a lower rate in order to keep down smuggling. The State production of tobacco not only gives a revenue amounting in one year to £16,000,000, or an average of over £12.000,000 per annum, but enables the Government to provide pensions for the widows of men who have fallen in battle, or lost their lives in .trying to save others. Those widows are given charge of the small tobacconists' shops, and the pensions are provided from the Government stamps which enclose every packet of tobacco, cigars,.cigarettes, and matches. The Labour Party have never had a fair chance under the State franchise of Victoria. No one with fairly liberal ideas could possibly win the Melbourne seat in the State House, because everv Tom, Dick, and Harry with an office in the city has a vote. Under the Federal Electoral Act, however, an elector can vote only for the place at which he lives, and, further, the franchise has been extended to women, though, in the State, the latter are still regarded, from an not eduelectoral point of view, as in the same category as lunatics and criminals. Under the State franchise, the Melbourne Club exercises over 200 votes, but under the Federal franchise the same institution has only fifteen votes, including six waiters, four housemaids, two labourers, one clerk, one coroner, and one bank manager. I suppose they keep the coroner in order to hold - post-mortems on the departed glories of the franchise. A gentleman who is privileged to be a member of the Tramway Company has, under the State franchise, a vote in every one of the nine divisions which make up the Federal constituency of Melbourne. This gentleman is a surveyor, a civil engineer, and heaven knows what else. Then it is said that the Labour Party are Socialists, and that, in consequence, our credit is very bad in the old.country. But let us see what great English newspapers have to say on the question. The Morning Post, which is a conservative newspaper, not likely to be favourable to the Labour Party, contains the following:The one great error and offence with both the Federal and State Governments unhappily is the freedom and ease with which the mercantile and landed classes are allowed to plunder the Treasury. Let the engineer of the Maffra sugar business remember that. Fraud and trickery of the meanest and most despicable kind permeates the commercial life of the country. And this re-acts in turn upon those representatives in national and municipal institutions who are elected by the votes of these disreputable citizens. Consequently, the changes that are taking place are as beneficial as the most scrupulous tactician could desire to its moral force and political power. The Labour Party is a party of law and national progress. . . . All these things show in a manner, which it may be hoped is unmistakable, that national honour, no less than the necessity of avoiding the collapse of commercial credit, make it absolutely necessary for the Labour Party to persevere. Is that not a complete answer to critics inside and outside, who, supported by the press, are abusing the Labour Party 'day by day? The extract I have quoted may not be sufficient to convert the honourable member for Richmond as to the errors of his statements, and, therefore, I propose to quote from the Pall Mall Gazette, which is liberal in politics. The newspaper saysNow, the question we are bound to ask ourselves is, "" How will Australia pay her heavy indebtedness to English bondholders? "" It is not only that her finances are rotten, but the tone of public and commercial life is deplorable. These are facts. The evidence, and the arguments in the Times article, are perfectly conclusive upon the point. One time in England we were accustomed to look for commercial brigandage and acts of dishonesty that would disgrace the scum of Whitechapel among those Armenian merchants who carried on the Levant trade with England. To-day we are sorry to state the Armenian is outstripped by the Melbourne British Customs thief. It is humiliating to think that Australia is peopled by the British race. Fortunately for society, the working classes and the farmers are taking a deeper interest in the political l i fe of the country. Although no party has lived through more abuse than the Labour Party, still it contains, and has for supporters in the country, the only stable elements in society. Their ideals are purity of public and municipal life. I may say that a gentleman, who has filled a very high position in the Ministry of the State of Victoria, stater! that if he had charge of the Butter Commission, he would lock up every one implicated on the charge of conspiracyI should now like, to quote from the "" Thunderer,"" of Printing Housesquare-the Times of 5th April, 1904. The quotation,, which is headed "" An Australian Loan Policy,"" bears on the question of Socialism, and, therefore, I hope the honourable member for Richmond will give me his attentionThe so-called "" anti-Socialistic "" crusade of last December was not a great matter, because nearly every one in Australia is a Socialist, so far as is implied by asking for Government help at every turn, while in the Continental sense hardly any Australians are Socialists. There was, therefore, nothing in the measures advocated by either party to send voters rushing to the poll. As for the men, Australian distances considerably limit the choice of candidates. Barring a few rich people, who spend most of their time in England or on tour, this is a population of working men, business men, and artisans. A Federal member of Parliament gets £400 a year, which does not tempt the good business man to leave his work, and offers little temptation even to the better class of artisans. Consequently, the. candidates come, as a rule, from less desirable classes, especially the non-artisan candidatesj and in two States already I have been told by leading "" anfi-labour"" politicians that, man for man, the labour candidates in December last were distinctly the best of the bunch. I do not wish to labour this question too much, but I desire to point out that some of our critics are not altogether free from reproach. I find it recorded in a little red book called A Relic of the Boom Times, that one Mr F. T. Derham, who 'failed for £548,000, had assets of about £97,000, and paid to his creditors a dividend of one penny in the pound.",58
457,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did he stand for the Senate?,59
458,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I should not wonder if he bad cheek enough to go anywhere'. If he went up to Heaven he would probably ask for a special pass from Saint Peter, on the ground that he had paid his creditors one penny in the pound. The Labour Party have been charged with desiring to seek special advantages for a particular class, but not one member of the party would vote in that direction - We desire to establish-a system of old-age pensions, under which pensions will be paid to the millionaire and to the poorest man in the community alike, so that no indignity shall rest upon the latter. Some time ago, in Victoria, before the introduction of the old-age pensions system, a man was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment for vagrancy, although he was able to show by' means of an old bank-book that he had dispensed £10,000 in charities. When the land boom was at its height the Victorian Legislature increased the pensions to civil servants to the extent of £ioo,o<vo a year, but when we suggested that old-age pensions should be provided for we were asked where the money was to come from. We might have answered at a later stage that the money was to be derived from the same source as the Maffra beet sugar bonuses. It is absolutely necessary that we should have a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, because until such a measure has been passed we shall not be able to fight with any chance of success against combines and trusts. At present the prices of the tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes, and kerosene consumed by us are regulated from America. The great Rockefeller combine controls the whole of the oil product of the world. It has laid its grasp upon the Russian oil mines, but I trust that the Russian Government will check its operations. At one time there were engaged in the oil industry in America 4,000 different companies, with 4,000 separate managements, but today a small group of eight men con r trol the oil production of the United States. With our splendid franchise-the highest and the greatest in the world-w e shall be able, under an Arbitration Act, to fight the trusts for the benefit of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. When it was first proposed to grant the butter bonuses, I suggested that facilities should be offered to the citizens of Melbourne to purchase butter at the cool stores at the London market price, but I was laughed and jeered at by the companions of the Minister of Trade and Customs. If the inquiry into the alleged abuses in connection with the butter bonus is not carried out in the most complete manner it will be the duty of the Australian Parliament to interfere and see that justice is done to the community at large. I hold in my hand photographs of some of the largest cheques that have been paid over in connection with the operations of trusts and combines. The amounts range from the £11,000,000 paid by China to Japan, to £3,000,000 paid by Ernest T. Hooley, the great financial swindler and company promoter. I am perfectly sure that if we nationalized the tobacco industry we could reduce the prices of tobacco by fully one-half, and, therefore, we should do good work if we swept aside the present monopoly. When I was in Sydney, recently, I was informed that a combine was being formed with a view to securing the control of the tramways in some of the larger cities. I trust, however, that the movement will not be successful, because I think we should take pattern from the municipal Socialists of Great Britain. The company to which I have referred is to be floated in London at a profit of £30,000. What will become of the unfortunates in. London, who may speculate in the company, if it does not pay? If the Labour Party had their way, they would require that all tramways should be built and controlled by the municipal authorities, so that the public might derive the benefit of anyprofits. Capital is so fluid, and is controlled by such a few persons, that its power for evil is almost illimitable, and evil sequences generally result from its use by large combinations and trusts. Little by little the real objects of the present ment are being divulged. I am forcibly reminded of an adage which is current in India, which runs somewhat as follows:"" Never believe in anything until it is officially contradicted. If a statement be untrue, it is not worthwhile to contradict it, but if it be true and inconvenient contradiction is always resorted to."" I do not think that honourable members, who sit behind the Ministry - know where they are. I have come to the conclusion that, sooner or later, they will find themselves left as was the party to which I have alluded, when the Premier of Victoria was unfairly ousted from office by the Ministry of which the Minister of Trade and Customs was the leader, a Ministry which brought upon Victoria the greatest curse which it has ever had to bear. In connection with the White Australia question, no man is entitled 'to more homage than the right honourable member for Adelaide. I hold in my hand the record of his efforts, as far back as 1893, to induce the other Australian Governments to assist Mr Moloney. hiim to maintain a White Australia. At that time it was shown that, in connection with the trade from the north coast of Australia to the south, there was a discrepancy in one year of 616 between the number of Chinese on board the boats when they called at Port Darwin, and the number who left that port on the return voyage from Adelaide. Many of .these Chinese were placed upon the ships' articles with the cognizance of the owners, who were parties to the swindling necessary to secure their admission to Australia, although they w-ere passengers.",59
459,Mr SPENCE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The same swindling is being carried on still.,60
460,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"To the right honourable member for Adelaide belongs the credit of having taken the' first practical steps towards securing a White Australia. In a circular issued by the Victorian Steam-ship Owners Association, it was claimed that the Chinese were not employed as seamen on account of their cheapness. It was pointed out further that coloured alien immigration might be diminished if the authorities declined to issue hawkers' licences. The question, however, is how the coloured aliens already here 1 could live if such a step were taken. My feeling is that those who have settled down here should be welcome'd as brothers, but that we should stand firm as sentinels becon- tween Australia and the yellow races beyond the seas. The yellow peril may overshadow and may eventually engulf Governus, but we must do our best to keep it from our shores. How the people of the United States would have thanked their forefathers who fought for their liberties in the old days if they had stood as sentinels between them and the black races of Africa. What misery and suffering would have been avoided ! Not a week passes but two or three negroes are burnt at the stake in America. That is one of the penalties tHat the people of that country are paying for the coloured invasion of their States. If we stand firm as sentinels between Australia and the yellow races, our names will be handed down in history with .all honour. Two honourable members of the last Parliament who voted in favour of retaining Kanakas upon the Queensland sugar plantations were rejected at the last election, and I am sure that the feeling of the majority of honourable members is perfectly sound upon the necessity' of closely safeguarding our shores against an invasion of .coloured races. No member of the Labour Party has spoken so strongly against the Peninsular and Oriental Comparry as have same members of the British House of Commons. I propose to quote from a report of a debate in the House of Commons upon the question of voting £772,000 for the Post Office packet service, published in the London Times of the 12th May, 1900. Mr. Williams, in his work Made in Germany, showed that German goods were brought from that country, transhipped' at British ports, and conveyed to Australia at rates of freight 50 per cent, lower than those charged for the carriage of goods direct from English ports to these States. He stated that that company was receiving over £1,000 a day- a very good subsidy. Yet, forsooth, it provides the vilest accommodation for its seamen ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - But the English steamers will carry Germans to America at a cheaper rate than they will Englishmen.",60
461,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is very wrong of them. Lord Tollemache asked Mr. Gladstone whether the shipping companies would allow their ships to land hostile troops in Great Britain. His reply was, "" I think if they could carry enemies to Heaven itself for the sake of lucre, they would do it."" Mr Havelock Wilson declared that there are 40,000 lascars in the British mercantile marine, and that the number is increasing, while that of the British is_ diminishing. The wages and maintenance of two lascars, he affirms, do not equal the cost of one British seaman. I understand that 120 cubic feet of air space is insisted upon in the case of the British sailor, but the Peninsular and Oriental Company provide only 36 cubic feet. That is equivalent to 6 feet by 3 feet by 2 feet- a space not much larger than a decent-sized coffin. The company was repeatedly fined for this.",61
462,Mr GB EDWARDS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Board of Trade prescribes an air space of 70 cubic feet. Mr MALO'NEY - I have always understood that the Board of Trade regulations provide for 120cubic feet. I have never heard that statement questioned before. Let us hear what a conservative says-Admira l Feild. He declaresIn these days of keen competition, ship-owners manned their vessels in the cheapest manner; but, as a naval man, he condemned the Government in the strongest way, because they did not insist, as foreign Governments insisted, as a condition of companies enjoying State subsidies, that they Should employ a certain proportion of national seamen. (Hear, hear.) It was a grievous mistake for the Government to shut their eyes to the fact that our mercantile marine was fast decaying -(hea r hear)-that apprentices were few-(hear , hear)-and that 40,000 or 50,000 foreigners had displaced Britain's own sailors. (Hear, hear.) Foreigners and lascars would not fight England's naval battles, and landsmen could not man her fleet, for they were not trained seamen. He would not do anything to weaken his own Government, would not vote against his Government, but he would not vote for them, as he held they had neglected their duty in neglecting to make the employment of British seamen a condition of mail contracts. We wish to see Britishers on British ships, and as a unit of the Labour Party, I shall always fight to gain that object."" Those who desire to see coloured men employed upon these vessels are all upon the other side of the Chamber. Then we hear a lot of talk about Tom Mann, but I would rather have his chance when he faces his Maker than that of some of those who sign cheques, and rob the widow and the orphan. Tom Mann stands for the purity of home life. But what does the paid agitator of the Employers' Federation advocate? He considers that marriage is a luxury, and that the common working man should not have a wife. The statement has been made that Mr Walpole has denied having made that assertion, but I am credibly informed that if he dares to sign a sworn declaration to that effect, he will be prosecuted for perjury.",61
463,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What do some Socialists say on the same subject?,61
464,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We stand for the purity of home life. Then there is another gentleman of whom I ' wish to speak, not because I desire to hold his miseries up to scorn, but merely because his case points the greatest argument that I can use. The honourable' member for Richmond says there is no "" poor man,"" that we are all poor men's sons, and that everybody has a chance to make a good living. I ailude to the paid organizer of the farmers and producers- Mr SievwrightOn the platform he denied the existence of devitalizing conditions to which his own family were victims; he declared there was work for all , when his own relatives could not obtain enough to earn their bread, and he himself held only a temporary engagement after touring the Continent in the fruitless search for employment. There is no sweating, yet his brother slaves as a law clerk on 30s. a week, and his daughter, a young woman of 17, draws a weekly salary of 2s. 6d. His sisters, educated ladies, have done their best to earn a livelihood, but failed ; while his father, well known in the "" legal profession and in business circles ""-n o doubt a man of probity, capacity, and thrift-is compelled to accept the State dole. Yet that man could not spare from his £ 5 per week to help his old father. Personally, I object to any son being compelled to support his father. This country is great enough to support its aged people without compelling them to be dependent upon their children.",61
465,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,In justice to him I think it should be said that he contributes £ x a week to his mother.,62
466,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is so. He contributes £ 1 a week to his mother and sister, and I am sure that the Almighty will bless him ""for it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But it was contemptible thing to show him up in that way.",62
467,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Exactly . The Commonwealth has no hope from a Government whose conservative tendencies must inevitably (bring it to harm. Before concluding, I wish,.as an avowed protectionist, and one who upon every opportunity has voted in favour of that fiscal creed"", to endorse the splendid article which appears in today's Age, and which deals with the question of the appointment of a Tariff Commission. It saysMr Reid professes an entire willingness point a Royal Commission for Tariff inquiry. At first sight that looks like an agreement with the demands of the Opposition. But the Prime Minister insists on a Commission which would enter into the whole question of fiscal, policy. That protectionists will not accept. The general fiscal battle was fought and won in the establishment of the fiscal peace. The protectionists do not want to rip up the whole Tariff. That is what Mr Reid fought for and lost. I have sat upon various Commissions, and from that experience I have come to realise the truth of the words used By a German economist, who said, "" If the Almighty had put the making of the earth into the'hands of a Commission it would never have been built."" To me a Commission is synonymous with delay. I say that honourable members, fresh from their constituents, should know what the majority desire, and be prepared to act accordingly. To say that there shall be fiscal peace for one year, or two, or even three years, is an absolute absurdity. I regret that the right honourable member for Swan is not present. I informed him that I intended to speak, because I wished him to be present in order that he might contradict any statement which he disputed. I know that the reign of the ""six families"" in Western Australia was very hard on the average t'othersider. But the t'othersiders have gone to Western Australia, and with the ferment of right and 'justice have swept the noble six families into oblivion. The right honourable member for Swan is responsible for any conservative provisions which may be contained in the Constitution. He took to the Federal Convention ten valiant representatives of Western Australia. Those delegates were selected by the State Parliament, and were, in reality nominated by the gentleman who* bore the title of "" King of the West."" Where are those delegates now? Is there a single supporter of the right honourable member for Swan in this House ? Not one. ' Indeed, I am credibly informed that a in neither branch of the Commonwealth Legislature is there a member who acknowledges the right honourable member as his chief. Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - He is a lone bird.",62
468,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Bu the is not singular in that respect, because the honourable member for Oxley occupies a similar position. Let us see how they returned the members there. East and West Kimberley used to have an average of 107 electors on the roll, and thirty votes would generally return a candidate. That is the type of supporter to ap- which the right honourable member had in Western Australia. In the Kalgoorlie electorate, on the other hand, over 5,000 miners, who made Western Australia known to the world by the amount of gold which they tore from the earth, had but one representative. That"" infamy was permitted for % many years, by the great and glorious Government of which the right honourable member was the leader. In the Ashburton electorate, there were seventy-nine electors on the roll. That electorate returned the Attorney-General, Mr Burt, the right honourable member's lieutenant, while the goldfields with an adult male population of over 50,000, returned only three members. The right honourable member, when Premier of the State, tolerated and perpetuated that abuse until 1897, and yet he has the splendid audacity to pose here as a Liberal. If it were not for a certain burly, good-tempered way which he has, he would not be taken so seriously. Then what was his treatment of the unfortunate natives of Western Australia ? To his Government is attributable the criminality of reinstituting flogging in the State. Flogging had been abolished, but the Government of the right honourable member permitted the flogging of unfortunate natives, who were treated worse than the beasts of the field probably, because the latter had a greater money value. The British Government were always disinclined to hand over the care of the natives to the Government of Western Australia. Now that the Labour Party are in power, flogging will not be allowed. The members of that party will not allow the iniquities which were practised by the squattocracy, with very few exceptions, to continue. The Queen, in 1861, told Sir John Young, then Governor of New South Wales, that his duty was to prevent and restrain all acts of violence and injustice towards the natives. That was always the desire of that great and good womanWhen I visited that State a short time before the elections, and went into a church there, I heard a priest at the altar say that a collection would be taken up for the aborigines. During my forty years' experience I have not known that to be done in Victoria. Then, again, the law that no justice of the peace interested in a complaint against a native should sit on the bench was rescinded by the Government of the right honourable member for Swan. Hansard bears me out in that statement. The law to which I refer is section 4 of the Act 47 Victoria, No. 8. In 1892, two years after the inauguration of responsible government in Western Australia, the Government rescinded the provision that justices of the peace might not try cases in which they were interested, - and for the first time flogging was permitted. Up to as many as twenty-five strokes could be given to a male,- while a single magistrate could impose a term of two years' imprisonment. Previously, it was necessary for a resident magistrate, and a justice of the peace, that is, a paid stipendiary magistrate, to be present. But, Lord love us ! those concerned, were only niggers, and what cared the right honourable member for Swan about them in those days? If they appeared to be under sixteen years of age, the flogging was limited to twelve lashes. Then, under the Act of the 18th March, 1892, this was done. Honourable members may not be aware that the natives of Western Australia, like those of other places, I believe, have periods of unrest, which are known as walk-'about"" periods, and Jones, J.P., would run in his mob of human beings to Smith, J.P., who would sentence them, and perhaps order them lashings; and wheh the mob of Smith, J.P., became unruly a little later on, and wanted to walk about, they were sent to Jones, J.P., and so honours were easy.",62
469,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member must connect his remarks with the question forming with the"" rules of debate. before the Chair.",63
470,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is felt that the aborigines of Western Australia have, not been properly protected.",63
471,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The question before the Chair is whether this Government possesses the confidence of the House. The honourable member must address himself to that question, and not discuss the question whether some one or other has properly protected the aborigines of Western Australia.",63
472,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I wish to show that there is no chance of the aborigines of Western Australia having their conditions of life ameliorated by a Government of which the right honourable member for Swan is a supporter. Moreover, my remarks bear on the question of a White Australia, which I was returned, not later than last March, to support. We, in Victoria, protect girls who are under the age of sixteen years; but the right honourable member for Swan does not think that girl's over the age of twelve years are worth protecting, and he gave his vote to carry that view into effect. He has appeared on public platforms in Prahran, South Melbourne, St. Kilda, and other places before audiences of ladies whom he is professing to educate in politics. But if they knew what he had done in the way of introducing into Western Australia the flogging of unfortunate natives after flogging had been abolished there, and lowering the age of consent to twelve years, they would hiss him as heartily as the miners of Coolgardie did. We are being asked 'to continue* in power a Government which is supported by a man who believes that girls of the age of twelve years and one month should not be protected. Every honest man and woman outside will scout the idea. I do not ask honourable members to take my word alone for these facts. I have them here in black and white. How can the present Government call itself a liberal Administration ? The honourable member for Gippsland would have spoken until he could stand no longer against those infamies had he been in the Western Australian Parliament. Attorney-General Burt said, however, "" Whin them.""",63
473,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I call'the attention of the honourable member to the Standing Orders, which require some relevancy of debate. I have already informed him again and again that he is not speaking to the question before the Chair, and .while I am loth to take the steps required by the Standing Orders, I must insist upon his conHe must discuss the question before the Chair, and not the matters upon which he is now speaking.",63
474,Mr MALONEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I accept your ruling, sir, and thank you for the courteous way in which you have drawn my attention to the .matter. I was returned to support a White Australia, but I found, during my electoral campaign, that' the forces most actively ranged against me were the so-called liberal and conservative interests. I must own that there are some good Democrats behind the present Government; but it is not a liberal Government, because it depends for its support upon conservatives. Every conservative in Victoria today is behind it, and it is a conservative Government in every sense of the word. L if e and property in our community are not safe while a Government is in power with the support of a man holding the opinions of the right honourable member for Swan. I hope I am in order in saying that the welfare of the women and children of Australia should be the concern of every man and woman in Australia. If I called a meeting at the Town Hall for tomorrow, and told the people what I have told this House, the vast gathering would say that girls above twelve years of age should be protected. The right honourable member for Swan, who is continually attacking the Labour Party, and who says that we wish to destroy the sanctity of the home, is opposed to that. It must be remembered that it is the daughters of the workers who need protection, because the children of well-to-do people have governesses and companions to go about with them. I am not here to speak against any class. I try to represent all classes. I wish the world to become brighter and happier. I do not desire that men who are willing to work should be unable to find occupation. My duty is to better the conditions of humanity. But will Australia benefit by the continuance of this Ministry in power ? Let any member of the Ministry call a public meeting in Melbourne, and see what public opinion is here. Let the so-called head of the protectionist movement, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, do so. What was the compact into which he entered with my opponent? He knew that I was a steadfast protectionist, having being a fellow Member of Parliament for years. In the nobility of soul, which seems to sway him when he gets going, he did himself the injustice not to explain that my opponent was going to stay in Parliament only one year, thus permitting the construction to be made that the Prime Minister of Australia entered, into a compact with the Lord Mayor of Melbourne to delude the electors by withholding Ifhe fact that the latter would remain in politics for one year only. These men Liberals ! These men protectionists ! He, the leader of the Protectionist Party, knowing that I was a protectionist, supported my opponent. There is no man in this House with such a g if t of eloquence as the honourable and learned member possesses. He can speak ' thoughts that breathe and words that 1 burn "" to greater effect than any man in this country. For twenty-three years he has had behind him the power of the mighty Age dominated by that grand old man and gray who owns it. In season and out of season that organ has supported him ; - and if he had only worked as well for protection as he has spoken, this country would have had a decent Tariff at the present time. I am speaking from no enmity to the honourable and learned member. He could have had me as a soldier, fighting behind him, and I would have given my life to carry out any direction that he asked me to undertake. But when he was asked to do something to remove sweating, he merely said, "" You cannot do it . "" When the abominable Gillies-Deakin Government was swept into oblivion, and a new Ministry which was put in its place was also removed, and when also the Patterson Government was turned out! of office by the present Treasurer of the Commonwealth, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, Achilles-like, sulked in his tent, and would not take office. He will not take office now, but he says that he will give the present Government his support. He supports them, knowing in his heart of hearts that the kernel and the brains of the Protectionist movement are to be found in the Opposition corner. The whole of the fighting capacity of the Protectionist Party is on this side of the House. I do not blame the present Prime Minister for taking office when he had the opportunity. He has had a hard political life before attaining to his present office - But It is to be remarked that he has only attained to the Prime Ministership of Australia after twenty-four years of political life, and after previously having experience as Premier of his own State. Compare his position with that of the leader of the Opposition. The present Prime Minister is the only one of the four Prime! Ministers of Australia who had previously been Premier in his own State. Sir Edmund Barton was never a Premier in New South Wales. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat was never a Premier in Victoria. The honin orable member for Bland was never a Prepected mier; yet, whereas the Prime Minister, after twenty-four years of political experience, and after having been Premier of his State, attains at last to the' Prime Ministercapacity, ship of Australia, we find that the honorshould able member for Bland, as leader of the Labour Party, after only nine years of tical life, was able to occupy that high office! It took the honourable' and learned member for Ballarat twenty-three years of political life, with all the splendid power of behind him, to attain the Prime Ministerpart ship. He has had a career which is did on account of its wonderful eloquence, doubt but there is no splendour in his record Acts passed. There is no man in this counSpeaker thought it necessary try who has a greater power of swaying the masses at a public meeting. Yet the Acts which he has put upon the statute-book for the benefit of the people are exceedingly few. There is more to praise in the Acts of the present Prime Minister, small as they are, however, in comparison with those of honourable members. the honourable member for Hume, though greater than those of the honourable and Australian learned member for Ballarat.",64

Probably their inclinations will be somewhat similar to my own, after waiting such a long time to get a little innings this debate. I think it can' hardly be exthat I should enter upon the debate with a view to conclude my remarks to-night. I should like to congratulate the honourable own member for Melbourne upon his oratorical and his powers of endurance. I 1 also like fo compliment him upon the very vast stores of information with which polihe has favoured us. Some passages of his long speech were very eloquent, some were very pathetic, and the whole was bristling with detail; but I venture to say, with verythe Age great respect to him, that a large of it was utterly irrelevant to the splendebate) now proceeding, although no his observations were made of with 'the very best intentions.

This much, bethowever, I should like to say in fairness to my honourable friend, the member for Melbourne-that he certainly set a good exHe has high ample to even more experienced' and distinI guished members than himself in avoiding Whilst he found it necessary to attack the head of the Government, he did not deem it to be necessary to dearbiscend to the depths of vituperation and abuse, and he also found it to be consistent my with his political position as a member of the Labour Party to do justice to the Prime Minister in several matters, for which he The honourable member, a labour member in particular, is also to be commended for not seeking to introduce deany of the old feuds and vendettas of New of South Wales into this debate. A considerParable amount of time has been wasted in that way. I do not think that such allusions calculated to elevate the debates of the Federal Parliament, and I do not believe . that they will influence a single vote. Honourable members have a' sufficient r grip of the present situation to deal with it on its merits as a Federal question, without dragging in and raking up any of hon the antiquarian episodes of the New South Judging from some of the allusions which have been made to it, one would think that the New South Wales Parliament must have been a very terrible place in times past; certainly persistency with which these ancient feuds are being revived is anything but gratifyspect ing or calculated to elevate our discussions. I am glad, indeed, that the leader Labour Party, in accordance with all previous history, endeavoured to give a and respectable tone to it, and to direct case. attention to political issues, avoiding altogether personal considerations. So far I am concerned, these references and aladvisable, lusions, betraying an animus against the Prime Minister, irrespective of Federal considerations, are rather calculated to cite disgust than to prejudice me against the right honourable gentleman. I, in common with other protectionists, have, from anywhere. in years gone by, deemed it to be my 'duty to fight him hard and fast on public grounds and for just cause; and if , at present juncture of affairs, any want of confidence motion were tabled, justified, I should undoubtedly feel it to be my bounden duty to support it. But, in the absence of good cause, in the absence of argument, to support such a motion as has already been submitted, I deem it to be duty to record my vote against the motion of want of confidence. I should like to draw the attention of honourable members the present political situation, which, appears to me, is without parallel in the history of parliamentary govern to take place. ment. ' Within nine months of a general election, we have had no less than two Ministries displaced from office, and we are now faced with a motion want of confidence in a third Government'. The position is certainly one which should make us anxious for the safety of our eral institutions. Such incidents as so unparalleled in the history of mentary Government, may well be calcuoutlined lated to shake our Constitution to its foundation. I think that the dangers congave nected with the situation should induce honourable members of a thoughtful disonly position on both sides to sulDordinate their own ambition, or what they may consider their interests, to the good government welfare of the Commonwealth. Of course, in every situation a certain amount of restraint is necessary. I think that if leader of the Labour Party had shown a capacity and disposition to sink what may be, perhaps, a natural feeling of disapthe pointment and resentment at being displaced of his hands? Sir John Quick. from office, until a future occasion, when better cause might have been shown, it would have reflected greater credit upon the his capacity as a leader, and would, I am sure, have won him greater esteem and rein the country.

493,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What about the provision relating to State servants? Sir JOHfTQUICK - I am merely pointing out a difficulty in the way of the honourable member for Bland resuming office. I venture to think that, having resigned, he might as well have waited until a development of events took place, or at any rate until the Arbitration Bill was disposed of in some way or other, before he made an attack. So far as I have been able to analyze in a general sort of way the arguments which have been presented in support of this motion of no-confidence, they may be summarized under three headings. first place, it. is alleged that the Ministry has no policy. In the second place, there are expressions of vague apprehension that a certain traditional and well recognised policy previously adopted by the House, is in danger of being attacked by the Ministry. And in the third place, there is an allegation, or a 8M 2 suggestion of a general antipathy to the Prime Minister.' Dealing first with the question of no policy, I would ask the leader of the Opposition what time the Ministry has had to develop a policy ?",67
494,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Longe r than we had.,67
495,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Undoubtedl y Ministers have had only a few weeks to consider the surroundings. They were suddenly brought into office, without any political association, or opportunities for considering a programme. They were not like the Labour Party, which came into office with a programme ready cut and dried. Ministers have had only three weeks in which to look around and take stock of the situation. Having done so, they found certain Bills on the. notice-paper. They decided to take up these residuary fragments of previous Ministers, lick them into shape, and pass as many of them as they can. Surely honourable members on the other side cannot expect a newly-combined team like that to come down with a complete programme, at the fag end of a session.",67
496,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We expect nothing from them.  them.,67
497,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"They say in one breath that we have no policy, and in another breath that our policy is the same as theirs.",67
498,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"And yet they will not give the Ministry an opportunity of considering, developing, and evolving a policy. Again, it is said that the great democratic ideals of our Commonwealth, such as a White Australia, and the Immigration Restriction Act, are in danger. What do we find? We find the late Minister of External Affairs coming down here and making an attack upon the Prime Minister because, forsooth, his own decision is not reversed . 1 He makes it a positive grievance that his own decision is not reversed by his successor.",67
499,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Oh no !,67
500,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The late Minister of External Affairs makes it a grievance that his successor does not stand to his colours.,67
501,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable and In the learned member for West Sydney taunts the Prime Minister, and does his best to goad him on to reverse his own decision.",67
502,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He says that the Prime Minister is inconsistent; that is all.,67
503,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not see where there is any inconsistency about the matter. The Prime Minister expressed certain views about some provisions in the Immigration Restriction Act in times past, and if he had a majority, I daresay he would endeavour to carry out his promise and try to modify the provisions; but he never said that he would refuse to obey the law.",67
504,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He said that he would trv to alter the law.,68
505,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Prime Minister is sworn to obey the law, and he dare not refuse to enforce the Immigration Restriction Act or the White Australia policy.",68
506,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Why did he not say that about Sir Edmund Barton when he enforced the law in the case of the six hatters?,68
507,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What did he say about the Petriana case?,68
508,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In regard to those cases, I understand that the principal ground of criticism and attack was, that the Act was not enforced, in a business like manner, and that its administration was allowed to drift . That point does not arise here.",68
509,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes . it does.,68
510,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The point is that members of the Labour Party are endeaof vouring to frighten people into thinking that the White Australia and Liberal policy is in danger. The greatest and strongest security that the policy to which we are attached-at least those of us liberal protectionists-wil l not be in any way interfered with or prejudiced, is the presence on these benches of liberal prober tectionists. The tenure of office of Government is dependent on the liberal ment on this side of the House.",68
511,Mr WATSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And just as much on conservative element.,68
512,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,So far as personal antipathy to the Prime Minister is coninterrupt. cerned. I venture to hope that this House will rhe superior to any such tions-that the House will judge public men connected with this Parliament according to Federal politics and Federal ciples.,68
513,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Briber y !,68
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Hume is delivering his speech again, here in the corner.",68
515,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,H is conduct is graceful.,68
516,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Postmasterbut General, the honourable member for Parrahe matta. and the honourable member for must be conscious that they are breaking the Standing Orders, and are doing so spite of the fact that I have called attenNaturally tion to the matter several times. that those honourable members will not further transgress. When honourable members of such experience disregard the Standing Orders, I cannot be expected to call to order honourable members not possessed of similar experience.",68
517,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am very sorry, Mr. Speaker, but really the honourable member for Hume is, in an undertone, delivering his speech over again.",68
518,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is quite unnecessary for the honourable member for Parramatta to make any remarks. I regret that I have had To call the attention of honourable members to the Standing Orders. I hope the honourable member for Parramatta will show his regret by obeying the Standing Orders, and refraining from interrupting.",68
519,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"As to the "" nopolicy "" of the Government, I think that a certain amount of indulgence might reasonably be allowed to the new Ministry in the first few weeks of their existence.",68
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I rise to a point order. The honourable member for Hume' is hurling accusations of bribery and corruption across the chamber, and it is impossible for order to be kept if the honorall able member conducts himself in that unwho are seemly and disgraceful way.",68
521,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In support of the point of order raised by the honourable memfor Parramatta, I desire to say that the the remark I made was in consequence of elethe charges levelled by the honourable member for - Hume at honourable members on the this side of the House. When an honourable member is alloweid to make such charges, it is no wonder honourable members",68
522,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I made the charge consideraof bribery this afternoon.,68
523,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Agains t whom? .,68
524,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Agains t the leader prinof the Government. I shall say nothing more than what I said in my speech, and have proved by documentary evidence.",68
525,Mr CONROY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member is over an authority on bribery, I believe?",68
526,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not wish to disdisturb the harmony of the speech of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I was surprised when I heard him say was going to support a gentleman who Hume, has such records against him.",68
527,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I did not hear any rein mark from the honourable member for Hume. honourable members nearer to that I hope honourable member would hear him before I might, or otherwise I should have asked him to refrain from those interruptions, and to withdraw the remarks objected to. But, in any case, if such remarks are made to which honourable members take exception, it is their place to ask that I shall rule them out of order. They should not take the iaw into their own hands by interjecting, or by carrying on conversations across the chamber, which are especially disorderly.",68
528,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"As you, Mr. Speaker, have intimated that honourable members should refrain from interruption, and should appeal to you if disorderly expressions are used, I draw your attention to the words^ used by ' the House honourable member for Hume, who has pending. accused the Prime Minister of bribery. I ask whether those words are to be permitted in this Chamber without withdrawal. to the debate It is a most serious charge, which no honourable member should make against another in this Chamber, and I ask that it be drawn.",69
529,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The charge, which ing. was made this afternoon, was based on words used in connection with reports of a certain proceeding in the New South Wales Parliament some years since. It was possible for me to require the honourable member for Hume not to use the words, his as they were a part of the reports on which he relied, and from which he he could not quote without using just those words. I did not hear the honourable ber for Hume use the phrase complained of Just now, or,, as I said before, I should have required him to withdraw it.",69
530,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"- I must express my regret, and I am sure the regret of honourable member, that such strong language should be used by the honourable member for Hume respecting a public man this House. I know nothing of the history of the case, but I decline to believe an parte statement ",69
531,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I proved it by evifor Bendigo. dence.,69
532,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have no doubt personal that the Parliament pf New South Wales was capable of dealing with the case replanation ferred to, and that it was dealt with accordhas ing to justice and law. It is a scandal to introduce those matters into, the Federal Parliament so persistently. Such a course is not calculated to assist this debate, merelv to excite prejudice, and it may to do injustice to individuals. I hope that the Opposition, as a body, will not counhas tenance or encourage any such unfair tactics. Debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS-DENTO NHA T MILLS. Motion (by Mr MCLEAN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",69
533,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF," In reference to the statement made just now by the honourable.and learned member for Bendigo, and to the lecture delivered by him against myself principally",69
534,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Will the honourable member kindly take his seat? Not even on a motion for the adjournment of the is it permissible tb refer to a debate,69
535,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I am not referring,69
536,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member is expressly referring to the remarks of with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and under the Standing Orders he must not refer to any part of a debate pendI f ' the honourable member desires to refer to any other matter he may do so.",69
537,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What I wanted to refer to was the origin of a statement. I immade a few minutes ago. The leader of the Government introduced the question of financial action in New South Wales; I was quoting; was not responsible,69
538,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"^-Will the honourable memmember take his seat? The question to which the honourable member now refers is distinctly a part of the debate which has just been adjourned - That question has been dealt with in the course of the debate by several honourable members, and is cerevery tainly not now open to discussion.",69
539,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"May I ask whether, in when the House meets tomorrow, I shall have an opportunity to make a personal exex planation' in view of the attack on' me tonight by the honourable and learned member",69
540,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"On the question of explanations, it may be as well for me to say at once, that a personal exin relation to what somebody else said, is not in order. A personal explanation can only be made concerning some matter with which an honourable member himself has dealt, and concerning which he but himself has been misunderstood. A perbe sonal explanation cannot be allowed as a reply to what some other honourable member said in the course of the debate. H the honourable member desires to make a personal explanation' concerning a matter: with which he himself has dealt, and has been misunderstood, he may do so. - Sir WIIWAM LYNE - That enough for me.",69
541,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"New England) When speaking the other night I made the statement that the Denton Hat Mills were fully employed, and that statement was challenged. I then said I would produce the letters on which I based my statement, and these letters are in my hand now. The first is from Mr Edward Shaw, the manager of the Denton Hat Mills, to a customer on the 20th July, 1904, as ""follows :We duly received your letter of the 2rst inst. asking us to furnish you with a set of samples of Victorian made hats. We should he very pleased to do so if we'saw our way to give execution to any orders with which you might favour us, but our hands are at present so full that we are afraid in the meantime to undertake new business' lest it should result in disappointment through our inability to give delivery. In the hope that in some future time we may have the pleasure of doing business with .you, we are. That bears out my statement that these mills have not suffered by the reduction of the Tariff.",70
542,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That letter was written two months ago. Mr LONSDALE.^-If their orders are exhausted now, it is very extraordinary. A second letter is from Mr T. Shelmerdine, of the Yarra Hat Works, Abbotsford, to a customer, on the 15th July, 1904, as f o l lows : With reference to your request for samples, we a understand from our representative that you reuire a special list for your own use. We regret lat at present we are so busy that we cannot manage to make a'fresh set, but will give your request our best attention as soon as we have a spare set or time to make them. It will be seen in both of these cases that' the Tariff has not injured the industry. As to the nail industry, I endeavoured to get information from the Department of Trade and Customs, but I found, from men who are in the trade, that no nails are imported into Yictoria at the present time.",70
543,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WAN T OF," I said the other night, by way of interjection, that the Denton Hat Mills were at the present time exceedingly slack, and that the men were working only four days a week instead of full time - The orders refused in July were season's goods, which were wanted immediately, and such a refusal might occur in the dullest season under the most adverse circumstances. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m. is good",70
