1,Mr KING OMALLEY,MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE,"I w is h to ask the Treasurer , with o u t not i c e ^ 1. Is he aware that the States are great trading corporations? a. That they employ thousands of workers, and have entered into financial obligations for the carrying out of developmental works involving large sums pf money, based on receiving a portion of the Commonwealth one-fourth surplus revenue ? 3. That the sudden withdrawal of this amount fro m the States will greatly inconvenience and disarrange their finances? 4. That as the Old-age Pensions Trust Fund cannot be utilized until July, 1909, and as the payment of old-age pensions will be only a matter of a ledger credit or debit between the Commonwealth and-States, w i ll the Treasurer lend the whole.of the Trust Fund Surplus Revenue to the States at a low rate of interest on call or demand, paying it .over monthly as usual; and thus save the States from having to procure an Overdraft, from the banks?",14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE,"I do not think that the States are likely to go to the banks, for an overdraft. The Commonwealth would see them through, should their financial position become serious; but I.cannot promise to return, monthly, money which we' have determined shall be placed to the credit of trust .funds for certain purposes.

Is' there . to be a corresponding increase in expenditure, and is penny postage provided for ? The expenditure, during this year was larger by over 11 per cent, than that of last year; but the increase in revenue was only 5 per cent. Is there to be a similar increase in the expenditure next year?",14

6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Not so far as I am awaie. The cost of penny postage is not calculated for in the preparation of the Estimates.,14
7,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Will the Government see that examination papers set for candidates for Public Service positions are better designed to test their fitness for the work which they are likely to be called upon to perform? For instance, would a man do the work of a line repairer any the worse if he could not say what the use of the mace is ?",14
8,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The Government has nothing to do with these examinations.,14
9,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It can secure an alteration if the matter is brought before the House.,14
10,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Public Service Commissioner has full power in this matter ; but it will be - for Parliament to say, next session, when am Amending Public Service Bil l is introduced, whether his powers shall be restricted. I do not think that Parliament could determine the form of examination papers.",14
11,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"What steps, if any, will the Postmaster-General take' into the telephone line repairers who have been dismissed, and whose caste was brought - before him yesterday ?",15
12,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I informed the honorofpractical"" able member, in reply to the repretion sentations of a deputation headed by him, that all I can do is to refer the matter to the Public Service Commissioner. only fair to that officer to say that the men who have unfortunately lost their employwhat ment at this particular season of the which makes their case all the harder, were really temporary employees, having no - legal' claim to continuous work. However, I sympathize with them, and have asked the Public Service Commissioner to see i - occupations can be found for them.",15

The names of the probable Commissioners should be given to the House before the session closes.",15

19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have been deputations in conversation with the Prime Minhe ister by telephone this morning, and hope to have something further to say on the subject later. The Prime has not decided whether the Commission shall consist wholly of members of liament or of members and two or three inuendo, if not by way of question. business men. I think that it will consist chiefly of members of the two Houses, with probably one or two private business men as well.'",15
20,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As the Treasurer was in charge of the Public Service Bill when it was going through Parliament six or seven regard years ago, I ask him: Was there not a distinct understanding given by the Minister when this Bill was passed, that no educational test would be made in the case men, who had given satisfacto the Department-that although they were employed'temporarily at the time of the transfer, they would not be called It is upon to pass any examination ?",15
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If I did say has been indicated - by the honourable year, member for Yarra it would be found in Hansard, but I really cannot tax my memory as t'o whether any such undertakingwas given. I am informed, however, that the examination in connection with line ref pairers and others is very simple, and only directed to ascertain whether they have a them have fairly good education.",15
22,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Following on the quesasked by the honourable member for Fawkner, I desire to ask the PostmasterI understand that. in reply to the deputation which waited on him yesterday, the. honourable gentleman made some ""fairly strong remarks concerning the injustice which was complained of, and wound up by informing the deputation that it was no responsibility of his? ",15
23,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I said nothingabout in- I use the word ""injusbecause I do not know what the actual words were, but one of the newspapers the Minister as having said that it was the Public Service Commissioner who had ""done this t h in g "" ; and the context of the remarks show that the Postmasterstrongly disapproves of the action",15
24,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I do not approve of it.,15
25,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"'Does the Postmaster General not think it would be better, for the proper administration ot the Public Service as a whole, if he refused to receive on matters in regard to . which has no power, when remarks that he may utter concerning another high public official may make the work of the latter Minister more difficult and arduous?",15
26,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I think I have heard Parthat sort of thing before, by way of I think it is my duty to. receive a deputation from any section of the public,' or any members of the House on any subject whatever, on which they may desire to approach me. I am also of opinion that I nothing whatever that could complicate make more difficult the position of the lio Service Commissioner.",15
27,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is the Postmaster-General aware of any arrangement made by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company which daily press cables must, as part of the agreement with the company, be transmitted solely over the company's lines, ancl, possible. if so, will he make inquiries in the interests ' of the States which ""are financially intethe rested in the Pacific cable, and publish result of those inquiries for general information ?",16

30,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Certainly' .,16
31,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish to ask Postmaster-General whether the Government still insist that all telegrams lodged transmission to Europe, and not marked "" vid Eastern,"" shall be transmitted by Pacific cable, and, if so, whether they prepared to recoup South Australia for loss which such a practice involves?",16
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Postmaster-General, who was not a' member of the Government when the question of the Jic Cable was discussed, has requested me to reply. I well remember the late Mr Kingston, who was then in the Cabinet, - bringing this matter very prominently beanti-Socialist fore the Ministry shortly afterwards. "" The Socialism. , Government desire, as far as possible, to make the Pacific cable a considerable of communication with the Old World.",16
33,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,And that is to be at the expense of South Australia and States ?,16
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I know that the practice involves some loss to South Australia, but it does not Western Australia.",16
35,Mr GLYNN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It cost South Australia ^13,000 during the first year of the existsent ence of the Pacific cable arrangement.",16
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is no doubt that South Australia has suffered, some time.' and that some loss has also been incurred by Western Australia. I shall versation with the Prime Minister regarding the .matter, with a view to our detertime mining whether some consideration cannot' be extended to South Australia in respect of the loss she has suffered by the said ference of a large body of work from the or Eastern to the Pacific cable. I am sure Pubthat the honourable member will acknowledge that in the interests of the. Pacific cable, which is owned by the British Government and the Governments of other parts of the by Empire- I think that we suffered in connection with it last year a loss of £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 - it is. our duty to utilize it as far as",16
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I understand that arrangement referred to does not apply the to South Australia and Western Australia.,16
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I think it does largely, if not wholly, but. there is room to consider the question as it affects the of the two States referred to.",16
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have another question to put to the Treasurer in regard to the Pacific cable. Will he ask the Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet to consider the policy of the Government the acquiring on behalf of the Commonwealth all the cable connexions in Australia, and of for making them a means of safeguarding the defence of the Commonwealth? Further, the will he make himself familiar with the attiare tude of the British Government and some the of the most prominent statesmen of the Empire upon that phase of the question ?",16
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I shall certainly bring the matter under the notice of Pacithe Prime Minister. From the stand-point of defence I think that the adoption of the proposal would be a step in the right direction, but I am rather surprised that the party should - advocate",16
41,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Order! The honormeans, able member must not debate the matter.",16
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I think that it done would be wise to bring this part of our other cable service into line with what we are doing in respect to cable communication between Tasmania and the mainland. We are at present arranging to lay two cables largely affect between those points.,16
43,Mr BOWDEN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Will the Postmaster General inform the House what is the preposition in regard to the erection of new post offices at Katoomba and Lithgow ? The matter has been under consideration for,16

45,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"1I have not had"" to look through the Supply Bill circulated last night, and should like to ask the Treasurer whether provision is made under transit, or upon any Estimates, for the laying of new cables between Tasmania and the mainland ? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The Supply B i ll is based on the expenditure in respect of 'the present financial year. It .covers a period of three months, and includes provision for a proportion', if not the whole, of the cost of the cables the honourable member mentions.",16
46,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether a vote has not been passed by Parliament to provide for the establishment of wireless telegraph stations on the Australian coast, and, if so, what steps are being taken to establish such stations?'",17
47,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There is a sum of £""10,000 on the Estimates for such works, and tenders are returnable in August next for the erection of three stations.",17
48,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Where ?,17
49,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"On e on the Western Australian coast, one at Port Moresby, and another, if I remember rightly, at Cape York.",17
50,Mr STORRER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"As the PostmasteiGeneral has said that the sum of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 voted for the erection of wireless-telegraph stations is to be utilized in erecting three at the points named by him, I wish to know whether any provision has been made for erecting a station on Flinders Island, or whether, the calling for tenders for that work is a mere political placard?",17
51,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"There are no political placards connected with my Department. The erection of wireless telegraph stations on Flinders Island and King Island is included .in the tenders we are now inviting. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Seeing that the - Postmaster-General appears to have been .travelling all - round the continent in search of place's'at which to erect wirelesstelegraph stations, I should like to know what are his intentions with regard to the erection of a station at King Island? . Mr Mauger - The erection ot stations on Flinders Island and King Island is covered by the tenders which I have ordered to be invited. I have also issued a direction that an estimate, of the cost of connecting Flinders Island and the. mainland by cable be prepared.",17
52,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish td ask the Postmaster-General whether any portion of the sum of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 to which he has referred is to be applied towards carrying out a scheme now being formulated by a, private company for establishing wireless telegraph stations in the Pacific? I understand that the Government have been approached, and should like to know whether any portion of the sum of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 is to be diverted towards the purposes of that private company?",17
53,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"No portion of that sum could be diverted. The proposals submitted to the Government by the company would in themselves involve an expenditure of something like £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , plus a further expenditure of £ 3 , 0 0 0 per annum on the stations. That proposal will have to be considered on its merits quite apart from the other undertaking's to which I have referred.",17
54,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Can the Postmaster General give the House any information respecting the proceedings now being taken for the recovery of the. amount forfeited by Sir James Laing and Company under the cancelled oversea mail contract ?,17
55,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I understand that the legal proceedings are still going on.,17
56,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In the absence of the Prime Minister I wish to' ask the Post-' master-General whether any official information has been received by the Department as to the results of the recent Lisbon Conference, where the question of what words might be used in cable codes was discussed ?",17
57,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Instructionswere given to the representatives of the Government at that. Conference, but no report of the proceedings has yet been received.",17
58,Mr HEDGES,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has considered the desirableness of establishing a wireless telegraph station on Rottnest Island, near .Fremantle ?",17
59,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I had Rottnest Island in mind when I referred to the proposal to erect a station on the Western Australian coast. A station is to be established there. Mr Bruce . SMITH - As we are about to enter upon a three months' recess, and it seems to be generally acknowledged that a large part of the confusion prevailing in the Post and Telegraph Department is the result of the refusal of the Treasurer to provide for the extra services required by the Postmaster-General, I desire to ask the Treasurer whether we. may rest assured that during the recess-whe n Parliament will not be able to criticise the conduct ofMinisters-h e will provide whatever funds are necessary for . the Post and Telegraph Department ?",17
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I resent the honourable member's insinuation. His statement is not correct, and he has made it, apparently, with the object of using it as a political placard. As Treasurer of the Commonwealth, I have always done my duty, and I.intend to do so. "" I shall not be dictated to by the Secretary to the Post and Telegraph Department as to whether I ought to find the money that he says I am to find for the Department, or whether I am entitled to exercise my own judgment.",17
61,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Does the Postmaster-General consider that the constant refusal of the Treasurer to provide for extra services in his Department has in any way' contributed to the confusion in that Department, which is to form the subject of inquiry ?",18
62,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Havin g in mind the lecture delivered to me by the leader of the Opposition upon a former occasion for having said what I think of my colleague the Treasurer-and I think only well of him- I decline to answer the question.,18
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,There is no confusion.,18
64,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"On the 29th - ultimo the honourable member for Calare asked a series of questions relating to Sunday duty in the Postal Department (vide, Hansard, page 11708).

Payment for Sunday duty at the rate time and a half has been made in Victoria, ing from 29th August, 1907.

65,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Has the attention of the Treasurer been directed to the following paragraph appearing in this morning's AgeAs the Harvester Excise Act of 1906 is repealed by the new legislation of 1908 the consequence of this oversight is that from the moment the Governor General signs the new Tariff laws the agricultural implement manufacturers are free to charge the f armers such prices as they chopse. Does he intend to bring in a measure to prevent - this ?,18
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I was in conversation with the Prime Minister on the subject this morning,' and he asked me to see whether the House would not pass the amending Bill I mentioned yesterday, which is very important. - Mr HUTCHISON - The Act is useless. Manufacturers are charging what prices they like tinder it.",18

111,Mr FISHER,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Wide Bay) [11.16] - I desire to move the' adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz. : "" Violations , of the wages award of Mr Justice Higgins as regards 'payment to persons employed in the agricultural implement making industry."" Five members having risen in their - places, Question proposed.",21
112,Mr FISHER,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"I have no desire to delay the course of public business, but I think that the position to which my attention was called last evening by a deputation from the Agricultural Implement Makers' Union is of sufficient importance to warrant me in bringing it under the notice of the House The deputation informed me that at a meeting of the Union, which had been previously held, the following resolution had been adoptedThat this union protests against the inaction of the authorities in the matter of the new protection policy, and the injustice thereby thrust upon the employees who were induced to favour protection to the employers on the understanding that protection would also be afforded to the workers, and who have also incurred heavy legal expenses in establishing their claim. They further informed me that the awaid which they.had secured was not being faithfully observed, and that, though' specific cases of evasion of its terms have been reported to the Registrar of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, no action has been taken to compel employers to observe the award. They are of opinion that the authorities should at once enforce the award as they are entitled to the wages prescribed in the schedule laid down by Mr Justice Higgins, whatever the decision of the High Coujrt may be in the cases now pending. They further hold that the award is legal until proved otherwise by such decision.' When I was apprised of the fact that specific instances of evasions of the award of Mr Justice Higgins had been reported to the Registrar, I deemed the matter of sufficient importance to request the deputation to supply me with particulars. I came into the city early this morning, and they then furnished me with the information for which I asked-informatio n which proves incontestably that specific instances in which the rates prescribed by Mr Justice Higgins are not being paid have been reported to the Registrar. That being so, I submit that the Government cannot further evade their responsibility in this matter. Mr Justice Higgins, in referring to the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act of 1906,. in the first paragraph of his judgment, says The Commonwealth Parliament has by this Act imposed certain Excise duties on agricultural implements; but it has provided that the Act shall not apply to goods manufactured in Australia "" under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which are declared by the President of . the Court to be fair and reasonable."" My sole duty is to ascertain whether the conditions of remuneration submitted to me are "" fair and reasonable."" I have not the function of finding out whether the rates of wages have, or have not, in fact been paid since the ist of January, 1907, when this Act came into force. That paragraph lays down a definite printo ciple, namely, that the President of the Court was not charged with the duty of 1906. ascertaining whether or not the proper rates of wages had been paid since the of January, when the Act became operative. But I am now directing attention to what able member. has occurred since that decision was given. Upon page 2 of the report of the same judgment, Mr Justice Higgins observesThe ' provision for fair and reasonable reobservance of the award. muneration is obviously designed of the employees in the industry; and it must be meant to secure to them something which they cannot get by the ordinary system of individual bargaining with employers. If Parliament meant that the conditions are to be fair and reasonable, where employees will accept and employers will give, in contracts of service, there would have been no need for this provision. The remuneration could safely' be left to the usual, but unequal, contest, the ""niggling of the market"" for labour, with the pressure for bread on one side and the pressure for profits on the other. The standard of. "" fair and reasonable must therefore be something else, and I pannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of the average employee, regarded as a human being living in a civilized com-' munity. ' In the schedule. attached to his judgment the learned Judge set oiit the wages which should be paid to each employee in the dustry. In this connection, I would remind honourable members that a very - handsome measure of protection has been extended to the manufacturers of agricultural imperiod, plements-Parliamen t having imposed a duty of £ 1 2 per machine upon stripper harvesters, and of j£6 per machine upon strippers.",21
113,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Accordin g to the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission, those duties are equivalent to a protection of urgent. from 30 to 40 per cent.",22
114,Mr FISHER,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Whateve r excuse the Government may have had for hot-taking action in this matter prior to the delivery of the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins, they certainly should haye enforced the payment of the wages prescribed in .the schedule to which I have referred since that judgment was given.",22

125,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"I am only able to gauge the urgency of any matter by the remarks - of the honourable member who brings it before the House, and I gathered from the observations of the honourable r member for Wide Bay that he was induced to take the action which he has taken by certain statements which were made to him by a deputation that waited on him last evening.. That fact indicates that, since the information was placed in - his possession, he has not lost any time in bringing under the notice of the House.

128,Mr FISHER,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Until Mr Justice gins delivered his judgment, there may have been some excuse for inaction on part of the Government, but since that judgment was delivered, there has been justification for an evasion of their redum :sponsibility.

130,Mr FISHER,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"I did not know of by specific instances in which the terms of that' ' award were being evaded. It is only fair I should say that the deputation informed Excise me that there are quite a number of firms in Melbourne, who are absolutely obeying that award. The real difficulty is that i these firms are permitted to pay less wages stituted than are - being paid by more reputable firms, they will, eventually, drag the latter down to their own level. I have been told that the award is being violated so far as so strikers are concerned, by a certain firm, the name of which, perhaps, I had. better withhold.",23

It is also alleged that a contractor under another firm is paying less wages than he should pay under the award of Mr Justice Higgins. The Very . worse thing that can happen in a matter of this kind is that one or two firms should be specially favoured. All these facts have' been made known to Mr Stewart, the Registrar of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.. That being so, the Government, should take action, not only for the purpose of protecting the employees, who instituted the proceedings which' resulted in that award, but also of protecting the reputable firms who are faithfull y observing the terms of that award.",23

This would have been before the House had we the advanof the High Court decision on several important aspects of the question. The Act came into force on rst Tanuary, 1907, and nothing could properly be done until the Court of Arbiand Conciliation was able to deal with applications for exemption. The regulations governing the practice of the Court were issued authority of the President on 27th MaTch, 1907, and the President urged that no action should be taken in regard to enforcing payment of until manufacturers interested had an opportunity of applying fo the Court for exemption. A number of applications were dealt with by the President in New South Wales and South f Australia in May and June, 1907, and exemptions were granted. The Victorian cases, which conthe majority, were not heard until November, 1907, and exemption was refused in a number of cases. For that delay the Government cannot possibly be held responsible. But soon as the applications .were refused, we at once issued directions for the collection of Excise and the licensing of all manufacturers who had failed to comply with the conditions of exemption. The manufacturers so affected then associated, with a view of resisting the demands of the Government.",23
134,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"The demands for back Excise? Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - The - demands for Excise, licence,"" and all other demands.",23
135,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,That view was not presented to the Minister by deputations.,23
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"I am informed thatThere was a uniform reluctance to. afford us auy information, and whilst we met with few positive refusals there was an equally effective passive resistance to our requirements. On 10th January, 1908, a writ was issued against H . V. MCKay for recovery of the duties on all excisable goods manufactured by him from ist January, 1907. A further writ was issued against W. Barger for manufacturing without a licence, the manufacturer having failed to Dav the standard rates of wages. These were typical cases on which the liability of all the manufacturers would be determined, and no good purpose would have been served by issuing further writs.",23

The memorandum continuesWe had an alternative of seizing all goods subject to Excise in the hands of the manufacto turers who had not complied with the conditions. It was not wise or expedient a course. Upon the decision of the High Court being given in favour of the Government there will be little difficulty in enforcing the law in regard to payment of Excise in every case where a manufacturer has failed to pay the standard rate of wages. As some misapprehension exists on the subject it may be pointed out Jhat we have no power to enforce the payment of the standard rates of wages.,24

To continue-^ We may only enforce the payment of excise if such standard rates of wages have paid. The excise provisions are for the purpose of encouraging the payment of the standard rate of wages, but the Act gives the manufacturer the alternative of paying such wages, or, in default, to pay the excise. It need hardly be said that the Governin ment is entirely in sympathy with the ' principles of the Act, and that every possible effort has been and shall be made to enforce its duty. its equitable and highly necessary provisions.

Government incurring unnecessary costs ?",24
154,Mr HUGHES,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"In reply, I say that it is no part of the duty of the Government to anticipate the defeat of its policy by the Judicature. If we are here, under the sword of the Judiciary, and we are never to enforce our legislation unless and until it has been approved after appeal, we are no longer the supreme body in the Commonwealth, and are in danger of defoi generating to that position which has keenly exercised. the minds of the wisest America, where legislation has long been altogether subservient to the Supreme Court,^ clear that competition between the persons and where the government is said to government by injunction. Here we have class of persons, who are everlastingly crying class legislation, and setting law-abiding faculty and instinct as ""being essential to civilization, deliberately ing and disregarding the law-resortin g to. every trick, artifice, and shift to evade legislation passed for the benefit of people. The contract which has been tered into is a three-sided one-it is tween the Government as representing people, the manufacturers, and the emfield ployes. The employers, are receiving all that we, on behalf of the people, declared they should receive, and yet they, in most' contemptible way, decline to pay their employees a reasonable wage. Every effort ought to be strained to bring those people to book, and I think that, under section 6 of the Australian Industries servation Act a remedy may be found. Section 4 of that Act provides1. Any person who, either as principal or as agent, makes or enters into any contract, is or continues to be a member of or engage any combination, in relation to trade or merce with other countries or among the. States(a) with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the or (i) with intent to destroy or injure means of unfair competition - Australian industry the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the no way contingent. interests of producers, workers, consumers is guilt}' of an offence. Section 6 is as f o l l o w s For the purposes of the last two preceding sections unfair competition means competition is unfair in . the circumstances; and in the following cases the competition shall be proved :to be unfair unless the contrary is [a) If the defendant is a Commercial Trust : (e) If the competition would probably or does in fact result in an inadequate remuneration' for labour in the Australian industry : (c) If the competition would probably or does in fact result in creating substantial disorganization in Australian industry or throwing workers out of employment. It has beeni laid down by Mr Justice 'Higgins what is an adequate remuneration persons engaged in this industry; and so it has been alleged by the honourable in - member for Wide Bay that certain persons are not - paying that wage. It is very be who are paying the statutory wage, and a those who decline to pay the statutory de-. wage, cannot but be unfair. As suggested up the by the honourable member for Wide Bay, it is pietty obvious that the employeis who floutare now paying the statutory wage will 'say, "" If other manufacturers can be permitted to have their machines made at a the lower wage, why should we pay the higher enrate?"" Therefore, I contend that such becompetition is calculated to bring about the inadequate remuneration over the whole of this particular industry. Under the circumstances I am of opinion that the offending manufacturers can be proceeded the against under the Australian Industries Preservation, Act, quite independently of the fact that the High Court has not yet decided whether the Excise Act is constitutional. This adequate remuneration Prewhich is spoken of is not determined by Statute-if must be adequate remuneration, whethei determined by Statute, by arrangement amongst the employers,, or by aror rangement between the employers and the in employees; and if it is inadequate, and comcalculated to bring about disorganization and unfair competition, it constitutes an offence. In my opinion-the Government public; ought to set this part of the Act into force at once, because, as I have said, by if is quite independent, and will remain any independent, of any decision of the High Court on the ExciseAct, on which it is in The possibility of and good employers reducing their rates to the level of those paid by bad employers, must, of course, be considered, but independently of that, the Government have a very clear opportunity for showing the utility of the Act, which was brought ir* with a great flourish of trumpets, but which apparently stands on a level with the Excise Act as absolutely futile, and i h grave danger of becoming farcically futile, thus placing the Parliament of the country in the most humiliating position. The - Excise Act was the standard-bearer and tl.e trumpeter of the great forces of the new ' protection which were to rectify anomalies and injustice; but the Government come down now and say that they cannot do anything because the red-tape ot the High Court has bound them up - I 'have pointed out, however, another Act under which tl.ey could proceed,' but they decline to try fo put it into force; indeed, so far as I know, such an idea has never dawned upon them.",25

We only need a Government determined to carry out its policy-nothin g is impossible to a Government with a majority behind them. As I say, we have, duririg this week, sufficient evidence of what can be done, by the legislative machine when it makes up its mind; and, therefore, there is absolutely no reason why effect should not be given to this legislation, which is one of the vital parts of the Government's policy. If we go into recess, not knowing' what is to become of this most important corollary of the Government policy, we, who are supporting the Government, will be placed in a most unfortunate and invidious position. To be told now that the Excise Act in its operation, and the whole policy of the new protection, is dependent on the decision of the High Court, discloses a most unsatisfactory position; and I call'on the Treasurer and the Government, to put into force section 6 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which will, at all events, enable us to see if there is any virtue in that legislation.",26

As one who has had some communication with the manufacturers, having introduced deputations on their behalf to the Minister, I have no hesitation in saying that the administration qf the Act has been characterized by the most lamentable ineptitude of which any Government could be guilty. The Act came into operation in January, 1907, and it was not until May or June of that year that the first Court under it was established. Courts were established first of all in South Australia and New South Wales, and Mr Justice O'Connor, who presided, fixed the rates of wages payable in the industry in those States, and allowed certain exemptions to certain manufacturers. But it was not until nine or ten months after the passing bf the Act that the first Court in Victoria was established, and I have never heard any reasonable explanation of the delay. The result of this delay was that manufacturers who must be regarded as being quite as reputable as any other class in the community, were called upon by the Minister to pay excise for not complying' with conditions of which it was impossible for them to have any knowledge. . Excise was demanded on machinery made during the ten months prior to the first sitting of the Court in Victoria. . That was manifestly unjust, and reflected seriously on the equity of the administrative power. We now have a complaint made by the leader of the Labour Party respecting the non-enforcement of certain penalties for failure to observe the conditions imposed under Mr. Justice Higgins' award, in respect of the industry in Victoria. My understanding of the position is that some manufacturers here refused to obey that award, in order that a test case might be brought before the High Court. Had the. Act been properly and efficiently administered, steps would have been taken to have the rates of wages payable in the industry fixed at the earliest possible moment after it came into operation. Had the Act been efficiently administered, the injustice which has been suffered not only by a large number of workers, but by many manufacturers, would not have occurred. The manufacturers were given no opportunity to make arrangements to carry on their industry in accordance with the terms of this Act before the Court in Victoria fixed the rates of wages payable in this State. The administrative bungle which has taken place is due to the ineptitude of the Government now in power, and I enter my protest against the way in which certain people have been dragooned owing to the action of the Minister.",26
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Parramatta) [12.4] - I congratulate the Government and the Labour Party upon the condition of affairs with which we find ourselves confronted. When the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill was before the House, they claimed for it all the industrial virtues that civilization could suggest, and any honourable member who dared to suggest that danger lurked in the Bill, and that there were possibilities' of its not being all that was claimed for it, was vigorously denounced. The Bill was rushed through the House without proper consideration.* No division took place upon it, and there was no opposition from this side of the Chamber, save that a few honourable members pointed out the probable consequences of the passing of such a measure. It has become the custom in this Chamber, when an industrial measure is under consideration, to suggest that an honourable member who dares to raise an objection to any feature of it is an enemy to all that makes for the welfare of the working classes. It is time that a better spirit prevailed in the House if our legislation in this direction is to be efficient and such as will contribute to the uplifting and comfort of the workers of Australia.",27

We have it, therefore, on the highest authority in the House, that pressure brought from outside has alone made this an urgent matter. I do not want to appear to be nasty; but I think that I am entitled to make these observations, considering the abuse that has been heaped upon my head when measures of this class have been before the House. The cause of much of the present trouble is the want of careful consideration of such measures on the part of the House, and the denunciation of honourable members on this side when they dare to criticise them. We have had a lot of legislation rushed through the House, for the most part without any knowledge of its features on the part of those who voted for it. This is not a solitary example. We have had illustration after illustration of the evil sults of Hasty legislation. And honourable members will never secure the new protection until they are prepared to spend more time in preparing and considering the necessary machinery, and bringing their intelligence to bear upon it as we all ought to do. I say this altogether apart from any question of policy. There is certainly something in the contention of the honourable member for West Sydney .that action ought to be taken in regard to this matter. But when he made that statement the only reply he got from the Treasurer was "" Talk sense."" That is the answer given to the appeal of the Labour Party after they have passed the Tariff on which this question is founded. To-day they are told to "" Talk sense "" ; when the Tariff was before u« they were told that the millennium was approaching. It is about time that honourable members of the Labour Party who, I am sure, are sincerely interested in legislation of this kind resented such treatment. It is the duty of the Minister administering this Act to see that any manufacturer who is not complying with its conditions, pays the Excise into a trust account, pending the decision of the High Court. surely could be done.",27
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,How could we do that? It would be necessary to seize the goods of the manufacturer.,28
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"The Minister may do it precisely as he will if the decision of the High Court is favourable. It is pointed out that whilst the High Court is proceeding to investigate the case of some"" manufacturers, others are taking advantage of the position. Considering the duties which have been rushed through the House for their benefit, they are taking a mean advantage of the present position, and the Minister ought to stop that kind of thing.",28
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,They have been taking a mean advantage.,28
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"And the honourable member and his colleagues are responsible for permitting them to do so. We are discussing not the policy of this question, but the need for honourable observance of the legislation of this Parliament. Either the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is a mere political placard, on it is to be observed. It seems to me, however, that it is not intended for use. The same remark will apply to most of the industrial legislation that has been passed by this Parliament. What about our antire- trust legislation ? It is a long time since we passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act, yet no action has been taken under it to bring any trusts to book. We have had nothing more from the Ministry than a promise to take action. Most of the industrial legislation that we . have passed has simply been used by the Government to cajole the House into passing high protective duties. Having done that, Ministers have subsequently repudiated their part of the obligation.",28
178,Mr WYNNE,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,Are all our industrial Acts dead letters?,28
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Most of them, so far, are mere placards.",28
180,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,-There is no Ministerial life behind them.,28
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"My honourable friends of the Labour Party are supposed to be the - watch dogs of the working classes. They say that they are, and if we dare to express sympathy with the workers, we"" are denounced by them.. Only the other day in another place a fierce attack was made upon honourable members outside the Labour Party for presuming even to suggest that ""they, were in favour That of old-age pensions. The position is the same here. If a member of the Opposition .dares to support an industrial measure, he is denounced by the Labour Party as a hypocrite. On the other hand, if he criticises any provision in it he is described as a traitor to labour. It is time a better spirit was shown if tfie workers of the. community are fo reap full advantage from our industrial statutes. Ministers should be held to their trust in this matter. If manufacturers in this industry are not treating their employees as this House intended,, they ought to be called upon to pay the Excise t-y the Minister to be held in trust pending the decision of the High Court. Either let us enforce this legislation or repeal it. Do not let us have perpetrated in connection with this .Act the farce that has been witnessed in connection with other industrial legislation. It is enough to bring the cause of labour into the utmost contempt when such proceedings are allowed to take place.",28
182,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,Yarra) [12.14] - I was greatly surprised at the announcement of the Treasurer that he was' suspending the collection of Excise pending the decision of the High Court.,29
183,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,What would be the use of doing otherwise?,29
184,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Then it would appear that if any of the States institute proceedings to test the constitutionality of the Surplus Revenue Bill which we passed the other day the Treasurer, pending the decision of that case, will not retain any of our surplus revenue and no money will be paid into the trust fund for old-age""pensions. The two cases are on exactly the same footing, and the Minister is extending an invitation to the States to challenge our legislation. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is the la'w of the land until the High Court rules otherwise. If manufacturers decline to pay the workers the rates of wages which have been fixed according to law, we are not going to do anything to assist them. Men in this industry are being sweated by their employers. workers, at their own expense, took proceedings before the High Court, and won. The' honourable member for Franklin has asserted that the facts, to which the honourable member for Wide Bay has called attention, were known when the members of the Agricultural Implement Employes Union brought their case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. But I would point out to him that the position today is a very different one, inasmuch as an award has since been given. That award, I maintain, should be faithfullyobserved. But I do not suggest that we ought to suspend the duties levied upon agricultural implements until the terms of that award have been complied with. It is admitted by the members of the Union that many employers are paying fair wages to their workmen, and I contend that we have no right to penalize them, because of the action of unscrupulous employers. The Treasurer has stated that the only way in which the Government could enforce the observance of the ""award of Mr Justice Higgins would be by seizing the implements manufactured by the firms who are disregarding it, and, in the event of. such action being taken, those firms might sue the Government in the High Court, and, perhaps, obtain substantial damages. I hold that, if only one workman is being deprived of hisright wage, it is the duty of the Government to take.action. They should compel the observance of the terms of the award of Mr Justice Higgins. I trust that some action will be taken to insure that the woikers shall obtain their fair share of the protection which has been granted to our agricultural implement makers.",29
185,Mr WILKS,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Dalley) [12.19] - I am glad that this question has been biought forward, but. I regret that it has been raised in the form of a motion for an adjournment. I am one of those who voted for the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, not as a mere make-believe or a placard, but as a law which was intended to be enforced. Indeed, my main objection to a protectionist Tariff has been that it takes from the many for the benefit of the few. That objection, however, will be materially minimized if the workers are granted their fair share of the protection afforded. I am sorry that' the honourable member for Wide Bay has not attempted to bring the Government to the bull ring in connection with this matter, just as the honourable member, for Gwydir did The upon the question of postal administration a few weeks ago. Apparently, we are now 'awaiting the tardy decision of the High Court in the cases in which the validity of the new protection legislation, enacted by this House, has-been challenged. In the meantime I submit that the law should be enforced. The analogy drawn by the honourable member for Yarra in reference to the action of the Treasurer in connection with the Surplus Revenue Bill was a singular!}' appropriate one. I am' surprised that the Labour Party should allow the existing state of things to continue without taking further action.",29
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,The members of the Opposition are always endeavouring to embarrass the Government.,29
187,Mr WILKS,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"The Treasurer knows perfectly well that time and again I haveassisted him to pass measures which he has submitted, not because I have any particular regard for him, but because I believed in those measures. I regret that a straight-out motion has not been submitted, in whichcase I . should have moved an amendment somewhat similar to that which I moved when the honourable member for Wide Bay brought forward his proposal affirming the urgency of the question old-age pensions.",29
188,Mr HUTCHISON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Hindmarsh) [12.23] - I have never heard a more unupon satisfactory statement than that given the Treasurer today in reply to the marks of the honourable member for Wide Bay. He told us that the employers adopted an attitude of passive resistance to the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. Yet the Government, instead ing with them, remain absolutely inactive, I venture to say that if 100 employees different parts of the Commonwealth had flouted any law upon our statute-book they would have been punished for their transTariff gression long ago. The Treasurer has sought to shelter himself behind the Court from the responsibility which should attach to the inaction of the Government. But I say that this matter might would have been settled by that tribunal than twelve months ago. "" At that time brought under the notice of the House specific cases in which the award of Mr. Justice Higgins was not being observed employers. . An inquiry was instituted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, Found and the employer admitted that he. was not about complying with the law. . But yet no provisions ceedings have been taken against him. Had he been prosecuted the whole question of the liability of employers under the cise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) would have been settled before the new Tariff was passed. I do not think that would be wise to suspend the operation the Customs duties levied upon agriculanticipating tural implements. Mr SAMPSON:-Why not enforce the legislation. law ?",30
189,Mr HUTCHISON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"Exactly . If the ""honourable member introduced into the monwealth goods, the duty upon which was in dispute, the Minister of Trade - Customs would insist that the highest payable in respect of them should be lected until the question at issue had been determined. That is what should ""been done in - the present instance.",30
190,Mr SALMON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,The manufacturers should have been compelled to put up the Excise.,30
191,Mr HUTCHISON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,Exactly. remarkable feature is that it was only - the Tariff was coming on for consideration that the Government were moved to any action whatever.,30
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,And it is only when - the Tariff is out of the. way that of honourable member's party has raised this question.,30
193,Mr HUTCHISON,DEVELOPMENT OF RURA L,"I felt so strongly it some time ago that if members of hy the Opposition would have assisted me in rethe action which I contemplated I should have been very glad indeed. I contend had that there is nothing to prevent the Government enforcing the law, and if they are not prepared to do that they ought to of dealgive place 'to others who will. Mr HENRY ' WILLIS (Robertson) in [12.27] - Thoug h I am opposed to the new protection policy of - the Government, I maintain that the provisions of the Excise (Agricultural Machinery) Act ought to be enforced. It seems to me that the High Treasurer is more in favour of granting protection to the manufacturer than he is of . extending it to the worker. Otherwise he see that effect was given to the Act more upon our statute-book. We ought not to I suspend the operation of that Act, pending the decision of the High Court. It is the duty of the Executive to give effect to it. by If the honourable member for Wide Bay presses his motion to a division L shall be voting with him. Let us bring a crisis by insisting that the pro : of the Statute to which I have alluded shall be enforced. The working classes of this country are being called upon to pay 'an excessive amount in order Exto.extend protection to our manufacturers, Act and yet the Government decline to grant them the benefit of our legislation in regard it to the new protection. As an excuse they of plead the law's delay. Evidently they are that the judgment of the High Court will be against the validity of that The Labour Party supported the extension of a high measure of protection to manufacturers in order to enable the Comlatter to pay reasonable wages to their workmen. The Government are now going and back upon their supporters. By their induty action they have conclusively proved that colthey are not in favour of the new protection, but that they prefer the old protection, have which means protection for manufacturers alone.",30

Had the scheme take suggested by the honourable member for Wide Bay been adopted, there is no doubt whatever that effect could have been , given the to it constitutionally.

198,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"South Sydney) [12.36]. - I enter my protest against this withstanding that the majority has assented to it's general principles. The objections which I first urged to the ing of bounties for the production of iron have become stronger with time. When d i dthis proposition was first made our financoncial position was not' so unsatisfactory. The GoWe had an overflowing Treasury, and comparatively few calls upon the revenue, tp whereas at present, apart from the old age pensions fund, it is doubtful whether our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue will be more than sufficient to pay for any services necessary for the good government of the Commonwealth. In dealing with this question nearly two years ago I showed what our financial commitments 'were, and urged the unwisdom of expending £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 on bounties when the same amount of encouragement could be given ""to the iron industry of by the imposition of piotective - duties. Those interested in the production of iron in Australia stated before the Iron Bonus Commission, and have repeated since, that That statement has ""July."" been made by Mr Sandford, by Mr. Jamieson, who owned the Blythe River mines, and by Mr Hoskins, the present, - I proprietor of the Lithgow ironworks.",31
199,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MANUFACTURES,We .cannot impose a.'duty now.,31

207,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"I think it is more than that. Thete was a substantial increase in grantthe duties on many kinds of machinery, though I regret that in some other instances the increases were not much. As a member of the Iron Bonus Commission, I asked representatives of leading engineering firms what it would be worth to'them to get supplies at short notice from local iron-works for any order they might have to fill, and their estimate was that they could afford to pay from 5 to 7 per cent, more for their iron to obtain that advantage, because it would obviate the necessity keeping large stocks. Furthermore, the gineering firms have been benefited by the new Tariff, and should share their advanpossible tages with those who are endeavouring establish the basic industry.

I recognise that the Treaismade surer desires to establish the iron industry, and therefore I point out to him that in this Chamber probably at least as many honourable members would support the imposition of a duty as would support the granting a bounty.",32
210,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,I do not think so.,32
211,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Quite a number members of the Opposition have told me that they would support a duty of 12J cent.,32
212,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,Yes ; in preference to a bounty.,32
213,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"Furthermore , such proposal would have a better chance this of passing through the other Chamber. I hope, therefore, that the Treasurer reconsider the matter.

On the last occasion, or the one before that, I was assured if I provided for a duty I would receive the support of the majority; but when I did so, I got a great check, because I found that there was no hope of carrying a duty.",32

I should certainly like to see a bonus given on the. manufacture of wire netting in the absence of any of protective duty. There is a provision in the Bill that at any time the iron indus' try may be taken over - by a State, and, of whether or not that be called Socialism, it provides a start on a sound footing. I per should be rejoiced to see any State lend its support to an industry of the kind.

221,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Where is the money to come from ?,33
222,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The cost is £ 3 0 4 , 0 0 0 , or £ 6 0 , 8 0 0 per annum for five years. I do not know how far it would be wise to reduce the amount or the time limit. However, I shall consider that question when we come to deal with the schedule; but I think that if the work were once commenced, the time might be reduced to three years, and the amount proportionately. I am sure the establishment of this industry will prove acceptable to the people, both on the ground of sentiment and on the material ground of profit to the community. I have had a conversation with the proprietor of the Lithgow works, and I do not think that he would be opposed to some modification of the kind I have just indicated.",33
223,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"(Dalley) [12.50] - The honourable member for South Sydney fears that the financial position of the Commonwealth does not justifv the payment of a bounty in the iron industry. I point out, however, that, up to 1922, bounties on cotton, fibres, oil, coffee, and so forth-the production of which is not really so important to the country as that of - ironwill involve an expenditure of £ 3 3 9 , 0 0 0 . This means that we are prepared to vote £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 a year in bounties on tropical productions, while we deny assistance to the same extent to the iron industry. I should think that the honourable member for South ""Sydney ought to welcome the . proposal, even from his own point of view,. because, if his fears prove to have any foundation, the nearer we shall be to that stage when taxation of a direct character will be necessary.",33
224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I am in favour of direct taxation; I have nothing to explain in regard to that.,33
225,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for. South Sydney said he would prefer a protective duty, and I admit that such a .'duty, in the case of iron, would not f all so heavily upon the user as do duties on other products. ' But from a protective point of view, the engineering trade has been most badly treated.",33

227,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"It is not my faults be-' cause the honourable member will admit that I did my best to secure a drop out of the bucket of good things for the engineering trade of New South Wales. ' Such an attitude may be called parochial, or by any other name; but the fact remains that honourable members, 'all through the discussion on the Tariff, voted in favour of the interests of their constituents. As between a duty and a bonus, I think the latter is the least objectionable, because the public know how much they really pay.",33

231,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"All I know is that there is no bonus for the industry in New South Wales, although the industry is one which, above all things, ought to have assistance.

Hoskins Brothers, who hold a reputation, not only for great enterprise, but for the fair treatment they extend to their men; and, if they bring their good qualities to bear on the new enterprise, I shall' have no fear of the result.

237,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"I am going to show that an expenditure of .£50,000 annum for the next five years, will totally inadequate to establish the iron dustry here. In Canada, which population nearly double that of Australia, the application of the bounty system to industry has been a failure. As far back as 1883, the Dominion Parliament voted a bounty of 6s. 3d. per ton on all pig iron manufactured there. That bounty continued until 1889, when it was reduced to 4s. 2d. per ton. It was. then found that the industry was dying out under reduced bounty, and in 1892, the paymentstons per - annum. were accordingly increased to 8s. 4d. ton. That scale of payment was.continued for some years, - and in. 1894, during the operation of the Act of 1892, a further Bill was passed, authorizing the Governor in Council to pay not only a bounty of 8s. 2d. on every ton of pig iron produced Canada, but an additional bountv of 8s. 2d. per-ton on puddled bars made Canada from Canadian pig iron, Canadian ore. Those bounties were applicable t ill March, 1899, to furnaces in existence in 1894, and from 1899, for five after the furnaces commenced operations. The Act was repealed in 1897 by an which authorized the Governor in Council pay a bountv of 12s. 6d. per ton on ingots, manufactured from ingredients not less than 50 per cent, of the weight <->f which consisted of pig iron, made Canada. It was found necessary to give Manufactures IS JUNE, 1908.] Encouragement Bill . 12171 bounty for the' manufacture of steel ingots, 50 per cent, of the raw material of which was imported. That course was taken because it was found, as it has been elsewhere,' that it would be impossible to make a success of the industry if manufacturers were limited to one class of iron. The Act of 1897 also authorized the payment of a bounty of i2s...6d per ton on puddled iron bars, made from Canadian pig . iron; a bonus of I2S. 6d. per ton on pig iron made from Canadian ore, and a bonus of 8s. 4d. per ton on the proportion produced from imported material. An Act of 1899 limited the time during which the payments ' will should be made, and provided for a vearly f we diminishing-rate of bounty. It was found a that under that Act the iron industry was dying out, and in 1903, it beAuscame necessary to introduce another Bill a providing for the payment of a. bounty of 25s. per ton on rolled-wire rods; 12s. 6d. per ton on other rolled shapes; and 12s. 6d. per ton on rolled plates, manufactured in Canada, of which not less'than 50 per cent, per consisted of pig iron, made in Canada. A be point to which I wish to draw special atintention is that it was found necessary, in has a order to encourage various manufactures of iron, to grant a bounty on the production the of rolled plates, made partly of imported pig iron. That was necessary to secure the variety absolutely essential to various industries. In 1904, the aggregate capacity was of the furnaces started in Canada under the bounty system was equal to an annual output of over 1,000,000 tons per annum, the but they were turning out only 278,219 In 1904, the bountv per paid on the material produced from Canadian ore, was only £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , while that paid on manufactures from imported material was £ 1 1 0 , 0 0 0 . Those who say that we shall be able, by the payment of bounties amounting to £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , to establish the in iron industry in Australia, are flying directly in the face of the experience of in Canadaj where there is a much greater made fiom variety of ore available.",34
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That is not so.,34
239,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"I believe that we years have in Australia ample supplies of iron ore to establish this industry, but the apAct plication of the bounty system to the into dustry in Canada has proved a failure.. steel Between 1895 and 1.906, there was paid, by way of bounty, £ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 on the production of pig iron, £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 on puddled in iron bars, ,£600,000 on steel bars, and a £ 1 3 4 , 0 0 0 on manufactures of steel,, or a total of £ 1 , 7 1 7 , 0 0 0 . Those payments were made after the industry had been bountyfed for nearly twenty-five years. Then, again, we have to remember in this connection that Canada has a population of some 7,000,000, wheueas the population of Australia is less than 4,500,000. As the result of the introduction of"" the sliding scale of payments, the production of iron in Canada fell from 404,000 tons in 1902) to 264,000 tons in 1903, or a decrease of about 40 per cent, in view of these facts, is it not absurd to imagine that we can establish the industry by expending £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum for four years?",34
240,Mr SAMPSON,MANUFACTURES,Can - we not consider position at the end of that period?,35
241,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"T h happened in Canada. The bounty system there has been extended from time to time in connection with the industry. The perience of Canada shows that if we sire to establish the industry here, by of a bounty, we shall have to continue the it. ' system year' after year, and from time to time increase the rates. As to the point raised by the. honourable member for South Sydney, I would invite honourable to examine the evidence given before the Royal Commission by Mr Keats and Mr . Jamieson, both reliable men.",35
242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,And the honourable member is now trying to prevent them from starting the industry in Tasmania.,35
243,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"I am prepared to take the responsibility of my action. T conceive to be right. Mr Jamieson, Mr Keats, and Mr Sandford, all appeared before the Commission, and Mr Keats stated that £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 too insignificant a sum to provide for the be wrong. establishment of the industry. Both Mr. Keats and Mr Sandford urged duty would be necessary. Indeed, the evidence of all the ironmasters examined that as soon as the payment of bounties ceased, a duty would be absolutely neceshis sary. If that be the case, would it not more business like to impose a duty urjon iron, and thus enable them to understand exactly their position? upon this industry with the aid of a bountv, and, on the expiration of the period over which that bounty extends, find themselves unable to continue operations in the absence of such assistance, is this House prepared to continue that bounty indefinitely? Let session?"" - us treat the iron industry"" in exactlv the same wav as we have treated almost every other industry in the Commonwealth. What has been the experience of Canada in conHouse. nexion with the iron bounty? Despite the fact that its Tariff duties range from 25 to 30 per cent., the Government of that Dominion have been paying a bounty upon the production of iron ever since 1883. No later than the year 1905, a special plea was made to that Government, not merely to continue the bounty, but to increase it from $2 to $3 per ton, as otherwise the industry would cease to exist. Upon the last day of the session, why should an attempt be made to rush this Bill through the Parliament? I submit that it should have been dealt with a month ago, when honourable members would have been the afforded an opportunity of inquiring"" into the effect which it is likely to have upon at is what has the iron industry.",35
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Hypocrisy .,35
245,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,Surel v there is exnothing to be gained and everything to be delost by giving insufficient encouragement means to this industry. Let us deal fairly with,35
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member is not dealing fairly with it . He is endeavouring to damage it all that he members can. I do not like hypocrisy.,35
247,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"Because I do not approve of the ill-considered method devised by the Government to fritter away £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 of the taxpayers' money, I am charged with being opposed to the industry. Such charges, however, will not influence me in the slightest degree. I will do what ",35
248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable 0 was member is doing that which he knows to,35
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,The Treasurer must that a withdraw that statement.,35
250,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"Whether ' the was Treasurer withdraws it or not is immaterial to me. He gauges everybody by own standard. What possible interest be could I have in opposing this Bill if I thought that its effect would be to successf u l l y establish the iron industry? As a If men embark matter of fact, there are very close friends of mine interested in the industry, and T a:r. glad to say that they view my attitude towards the Bill in a very different li'ght from the Treasurer. They credit me with sincerity. I ask: "" Is it right to bring forward this Bill upon the last day of the",35
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It has been discussed on four different occasions in this,35
252,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,"I believe that, the bounty will be utterly inadequate to establish the iron industry, and I do not doubt that in the near future we shall be called upon to again discuss this question as a result of this measure having been passed without sufficient consideration.",36
253,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"(Kooyong) _[2.37] - The honourable member for Franklin has practically delivered a second-reading speech upon this Bill . I understood that the general principle of the measure had already been affirmed by the House. I quite agree with the honourable member that 'we ought not to be called upon in the dying hours of the session to consider such an important question. But I know that the matter'is one of urgency, on account of the critical condition of the'- ironworks at Lithgow, which require .immediate assistance. I would, therefore, suggest to the Treasurer that the whole question should be re-opened next session. The honourable member for Franklin is quite right in his statement that a bounty of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 will prove utterly inadequate to successf u l l y establish the iron industry. If we are going to attack this problem in a practical way, we shall require to authorize an expenditure of not less than £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0. However, I believe that an understanding has been arrived at that this Bill shall be allowed, to pass without 'opposition. That being so, I shall not occupy the time of the Committee any further. that we should pass the Bill without delay, so as to afford another Chamber an opportunity of dealing with it . - Mr FULLER (Illawarra). [2.39] - I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he had an - opportunity. during the luncheon adjournment of considering the amendment which I submitted to him ?",36
254,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Yes ; and I intend to accept it ,36
255,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"I am glad of that asand a half years. surance. It is only right that penditure authorized under this Bill shall find its wav into the pockets of those it is intended to assist, and not into the binders for only a year. coffers of the New South Wales Governvisions ment. I understand the Treasurer intimated - that' he intended to consider question of whether if would not be wise to reduce the period, over which the p posed bounty will extend. I would point out to him that if that periodbe reduced the whole of the bounty will be pocketed by one firm.",36
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I do not intend to reduce the period prescribed in the Bill , namely, five years.",36
257,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"In that case I am perfectly satisfied. I should like, however, to make one or two remarks in reply to the observations of the honourable member for Batman, who taunted the representatives of New South Wales with having voted against the imposition of high protective duties during the recent Tariff debate, whilst supporting the granting of a bounty to the iron industry of that State. Upon every occasion I voted to give effect to a policy of free-trade. But there are some honourable members who profess to be protectionists, but who are merely 'geographical protectionists-wh o voted to extend protection to the industries of their own S'tate, but adopted an entirely different attitude where the industries of other States were concerned. Some of those honourable members were prepared to vote in favour of extending protection to the twopenny half-penny mushroom industries on the banks of the Yarra, but, fortunately, their vaunted protectionist principles did not extend beyond the limits of Victoria. Sir JOHN FORRES T (Swan) [2.43]. - I am in favour of this Bill , and intend to support' it. We want to encourage the iron industry, and we are not prepared I suggest to place a duty upon pig or other iron, which is the raw material of so many industries. But, wlulst I desire to assist those who have exhibited a great deal of enterprise in embarking upon the industry, has I do not wish to pass a Bill of this character for their exclusive benefit, and I think, the opportunity should be given for . others to enter upon the business and secure a portion of the bounty. I noticed that under class 1 of the schedule the bounty is to be operative over a period of only four The production of the exgoods coming under class 2 will be encouraged by bounty for only two and a half whom years, and the production of reapers and Those proseem equivalent to paying bounties has to those already engaged in this business the with a view to increasing their profits, and I intend, when we get to the schedule, to r o - ask the Treasurer to extend the period during which bounties will be payable.",36
258,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I shall meet the right honourable member so far as I can.,36
259,Sir JOHNFORREST,MANUFACTURES,"I hope the Treasurer has considered the financial side of this question. Does he propose to place to a trust.fund the money required for the payment of these bounties? We have been appropriating so largely during the past twenty-four hours that I am afraid some of his proposed trust funds accounts will have to go short. Under the Bill we are entering into a contract with manufacturers, the payment of bounties must take precedence of everything else - We have now appropriated £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 for old-age pensions, ,£250,000 for defence, £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for agricultural bounties, and a-very large sum for the sugar bounties.",37
260,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member sure does not regard the sugar bounties as perconditions manent ?,37
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"They have a good many years to run, and will, be increasing every year. We should be informed by the Treasurer how lie proposes to get the money to meet all priations. It would almost seem as if he were running amuck, in order to to bring forward his pet scheme-no t endorsed by the Prime Minister-for adding a Commonwealth land tax to the State municipal land taxation.

I know that those who are likely to have the management of the'works prepared to submit, to any provision we may make, in regard to wages.

The trouble is that, although there are a few Wages Boards in South Australia, there is not one which applies to the iron industry; and it is not unlikely that we may give a bounty to induce the Broken Hill Proprietary to provide furnaces at Port - Pirie, in close proximity to the finest iron deposits in Australia. In South Australia we have been trying for years to have Wages Boards created.",38
291,Mr HARPER,MANUFACTURES,If there* is no industry there can be no Wages Board.,39
292,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,I do not see any essential difference between smelting iron and smelting silver. I must admit that the wages at present are satisfactory.,39
293,Mr HARPER,MANUFACTURES,Then a Board is unnecessary.,39
294,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"The experience is that it is necessary to have a tribunal to deal with every industry in . the Commonwealth. There are, of course, employers prepared to pay fair wages, but there are others who do quite the opposite; indeed, there is one man in Victoria, who calls himself a reputable employer, and yet he pays married men wages as low as £ i per week. I'may add, however, that the men employed in the industry to which I am now incidentally referring will very soon be under a Wages Board. In South Australia a Wages Board cannot be created until a resolution has passed both Houses, and those who know the Legislative Council in that State will realise the difficulties in the way.",39
295,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"It cannot be worse than the Legislative Council of Victoria ! ' Mr HUTCHISON - I think it is a little worse. It should be a simple matter to draft the clause to carry out the-wishes that have been expressed, so that, in the absence of a special tribunal, any tribunal in existence may decide the matter.",39
296,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"Flinders) [3.13]. - I entirely sympathize with the object of the honourable member for Wide Bay. Apart altogether from the general question of new protection, it seems to me that if we spend public money, as is thoroughly de-' sirable, to establish the iron industry, we ought to take some means of securing to .the workmen proper remuneration and conditions of labour.",39
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"In this case, could only be to secure fair conditions, because the conditions are already very fair.",39
298,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"The difficultyis that we cannot leave this matter to the Commonwealth authority, because, under the Constitution, its power in industrial matters is confined to disputes which extend beyond the limits of one State. There may be no dispute, or, if so, it probably may not extend for some time into another State. It will not do to leave this power to the Minister. Not only is it extremely undesirable that the political head should control, and have the power from time to time to control, the conditions of a particular business, but there is a constitutional difficulty Sir WILLIAM LYNE . - I shall move the Chairman out of the chair; I am quite tired of this !",39
299,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,I am endeavouring to help the Treasurer. Surely we have a right to speak on an important measure of this sort?,39
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Quite so; I understand !,39
301,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"Assumin g that the Treasurer desires to have this B i ll carried, and effect given to the suggestibn of the honourable member for Wide Bay",39
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I do.' But I want the business done in areasonable way, and not to have attacks made on me like that made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. Mr 'HUTCHISON - The honourable member made an attack upon me.",39
303,Mr W,MANUFACTURES,". H . IRVINE - Whateve r the differences may be between the Minister and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I certainly agree with the suggestion made by the latter that we ought to embody in this Bill , before we send it to another place, a clause that will give effect to our desire. Perhaps it would not be constitutional for us to give the Minister the power",39
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The power is given under the Sugar Bounties Act.,39
305,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"I admit that; but I would remind the honourable member that there was recently an extended argument on this subject before the High Court. Without desiring to anticipate the judgment, I would point out that lengthy arguments took place on the question of whether it is constitutional for this Parliament to attach to a bounty conditions with regard to rates of pay, and. hours of it labour. That is a doubtful point, and has not yet been decided. Therefore, it would be unwise to attempt by this B i ll to give the Minister power to do something which possibly we may not do ourselves. The only form vvhich the suggested clause could properly take is that of providing that there shall be remitted to some State industrial authority the determination of the rates of wages; the hours of labour, and so forth, to prevail in the industry. I recognise that it might be desirable to enable the manufacturers to go on with their operations before such matters can be referred to a State industrial authority. The present conditions may not be unfair, and the Minister should not be prevented from . paying bounties even for the period before the questions relating to conditions ot labour could be referred to the Court. But either side should have-the opportunity to apply to a State industrial authority, and if the conditions of labour and rates of wages determined by that authority are not observed, the Minister should not be at liberty to pay' any further bounties.

I do on not intend to go back on any vote that I have cast in this Hous'e. But I do know that if this industry had been located in Victoria, or in any other State except New South Wales, the Bill would have had no chance of being passed through the House today. Every honourable member upon the other side of the chamber has now been a protectionist upon some item-eithe r upon wire netting, puddled bar iron, pig iron, or something else. I fail to see why prisonof made wire netting produced in Australia should be prevented from participating in the proposed bounty, seeing that it would not compete with any established industry.",41

331,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURES,"West Sydney) Upon the present occasion I find myself in a very unfortunate position. I was ber of the Royal Commission which. appointed to inquire into rounding the iron industry, and after listening carefully to the evidence adduced by that body, I cast my vote with the minority. I did not intend to alter that vote, view of the fact that the gentlemen with whom I have been associated fiscally fo so long have seen fit to support this sure, I can only follow in their admirable and honourable footsteps. I cordially echo the remarks of the honourable member Parramatta in denouncing in the most enthusiastic way' the attempt of Victoria to compete by means of prison labour with free labour of the State which I represent. If that sort of thing is to be encouraged, obviously it would be wise for this State to incarcerate as many able-bodied workers as possible with the object of buildthe ing up the industry. Such a state of things ought not to be tolerated for a moment. Since we have to choose between the imposition of a duty and the payment of a bounty I shall vote in favour of the adoption of the latter course.",42

I cannot understand Treasurer suggesting that this provision is designed to give a bounty to Messrs. Lysaght. If he wishes to do that, he should embody the proposition in a special Bill. - Mr HEDGES (Fremantle) [3.48] When the Tariff Commission was taking evidence, it was informed that a man working an imported machine received 8s. 6d. for turning out 1,200 yards of wire netting, the labour cost of making the netting being about 12s. .a mile. But the bounty now being offered is equivalent to 48s. If the netting were being woven out of wire made in Australia, I should not mind giving a bounty of £ 3 a ton to encourage the industry; but we are asked to do too much for an industry which uses imported wire.",42

375,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,How did the company get correits special rights in Sydney?,44
376,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"I do not think these slurs should be cast on any Parliament. I had something to do with the original negotiations between the company and the South Australian Government, and the arrangements were mostly made by Sir Charles Todd, on the one hand, and Mr. Warren on the other. Such imputations as are being cast would f all , off Sir Charles Todd like water off a duck; that gentleman was above any unfair or corrupt dealing. Undoubtedly, the result of those negotiat tions was to make much better terms for the Commonwealth in cable ""matters, though I admit that it was the competition or the expectation of the competition of the Pacific Cable which put pressure on the company to reduce their rates. But it is not fair to attack the integrity of the company. The Government, having decided that they should own the cable, the next question arose as to what method should be adopted ? Should the cables of the company be bought as a going concern, or sliould the Government lay down freshcables alongside?

411,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"The Government asked the company' what they would sell their cables and plant for, and Mr Warren, after consulting the London Board, submitted an offer.",46
412,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"£ 3 3 , 0 0 0 was the price that he asked. , Mr BATCHELOR - That was the final offer.

415,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"Because ""there was nothing to be gained. We asked them to lift the cable so that we might inspect it , stating that if they would do so we might proceed to purchase it .",46
416,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"So far from that being the case, the question of raising the cable and testing it had not been mentioned prior to this correspondence.",47
417,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,Not up to that time.,47
418,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,The plain fact is that the company made an offer to the Government which was refused.,47
419,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"It was of no"" use.",47
420,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,The Department refused the offer of the company to allow one of its officers to board the steamer which was to lift the cable.,47
421,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,It was not going to lift the cable.,47
422,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"As a matter of fact the cable was lifted, and I produce specimens of it. The Government rejected a bond fide offer by the company toinspect the cable. There is no doubt about that.",47
423,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,There is every doubt. The offer was of no use whatever. Mr BATCHErLOR - The honourable member would say anything.,47
424,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"That is unworthy of the honourable member"". Surely he does not suppose that I have anvthing to gain byrecommending this project?",47
425,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"And I have nothing to gain by declaring that this matter should be inquired into. . I say that the .Postmaster-General is doing a bad piece of business, and it is my duty to prevent that. I do not suggest' that the Postmaster-General is guilty of any wrongdoing, but I feel that the prejudice which exists in the Central Office against the tension Telegraph Company is responsible for the refusal of the Department to close with an advantageous offer.",47
426,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,I have every reason to believe that the two cables belonging to that company are rotten.,47
427,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"How can the postmaster-General make that statement, seeing that the Department have never taken the trouble to inspect them? As a matter of fact, the Department refused an opportunity of inspecting them. Further, when the company offered to send it specimens of the cables no notice was taken of its communications.",47
428,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,The Department offered to inspect the cables at the company's expense.,47
429,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,But it did not offer to do that at first.,47
430,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"I repeat that the company offered to allow the Government to inspect the cables when they were lifted and tested. It is true that at a later stage the Government demanded that the company at its own expense should enable the cables to be lifted in two places .and inspected by its engineers. The reply . which it received was that the request was a most unusual one, and that the company ought not to be called upon to pay the cost of testing the cables. It further pointed out that the lifting of a cable very frequently injures it, and consequently the Government ought io pay the cost of the inspection. I submit that the proposal of the Government was a most outrageous one. .",47
431,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,My engineers inform me that lifting the cable would not have injured it.,47
432,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"Ha d the Postmaster-General taken advantage of the 0 offer which was made upon two occasions when the cable was lifted the Department might, with some show of fairness, have taken up the stand which it did. But the correspondence discloses a determined desire on the part of the Government to have nothing whatever to do with v the company, and to leave, if possible, its cables idle. Mr Mauger.^- I had the very opposite desire, and I did everything t'o bring negotiations to a successful issue ",47
433,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,The earnestness cf the Postmaster-General is not revealed Exin the correspondence. Why was not this proposal brought down when the House would have had an opportunity of fully considering it? It has been deferred until the last day of the session in order that itmight be got through without discussion.,47
434,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,That is a very unfair statement to make.,47
435,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"I can, only judge the position by the facts. The Government ""propose to purchase a new cable for £50,000, and to expend an additional ; € S ' ° upon plant and accessories, mak1 0 0 ing a total of £65,000. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company made a bond fide offer to the Government, which the latter refused-'no t upon the ground that' it was unfair-bu t because the company would not agree to provide for an inspection by lifting the cable in two places at its own expense, notwithstanding that such - a proceeding would be likely to injure it.",47
436,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"That is denied, by experts.",48
437,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"Le t the Postmaster-General bring his own common sense to bear upon the question. Surely it is obvious that the liftin g of a cable which lies in forty-eight fathoms of water is likely to strain it. The company took"" up a perfectly fair position when it held that the Government should inspect the cable at their own expense, seeing that the Department had refused to examine it when the opportunity of doing so was presented.",48
438,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,That examination would not have been of any value.,48
439,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"The Postmaster General jumps at conclusions. The cor. respondence shows that the reason which the Department gave for refusing the offer of the company was that negotiations had not then begun. As a matter, of fact, they had been proceeding for some months. Now the Postmaster-General says that the reason the Department refused to inspect - the cable was that such an examination would have been of no value.' Why did not the Department think of that excuse before? No better opportunity for ascertaining the condition of the cable could have been offered than that of accompanying the company's steamer, which was en- gaged in the task of lifting, cutting, and splicing that cable.' The honourable member for Fremantle reminds me that one of the reasons advanced by the manager of the company for refusing to lift the cable at their own expense was that when. once .a cable has been bedded it is very much - safer than it is for some time after it has been lifted and relaid; because it has then to find a new bed. That fact must * be obvious. I have no desire to prolong this debate, but I ask honourable members fo seriously consider whether we'ought to vote £ 6 5 . 0 0 0 for the laying of one cable alone when we can obtain a going concern which, so far as tests have disclosed, - is in a satisfactory condition, for £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 . Is not valuable material being sacrificed for mere prejudice? I am absolutely disinterested, in this matter, but that is the conclusion which I have come to through reading the correspondence. The Government has transacted this business badly. All sorts of objections were raised, and ""when.'they were met by the company, further objections were pressed, the desire being shown throughout not to purchase, but to leave the company stranded with its cables. Had the Government purchased the company's cables, it would have obtained the whole of the Tasmanian busi-' ness; but, under present arrangements, it will have to compete with, the company.. J. do. not say that the £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 asked by the company is or is not a fair price; thar is for experts to determine. It is, however, obvious that the offer was rejected, not' because of the amount, but on the ground that the companyshould bear the expense of liftin g the cable to enable it to be examined. This work would not have cost the Government more, than £ 2 0 0 .",48
440,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"If the expenditure would have been only trifling, why would not the company undertake it?",48
441,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,I have stated one of two of the' reasons why it was not fair to ask it to do so.,48
442,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,"-The company demanded £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 for its interests.",48
443,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"That offer included property .which the Government said it did not want; the company did not recede from its offer at £ 3 3 , 0 0 0 , plus £ 6 , 0 0 0 for the remainder of its subsidy. If the honourable member offered a turnout, consisting of a buggy and horse, for £ 5 0 , and afterwards, learning that only the horse would be purchased, asked £ 2 0 for it , . he could not be accused of having made an extortionate demand in the first instance. Having placed this information in the possession of honourable members, I ask them to consider it without prejudice, and to act, not as supporters or opponents of the Government, but in the public interest. I - hope that the Government will leave out of. the Bill the item providing for. payment for the cable. MT. MCWILLIAMS - It has accepted' a tender.",48
444,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"No ; but I understand that a tender, £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 lower than the departmental estimate, has been submitted.",48
445,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MANUFACTURES,B y a first-class firm.,48
446,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,Yes ; a firm which supplies cables to all parts of. the world.,48
447,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"Maribyrnong - Postmaster-General) [4.52] - It seems to me that if there has been any special pleading in this matter, it has been on the part of the honourable member. The company, in its negotiations with the Government, continually wasted. time by informing us, through its local agents, that the Central ""Board must be cabled to for authority, and - at length it became apparent that, unless we took definite action, we should ultimately find ourselves in its hands, without an opportunity to lay a cable of our own before our contract had terminated. The first test proposed would have been of no value, because of the conditions surrounding it, although it might have committed the Government to the purchase of the cable.",48
448,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,Why is that shown in the correspondence?,49
449,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"It was demonstrated to me. The correspondence does not show all the negotiations. It was pointed out to the company that it, having the cable for sale, was the vendor; and whoever heard of a vendor requiring an intending purchaser to pay the cost of exhibiting an article which was for sale? The Government naturally declined to bear the expense of testing the cable. These negotiations have cost me a large amount of thought and attention; and I urge the House, in the interests of the. public, to permit of the tender for the new contract being accepted by passing this. Supply. Bill . My experts assure me that the life of the present cable, at most, will not be more than nine and a-half or ten years, while that of a new cable would be from twenty to twenty-five years.",49
450,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"All cables may be superseded before that time, by wireless or some other system of telegraphy.",49
451,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"At present, the price of copper is very low, and if we do not get authority and accept the tender submitted, we . may find ourselves at .the mercy of the market, which in all probability will rise. House to accept my assurance that I did everything possible to secure a fair and reasonable offer from the company. I believe that I am acting in the best interests of ' the Commonwealth in urging the acceptance of the tender for a new cable. If the item is struck out, honourable members must take the responsibility of a course which may result in forcing us to buy the company's cables at whatever price they choose to fix, or of laying another cable at a time when the price of copper wire will be much higher than it is now.",49
452,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Dalley) [4-57]-- Although the session is in its dying throes, and honourable members are impatient of long speeches, the importance of the Bill justifies a few remarks. We have already passed fiveSupply Bills during the current year, and we are now asked to grant Supply for the first three months of the next financial year. Last time, and the time before, I protested as strongly as I could against this course, showing that if resulted in Parliament losing control of finance, and the Treasurer promised that further Supply Bills would not beintroduced. I admit that the session has been a long one; but some excuse is always ofnot fered for the introduction of a measure of this kind. When we meet next September, another Supply Bill will be put before us.",49
453,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The ' Estimates-inChief will be laid on the table as soon as possible.,49
454,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,Yes ; they will be ready then.,49
455,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Experienc e shows that they will not be ready. The honourable member for Boothby has pointed out that, while nominally asking only for Supply to cover expenditure on ordinary services, the Government is really asking for authority to spend out of the Treasurer's Advance for works and buildings.",49
456,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,It is better that the House should know how the money is to be spent than that the expenditure should take place from the Treasurer's Advance without it having that information.,49
457,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"It must be recognised that the-Treasurer's advance is to meet not ordinary, but extraordinary, expenditure. Apparently, however, the Treasurer likes to have a little money box of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , into which he can dip, and then afterwards, as he did three weeks ago, come to Par- liament for an indemnity. Why, Mr. Speaker, when we passed the Additional I ask the Estimates, we had to ratify expenditure made while the right honourable member for * Swan was in office. This I regard as a slovenly way of handling the finances j and the most serious work of a representative is to see that the finances are properly administered. I am not prepared to say, whether the honourable member for Boothby, is correct in his contentions in regard to - the Tasmanian cable: but the speech of the Postmaster-'General in reply reminded me of the old Scotch jurist who divided human nature into three classes-prevari cators, infernal prevaricators, and experts; and I must class the honourable gentleman under the last head.. I know that we are all weary of the long session; and I have no desire to inconvenience honourable members by bringing them back next week to resume the consideration of this Supply Bill ; but for that consideration, I should have felt compelled to resist this measure to the bitter end. All I can do now is to protest against Bills of the kind being introduced in the dying hours of the session. ' No member, however clear his perceptive powers, could possibly deal effectively with a Bill introduced in this sudden way,' but he must accept it in confidence; and, while I do not think the Government' would dp anything that was disreputable, items might be passed that we should afterwards regret. However, if the Government will not accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Boothby to postpone one or two of the items, then Ministers must take the responsibility. I admit that that is an easy wav of avoiding my own responsib i l it y ; but if I spoke for hours, I snould not be able to get a vote against the passing of the measure. It is a great wonder to me, however, that the. press have not commented .on the unfortunate policy of a Government in living on a series of Supply' Bills; and the position can, I think, be most aptly described in a phrase which was very popular in a comic opera some years ago-""Ain' t it sickening?"" Here we are beginning a new year with a three months' Supply Bill , although the Government have declared themselves against the practice. When I opposed the last Supply Bill , I suggested that we ought to make an effort to complete the business, so as to commence the new year.under a proper system. Before I sit down, I should like to express regret that the Seat of Government Bill has not been disposed of. While I think that - Parliament will re-^affirm its original decision, I submit, although I opposed that decision, - that it would be in the interests of Australia and of New South Wales to have the matter finally settled.",49
458,Mr KELLY,MANUFACTURES,"Wentworth) [5.5] - I hope honourable members will not unduly protract this discussion. We are bound to admit that the Government are in a somewhat singular difficulty due to no fault pf their own, but mainly to the fact that, in another place, where there are thirty-six members, the Government and their supporters now consist of only three-that is when they are in health. In the pitiable circumstances in which the Ministry find themselves, in having considerable difficulty to keep a quorum to consider their financial measures, it is the duty of the House to treat them with as. much consideration as possible. A number of honourable members of the Labour Party i i i the past always maintained a quorum in order to ' prevent such difficulties' as the Government are experiencing this afternoon; and I think they would have shown more gratitude fbr all the favours the Government, have shown to them, had they "" stood by "" today in order to pass into law the Bill for granting a bonus to the iron industry. However, that 'measure has passed away, and I shall not refer to it further. Inasmuch, however, as the. Government Party, which in this House only numbers sixteen-in other words, a supporter for each Minister-and only three supporters in the Senate, find themselves in difficulties, which are inherent in a party, the numbers of which cannot themselves constitute a quorum, honourable members generally ought to take pity on their helpless and hopeless position, and allow the Supply Bill to pass at the earliest moment.",50
459,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"Hunter) [5.12] - I ' have no desire to delay the passing of the Supply Bill , but I have one or two matters to which I desire to draw the Postmaster General's attention. I am getting tired of constantly receiving letters over his name to the effect that certain works will be proceeded with when circumstances permit,. or when funds are available. Such letters are now the rule rather than the exception.",50
460,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"It will be all right now that, the money is to be voted !",50
461,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"I am not so sure; and unless I can get some kind of assurance that the Postmaster-General will listen to me, I am prepared to stand here for another hour, and to extend the time if necessary. For months past, certain, districts in my electorate have been crying out for telephone facilities. I refer particularly to Lostock, where the people - bitterly feel the absence of telephone ' communication ; and yet over and over again the departmental inspectors have declined to recommend the granting of their request. In my opinion, we have far too few inspectors, and those we have, according to my experience, are incapable of satisfactorily performing their duties, although they are highly paid, and ought to be thoroughly efficient'. In the Underbank district, the people have over and over again requested telephonic communication extending only a few miles, and have offered to supply the posts; but their requests have been refused, and, as-a matter of fact, the departmental estimates of the cost are so great that I do not wonder nt the refusal. I do not believe that the inspectors send in very satisfactory reports; and, therefore, I urge upon the Postmaster-General the necessity of looking a little closer into the matter. The Postmaster-General, with his thirty years' experience,' ought to know how to conduct business in a business-like way; but, as a matter of fact, while there are ' dailv applications for instruments, which do not come to hand, the Department is full of both instruments and wire ready for use. It is only owing to the red-tape system that the wants of the public are left unsupplied, and if something is not done, there will be an outcry which will affect, first, the unfortunate parliamentary representatives, and, secondly, the Parliament itself. I am satisfied that the Minister will, as far as possible, endeavour to right the wrong; and if he does not, there ought to be, and may be, some united effort made to bring him to reason. ' Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [5.13]-I regret that this debate has been prolonged, and I .shall not detain honourable members more than a few minutes. I do not think that we have been well treated by the Government during the past few days, in view of the great rush of business pressed upon us without any justification. Surely the convenience of a few members, or of all honourable members in fact, is as nothing compared with our public duty ? What necessity is there to prorogue to-dav ? Surely honourable members could have given a few more days to permit of many important matters being decided after full discussion in the ordinary way ? I have no objection whatever to the Supply Bill now under consideration, although it may, perhaps, be for a period a little longer than is usual. I point out that there is no three months' Supply Bill for works before us, and, therefore, those works in course of construction will suffer from want of funds on the 30th June, unless the Treasurer comes to the rescue with his Advance. Further, the Treasurer has no provision for any new works that may be required; indeed, we have not been consulted at all in regard to the Works Estimates. I submit that the Treasurer's Advance Account is not intended for the purposes to which the Treasurer informs us today he proposes to apply it. He certainly has no right to pay out of it a sum of over £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 in respect of new cables between Tasmania and the mainland without the specific approval of this House. We have not approved of any vote for such a work, and the Postmaster General informed the House on 29th May last that "" this House will be asked to deal with the matter in some way before any tender is accepted."" The expenditure of moneys out of the Treasurer's Trust Account on new works that have not been approved by this House is contrary to the Constitution, section 8.3, and to the general practice.",50
462,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,"We are now paying a large sum per annum to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, so that the laying of new cables will be a saving in the long run.",51
463,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,But the subsidy to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company in respect of its Tasmanian cables will not cease with the laying down of the new ones. It must be paid up to the date fixed for the termination of the contract..,51
464,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,I am afraid that the newcables will not be laid before then.,51
465,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,I agree with the honourable member for Bass.,51
466,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"Eve n when the Government cables are laid the company will not be prevented from continuing messages over its lines - It seems to me that the negotiations have been characterized by a want of ordinary business methods on the part of the Department. I am not impressed with the .statement made by the Postmaster-General. The company invited the Department to send one of its expert officers on board a steamer with a party which was to lift the cable at two points,' pointing out that the - officer would thus be afforded an opportunity of ascertaining its condition. One would imagine that such a fair and reasonable offer would have been promptly accepted, but, as a matter of fact, it was curfly refused. The Postmaster-General says that no good would have resulted from such an inspection. Business men will not be inclined to agree with that view. Four months after that offer had been declined, the Postmaster General requested the company to raise the cable for inspection. In the meantime the company's steamer had probably sailed for other parts, and the company's representatives naturally demurred to incur the expense of engaging another vessel to lift the cable unless it was remunerated by the Government, and without any condition as to purchase if the inspection was satisfactory. The price asked - by the company for the purchase of - its cables and plant£33,000-wa s not, in my opinion, too high, but, if it was so, that ground would have been a good one on which to go to arbitration. I am inclined to think that will cost the Government twice as much to lay the new cables, more especially as twelve miles of cables have to be directors laid underground. The Government should have made an effort to come to terms with the company. The taking over of its cables would have been a more economical arrangement than that now proposed by the Government, and it would have removed a competitor from the field. This company has a world-wide reputation. Its business association with the States tends over thirty years, and one would rally imagine that in the circumstances the Commonwealth Government would have a friendly feeling towards it. I have never knownthe company to fail to carry properly and well any agreement made by it. When I was Premier of Western tralia it laid the cable from Fremantle the Cocos Islands,, and my relations, with were most satisfactory. One would think that friendly relations would exist between the company and the Government; but the correspondence throughout suggests an friendliness on the part of the Post Office, which is to be regretted. There seems lie an idea on the part of the Postal partment, as at present administered, it must pick a quarrel with every one with whom it does business.",51
467,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"We do not want a annual company to "" best "" the Government, and not that is what this company is trying to do.",52
468,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"I agree with upon the honourable member that no company should be allowed to "" besf the Governout ment.""",52
469,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Why did not this company comply with our request that it should raise the cables for inspection?.,52
470,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,It offered in bring the first instance to do so free of charge.,52
471,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Late r on it would not agree to do that.,52
472,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"That is no reacount, son why the Government and the representaannual services."" tives of the company should be at arms' length. Mutual concessions will always move difficulties, but we find that the vernment, .instead of being prepared negotiate with a view to an amicable rangement for the purchase of the pany's cables, declared in effect to its representatives, "" We will lay cables of [43 ] 2 our own and do our best to render your cables between. Tasmania and the mainland' absolutely valueless to you."" Such an atit titude towards - a company that has been working with the States for thirty years is to be strongly deprecated. No doubt the are keen business men, but that is no reason why we should look upon them with distrust. This company has at present interminable, agreements with four of the States, and may be carrying on business here for hundreds of years to come. It is certainly not to the advantage of those States that we should adopt that high-handed procedure in exwhich the Postmaster-General appears to natudelight. I do not know whom he thinks he is pleasing by carrying on negotiations in such a manner, but it would seem, by his action, that he thinks he is pleasing someout body. I am sure it is not the desire of the House that he should treat with Auscontempt every one with whom the Deto. partment does business.' We expect not it only friendly, but generous, treatment to be' extended to those with whom we have business relations. The purchase of two new cables has not been submitted to this House unfor approval, as promised by the Postmaster-General on 29th May. There is also ho to provisionfor it on the"" Estimates, and it Dehas never been considered by the House. that The Treasurer's Advance Account is designed to meet extraordinary or unforeseen expenditure in connection with ' ' the ordinary services of the Government,'' and to provide for new works for which this House should be asked to provide by a specific vote. If the Treasurer insists doing an illegal act by advancing this large sum out of his Advance Account witha vote of the House he will have to answer for it. I believe that he will think twice before he does so, but I warn him that if he does attempt to provide for this work out of his Advance Account we shall try to home to him the fact that he is acting illegally, and that he must accept the responsibility for his action. This is a new work, arid cannot be included in the appropriation for the Treasurer's Advance Acwhich is provided for "" ordinary I have no desire to place the Government in a difficulty, rebut they alone are. responsible for the Gotrouble that has arisen. We have a duty to to perform that is far more important than arany consideration as to the prorogation comto-da.y. I am anxious that Parliament ' should be prorogued without delay. I am opposed to the Treasurer providing for these cables out of his Advance Account. I do not think it is reasonable, and certainly is not legal. If he has power to he has power to do anything since the Constitution Act forbids his doing that. The licensed to liework has not been included in any ApproI priation Act; it has not been recommended by the Governor General, and cannot therea fore be legally proceeded with. having to delay the House at this ister stage, but I have a public duty to perAvhatever form. I am here, not in the interests of the company or of the Government, but in the interests.of the country. To matters not whether this cable is purchased, so long as the best possible arrangement is made, in the public interest. I haye the correspondence relating' to this ter, and I say that the Postmaster-General has not treated the Eastern Extension graph Company with ihe courtesy to which it was entitled. If all the negotiations disclosed in that correspondence, I do not' think he will find it an easy task to justify his action.",52
473,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,"Riverina) [5.33] I desire to make a personal exmay planation. . On Wednesday last, it came my duty, in defence of my honour, to deal with the statements made by several gentlemen-reveren d and otherwise-wh o formed a deputation which had waited the Prime Minister. Exception has been taken to some of my remarks upon occasion, and after perusing the Hansard report of my speech, I wish to express regret that-smarting , as I was, under a now asked for. sense of injustice- I - allowed my feelings to carry me away. For instance, in replying to Mr MCCutcheon's statement Council of Churches was unanimously be.hind the Postmaster-General in the action which had beeri taken, and that the prohibitotion had been issued only after the fullest inquiry and consideration, I statedEvery one knows that that is not correct. That assertion was intended to apply only to Mr MCCutcheon's declaration that the prohibition upon the correspondence of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace had been issued after the fullest inquiry and consideration. I find that I also described Mr. MCCutcheon as "" a pettifogging solicitor,"" and I regret having referred to him in that way. The profession of a solicitor is a good one, but, like every other profession, it contains all sorts-bot h good and bad. I regret that, whilst smarting under a sense of injustice, I applied that term to Mr. MCCutcheon. Another statement in reference to the same gentleman which I wish to do that, unconditionally withdraw, isI t seems an anomaly for a solicitor who is further said that both Mr MCCutcheon and the Rev. T. B. S. Woodfull had told deliberate lie. From the information I regret which I have received from' the Prime Minand others since, I have no hesitation in saying that I should not have made that statement. I recognise that it is a very strong one to make in respect-of a me it member of the cloth. I know now that these gentlemen based their statements upon a certain letter which has been read to thisread House. At the same time, I regret that matthey were misinformed. In conclusion, I desire to say that, in the action which I Teletook in the case of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace, I had only one object in vieware a desire that justice should be done. I was .influenced by no personal feeling whatever. I simply held that, as a matter of British justice, an accused person should be found guilty before punishment was inflicted. I wish to express my sincere regret for what be regarded as. insulting references to betwo gentlemen who had made accusations which were not' warranted by facts.

But I submit' that the Treasurer, out of his Advance Account, proposes to pay moneys for' works which do not properly come within the scope of that advance. Under the all moneys in connection with an new buildings, additions and works, must be submitted in a separate Bill, and not a Bill which includes the ordinary Esti",58
482,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERN AUSTRALI A,"I would point out to the honourable member that the money with which it is intended to pay for the works included in the schedule which I have laid upon the table, will be voted under this Bill.",59
483,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN AUSTRALI A,"The honourable member for Swan will recognise that the stage which we have now reached is the third reading of the Bill. It is not, therefore, competent, either to recommit the measure, or to reconsider any item contained in it. The only course ' open to honourable members is either to accept or reject it upon the motion for its third reading.",59
484,Mr WILKS,WESTERN AUSTRALI A,"Dalley) [5.44] - The Treasurer has placed honourable members in a very awkward position by declaring that we must either agree to the carrying out of the works included in the schedule which he has submitted, or accept responsibility for having stopped the public works of the. country.",59
485,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERN AUSTRALI A,I would point out to the honourable member that the Bill has passed the stage at which it can be amended.,59
486,Mr WILKS,WESTERN AUSTRALI A,"I know that all I can do now is to protest. It is, however, an insult to representative government for the Treasurer to tell us, "" Now is your chance,"" when we can do nothing but protest, and, according to the right honourable member for Swan, are in an unconstitutional position.",59
487,Mr FISHER,WESTERN AUSTRALI A,"Wide Bay) [5.46] - I do not wish to prevent what the Treasurer desires to do; but the only excuse for the course being taken is that we are right at the end of the session. I am not approving of the proceeding which, under other circumstances, might lead to the most serious consequences. Besides, as the right honourable member ' for Swan was' good enough to remind me, section 54 of the Constitution Act clearly enacts that an Appropriation Act can cover only expenditure for the ordinary services - of the year in which it is passed. As in this case, the expenditure can be covered by the Treasurer's Advance, and the reasons for it are generally understood, I am content to allow the Billto go through. The Treasurer has shown himself very astute iri the position which he has secured for himself in this instance. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA REIMBURSEMENT BILL . Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of ft message from His Excellency the vernor-General ^recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill. In Committee: Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum' for the purpose of reimbursing expenses incurred by candidatesin connection, with certain elections which have been declared void, and in proceedings in relation thereto. ' Resolution reported. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed to- That the Standing Orders be suspended as to allow the Report to be considered this day and a Bill to be passed through all its stages forthwith. Report adopted. Ordered That Sir William Lyne and Mr Groom do> prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented and read a first time.",59
488,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,^-Treasurer) [5.50] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time.,59
489,Mr KELLY,ELECTION EXPENSES,We ought to be told what the Bill is. It has not yet been distributed.,59
490,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,"The Bill authorizes the appropriation of .£1,315 for the payment of the expenses incurred in connection with - elections declared to be void through the fault of the Electoral Department. The names of the persons concerned, and the amounts proposed to be paid to them, are:- Mr Vardon, £467 3s. od.; Mr Blundell, £259. is.; Mr O'Loghlin, £ 3 7 8s. i d . ; Mr. Palmer, £367 us 2d.; and Mr Kennedy, ^182 18s. od. These names and amounts are not in the Bill, because, although I - desire parliamentary authority for the payment of the sum I have mentioned, it is my intention to again go through the claims with the Crown Law officers, to see that they are not at all excessive. I propose also to pay ,£45 to Mrs Crosbie, whose late husband was a candidate for the Senate, and would have been elected had he not died very shortly after the poll was taken. This is a matter of pure charity.",59
491,Mr MALONEY,ELECTION EXPENSES,Of pure justice.,59
492,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,I think Mrs. Crosbie is entitled to something; but I have yet to inquire further into the matter.,59
493,Mr WILKS,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Dalley) [5.55] - I do not Goobject to the payment of this money, though I would point out that while the Electoral Act provides that no candidate shall spend more than £10 0 on an election, it is proposed, according to the Treasurer, to pay a much larger sum to some of the candidates in the elections with which we are dealing.",59
494,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,They are being reimbursed legal as well as electoral expenses.,60
495,Mr WILKS,ELECTION EXPENSES,"This is not the first occasion when the faulty character of bur electoral machinery has been made manifest, and I hope Parliament"" will be afforded an early opportunity to amend the electoral law. It will be a serious thing if every election is to cost the country £1,500 because of the mistakes of electoral officers. Furthermore, as I contended when the measure was before Parliament, it offers. a temptation to speculative lawyers to bring cases against sitting members, not for the benefit of any candidate, but in order to obtain fees. I do not say that any of these candidates should"" not be reimbursed, but the Treasurer in cases of this kind should be careful to do nothing which is opposed to the public interest. His action should be directed not by charity but by justice. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clause 1 agreed to.' Clause 2 (Appropriation for reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with certain void elections).",60
496,Mr TUDOR,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Yarra) [5.58] - Did I understand the Treasurer to say that it is his intention to pay part of the sum hereby, appropriated to Mrs Crosbie? I agree that that lady is entitled fo something, because had her husband lived he would have been returned to the Senate, and, no doubt, his election expenses have been defrayed out of his estate, to her loss.",60
497,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Trea surer) [5.59] - On e naturally leans to a person who is in distress, as this lady is by reason of the death of her husband. Hacl he not borne the cost of an election, she would have been left better off than she is now. I understand that his death was due partly to the exertions made by him when a candidate, and I think that the Government should show consideration to his widow. I wish to be able, either out of the sum now being appropriated, or. from some other fund, to return to her some part of the expenses incurred by her late husband.",60
498,Sir JOHN FORREST,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Swan) [6,0] I wish for more information in regard to this matter. I understand that Mr. Crosbie died between the holding of the election and the declaration of the poll, and that the election was subsequently declared invalid by 'the High Court. If ""that be so, the case of Mr Crosbie should be treated in the same way as that of any other candidate, who has been put to expense in an election which is afterwards voided.",60
499,Mr SPENCE,ELECTION EXPENSES,"But Mr Crosbie would have been elected. Sir JOHN^ FORREST - Then he would probably ""have been unseated by the High Court.. '",60
500,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,That is doubtful.,60
501,Sir JOHN FORREST,ELECTION EXPENSES,"However , I hope that tie Treasurer will treat Mr. Crosbie's widow as liberally as possible, - especially if she is not in very good circumstances.",60
502,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,^-Treasurer) [6.1] - I should like to do so. I wish honourable members to understand that ihe case of Mr Crosbie is not quite on all-fours with the other cases; and my desire is to reimburse his widow for the expense he was put to in fighting the election.,60
503,Sir JOHN FORREST,ELECTION EXPENSES,A sum of £ 4 5 will not do that.,60
504,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTION EXPENSES,That is all that is asked for; and it seems reasonable that we should reimburse the widow her late husband's expenses.,60
505,Mr FISHER,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Wide Bay) r6-.il--It is quite evident that Mrs Crosbie is too modest to employ a legal gentleman to put in a claim, or, otherwise, I think the amount would have been much larger. I hope that' the Treasurer will not offer Mrs Crosbie less than .£100.",60
506,Mr WILKS,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Dalley) [6.4] - Whil e I agree with the honourable member for'Wide Bay as to the amount which should be given, I regard the vote as an act of grace, because it would be straining the meaning of the word to call it an act of justice. Mr Crosbie, unfortunately, died before the declaration of the p o l l but , , supposing he had not died until after he had been returned, and the election had not been questioned, he would have had to pay his own expenses. I know, the view I am taking may not meet with general approval, but I think it right to point out that similar cases may arise in the future; and that, therefore, this ought to be regarded, as I say, as an act of grace.",60
507,Mr FISHER,ELECTION EXPENSES,I do not regard it such. I do not think that Mr Crosbie's death affected in any sense the High Court proceedings.,61
508,Mr WILKS,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Supposin g that I died will take its' course. after my return to Parliament in a similar way, nobody would raise a claim on behalf of mv widow.",61
509,Mr FISHER,ELECTION EXPENSES,"Wide Bay) [6.6] - I do amendment. not desire to be misunderstood. If the honourable member for Dalley thinks that 1 regard this vote as an act of grace, he forthwith. is mistaken. Mr Crosbie. incurred expenditure during the election,. which was clared void; and, in my opinion, it would papers). have been declared void, even if he had lived. Therefore, I say that we ought to return to Mrs Crosbie the money which would have been returned to her husband had he lived; and on that ground I favour' a higher sum than that asked for.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",61
510,Mr MALONEY,COAST DEFENCE APPROPRIATION,"I regret to have to make a personal explanation. I have never' willingly made an untruthful statement in this House, though, of course, I have ""made mistaken statements, which I have always willingly withdrawn. During the discussion on the Tariff the honourable member for Batman accused me of exhibiting certain shoddy articles to honourable members; but I have had those articles examined, and I have ascertained that not one was' shoddy. I gave the honourable member every opportunity to withdraw his statement, and offered to prove that I was right, but that offer was not acas cepted. I now, desire to say that the articles exhibited were not shoddy; and if the honourable member choose to make a statutory declaration to that effect the law PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS BILL.

511,Mr GROOM,COAST DEFENCE APPROPRIATION,"Darling Downs-At torney-General) [6.12] - The Senate has agreed to the whole of the Bill with this .one exception. The clause, which it is proposed shall be left out, gives special protection to newspapers which publish extracts from parliamentary papers. As and to whether the clause omitted is only declaratory of the existing law, I do not desire to express an opinion. The clause was inserted in the Bill because it is part of the English law.

Whether the preference between goods the product of the United Kingdom and those the product of foreign countries, fixed by Parlia. ment, is to be the preference given by the Departments when tenders are called for? 2. If not, will he state what additional preference is to be granted to goods the product of the United Kingdom so that tenderers may know whether it is worth their while to go to considerable expense to obtainprices from the United States and elsewhere?",61
513,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COAST DEFENCE APPROPRIATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. and 2. The present practice has been pursued since 1903, and endorsed by several Governments, but the questionwhether any_ alteration should be made or any additional preference granted, has not yet been considered by the Government. The principal Department concerned is the Post Office, and further particulars are being obtained as to the extent of the practice followed in that Department. LAND ADMINISTRATION : MR.

Was Mr Staniforth Smith's statement, "" that he was convinced that Mr Drummond had no; intention 'of .evading the Executive Council order of December last,"" proved to be erroneous ? 5.

Is the Prime Minister still of opinion that Mr Drummond has been fairly treated ?",62
515,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COAST DEFENCE APPROPRIATION,"The answers followsto the honourable member's questions are as follow1 to 5. These questions are answered by the papers which have already been laid before Parliament and printed. Further information on the matter is contained in two communications from Mr Staniforth Smith, which are About to be laid on the table.",62

Mr CARR asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn connection with the dismissal of Mr. Drummond from the Papuan Civil Service1. Is the Mr Russell, who gave evidence as to Mola being detained in Drummond's room while the applications of Watt and MCAlpine were being pressed forward, the same witness who gave evfdence before the Royal Commission? 2. If . so, did not Russell falsely swear before the Royal Commission that he had seen Drummond destroying a deed in the Lands Office, which evidence was afterwards proved to be untrue, and the deed that Russell swore had been destroyed was found and produced to the Commission by Mr Drummond ? 3. Is it not obvious from the depositions that Russell swore falsely before the Executive Council that Mola was in Drummond's room when Watt and MCAlpine's applications were being recorded, inasmuch as Mola himself states that he was elsewhere, and Pinney swore that Mola was not there? 4. If it is a fact fhat Russell gave false evidence before the Royal Commission, to implicate Drummond, and if his evidence before the Executive is obviously untrue, will the Government persist in punishing Drummond on the strength of reports based on the evidence of such a person?",62
521,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COAST DEFENCE APPROPRIATION,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as If the honourable member will examine the papers on this matter already printed and the communications from Mr Staniforth Smith about to be made public, he will see that they answer his questions.",62

Is it not a fact that when the House again meets, nearly ten months' correspondence be the tween the Prime Minister of Australia and Imperial Naval authorities, on a matter of great public importance to Australia, will have been kept from the knowledge of Parliament? 3. Is it not afact that in that correspondence, corporated accountants, and duly certify which has not yet been made public, the Imthe perial Naval authorities have declined the Prime Minister's proposals as set out in his Defence speech of December, and urged the imperative necessity of any Australian Naval flotilla being placed under the Imperial Commander-in-Chief lation. in time of war as a condition of any modification of the existing Naval Agreement? 4. Whether he considers himself constitutionally justified in carrying on, over a period of many months, and behind the back of Parliareferred ment, detailed negotiations for the cancellation or modification of a ten years' agreement the Mother Country which was carefully and deliberately entered into by. the Commonwealth and endorsed by a large majority of the people's representatives ?",63
525,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COAST DEFENCE APPROPRIATION,"In reply..tp the honourable member's questions, I beg difficulties. to state that the correspondence which has passed on this subject is very small, and practically consists of one . general letter from the Admiralty, which suggested to the Government a number of specific quesingtions which have been answered. The only reason why the papers have not yet - been made public is that the matter is at present quite incomplete, and would not add materially to knowledge of the subject.

537,Mr KELLY,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Wentworth) [8.55] There is a glad air about the proceedings this evening, with which I am in hearty PAPERS. accord. But, in order that the joy of the moment may not be marred by any prospect of an early meeting of Parliament, I d d i - wish to ask the - Treasurer whether the Houses will be prorogued by proclamation prior to the date mentioned in the motion for adjournment?",64
538,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Yes . Mr KELLY.'-So long as we understand what the Government propose, I am quite sure that there will be no objection raised from ' the crowded Opposition benches.",64
539,Mr FISHER,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Wide Bay) [8.56] - I desire to express my gratification at the legislation which has been enacted this session. It is remarkable from two points of view. We have effected a large measure of Tariff reform, in which the whole commercial community was interested, and we have also enacted social legislation, the of which has not previously been enacted in Australia. I hope that we shall all return next session invigorated by our holiday, and that we shall then complete some of the work upon which we have entered during the lif e of the present Parliament. I trust that we shall all spend a pleasant recess, and that, whatever changes may take place, the harmony which has generally characterized our proceedings in this House will be preserved.",65
540,Mr MALONEY,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Melbourne) [8.57] I feel perfectly certain that those honourable members who are present, and every honourable member who is absent, desire to express their thanks to the officers of Parliament for the work which they have done - to the Hansard staff, the Librarian, and those in attendance upon the Chamber. Every officer has done his duty.",65
541,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,What about Mr Speaker?,65
542,Mr MALONEY,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Mr Speaker occupies sd paramount a position lhat any praise.from, me for the work which he performs would be in the nature of gilding re-, fined gold.",65
543,Mr TUDOR,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,Do not forget the Chairman of Committees?,65
544,Mr MALONEY,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"He keeps such an eagle eye upon me that I shall leave the love which I bear him unexpressed. I am sorry that the Prime Minister, owing to the bereavementwhich he has just suffered,'is not present this evening.. But I desire to say that communications have been opened up with him upon one subject which I feel sure will in the near future loom as largely in our political firmament as did - the question of old-age pensions.' Just as I am proud of the work that has been done in that connection, and while I am delighted that ho dissentient voice was raised when the Old-age - Pensions Bill was under discussion, so I hope that, at a future date, we' shall have a unanimous House in favour of granting provision for children when their parents have not sufficient means to properly feed and clothe them. Of course, I recognise the difficulties that will be experienced by the Treasurer in sparing more money. But, during the recess, I ask him to take into consideration an Australian institution which I believe is unique in the world. In the O l d World there are foundling hospitals in which young children can be left. The death rate in such institutions is enormous;, but in the Waitara Home, a little outsidelike of Sydney, and in a lesser degree in a similar institution near Melbourne, we have the finest institution of its kind under the British flag-a n institution which offers to> a mother carrying a child a home for three months prior to its birth, and for six months subsequently, thereby promoting the ties of affection. I want the Treasurer to consider whether there is not some way in which that institution, and any kindred institution, car* be assisted. I may add that it takes nocognisance of creed or religion, but is prepared to help any prospective mother whois in difficulty. 1 hope that when we have any money to spare, the Treasurer, out of the kindness of his heart, will look to thesecharities. The Prime Minister is heartily in accord with the object that I have inview. In glowing and eloquent language he has promised to assist this institution in any way that he can. With the knowledge that his chief is so sympathetic, andi his own heart beating in sympathy with the little ones, I hope that' whera he can spare any funds for the purpose he will bear my remarks in mind. I feel certain that if , after the last sessionof this Parliament, members can go to> their constituents, and tell them that, in their wisdom, they have passed legislationfor preserving the best immigrant we have-the Australian baby-the y will have nocause to regret it .",65
545,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Wimmera) [9.1J - As a new member, I wish to express my pleasure that, during the session, Parliament has succeeded in passing two suchimportant measures as the Tariff-which , I believe, while not doing everything that we could hope for in the development of ourmanufactures, will largely assist them-and the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill , which was agreed to without a dissentient voice. I have been very much impressed with the conscientious manner in which honourable members have fought to secureeffect to their political convictions, and the uniform good feeling and kindliness displayed in their private relations. Political' experience is new to me, but what' I have seen and heard within the walls of this building has given me a better opinion of human nature. I hope that the great P""arliament of the Commonwealth may long continue an instrument of beneficent legislation for the welfare of the people of Australia.",65
546,Mr COON,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Batman) [9.2] - I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne has made a personal explanation affecting myself. As I did not hear it, I have only to say that I shall read the report of his speech, consider his statements, and, at the proper time, if necessary, reply to them.",66
547,Mr MALONEY,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"And if I have said what was wrong, I shall give the honourable member fair play.",66
548,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.3] - I do not know how much the honourable member for Melbourne expects to receive for the institution to which he has referred; but I am heartily in sympathy with its objects, and wish to do all I can to assist it. Still I shall have to consult the Prime Minister, who, the honourable member says, is in accord with him, and shall try to do all that is reasonably possible to meet his wishes. As reParliament was, on n t h June, Proclamation :Commonwealth of Australia By His Excellency to wit BARON NORTHCOTE, Distinguished Governor General.

549,Mr GROOM,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Luckily , the honourable member has a good temper.",66
550,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ELECTIONEXPENS ES,"Some personssay that I have not. I threw into the work as much energy as I had, and, I trust that what little unpleasantness arose from time to time will be forgotten. I thank honourable members for their attention, and especially those who stuck to me so gloriously. The Tariff has not .satisfied my desires, but the results are better than many protectionists expected to achieve, and we have now a structure which, I hope, will be greatly improved on some future occasion.
