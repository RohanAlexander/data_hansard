That was the background and the catalyst. addressing the year 2000 problem-it had governments in Australia and by the private legis,Iation we have before us-and for the purpose legislation-was appropriate for Australia.

It does not address all the issues has taken alternative strategies to pursue coordination, establishing means for individuals I am not sure, in the Australian system, that by legislation. It may well be that the alternative being taken are more appropriate. We should not be under any illusion about 2000 problem preliminary survey results found undertaking Y2K protection.

The US does not expect NA 3078 to be 100 per cent compliant until July 1999 States, so if our critical systems are not going are cutting it fine.

Compared to most compare ourselves, Australia is up towards the year 2000 problem-and nobody has found corporation, that has had a magic wand to solve to score cheap points. We are ahead of the we have at least got the track record of having the government acted. The Howard government expects Y2K compliance $600 million, as I understand it. The US government fix its mission critical systems. So I am surprised that $127 million of extra spending has been those differences, our continuing support for problem. We have been pushing for months, in particular year, for a number of measures, one of which today. During that first week in December we and other statements seeking to provoke Commonwealth response, through its own disclosure I am pleased we have the legislation before Whether it is exactly what we would have done what any Australian government would do in the Clinton administration's year 2000 'good Westminster system style response and so, for could be, if time was available, merit in an amendments, but we do not have the luxury legislation have done a good job, a good job we will support this legislation in its passage will support it in the Senate.

So I do not want pack, but I think we could have been further, and been raising that issue for some time before costs for the Commonwealth to be around estimates it will spend $6.4 billion to at the $600 million figure and I am surprised seen to be sufficient. But let us reaffirm, despite initiatives to cope with and respond to the Y2K during the early weeks of December last was legislation of the sort we have before us made a couple of announcements, press releases and promote 'good Samaritan' legislation and and otherwise, to the Y2K problem. us; and, in what it does contain, we support it. is really beside the point. It is substantially responding to the same imperatives that led to Samaritan' legislation. This is essentially a what is in the legislation, we support it.

Howis very interesting, not so much because of what a year ago, in relation to a discussion on the from one of the programmers of the day: I used to write those programs back in the '60s and to squeeze a few elements of space out of my program then it was very important. We used to spend a lot before we started to write our programs so that to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our than a few years. And, as a consequence, they were look at some of the programs I wrote 30 years ago my way through step by step. And to try to infer how ways of doing things and all you've got is the code Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal to be considered a rash or inconsiderate or one of the most respected people in the NA 3084 Western world. When this gentleman was learning indeed a programmer, one of those who took clearly, given the nature of that quotation, the time. It also tells us something much more important-not occurred in the first place but also the difficulties problem. As Alan Greenspan said, those programs were very poorly documented. When you programming language in front of you, it is problems. That explains, to some extent, not which governments and corporations have in rectifying those errors and in being sure that code that they are repairing. It is a very at the same time introduce new errors into years and, in some cases, for decades at a affect individuals, businesses and governments international level. Y2K will affect such transportation, defence, manufacturing, generation and so on. The range of issues It is very important to reiterate the all-encompassing terrifying to realise that in October 1998 and they discovered that some 23 per cent not have even started Y2K repairs. With only nearly one-quarter of all governments and not even started those repairs. In January and better. Some 83 per cent of those companies that had fewer than 2,000 employees. It is very governments of the world and Australia, in nature of the problem that they face. It is smaller countries that will cause most of There is no doubt that by March 2000 some not yet begun to address this problem will failures. A cost of a single failure will million, given that it will probably cost them of course, will add up across the board. What are the particular areas that we need been addressed but still need attention? No the electricity generation and water distribution rely heavily on embedded chips that contain particularly difficult to repair and find. As base economy and society. They are particularly economic life of a nation but also for the very case in Australia, thank goodness, but it is is a very powerful source of electricity MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 17 February 1999 his initial trade some 30 years ago, he was great pride in leaving out the two digits. Very it is difficult to blame those who did this work at only the reason that this problem which people now have in rectifying that were not expected to last very long. They have only got the base machine code or COBOL very difficult to go back and find all of those only the nature of the problem but the difficulties tracking down the problems in their code, in they are not introducing more mistakes into the serious issue to go back and fix Y2K problems and programs which have been bedded down for many time. There is no doubt that the Y2K issue will and it will do so at a local, national and wide ranging activities as financial services, telecommunications, health and safety, power that has been detailed is well known to members. nature of this kind of problem. It is a survey was conducted by US government agencies of all companies and governments worldwide will just over 12 months to go back in October 1998, business organisations throughout the world had February 1999, I think the problem is not much have not even started to look at this problem yet much the case that small businesses and small particular, have not yet begun to examine the those small companies and, indeed, in some cases the international and national difficulties. 30 to 50 per cent of those companies that have have experienced one or more mission critical be anything from $30,000 to $A3 million or $A4 a day's business to repair those failures. That, to address most urgently that should have already doubt, as many across the world have said, it is sectors that are probably the most critical. They programs in the silicone itself, which makes them utilities, they support every other sector in our important not only for the continuation of the social fabric of the nation itself. It is not the the case overseas that nuclear power generation generation for many countries. NA Wednesday, 17 February 1999 There are a whole range of countries which of some 25 or 30 per cent of their electricity. Switzerland, Hungary, Korea, Japan, Germany, the electricity comes from nuclear power. In it is unlikely that any Y2K related problem power plant along the lines of Chernobyl physically impossible in the case of modem the reality is that Y2K related problems shutdown of some of those plants. The issue here, in raising those issues about is not to promote undue cause for concern. recently come forward in the media and, indeed, exploit this for almost financial and religious trend, I believe, and one which causes completely is the first time we have faced mission critical The world, and our modem technological Europe, are well used to the idea that individual Qantas or Ansett desk only to be told that the confirmation immediately?

This is the first time, however, when simultaneously, if they are going to fail at life somewhat more difficult, because lightning lines often contribute to the catastrophic failure seaboard suffered that only very recently, as are severe for those who live in the district-not it does not have a flow-through If some of these systems fail at the same time, undue burden on other systems which are Y2K attempt in the normal way to supply the missing will be too great, they will experience power is a possibility-a remote possibility, but a engender the kind of panic which those survivalists engender. I say it because I think it is very nature of this business. We are engaged in a very digital world. economically as well as physically and electronically. sensitive not only to what our fellows in business down and up the supply chain, the customer doing, because failure in one location, failure others. If only 20 per cent of businesses, for then that can have enormous problems for the detail about some of those chips in a moment. MAIN COMMITTEE 3085 rely on nuclear power generation to the extent For example, in France, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Spain more than 30 per cent of the United States it is over 25 per cent. So while would cause any catastrophic failure of a nuclear or Three Mile Island-such things are almost nuclear power plants in the Western Hemispherein non safety critical areas could well cause a utilities and the widespread nature of this issue, Some survivalist types in the United States have some of the Christian Right have sought to purposes in the United States-a very dangerous unnecessary panic. The reality is that this failure across the board on the same day. societies in Australia, the United States and systems will crash. Who has not gone to the computer is down and you cannot get your flight to some banking institution and discovered You go to the other airline, you go to another until tomorrow-whatever; there is always a way all of those mission critical systems will fail all, but on the same day. And of course that makes storms in the United States and ice on power of individual systems. Canada and the eastern we all saw in the news.

I am sure that, of all telecommunications equipped, if not the most wen-equipped, to achieve Telstra will make enormous strides to this experience failure in isolatcd places. But a of the connections will be in countries outside may not have the same degree of success. The same is true of the banking system. throughout the world have made enormous progress example of the problem, and to look at the moment, the reality is the big banking systems doubt be almost fully Y2K compliant; but the small town banks, in the United States-of will be fully Y2K compliant. All of those connect deal with each other. And a single failure effects in the system. If they fail, others are affected, the demand for cash is affected So while we look at the large organisations reality is that it is often going to be the smaller problem.
