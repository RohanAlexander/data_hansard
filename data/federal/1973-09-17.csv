0,NA,Unknown,"Those of that opimon say aye, and to the contrary, no. I think the ayes have it. Question resolved in the affirmative; report adopted. Suspension of Standing Orders",98
1,Mr NIXON,Unknown, I move: That so much of the Standing Orders by suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Gippsland from speaking forthwith on the motion that the report be adopted.,98
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order l I had put the question that the report be adopted, and it was carried. There was no request for a division. I said: 'I think the ayes have it'. The honourable member is now moving the suspension of Standing Orders.",98
3,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"I am sorry to delay the House in this way, but tonight we have been treated with complete contempt by the Government. Earlier in the debate the Postmaster General (Mr Lionel Bowen) read from a document which I suspect to be a Cabinet document. I would like to know from him whether it is a Cabinet document.",98
4,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,It is not a Cabinet document. You know that. I told you that.,98
5,Mr NIXON,Unknown,Mr Speaker,98
6,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,I rise on a point of order. I ask that that allegation be withdrawn. The honourable member for Gippsland has just made an accusation that I knew that I was reading from a Cabinet document. I had told him that it was not a Cabinet document. It was a copy of a submission made.,98
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think the correct procedure for the Minister to adopt would be to seek leave to make a personal explanation when the honourable member for Gippsland hasfinishedhis speech.,98
8,Mr NIXON,Unknown,We now have the extraordinary admission by the Minister that it is a copy of a submission. As he has quoted from this copy of a submission I ask that the document be tabled forthwith.,98
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable gentleman is now debating the question. He must put the case for the suspension of Standing Orders. I ask the honourable gentleman to keep to the specific question of whether Standing Orders should be suspended.,98
10,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"Standing Orders should be suspended because of that reason. We have this extraordinary admission by the Minister that he has read from a copy of a submission. He has taken part of it off. So I ask, because it has been quoted from, that as a courtesy of the Parliament, it be tabled. I think that Standing Orders state that it should be tabled. Therefore I ask the Minister to table the document.",98
11,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,You are talking about the suspension of Standing Orders.,98
12,Mr NIXON,Unknown,I am talking about the suspension of Standing Orders.,98
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable gentleman has moved the suspension of Standing Orders. Therefore I suggest that he direct himself to that motion. The matter he is now mentioning is not debatable. He is asking the House to suspend Standing Orders. He must give reasons why Standing Orders should be suspended.,98
14,Mr NIXON,Unknown,That is one reason. The Minister was quoting from a document which he claims is a copy of a submission. It is quite obvious that the matter ought to be debated by the Parliament as a whole. There should be an opportunity for all members to speak.,98
15,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,You were in Oabinet at the time.,98
16,Mr NIXON,Unknown,Now the Minister says that I was in Cabinet at the time. So it must be a Cabinet submission. But we cannot debate the question.,98
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The request for the tabling of the document should be made immediately the document is read and not left to a later stage, but that has nothing to do with the question. You should be giving reasons why the motion to suspend Standing Orders should be carried.",98
18,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"I believe that the motion to suspend Standing Orders should be carried because the Minister has been quoting from Oabinet submissions. The Parliament should debate that. According to May's 'Parliamentary Practice', only somebody who was persona non grata would stoop to such a trick.",98
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It has always been the practice of the House that if a member seeks the tabling of a document it must be done immediately after the document has been read by a Minister. I was not in the chair at the time of this incident but I am informed that this was not done. The honourable member for Gippsland must confine himself to the reasons why Standing Orders should be suspended. That has nothing to do with the tabling of the document. Mr MACKellar- I rise to a point of order. I draw attention to standing order 321 which states: A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister . . . , unless stated to be of a confidential nature or such as should more properly be obtained by address, shall, if required by any Member, be laid on the Table.",98
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Nobody is actually quarrelling with standing order 321. I am concerned with the appropriate time at which to seek the tabling of a document. For example, a point of order must be taken immediately after a remark is made and not later. Ever since I have been a member of this House and ever since the longest serving member has been a member, it has always been the practice that it must be done immediately after the incident takes place. Mr MCLeay-That is not correct.",99
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I tell the honourable member for Warringah that I prefer the advice of my Clerk as to what is right and what is wrong in this matter to the advice of the honourable member. If the honourable member has any objection to make, he can always take the appropriate action of moving against my ruling. Mr MACKeUar- I did not say a word. Mr MCLeay- I said that.",99
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,On e honourable member in that area said it. I tell the honourable member for Boothby that had his father been in the chair he would have known the procedure.,99
23,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, you have ruled that the Postmaster-General does not have to tab'e the document. I will let the matter pass. If the Minister was a scholar and a gentleman",99
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! If the honourable member continues to ignore my request to direct his remarks to why Standing Orders should be suspended I will have to ask him to resume his seat.,99
25,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"Wit h due respect, I have had great difficulty making my point because of all the interruptions coming from ratbags in certain areas, not looking at anybody in particular-much . During the course of tonight's debate certain allegations were made about costs of newspapers and one newspaper was waved as an example of this. The Minister said it would increase in cost by 1.75c; it was a paper from the area represented by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles). The point that is to be brought out in this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is that in 1976 the cost of that newspaper will be 1 lc, as I understand it.",99
26,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,You did not raise that in the debate.,99
27,Mr NIXON,Unknown,I did not get an opportunity to raise it.,99
28,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,That was in reply to the Postmaster-General.,99
29,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,You spoke for 20 minutes.,99
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I call the Leader of the Country Party and the Minister to order. The member for Gippsland is again debating postal rates. The question before the chair is whether Standing Orders should be suspended and I am asking the honourable member to make his contribution to it.,99
31,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"Standing Orders should be suspended because the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Whan), the Minister for Immigration (Mr Grassby), the member for Wide Bay (Mr Hansen), and Government members for a couple of other rural electorates have not been given an opportunity to speak in this debate. This is the case also with the members for Maranoa (Mr Corbett), New England (Mr Sinclair), Moore (Mr Maisey) the Northern Territory (Mr Calder), Gwydir (Mr Hunt), Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh), Canning (Mr Hallett), Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), MCMillan (Mr Hewson), Wimmera (Mr King) and  had an opportunity to speak on this matter. There is a great deal more information that these members",99
32,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. The member for Gippsland is openly flouting your ruling, Mr Speaker. Your Speakership is at issue. You should sit him down. You have warned him 5 times.",99
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Gippsland will confine his remarks to his reasons in support of the motion that standing orders be suspended.,99
34,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"I think it is true to say that the honourable members. I named have not been able to contribute to this debate because the debate was gagged. Therefore I seek to reopen the debate so that the honourable members. I named will be given a proper opportunity to debate the subject. I know full well that the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies), and a few other honourable members from rural areas, would like to tell the Postmaster-General what they think of him but they are not game. At this stage they should be given an opportunity in this Parliament to speak on the matter. The honourable member for Boothby also is very concerned about this matter and should be given proper opportunity to debate it. To think that we have gone through a debate of this nature without Labor members having the courage to get on their feet and do something about it",99
35,Mr SCHOLES,Unknown,"I take a point of order. The honourable member for Gippsland is reflecting on decisions of this House, and that is contrary to the Standing Orders. He is stating that the decisions of the House, taken in a number of divisions on motions that the question be put, were improper decisions. I suggest that the honourable member fbr Gippsland is out of order.",100
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I call the honourable member for Gippsland.,100
37,Mr NIXON,Unknown,The time allowed for my remarks relating to my motion for the suspension of Standing Orders,100
38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,100
39,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown," I second the motion. The motion before the Cbair seeks to suspend so much of the Standing Orders as would enable the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) to speak on the motion for the third reading of this Bill. The reason he wants to speak is that he was gagged in the Committee stage. He had no chance to reply to the comments of the Postmaster-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), who refused to answer the charges and allegations made during the course of the second reading debate which was very limited. Many honourable members feel extremely strongly about this issue and they were deprived of the opportunity to speak. What did the Postmaster-General do? He got up and took advantage of the Committee stage to answer some of those charges. In the course of doing so he committed a major breach of parliamentary and Cabinet principle by quoting from a submission of a previous government.",100
40,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,Whic h you knew of and which you were upset about.,100
41,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,This is the first time. I have known a government to do this. I am not concerned about the content of the document. The content does not worry me. For a person soflagrantlyto pick up a Cabinet document and then try to duck presenting it by saying that it was not a Cabinet document when in reality it was a copy of a Cabinet submission is the height of arrogance and an abuse of parliamentary privilege.,100
42,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I ask the right honourable gentleman to confine his remarks to his reasons in support of the motion that the Standing Orders be suspended.,100
43,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Than k you, Mr Speaker; I will heed your ruling. It was necessary to make that point. That is what engendered very strong feeling in my colleague, the honourable member for Gippsland, who no doubt wanted to speak on that matter. He also wanted to speak about the excuse that the Postmaster-General used when he was referring to a newspaper, the cost of which, he said, was going to increase by only 1.75c. Well, that was 100 per cent. This really was deceiving the Parliament and the public about what the true increase would be. It is true that that would be the increase next year and this in itself is a special concession to a trade union but by 1976",100
44,Mr KEATING,Unknown,I take a point of order. The honourable member is debating the issue that was covered in the second reading debate on this Bill. He should confine his remarks to his reasons for suspending the Standing Orders.,100
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The point is well taken. The Leader of the Country Party must confine his remarks to the motion to suspend Standing Orders.,100
46,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Sir , I think this is very relevant to the reason for moving for the suspension of Standing Orders. It is because of this sort of allegation made by the Postmaster-General that the honourable member for Gippsland and other honourable members want to speak on the motion for the third reading. I know it is not normal protocol in this Parliament to speak at the third reading stage, but when an issue comes before this Parliament Dr Gun- I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Gippsland has moved that Standing Orders be suspended to enable him to speak on the motion for the ing. I submit that it is not necessary to suspend Standing Orders. As the motion for the third reading has yet to be moved he will be entitled to speak anyway without having to suspend Standing Orders.",100
47,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of That order. A motion to suspend Standing Orders may be moved at any time. I call the Leader of the Country Party.,101
48,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I said that the feelings of honourable members on this side of the House were very strong on this issue as whole because we see in this issue a sinister move to gag free expression by newspapers and periodicals in this country, which of course part of the philosophy of the socialists would try to limit the number of organisations which can expose and question the practices in which they are participating. So believe that my colleague, the honourable member for Gippsland, has every right, as subject. has every honourable member in this House, to speak at the third reading stage. This all important issue. When the rate of postage on a trade union newspaper can increase by 528 per cent one would think that members of the Labor Party would be a little contalk cerned, but they are like mutes saying nothing and allowing their own organisations to persecuted along with country people. Mr LIONEL BOWEN '(Kingsford-SmithPostmaster-General) (11.22)-We do not port the motion for the suspension of Standpoints ing Orders. Let me put it on the record that agreed with the Country Party that it should have a number of speakers on this Bill and that consideration of the Bill would conclude ing Orders. at 10 o'clock. It was agreed that I might have a chance to reply. Mr Nixon- I rise on a point of order. I do not want to get into an area of disputation with the Minister. In point of fact, what happened was that I approached the Minisresented. ter",101
49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point order involved. Mr Nixon-Then I wish to make a perorder sonal explanation.,101
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member will wait until the Postmaster-General has finished making his remarks before third readmaking a personal explanation.,101
51,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) even marked his name on the list saying: 'As long as I can speak that will satisfy me, otherwise I will tear the place down brick by brick'. was his attitude. I do not mind that, but we have to uphold the dignity of this Parliament. Those people listening to this debate will see that the Country Party is trying to make out that its members were not allowed to speak. About 8 or 9 speakers took part in the debate, and the Government asked that a the Minister be allowed to reply and the Opposition refused. Apparently it wanted to take up all the time. I give credit to the Libis eral Party. I think only one of its supporters who took part in the debate.",101
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I presume the I Postmaster-General is opposing the suspension of Standing Orders. I ask him to keep to that,101
53,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"I am opposing the is an suspension of Standing Orders on the basis that the honourable member for Gippsland had ample time to talk. In fact, he demanded that he be allowed to talk. He was allowed to and thus virtually prevented everybody else from doing so. This was the arrangement be made. It is making a complete farce of the Parliament to suggest that this debate should continue. The honourable member was given full opportunity to speak during the second supreading debate, and that is when all those were made. This motion is trying to I make a joke of the Parliament and trying to prevent this Bill being passed. Accordingly we reject the motion for the suspension of Stand",101
54,Mr NIXON,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",101
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,101
56,Mr NIXON,Unknown,"I claim to have been misrepThe Minister knows full well that I did say to him: 'Look, I would like to speak on this Bill. If you do not let me I will tear of the place apart brick by brick'.",101
57,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! That would be in provided you did it on the Senate side of the building and not on this side. time that he too wanted to speak on the Bill. I said: T cannot answer for what goes on over there but I certainly want to speak. Be clear about that*. The Acting Leader of the House came to me and wanted to know whether there were any arrangements made. I said no, there were no arrangements made. That is the situation as it was.",101
58,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"On the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, as one who has not had a chance to speak Motion (by Mr MdhoMs) put: That the question be now put. The House divided.

Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.32 p.in. NichoUs, M. H. The following answers to questions Pensioner Medical Service: Payments to (Question No. 735) Dr EQugnian asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) What was the average annual payment to each doctor participating in the Pensioner Medical Service during (a) 1971-72 and (b) 1972-73. (2) How many doctors bave (a) joined and (b) resigned from the Service in each of the last 3 years.",102
60,Mr HAYDEN,AYES,"The answer to the honourable the member's question is as follows: (l) (a) 1971-72 . . (b) 1972-73 . . (2) (a) 479 (b) 313 The figures in 2(b) represent resignations or terminations from P.M.S. for a variety of reasons such as-lef t general practice to specialise, left State or Australia, retired, deceased, etc. Married Age PesisSomer Couples: Fringe (Question No. 736) Dr Kltogman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) What is the maximum allowable weekly income, including the pension, of a married age pensioner couple before fringe beneiits are withdrawn. (2) What is the maximum allowable weekly income of the same couple before the pension is not payable. (3) What was the proportion of Australian wage earners who earned less than the amount indicated in answer to (a) part (1) and (b) part (2) during 1971-72. (4) How does taxation affect (a) an age pensioner couple without dependants and (b) a wage earner with a dependent wife and 2 dependent children earning the amount indicated in answer to (i) part (1) and (ii) part (2). Mr Haydeira-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A married couple cease to be eligible for fringe benefits when their combined non-pension income, assuming they have nc affecting property, reaches 854.50 a week. With an income of 854.50 a week, a married couple would, at existing rates, each receive a pension of 313.75 a week giving then a combined income of 882 a week. NA upon notice were circulated: (2) Pension ceases to be payable to an age pensioner Doctors couple when their combined income, assuming they have no affecting property, reaches $109.50 a week. (3) The Treasurer has supplied information relating to wage and salary earners who were taxable for the 1971-72 income year, the latest year for which statistics are available. At 30 June 1972 the income limit at which the pension eligibility ceased in the case of a married couple was $81 a week and that at which a couple ceased to qualify for fringe benefits was $49. With income of $49 a week a couple would have each received a pension of $8 a week giving them a combined income of $65 a week. The information from Treasurer indicates that of those taxpayers with net incomes below $15,000 per annum whose income was solely from salaries and wages (or salaries and wages together with net property income of less than $400) and whose assessments were dealt with under $ the computer-assisted assessing process, about 47 per 4,138 cent had annual incomes equivalent to less than $65 a 4,515 week, while 63 per cent had annual incomes equivalent to less than $81 a week. (4) At income levels equal to the amounts mentioner in 1 and 1 above the following table compares 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 the tax which would be payable at existing rates by an age pensioner couple (assuming that all the income 606 497 is received by the husband) with that which would be 406 404 payable by a wage earner with a wife and two dependent children.

When these proposals are implemented the tax liability for an age pensioner couple will differ from that shown. Prices Justification (Quesuon No. 758) Mr Lymcm asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: How many companies are not subject to the Prices Justification Act by reason of (a) section 5 and (b) exemptions granted by the Tribunal under section 18. <2) What was the total turnover of all companies specified In parts (1) (a) and (1) (b) during 1972-73. (3) How many companies are not included in parts (1) (a) and (1) (b), and what was the total turnover of those companies during 1972-73.",103
61,Mr WHITLAM,TAX PAYABLE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Section 5 of the Prices Justification Act sets out the basis on which companies come within the provisions of the Act. The number of companies not subject to the Act is not known. (b) Exemptions granted under section 18 of the Act do not have the effect of exempting companies from the whole Act but only from its notification porvisions. Exemptions may be granted either generally or otherwise. As at 31 August 1973, 480 companies (including subsidiary companies) had been granted such exemptions. Most of these exemptions cover part only of the business of the companies concerned and relate to particular types of sales e.g. competitive tendering, to which the notification provisions cannot readily be applied, or provide a rational basis for dealing with large numbers of items in retail stores. As required by the Act these have been published in Australian Government Gazettes Nos 95, 103, 106, 106D and 106E, 108, 115 and 118 of August 7, 16, 21, 22 (2), 23, 28 and 30. (2) and (3) This information is not available. Reid House, Canberra (Question No. 793) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Services and Property, upon notice: (1) Is the partial demolition of Reid House proceed ing in spite of the union black ban placed on its demolition In 1972. (2) Will any of the present Reid House site be used for car parking services.  member's question is as follows: (1) No. The union body concerned in the ban is aware of the use to which 'F' Block of to be put and does not oppose its removal, which is currently proceeding. The partially demolished block is being removed to Duntroon for use by the Association for Modern Education. (2) The provision of car parking in Canberra Is the responsibility of the National Capital Development Commission which is within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. I am advised that the provision and control of parking spaces in the city is constantly under review. The introduction of paid car parking by the Department of the Capital Territory is awaited before any decisions are made about total provisions in parking. (vl) To Canberra: Road Accidents Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) What are the names of the street intersections in Canberra where most accidents have occurred during the last 18 months. (2) What were the dates on which the intersections were completed, and the number of accidents at each intersection since the time of completion. (3) Have there been any complaints to the Department alleging that danger existed at these intersections because of faulty design and lack of traffic lights during the last 18 months; if so, have these complaints been investigated and reported on. (4) Has he ensured that recommendations for improved warning and traffic lights are being implemented. (5) How many alterations has the Department and the National Capital Development Commission effected since 2 December 1972. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The necessary information is being compiled. When this is received I will make it available to the honourable member. Canberra Bos Service (Question No. 795) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) What is the current operating loss on the Canberra bus service. (2) What action is he taking to make the bus service a viable venture. (3) Have any studies been completed by his Department to modernise and improve the bus service for the people of the Australian Capital Territory, if so, will he make the reports public. (4) What action is he contemplating to improve the public transport system in Canberra to serve the widest possible needs of the people in this city. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 1972-73 operating loss was $869,772. (2) , (3) and (4) To meet the needs of the citizens Reid House is of Canberra it is proposed to: (i) Order a total of 99 new buses with improved seating and internal fittings. (ii) To progressively introduce new timetables lowering the frequency from a basic 30 minute service to 15 minutes. Peak hour services will run at six minute intervals. (iii) To improve bus shelters and provide new ones. (iv) To promote the bus service by a publicity campaign. This will be slanted to 'how to use* information and helping people understand the service. (v) To experiment with free travel to measure desired improvements. develop a system of priority bus lanes through congested areas as the need arises. These initiatives are seen asfirststeps towards better public transport for Canberra. (Question No. 794) Canberra Housing Authority (Question No. 800) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: Is he now in a position to answer my question No. 244 regarding the establishment of a Housing Authority; if not, why not. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable (3) member's question is as follows: No. Several major inquiries are current which have a bearing on any future Housing Authority. I have requested the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory to examine and report on the most appropriate form of self-Government for the Territory, The issue of an Independent Housing Authority seems related to the self-Government inquiry. There is also a wide ranging inquiry into systems of land tenure and disposal which may impact on future arrangements for provision of accommodation. Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council: (Question No. 801) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital pubUc. Territory, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that he has on several occasions failed to seek the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council's advice on Ordinances that have become law. (2) If so, does he intend to downgrade the importance of the Council pending the implementation of a new form of local government for the Australian Capital Territory. (3) Will he give an assurance that he wiU not ignore the elected representatives of .the people of the Australian Capital Territory on the Council and that in future aU proposed new Ordinances and amendments to existing Ordinances will be referred to the Council for advice before implementation. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I have continued the practice of seeking the advice of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council on proposed Ordinances for the Australian Capital Territory which would, if made, be administered by the Minister for the Capital Territory. As a matter of course draft Ordinances are sent to the Advisory Council but there have been several occasions when for reasons of urgency it was necessary to submit proposed Ordinances to the Executive Council without prior consideration by the Advisory Council. As far as practicable the Chainnan has been informed of the action being taken and the reasons for the urgency. The honourable member can be assured that I value the advice of Council administrators. Postmaster-General's Pepartment: Engineering (Question No. 823} Mr Bourchier asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Engineering Division, of his Depanment does not control its own operations. (2) Is its finance controUed by the Finance and Accounting Branch, its staffing by the 'Personnel Branch and its stores by the Supply Branch. Does his Department have in its employ approximately 45 per cent of all PubUc Service employees. (4) Does the Engineering Division have in its employ approximately 44 per cent of the Department's employees. (5) Would it save a lot of double administration costs by permitting the Engineering Division to control its own affairs. (6) If so, could he, with the savings gained by this move, allocate more expenditure to areas of greater need in the Department such as providing more public facilities.",104
62,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TAX PAYABLE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Ordinances (1) The Engineering Division of the Department performs and controls those engineering functions Involved in providing and maintaining services to the The operations of the Division are integrated with those of other Divisions in a planned approach to the activities of the Department Different levels of output of the Department require different levels of resources-of men, money and materials. The planning process involves balancing the demand for resources with the likely supply of resources. The Engineering Division participates in this process through Its Une management. (2) The Department's plans are translated into a set of financial budgets. The Engineering Division participates in the establishment of these budgets, and in the quarterly reviews of the budgets. Within the Engineering Division there isflexibUityto re-allocate expenditures. The Division also bas its own system of financial control through the Engineering Costing System. The Personnel Branch, in conjunction with the PubUc Service Board, provides the recruitment function for aU Divisions of the Department. Staff levels, including those of the Engineering Division are constrained by a ceiling notified by the Board, and by the Department's own integrated plans. Within these constraints, a common Staff Estimating Procedure is appUed by aU Divisions, including the Engineering Division. The Supply Branch arranges the usual procurement, inventory, warehousing and distribution functions for aU the Divisions, although most of its activities relate to engineering materials. The specification of these engineering items is the responsibility of the Engineering Division. The quantities of engineering materials to be purchased are determined by the Engineering Division, except for items comprising a small value of purchases which Engineering has assigned to Supply. (3) The Department does employ approximately 45 per cent of all Australian Public Service employees. Division (4) The Engineering Division of the Department contains approximately 52 per cent of the Department's employees. (5) The organisation, administration and operation of the Department are currently being examined by the Australian Post Office Commission of Inquiry. At present the Department is organised, at Central Office and State levels, on a functional basis. Consequently, much attention is given to the co-ordination and control ot the different Divisions or functions, One objective of the Department has been to eliminate potential duplication of functions. Consequently, it is not agreed that there have been 'double adminisand trative costs'. On the contrary, it can be argued that there are administrative economies in the present method of provision of the finance, personnel and supply functions through common service units, rather than an alternative system in which there was duplication of these functions in Engineering and non-Engineering Divisions. (6) As the Department is organised on a functional basis, the Engineering Division's functions are planned integrated with other areas of the Department. Under this arrangement, it is not necessary for the Division to have more authority than it has at present. In fact it has all the authority it needs to perform its allocated functions. The Department reviews its operations regularly and any economies obtained are passed on to the public in tariffs lower than they might otherwise have been.",105
