This Australians are taking towards healing hearts the last stop on our journey but one along Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples history, the current day and into our future. In recent years our nation has made significant between all Australians. Leaders on both sides achieving what we have thus far. Some 20 Minister Paul Keating delivered the significant International Year of the World's This is a fundamental test of our social goals and the rest of the world that Australia is a first rate the land of the fair go and the better chance. … … … Perhaps when we recognise what we have in common practical things. … … … The message should be that there is nothing to fear extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australians.

Mr Keating said: our national will: our ability to say to ourselves and social democracy, that we are what we should be-truly we will see the things which must be done-the or lose in the recognition of historical truth, or the Australian social democracy to include Indigenous a healing process for our country and, having event. Other leaders have also contributed to the impressions on Australia's culture through their then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said to the their peoples must become fully reconciled to their to embrace their future. Our nation, Australia, has all peoples of our great country, for all citizens of who are Indigenous and those who are not-to build a new future for our nation. of the Opposition, cited Neville Bonner in his Australian who came to this parliament was to the Liberal Party members who selected him: are always in greater need-human understanding and abundant in Australia and the reconciliation Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians have The bill we are discussing today is not the single point that allows us to look behind achieved much, and to look ahead to see the forward, there is a greater understanding that people of Australia can come together to recognise people. I believe the Leader of the Opposition, consensus in our nation. Mr Abbott There is a new spirit in this land. There is a new people of this country, so different from the spirit young. It is a tribute to so many people in this place This bill is a small step in a long journey It recognises the unique and special place of the a growing number of Australians who understand all Australians need to be brought This bill is the result of the extensive Australian public, both Aboriginal and Torres expert panel was charged with determining Additionally, the expert panel was tasked building support necessary for successful affectionately known as the 'father of reconciliation', panel being convened. He said: We're gathered to take a remarkable step forward. heritage in its founding document. Forward to a racism and proponents of recognition. The panel's engagement process was a thorough, considerations. Over the past two years I have handed down a series of recommendations that gamut of propositions posed by all of the people was the view of the panel that, out of the consultation prosperity of this nation, and for its history, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people be captured so that the record of the day stands back upon it and take components of it to the one. Specifically, the report recommended the possibility of state laws disqualifying people their race; the removal of section 51(xxvi), legislation to discriminate for or against people section 51A to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Australian government's ability to pass law Islander peoples; the insertion of new section Commonwealth; and the insertion of new section Strait Islander languages as this country's Australia's national language. These suggested final stop in our journey. Instead, this bill is a to see what we have achieved, and we have distance yet to travel. Yet, from this point there are ways that this parliament and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tony Abbott, has picked up on a growing said in his Closing the Gap speech: spirit which reaches out to embrace the Indigenous that was abroad when the Prime Minister and I were and around our country that this is now the case. that we as Australians are taking towards healing. first peoples of our nation.

The expert panel has indeed identified-that is, the two sections that contemplate must be removed, but one of these sections-section system. The expert panel has suggested a specific provision against so-called racial discrimination government, and perhaps to all actions at all would directly support Indigenous specific legislation. provision in section 51(a) that empowers Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. make laws for groups of people defined by common descent.

The interpretation people should be up to the parliament, not the judges. So how do we get around this problem of needing a head of power to deal with native title are related to indigeneity? My solution-at should be a bill that has a prohibition against for laws dealing with land, which by definition are one or two other specific exclusions that head of power. But otherwise there should race. This would be challenging for many of goes towards Aboriginal people would need different head of power and executed on indigenousness. In some respects, I think These are very difficult and complex measures, going through the parliament today, which then to address them, think about them carefully them. That is what is most important. If we do change, it will not get up. In the last minute or so I have remaining, who passed away yesterday.

And this is the fundamental recommendations, despite my deep respect for is sitting here beside me, and Mark Leibler and of what is for the advancement of Aboriginal wanting to prohibit race based laws but still and possibly other matters that, by definition, least at this stage in my thinking-is that there any laws based on race but that has an exclusion are related to indigeneity. And possibly there need to apply where there definitely needs to be a be an overall prohibition against laws based on our laws. Some of the education funding which to be reconstructed and put forward under a the basis of disadvantage rather than on that would be a positive measure in itself. and it is a good thing that we have this bill gives time for both sides of politics to be able and come forward with bipartisan agreement on not have bipartisan support for a constitutional I would like to pay tribute to a friend of mine of this debate, because he was one of Noel 20 years-a person by the name of Lou Griffiths. policy would know him very well, and he in his hotel room from a heart attack.

It overthrew the historic lie of view, we could no longer deny the ancient connection and Torres Strait Islander people had in this country. So the step that we are embarking upon today by this parliament of Aboriginal and Torres Strait is an important history. The government established Australian community, and it was an important of ensuring that we could get constitutional Islander people. Any student of law knows that it comes to constitutional change in this country, behalf of the expert panel and those advising to constitutional change, we should not do that we are going to get success in So the expert panel's report recommends that this statutory recognition It is an important step. It does not stand government has embarked upon, such as ensuring disadvantage. But it is important nonetheless, decision in Mabo and subsequent High Court respects symbolic. They also kick-started a come to terms with our past and our relationship-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers legislation. It is great to see that it I would like to conclude my contribution used at citizenship ceremonies, which I regularly parliament. I often reflect upon words from lesser sung verse-that say: For those who've come across the seas We've boundless plains to share, The important thing is that, when white people were occupied by the Aboriginal and Torres practised a culture in this country for over years. That is a claim that can be made in no earth where people can say that they live in continuously practised a culture for over 30,000 should embrace and be proud of, and as process of reconciliation, I firmly believe that and a place that we, as a united and reconciled commend the legislation to the House.",153

The statutory recognition Islander people is an important step. There a process of consultation with the consultation process, to work out the best way recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait there has not been a fantastic strike rate when and I think it was an act of great maturity on them to say that, whilst we are firmly committed in a way or at a time unless we can ensure that that constitutional referendum. that we do proceed with constitutional change but is a first step in that process. alone from the other important initiatives that this that we can close the gap on Indigenous just as the 1967 referendum, the High Court decisions were certainly legal, and in some national debate about how white Australia could important relationship-with our and sisters. This is an important piece of has support from all members in this place. to the debate by reflecting on the words that are attend as part of my function as a member of the second verse of our national anthem-the got here, those plains were not empty. They Strait Islander people who have lived and 30,000 years-some say probably more like 70,000 other place on earth. There is no other place on a land that has been occupied by people who have years. That is something that all Australians we learn from each other and embark upon the we will become a better place, a greater place, Australia, can be very, very proud of. I that this bill is coming before parliament in most of my working life trying to redress some of day-today difficulties of Indigenous people. My up on my family's farm, which had been in the family for five generations and was surrounded owned-not occupied, but owned-that country the shape of what we called at the time middens-and scar trees and lots of stone tools. We have come a very long way in my lifetime Australians. In my time in parliament we have various attempts to address the horrific differences length of time people spend in prisons, and addressing the issue of constitutional recognition Torres Strait Islanders. This bill is an interim step. It aims to help this referendum. The Australian people are notoriously how worthy the cause. We have a tendency don't think it's broken, say no.' So it is important information building so we can achieve bipartisan change. I do think it is very important that there is limping on forever. We have to very determinedly nation, with proper engagement and consultation, business to a head with a referendum which succeed. In this pathway towards constitutional recognition 2010 the government appointed an expert panel. and particularly with Indigenous Australians, consensus towards constitutional change and in a referendum. The expert panel recommended a number and I am very pleased to say the coalition supports support them quite broadly; I support them categorically clear in my opening remarks, I have a problem rather than 'ownership'. The expert panel, for 51A in the Constitution: Recognising that the continent and its islands Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, … I would have put 'ownership'. The next point is: Acknowledging the continuing relationship of their traditional lands and waters, Respecting the continuing cultures, languages peoples, and Acknowledging the need to secure the advancement These are very significant and important by the evidence of the peoples who had before my farm family. That evidence was in 'blackfellas' ovens'-we now call them kitchen in delivering justice for Indigenous had the native title acts, and we have seen in health, educational outcomes and the now I am pleased to see that we are at last of Indigenous Australians-Aboriginals and prepare the public to vote yes when it comes to bad at supporting referenda, no matter to say, 'When in doubt, say no,' or, 'When we that we do have a time of awareness and national consensus for the constitutional a sunset clause built into this bill so it cannot be set forth to build that consensus across the and then make sure that we bring this whole is couched in the terms that are most likely to of Indigenous Australians, in December Their specific charter or task was to consult, to see how we could build the national to look in particular at what might be supported of amendments and changes to the constitution, those proposals in their various forms. We as an individual. Although, as I made with the fact that we talk about 'occupation' example, suggested that we insert a new section now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, additions. It goes on to say: … the Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, and good government of the Commonwealth with peoples. You would think: hasn't that already been in power of the Commonwealth to make laws with been with us for the last 50 or so years. With respect to the business about discrimination removal of any reference in the Constitution, Constitution does not allow any racial discrimination detriment of any race, but I, like others, support should be a capacity for us to make laws which for Indigenous peoples, given there is so compared to other Australians. The recognition of languages should be another The expert panel recommended there be a (1) The national language of the (2) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages of our national heritage. I am a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Standing Committee and I support this recommendation. into Indigenous languages in Australia and Australians is to retain or to resurrect, certainly also the culture contact languages in some widely spoken. This business of language learning is so long to acknowledge in our school systems that speaking a different language to English and taught as a second language. If I can direct people back to that inquiry's yet adopted our recommendations. They should. would look at those recommendations which language retention or resurrection. Certainly come to school or preschool with other languages method. That is one of the critical ways we educational deficit that they now often experience. I want to remind us though, as I often parliament, about where we have come from into Indigenous Australians: their citizenship workers, their rights to be educated and to have short time in our Australian history since citizenship for Aboriginal Australians. New South Wales parliamentary papers in 1938 said: have power to make laws for the peace, order respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander the Constitution a very long time? Well, no, the respect to all Indigenous peoples has only against Aboriginal peoples and the obviously we have to make sure our or laws to be made that are to the the notion that in our Constitution there are to the advantage of any race, particularly much to make up in terms of their life chances important reference in the Constitution. new section 127A inserted along the lines of: Commonwealth of Australia is English. are the original Australian languages, a part Strait Islander House of Representatives We have just completed an inquiry we found the overwhelming desire of Indigenous to transmit, their traditional languages-and contexts, the Kriol languages which are now important in Australia. We have neglected for so our Indigenous children often come to school then they are not given support with English recommendations. This government has not as I hope an incoming coalition government acknowledge the importance of Indigenous it is important to teach Aboriginal children who using the English as a second language could assist Aboriginal children to make up the do when I am speaking on Indigenous affairs in Australia in relation to our previous responses rights, their rights in terms of being paid as decent health services provided. It is such a rights were being debated as a possibility It has been said from time to time that Aboriginals far as can be seen at present, the majority that is, the protection act of New South Waleshave all citizenship rights except the following: (a) They cannot exercise franchise at Federal elections. (b) They are prohibited from obtaining liquor. (c) If Aboriginal blood predominates they cannot pension from the Commonwealth Government. … (d) Residents on stations have been debarred of this State. (e) Family endowments payments are in general, instead of in cash. (f) Certain restrictions may be imposed on Aboriginals Despite the restrictions mentioned, including fundamental human rights, it was concluded actually have all citizenship rights. The therefore that the New South Wales parliament citizenship for Aboriginal people because, they concluded: Generally speaking the restrictions in relation to citizenshipare in the interests of the Aborigines, and at the indicate that in general the opinion is that they Aborigines who might with justification be placed The general opinion of those most competent to not yet reached the stage where the restrictions can on the majority. That was the citizenship rights debate in 1938 Western Australia in 1944 went along similar citizenship granted to an Aborigine … any adult person who is a native within the meaning may make application for a Certificate of Citizenship Government Resident in the magisterial This was subject to the condition on … for the two years prior to the date of the application except with respect to lineal descendants (a) that he has served in the Naval, Military (b) that he is otherwise a fit and proper However, there were some other conditions unfortunately, bar the granting of this citizenship.

Briefly as of Aborigines, as defined by the Act,receive maternity allowance or old-age or invalid from receiving relief work provided by the Government made to Aboriginals by means of orders for goods in accordance with the provision of the Act. some which I would have called some that Aboriginals in New South Wales did recommendation of the Public Service Board was should not rush into this business of imposed by the present law of this Statepresent time the Public Service Board's inquiries should not be lifted, even though there are numerous on an equal footing with the general community. speak appears to be however that their education has be lifted as a general policy, without harmful effects in New South Wales.

Requiring someone to have 'dissolved seeking citizenship of Australia, a country that was the way it was. We have come a long way. We have not yet by a referendum in this country, but I am saying amongst the league of other nations in the world this case it is our fellow Australians.

15,Mr MELHAM,BILLS," Before I address about Lou Griffiths. It is only with the announcement out that Mr Griffiths passed away yesterday whom I have had an association for many years. affairs, from 1996 to 2000, I had lot to do  Lou before that and I have had contact with advocate of Indigenous rights and causes. He the history of what was happening in relation people as to the justness of that cause. I offer a great loss to the community. It is interesting in light of this debate recognition and for basic rights takes its toll both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. I think and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition bipartisan support of the parliament. I think it not one who says, 'This should have been an that, in my opinion, it would be lost overwhelmingly. affairs was dealt with from 1996 to 2007. The community as a result of native title amongst the Opposition for his approach and those played an important part in this. This is not debate. It is hard enough as it is. In 1999 the parliament passed two bills another was the preamble. The preamble was Labor Party and I voted for it in the parliament, preamble. It was one that was imposed by the proper consultation with the opposition or, I remember speaking out on a number of occasions 'If you want to protest, vote against the preamble history. They are cruel when you read them now. states could have had democratically elected laws and such pronouncements about fellow human all tribal and native associations' if they are that they had owned, is quite extraordinary. But achieved constitutional recognition, accepted that it is more than time. We need to stand up who do right by their indigenous peoples; in support this bill. I know that it is going to I hope that, within the next two years, we will support to this referendum with the same which brought Aboriginal Australians citizenship rights in this country. the bill, I want to make a few remarks by the member for Aston that I found from a heart attack. Mr Griffiths is someone with When I was shadow minister for Aboriginal with Noel Pearson and Mr Griffiths was a very documenting Mr Griffiths' life on film. I knew him. He is a great loss. He has been a passionate took the view that it was important to document to Indigenous issues at the time, to enlighten my condolences to his family and friends. He is as well. The struggle that continues to be had for on a lot of people in the Indigenous community, that it is a very good thing that the Aboriginal Bill 2012 before the House has the appropriate is worthwhile getting a bit of history here. I am early referendum.' The reason that I say that is Part of that was the way that Indigenous reality is that it was in the frame in the broader other things. I commend the current Leader of honourable members opposite. I think he has an area that should be the centre of partisan to put to the people: one was a republic bill, supported by both sides of parliament. The but it was not an appropriately bipartisan government at the time. It was not done with more importantly, with the Indigenous community. during the referendum, saying to people, and not the republic.' What is interesting is that whilst there was the to-and-fro on the republic, popular vote; the preamble only got 39 per sides were supposedly barracking for it. I cheered not a preamble that was worthy of the public's being. This is a different situation. The act of interim measure to hold us to a time when we not just changes, but substantive changes, to substantive change, particularly in relation to Hindmarsh Island bridge case, six justices Justice Cowen was disqualified in that case, Senate Legal Committee. I, with my starry, blinkered pick up the sentiment of the 1996 referendum words 'other than the Aboriginal race' in any Court said that with that constitutional change was to be interpreted as the legislation was first for Aboriginal people but detrimental laws people. Two judges of the High Court did said: no, you could only use the clause for Justice Gaudron said: look, in this day and So what we had was a referendum with 91 per used by governments to discriminate against Commission of 1988, before the Kartinyeri There is as a result of the expert panel a new 51(xxvi). The last clause in that section 51A reads: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, good government of the Commonwealth with respect I am indebted to the Law Council of Australia think that has a lot of the arguments in it. It High Court, Chief Justice French, in 2003 provided Court jurisprudence in relation to section Commonwealth. He was of the view that a interpretation I mentioned earlier: that you can as a result of that constitutional change. He change. That is not going to be easy to achieve. I a constitutional lawyer, but I have to say, even in the proposed new clause, given the way detrimental laws could be made against Aboriginal class, under this clause, as people of any race-in that is open to any race within Australia at think we need to tweak it. I do not believe governments specifically in relation to the detriment. When will tell you this: it was not the Constitution the republic actually got 46 per cent of the cent of the popular vote, and that was when both when it lost, because I thought that it was support on the basis of how it was brought into recognition that we are passing is an appropriate can bring the public to a position of support for the constitution. And the Constitution does need section 51(xxvi). In the Kartinyeri case, or the of the High Court gave judgements. His Honour because he had given a legal opinion to the eye, had felt that the High Court would and what it was about in terms of removing the state. The reality is that two judges of the High the provision in relation to Aboriginal people enacted in 1901.

Now, the Constitutional case, recommended a change in that provision. section 51A that is being considered to replace have power to make laws for the peace, order and to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. for its excellent discussion paper, because I points out that the current Chief Justice of the a detailed overview of the post-1967 High 51(xxvi), culminating in Kartinyeri v The current High Court would probably take the legislate to the detriment of Aboriginal people too was, I think, agitating for constitutional used to be a criminal defence lawyer, so I am not I am worried-and I think the point is made-that it is constructed, there is a possibility that people. Aboriginal people are in the same other words, migrants as well. It is a clause the moment. And I think we need to get it right. I of the day should be able to legislate it comes to advances for Aboriginal people, I that gave them advancement in the court cases of the last few decades; it was actually the enactment that protected Aboriginal people against That Commonwealth act is the reason native cases, and to, in effect, overcome the discriminatory act of parliament can be quite powerful in protecting this country. That needs to be understood. important act. It is a little bit more than Commonwealth act, that will prevail over state provisions we are particularly wanting to pass act of parliament is that it can be overwritten about when the Wik judgement was delivered shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the is that those native title amendment acts So, it is all right to pass this bill that beyond any doubt that we should not be interfering was one of the objections I had to the intervention discriminatory, because I do not support discrimination, because true equality requires people up to an equal level-the disadvantaged in terms of international law. Positive discrimination equality matters. The bill before the House at why everybody people supports it, at clause 3(1) says: The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, known as Australia were first occupied by This is indisputable. It further states in clause 3(2): The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples This also is indisputable. It does not matter association with their traditional lands, Aboriginal they think that counts. But it is important association, so that is an important The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal Again, this is a non-contentious clause. It Non-Indigenous Australians need to start substantially That is what true reconciliation is about. It cannot have a situation where, every time there have to give way. The world did not fall delivered by the High Court, when the Native enacted. There was a lot of ignorance and prejudice our time to repair some of that damage of community. What is appealing for me now is that conservative having Indigenous land use agreements by of the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 discriminatory action by the states. title survived to allow the successful Mabo laws of the Joh Bjelke-Petersen era. An the Aboriginal race and other people in That is why the act that we are passing is an symbolism. It is an act of the parliament, a and territory laws, although at the moment the are symbolic provisions. The problem with an by a later act, which is what the debate was all along with the native title amendment acts. As time, I was in the middle of that fight. The truth overrode the Racial Discrimination Act. we are talking about today, but we should also state with the Racial Discrimination Act. That in the Northern Territory, which was discriminatory laws. I support positive differential treatment. That is how you bring and the dispossessed. It is not discrimination is not discrimination. It is engaging in the moment in relation to recognition, which is recognises that the continent and the islands now Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. acknowledges the continuing relationship of with their traditional lands and waters. what non-Indigenous people think about their people have that association and it is what that non-Indigenous people acknowledge that clause. Clause 3(3) states: acknowledges and respects the continuing and Torres Strait Islander peoples. seems to me that the respect has to be two ways. respecting Indigenous Australians. is not a one-way street, it is a two-way street. We is a clash, Aboriginal people and their rights in for Australia when the Mabo decision was Title Act was first enacted, when Wik was out there, and that is why we have to take false perceptions that was inflicted on the governments around the country are consent with Indigenous Australians when it comes to pastoral leases. The pastoralists through misinformation. Indeed, the miners Tinto, have to deal with Indigenous people in with them in Australia. So, it is an excellent thing that this act should. If we have got our differences of opinion, way, because this is non-threatening. This actually our first Australians. They are not a threat to them. The Parliament of Australia, through in the High Court had found under the common law. I think we have moved on. As I said earlier, the Opposition because I think people like Noel talk to, have influenced him, and that is a good House we are always going to be in a love-in agreement-that is not the case-but this is differences. I know that there has been some is not about the government blindsiding the and we should be at one on this, but we should of us if we do not. As I said, there are some at the moment-it is discriminatory. Any decent, parliament should be uniting to try and in future everyone. That is why it will take time. You will not pass, and that would be a tragedy. I commend the bill to the House and congratulate work to date.",162
16,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," We speak Yesterday we heard the Prime Minister and about the gaps in life expectancy, educational Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. It also important to have a sense of optimism the member for Throsby noted earlier in this have in this country a people whose association years. Maintaining that sense of excitement continuing link to their land is a great thing. Australia's Indigenous heritage. That Indigenous of languages. As the member for Blair noted, knowledge over recent years, and that is important maintains your links with generations gone by. There is a terrific book called Stories Indigenous elders and significant members One of those stories is about Carl Brown, who words in traditional language. Instead of asking, 'boothm'. He said that if a person is silly they they call a dog 'mirigung'. He said his parents are no longer seeing themselves under threat who have an international perspective, like Rio other countries and they understand how to deal before the parliament has cross-party support. It we should not be slugging it out in a public enriches us as a nation. We need to respect us, they are an asset. It is hard enough as it is for its Native Title Act was only recognising what I applaud the attitude of the current Leader of Pearson and others, who we have sat with and thing. I am not saying that on both sides of the and hugging one another in unanimous one area in which I think we should work out our tweaking of this so that all sides could agree. It opposition. They are the alternative government stick to these basic principles. It diminishes all pitfalls. The Constitution is unacceptable as it is two-bob lawyer will tell you it is. So we as a make it non-discriminatory and acceptable to cannot have a referendum tomorrow because it everyone, including Ken Wyatt, on their a lot in this House about Indigenous gaps. the Leader of the Opposition speak eloquently attainment and employment between is important to focus on those gaps, but it is and pride in Australia's Indigenous heritage. As debate, it is great and exciting to know that we with the land goes back tens of thousands of and living alongside people with the longest This bill in some sense recognises our pride in heritage involves maintaining a multiplicity there has been a decline in Indigenous language to redress because language is culture-it of the Ngunnawal which talks about some of the of the Indigenous community here in the ACT. was born in 1952.

We need to maintain this important symbolic recognition in the Constitution. Next Wednesday will mark the fifth anniversary Australians-the moment when a Labor government were sorry for the wrongs of past governments; ripped from families, to the communities suffered and whose pain remained unacknowledged years. The apology was driven by an understanding works of the past and words alone would not gap. It was a symbol. Stolen generations elder of the hope we place in the new relationship This bill will be another important step towards that Indigenous peoples hold the unique establishing an act of recognition that will recognition. Once this bill become law it will and assist in building a national consensus. When we come to a referendum, there are for a referendum on constitutional recognition track record of referenda is not good-eight The Gillard government agrees with the expert referendum at a time when its chance of history that with those defeated referenda best part of a generation afterwards. At the was talk that if it were defeated it might be we have not had anything since. There was talk if that model were defeated another could easily later. That was 1999 and a lot of water has Australia has reported that, while the idea Indigenous communities, fewer than one-third discussions. So it does suggest that we need recognition before we reach to the tree and try to pick it. This bill is a reflection of the Labor approach Labor tradition I want to recognise, as previous Hasluck have, that there have been important steps have been bipartisan. But as a Labor steps that have been taken with compassion, own party. Gough Whitlam championed Indigenous of: … one group of Australians who have been denied liberty and indeed to life itself for 180 years-since first proclaimed those rights had to. He notes that Indigenous language generation. You can sense in his story a little those languages, just as we need to attain of Australia's apology to Indigenous stood up and said, long overdue, that we we were sorry to the children who were that were broken, and to the generations that by many governments for too many that words alone could not undo the absolve us from future actions in closing the Auntie Lorraine Peeters said it was a 'symbol you wish to forge with our people'. strengthening this relationship, recognising place of being Australia's first peoples, and be a step on the longer path to constitutional promote community engagement with the issue few more tragic things one could imagine than of Indigenous Australians to be defeated. The out of 44-so we need community consensus. panel's recommendation that we need to hold a success would be highest. We know, too, from sometimes the questions do not come back for the time of the referendum on four-year terms there returned in some other form. That was 1988 and at the time of the republican referendum that be put to the Australian people a few years passed under the bridge since. Reconciliation of a referendum has strong awareness within of non-Indigenous Australians are aware of the to continue ripening the fruit of constitutional to Indigenous policy. In talking about the speakers such as the members for Aston and steps taken by the coalition. Many of the great member I do take particular pride in some of the with justice and with respect by leaders of my issues in his 1972 campaign. He spoke their basic rights to the pursuit of happiness, to the very time when Europeans in the New World as inalienable for all mankind. That was the approach that Prime Minister Aboriginal Affairs to the ministerial level, when pushing for the Racial Discrimination he supported the findings of the royal commission approach that became law with the passing approach also taken by another Labor Prime said in Redfern Park: … we cannot confidently say that we have succeeded not managed to extend opportunity and care, dignity the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. That again articulated the Labor approach of with that approach that we have to continue communities.

One way of thinking of much of what is happening heart it is about ensuring that children are housing right, you need to have health right, to have communities with a commitment to learning. After school, we are also recognising that opportunities.
