Whatever may be the quality the spirit that is distilled from potatoes, happily we have a better purpose to which to turn them, and notably in the instance of Tasmania. Her interests will be best served by their being used as an article food, for which they are eminently suitable, - rather than as a material for distillation. Our potatoes would have to be priced at per ton to enable tliem to be used for tillation with any chance of profit to distiller. The price now realized by potatoes ' in Tasmania is £ 4 per ton. How manychamber, potatoes are going into distillation at that price 1 If the price were low, I take it it would be more profitable for the potatoes be used for feeding pigs than for distilling liquor.",16
12,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," W have heard a good deal on the question of adulteration, and, therefore, I rise to give the effect of an analysis of the figures relatis ing to imports and production. Last year Viotoria imported 738,746 gallons; and manufactured 193,000 gallons. Queensland imported 458,000 gallons, and produced 66,000 gallons; while South Australia ported 124,000 gallons, and produced 75,000 gallons. In other words, these States imported 1,321,247 gallons, and duced 334,545 gallons. The import duty is 14s. per gallon, and the highest excise duty is 13s. per gallon, and by refusing to insert these words we wish to put all spirit at the rate of 13s., except, of course, the grape spirit. A duty of Is. per from the grape only. gallon on the local production amounts on the to £16,727. In other words we have alvery ready given nearly £17,000 to encourage local production, and I trust that the committee will cancel this intermediate rate, the which gives an additional 6d. per gallon. a very The proposal of the Minister is bad enough, because it will involve a sacrifice "" potaof revenue, as well as the temptation absence to adulteration. I have been told that in all these additions will leave very little under the n.e.i. line. I ask the committee to abolish the rate of 12s. 6d per gallon. From the revenue stand-point, the honourable, to me member for Tasmania, Mr Hartnoll, has not appealed to us to do so with a considerable of amount of force, which is supplemented by sold to the the figures I have given. Amendment of the amendment nega",17
13,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," Owing to a convplication which occurred last night, of the committee may not be quite certain where it is. Last night I moved an amendment, with the object of leaving all this spirit at the rate at which it was, and pre- t venting any adulteration from taking place. of The result of this amendment would be that an article would he sold as brandy which is not brandy. I do not wish to see this coun10s. try made a big distillery. I ask the two or disthree honourable members who are advocates the of temperance outside the chamber whether they intend to act quite differently in the and whether, even from their point of view, they think it is advisable to cut down that the duty, or to adopt the Ministerial proposal to to allow the article to go out to the public as one thing when, in fact, it is another thing. I feel sure that the honourable members for e Echuca and Melbourne Ports ought to agree - with that view, even if they do not act upon it, and I shall carefully watch their votes. It perfectly clear that the effect of rejecting the proposal of the Government will be not to allow anything to go out to the public unless it is absolutely what it purports to be. We seem to have got ourselves into a imtangle, and I should like to know exactly how we stand. The more the difference is three increased between wine spirit and grain prospirit, the more is encouragement given to pure Australian brandy. It is perfectlyclear that if the one line is to come in at the rate of l is . per gallon, and the other is left dutiable at 13s. per gallon, it will be a great encouragement to sell brandymade I trust that the Ministers will not persevere with their another amendment, but will adhere to the rate of mise 13s. per gallon for the spirits included in the n.e.i. line. Last night, I made a slight mistake. I said that spirits made from rye, wheat, and oats, I and mixed with spirit made from grapes, duties were being allowed to go out at the spectivelyrate of 12s. Gd. per gallon. I drew the that. Minister's attention to it . He denied it at the time, and I find that I was not absolutely correct. What is being done s that the 12s. Gd. is being charged, they deposit a further Gd., which unless the spirits. amendment proposed by the Minister is carried will be retained by the Customs. If the amendment is carried that Gd. will be returned. That is a correct statement the state of affairs.",17
14,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I said yesterday that I was surprised to hear it suggested that the agreed toreduced rate was being collected and that I did not believe it. But I find that it is so. I directed certain instructions to the draftsman in reference to the Tariff. The instrucFebruary, tion I gave was that in the case of a mixture ""12s. Od.'; of spirits upon - which the excise was l i and 12s. Gd., the excise collected should higher than 12s. Gd. That was simply intended as an instruction as to a line in the Tariff he approved by Parliament. I never had the tion. slightest idea until I heard of it last night that anything else had happened. But my instruction was construed as a sanction for the alteration of what I had previously decided to be the proper interpretation the Tariff, and the reduction was made. do not blame my officers, who have a great deal to do, and I venture to think that very much blame attaches to myself. instructions the moment I heard of it for stoppage of the collection of the lower Of course it would be impossible, having clared that a certain interpretation of Tar iff necessitates the collection of the rate, to alter the practice by collecting lesser rate until Parliamentary sanction is obtained. My attention has been called to fact that the Tariff, as it emerged from first committee was, as regards this particular matter, a compromise. Our policy 12s. has been to stick to the compromises we mixing have made. I refer honourable members to what took place upon this item. The necessary Treasurer spoke as follows :As the committee is so evenly divided with reference to these duties, and the Chairman may possibly be placed in the position casting vote, I suggest as a fair comprothat we should fix the duty on spirits made of barley malt, molasses, and maize at 12s.

However that may be, the honourable highermember for Bland proposes that spirits made the from raw barley, wheat, rye, and oats be added to the 12s. Gd. list. In regard to that the I have in my hand a report from the Chief the Inspector of Distilleries, in which he saysI see no objection to these being added to the (id. rate. All these produce good spirit. By a small quantitv of raw grain with malt, a higher yield of spirit is obtained. A small quantity of oats mixed with malt is considered for the .aeration of the mash. These grains at some seasons may be cheaper than Barley malt. Bye is used with barley malt in the making of gin, and is said to improve the spirit. Grain-is allowed in Great Britain, and is of giving largely used. See statistics.",18
20,Mr FOWLER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Does he recommend blendhonorable ing those spirits with grape spirit 1,19
21,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I am not speaking about the blending. Honourable members will recollect that our sole desire was when two spirits of different kinds which the excise was, l is . and 12s. spectively were blended, we should not apply anything more than the 12s. 6d. rate to the blend.",19
22,Mr FOWLER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,If they are blended half and half proportions 1,19
23,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"No , the honourable member will see that he is wrong there. Some people suggest that we should look the proportion of the different spirits in the 6d. blend, and that if it is found that there is a certain proportion of the l is . spirits should charge only l is . , and that gards the residue of spirits dutiable at 12s. 6d. we should charge 12s. 6d. I do not think that the question of the blending of the spirits was seriously considered. There would be a great deal to be said in favour of charging according to the proportion of the spirits contained in the blend. But strict legal construction of the Tariff such as required the spirits in the lower classes to be wholly distilled material, and if they were distilled from blended material, they were to be taxed, not in the proportion in which the spirits were used, and"" not at the rate for the higher class of the two, but at highest rate of all, 13s. We have concondition sented, inadvertently, to a breach compromise which was made, and of which honourable members opposite did not remind us. What we propose to do in connection with the matter, if the committee is not favour of remedying the question of duty applicable to blending, is to go back to old arrangement, and carry out the comproconsiderable mise arrived at.",19
24,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," It is altogether a mistake for the Minister for Trade Customs to speak of the arrangement come to about the duty of 12s. 6d. as a compromise. I regard it as nothing of the sort. Let detail the circumstances. I have not had to look up the whole of the debate as rerevenue ported in Ha/nsa/rd, but I well remember that, if it had not been for the manner which the pairs were arranged, the 13s. would have been carried. The voting was equal, and the Chairman, in accordance duties with the usual practice, gave his vote with the noes. The point was raised by the member for Kennedy as to the manipulation, as he said, of a pair, which brought about that even voting, but for which those of us who are in favour of the that 13s. rate would have won. The point was, upon that the honourable member for Canobolas 6d. rewas induced to pair under the impression that another honourable member intended to vote in a certain direction. Because of that misunderstanding-ther e was nothing in in tentionally wrong-thos e who were in favour of the 13s. rate were robbed of their victory. While the feeling was high the Treasurer, to get over the difficulty for the at time being, proposed that the rate be 12s.",19
25,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,In the meantime we the honourable member for Wentworth had as resuggested that the rate be 12s. 9d.,19
26,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"We had not been proceeding by differences of threepence but of sixpence. As one of those present on the occasion, and one who was in favour of the thirteen shilling rate, I repudiate the sugthe gestion that a compromise was arrived at. was The whole point is that we were deprived of our victory by a misunderstanding in from certain connection with a pair.",19
27,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,No one moved for a recommittal to alter what was done.,19
28,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I can quite understand that honourable members after six months' the work upon the Tariff have got into such a of mind about that they hardly of the know where they are. Many of them were quite content to allow the thing to go to Sheol, or any place short of it, rather than propose an alteration. The Governi n ment themselves have proposed an alteration, the effect of which is to rob the the revenue of 6d. per gallon, in regard to a proportion of the spirits that will be subjected to excise. Yet the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Cusand toms a few nights ago wailed about the loss of revenue to the smaller States. I cannot honestly reconcile their two attime tudes. If the smaller States are short of time revenue, what better method for raising is there than an excise on spirits. Personally I do not admit that they will be in short to the extent imagined. But there rate cannot be a more legitimate opening for raising revenue than by means of a set of that will effect no hardship whatever, and make no difference so far as the retail price is concerned. Suppose we refuse to insert the words proposed, and leave the duty at 13s., what is the position? Taking the actual cost, not of the matured spirit, but of the original spirit, and adding the freight, a difference of Is. per gallon in favour of the local distiller means protection to the extent of about 120 per cent. So far as I have been able to calculate, with the assistance of those who know something of the trade and the probabilities of its development, the amount of revenue represented by the sixpence is nearly £ 2 0 , 0 0 0; and it is unwise to make such a sacrifice. That is not direct loss, but allowance is made for the difference occurring in the importations by the extra consumption of the locally-made article, consequent on the lower rate of excise. At any rate, £20,000 is an amount of revenue which, in this connection, we are justified in making an effort to retain. I reiterate that there was no compromise. It was a very good natured suggestion, I admit, that the Treasurer put forth, in view of the fact that a number of honourable members felt that they had been jockeyed or robbed-no t to use these words offensively-of a certain victory. To allay the immediate heated feeling, the 12s. 6d. was proposed, but under all the circumstances I do not see that the Government have anything to complain of if this question be now put to a division.",19
29,Mr HARTNOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," As a quiet listener to the debates, I have been ' forcibly struck with the inequalities of protection. I remember that protection to the extent of 5 pei cent, was given to the gal1 vanized-iron industry of New South Wales, though many honourable members did not specially regard the impost from the protective point of view, but rather as a means of increasing the revenue to that small extent. The more favoured industries of 'Victoria are content with duties of 15 per cent., 20 per cent., or 25 per cent. We are now discussing an article which every one regards as a fair and legitimate source of revenue. Distilling is, to a considerable extent, a mechanical process, which does not employ much labour; and it was principally on the ground that the Victorian industries employ labour largely that protection was asked for and granted on their behalf. The proposal before us will absolutely give 75 per cent, of protection to the distillers. Any quantity of spirit can be distilled from any of these grains and products at 2s. per gallon, and on such an article it is even now 33 Q proposed to give the distillers a protective advantage of 1 s. per gallon. Under the previous decision the protection given is 75 per cent., and in view of the needs of the smaller States, and of the fact that in Queensland and Tasmania every source of revenue should be preserved to the fullest possible extent, Ministers are pursuing a course that is not desirable in the general interests of the Commonwealth. As much revenue as possible should be raised, consistently with justice to those engaged in any special industry, and spirits can fairly be made the subject of additional taxation.",20
30,Mr THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," As Ministers have .claimed that a compromise was come to on this item, I desire to say a. 7 few words, because I should not like to accept the responsibility of breaking any compromise duly arrived at. The circumstances, of the former vote were as stated by previous speakers. If there were a compromise, and to some extent the decision may be called so, with regard to the particular items under this heading, it is theMinisters themselves who have departed from it by re-introducing the subject at therecommittal stage, and it is that departure - which has caused all this discussion. There is good reason for the objection of manyhonorable members to placing blended brandies on the same footing as brandies produced from grain. It was urged, and possibly correctly urged, that brandy distilled from grape wine is infinitely more wholesome than brandy distilled fro ingrain. That view was maintained by Ministers, and a considerable distinction was made in favour of the grape brandy.. The present proposal is to allow brandy, which is blended in order that it niayji nutate grape brandy, to come into competition with what has been declared to be the more wholesome product. An-i advantage is to be given to blended brandy which was not given to it under the previous decision. As has been well said by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Hartnoll, it is proposed to deplete the revenue j that is to say, those who find it profitable to imitate grape brandy would, in the absence of the present proposal, have to pay 6d. per gallon extra for the privilege. Under our previous decision the lower duty of 12s. 6d. was allowed on pure grain brandy, but if the products were blended, and an advantage sought by imitating grape brandy, the Gd. extra had to be paid.",20
31,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Blendin g is allowed in all ordinary distilling - Minister,21
32,Mr THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"There is no objection to blending. There is nothing to prevent the duty being paid, and the blending then being carried out; hut the position previously taken up was that the sale of pure grape brandy should be encouraged by a lesser excise, and the sale of coarser grain brandy to that extent discouraged.",21
33,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"That is so, hut honourable member wants to go on further.",21
34,Mr THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Unde r the present proposal grape brandy may be imitated by a certain admixture of the grain spirit; and honourable members rnay reasonably say that if to that extent the production of the better article is discouraged, the extra sixpence ought to be paid. No action has been taken by the Opposition to disturb the previous decision; any such action has been on the part of the Government, for the reasons they have stated.",21
35,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,The point as to blending was not really considered - that,21
36,Mr THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"But it is brought before us now for our consideration, and I am inclined to agree with those who think that it is undesirable, if grape brandy is so much the better article, to give encouragement to blending, which is meant to enable the manufacturer to declare that what he is selling is grape brandy, though it is only partially so.",21
37,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," The contention that there was any compromise has been entirely disposed of. The Government now propose to allow the blending of spirits at a different rate to that on which the committee previously decided ; and the effect of our stopping short, as proposed, will be to practically abolish the whole of the 13s. lines. What other articles are spirits made from than those already mentioned ? Having included all other grains, we shall, if we do not agree to the 13s., do away with the "" n.e.i."" duties, and thus make a most serious difference to the revenue. ance members may be called on to assist in preventing the adulteration of spirits, and I shall be surprised if they are found voting for the Government. I trust that the committee will allow the duty to remain at 13s. Mr.KINGSTON - In accordance with our previous intimation, and for reasons stated, we propose to let the amendment go, and on recommittal bring the duty down to the figure at which it originally stood. Sir EDWARD BRADDON s have stated that the duty was fixed as the result of a compromise; but whatever compromise may have been arrived at was abandoned by Ministers themselves when they brought down the proposed alteration. Therefore the responsibility for any breach of compromise rests upon the Government.",21
38,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Honourable members the know very well that the question of blended spirits was not even considered on the former occasion ; and the proposal by the Government that blended spirits should not be charged at a higher rate of duty than if they were distilled wholly from any one of the materials used in their manufacture was not a breach of the compromise arrived at.,21
39,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,We never admitted that there was a compromise.,21
40,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Wit h regard to the statement that honourable members were not aware of any compromise, I . may point out the proposal adopted by the committee was offered in set terms by the Treasurer as a compromise, and was accepted and moved as such by the honourable member for Wentworth. Sir EDWARD BRADDON. - And Ministers have gone, back on that.",21
41,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"We have done nothing of the sort, except that upon finding out that a mistake was made, we have withdrawn sufficiently to give effect to what we believe to be the intention of the committee.",21
42,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I had intended to move an amendment, fixing the duty at 13s., but I find that that will not be necessary, as if matters are allowed to stand, all spirits will be subject to the same duty under spirits n.e.i., excepting grape spirits.

43,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I m o v e That the words ""and so that it limy be prescribed that the average sugar-giving contents of the cane or beet in any particular district shall be taken to be the sugar-giving contents of each lot of cane in such district"" be added. I am happy to say that, judging from the number of applications we have received, there is an intention on the part of the people of Queensland to take advantage of the provisions of the Tariff with regard to the rebate. I have no doubt that their expectations that they will be able to carry on operations by employing white labour and to obtain the rebate they desire, will be realized. The idea is-and I have no doubt . of its feasibility-that as regards certain districts the average sugar-giving contents of the cane grown can be well ascertained. The proposal is that instead of attempting to determine the sugar-giving contents of each lot of cane as it arrives at the millwhich would cost a large sum of money and give a lot of trouble-the average should be taken for the district, and payment made accordingly. We are merely taking power to prescribe the conditions under which the sugar contents of the cane shall he ascertained, and I hope that after a conference with Dr Maxwell, the sugar expert, whose valuable services I shall be only too delighted to avail myself of, we shall be able to arrive at the be3t method of encouraging sugar growing by white labour in Queensland. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I should like to know whether Ministers have considered how the rebate is to be charged. It is stated in the press that the law officer of the Crown has advised Ministers that the rebate should be paid out of the revenue derived by the State in which the sugar is grown-and that is an intelligible position. On the other hand it has been suggested that Ministers generally hold the view that each State should pay the rebate in proportion to the quantity of sugar imported. I shall not press for an answer upon this point now, as I know that Ministers are so little versed in their own policy that it would be cruel to ask them for an opinion off-hand. I shall therefore simply request them to bear the matter in mind.",21
44,Mr BEID,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I do not think I shall be out of order if I take advantage of this proposal to ask a question with reference to the excise on sugar. Is it distinctly understood that in the year 1907, when the present special arrangement comes to an end, there is to be no excise duty on sugar ?",22
45,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Of course the excise will lapse then unless some further action is taken in the meantime. 33 Q,22
46,Mr REID,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"If any prospect of a discontinuance of the excise were held out, the Government in 1906, on proposing that there should be an excise duty upon sugar in 1907 and following years, might be met by the statement that in 1901-2 the Government of the day had entered into a compact with the Queensland sugar-growers to the effect that after 1906 there should be no excise. This is another of those questions which rise above the commonplace, and it would be cruel to ask the Ministry for even a chance expression of opinion on the subject. When we are dealing with the Tariff Bill, however, I hope the Government will make some definite statement which will disabuse the minds of the sugar growers of any notion that there is any compact on the part of the Federal Government that no excise duty shall be collected after 1906. Mr KINGSTON.'-It is well known that no Government or Parliament can very well bind their successors.",22
47,Mr REID,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"No , but a compact may be entered into or an honourable obligation may be established.",22
48,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,We are not attempting to bind any Parliament or Government; but it is our fervent hope' that the excise duty upon a natural industry such as sugar growing will cease at the end of the period mentioned in the Tariff.,22
49,Mr OMALLEY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I do not think that the Minister has been explicit enough. In all countries those who hold vested interests are always prepared to declare that compacts have been entered into to relieve them of their burdens, and the Government in office when the present arrangement comes to an end should not have to face a declaration on the part of the sugar-growers that an understanding was arrived at that they would not have to pay any more excise duty. Similar questions have arisen over and over again in the United States. If in the first American Commonwealth it had been declared at the outset that the ownership of slaves was not a veste'd interest under the United States Constitution, much expenditure of blood and treasure would have been saved, and the Southerners would not have been able to declare that they were being robbed and plundered of rights to which they were entitled under the Constitution. We have, in the sugar question, one very similar to that which arose in America, and we may .judge from the feeling already exhibited over the - Kanaka question in Queensland of the difficulties that will probably arise in the future unless the understanding now arrived at is perfectly clear.",22
50,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL, I presume that Ministers are acting upon the suggestions of their officers in this matter 1 . Mr KINGSTON - We have not failed to secure all available information on the subject.,23
51,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I objected to the original proposal brought forward, but as it was carried against me by the committee, I desire to see the administration of it conducted as satisfactorily as possible. I am prepared to leave to the Ministry, without much discussion, the determination as to what is the best thing to be done in such a matter. They arc the executive body, and it is to them we shall look to answer for any maladministration.",23
52,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," With reference to the alteration made in the amendment as printed, it appears that, instead of taking the average sugar contents as struck in each mill during the year, the average to be taken is that ascertained by Dr Maxwell as the average found to exist for five years in each district. should like to know if that is so, and if it is intended to accept the average .already struck by Dr Maxwell 1",23
53,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I will not say that in so many words, but of course we shall have the benefit of the advice of Dr Maxwell in fixing the average. Amendment agreed to.",23
54,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I move That the following new item be inserted :'-'Starch, on and after 26th March, 1902, per lb., Id."" I have fixed that date because it was on the 25th March that the committee reduced the duty on rice, and it is intended to make up any loss of revenue by this excise duty.",23
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Why single out for an excise duty %,23
56,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Because if we did not do this we should not obtain the same amount of revenue that we otherwise would. Honourable members will recollect that when discussing the subject of starch we agreed that the duty upon rice, which is the rawmaterial of starch, should be fixed upon the basis of a contribution by the manufacturer who uses the raw material, of I d . per lb. for starch. Honourable members will see that unless this proposal is adopted there will be an advantage to the manufacturer greater than that which he should enjoy. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - What will be the position of the department in making the duty retrospective 1",23
57,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,There will be no trouble whatever in giving effect' to the . proposal.,23
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Parramatta) The right honourable gentleman told the committee in fixing a duty of 2d. per lb. on starch, that it was his intention later on to propose an excise of a Id., but he has never yet told the committee why, out of all the numerous items in the Tariff, starch should be selected for an excise duty. This is deemed one of those articles which is in the category of non-revenue producing articles, and to which scientific prohibitive protection should apply. The right honourable gentleman now fixes a duty so as to keep outside of the Commonwealth all foreign starch"". That is clearly the intention of the Government: but why does he select this article, produced within the Commonwealth, for this impost for revenue purposes ?",23
59,Mr REID,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Because if this were not done perhaps' the English manufacturers I might come in and share the'benefit with the local manufacturers.,23
60,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,-Because we do not wish to make the fortunes of the manufacturers of starch.,23
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"At any rate, we might be told why the right honourable gentleman proposes an excise duty upon starch, and not upon rice, butter, tea, or any of the other articles which enter into the home consumption of the people of the country? If there is a reason for this special treatment of starch we ought to know what it is.",23
62,Mr REID,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," The right honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs has made a very startling admission starch just now, in reply to the comments of the honourable member for Parramatta, upon this somewhat peculiar extension of the excise duties. He has said that he does not wish to make the fortunes of the manufacturers of starch. That is a startling admission that, until now, this Tariff has been framed to make the fortunes of the manufacturers of this article. It was a most injudicious remark to make. The explanation of the proposal of the Government is that this article has been so peculiarly favoured in the Tariff, as it stands, that i is necessary to make this extraordinary departure. One would have thought that it would have been a very much simpler thing to apply to this particular line the rule applied to many other lines. There are a great many other industries here using raw material upon which they have to pay duty, but in their case no excise duty is proposed. Why an excise on starch, if it had been properly treated, as the other industries had been treated, in dealing with the Tariff ? The Minister says that when the duty upon rice was fixed, an arrangement was made as to the rice to be used in the manufacture of starch, which necessitates this proposal. I think some other arrangement might have been made, as has been made in the case of other articles, without the necessity of establishing an excise which is, to some extent, an expense upon the public, because an excise department involves the expenditure of money. I do not oppose this duty, because, although the expedient may be a roundabout one, it probably has the effect of making the margin in favour of the manufacturer of starch more reasonable than it was. Of course, the suspicious outsider may say that this is a clever contrivance to keep foreign manufacturers out of the competition : that if the duty had remained as it was, they would have been tempted by it to come to Australia to manufacture starch. While this excise will not prevent the local manufacturer from securing the market, it will prevent any foreign manufacturer from making his home amongst us. That is one of the ingenious speculations that arise from this somewhat roundabout way of dealing with the subject. The Minister explains it hy saying that it is due to the adjustment of the duty upon rice, but as I have said there are a number of other articles upon which adjustments have been , made so as not to involve the establishment of an excise duty.",23
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I wonder why some of the Victorian members do not say something upon this matter. Here is a proposal which must permanently increase the price of this article. We have been hearing from Victorian members all through the dehate upon the Tariff that protective duties are not taxes. That is a favourite subject, for a homily by the honourable member for Gippsland, but he must admit that this prot posal would impose a tax upon the people, and would result in a permanent increase in the price of the article. If , heretofore, commodities have been cheap in Victoria, because of high duties, starch can'no longer be included in that category. Having taken steps to prevent the introduction of the outside article, Ministers proceed to tax the article produced within the Commonwealth for the benefit of the revenue. Why should they not get this advantage by another process 1 Why not give the people of Victoria the benefit of cheap starch as heretofore, instead of permanently raising the price by I d . per lb ? That is what I should like to hear from Victorian members. But it seems they do not care what happens to Victoria so long as a stray manufacturer gets what he wants. I should have thought that they would protest most strongly against the imposition of such a duty as this. This is 7 a case in which they must admit that their favourite theory will not hold good any longer, because they are now deliberately assisting the Government to permanently raise the price.of this article to all who will have to use it . Amendment agreed to. - Mr GLYNH (South Australia) - I move That the following new item be inserted :""Matches, on and after 18th April, 1902, per gross,'3d."" I should like to remind honourable members of one or two of the facts connected with this industry. The duty was reduced from Is. to 6d. When the subject was previously discussed I stated that the total number of persons employed at Bell and Co.'s factory at Richmond, according to the registration under the Pactories Act, was 49, and that of these 41 were females. When they were asked to supply materials to ascertain the wages paid, the manufacturers gave some figures which fixed the number of hands at 93. I believe that the number 93 comprises kindlers and others who can scarcely he called factory hands. The manufacturers have stated that the wages paid are-for males, an average of 18s. Sd. per week, and for females 14s. 1 d. per week, so that neither the total number of persons employed, nor the wages paid, justifies a loss of revenue, or any serious consideration for this industry. The duty imposed by the Victorian Parlia7 ment in 1894 was intended, not as a pro tective duty , but to discourage the use of 7 wax matches, aud, like many another legislative interference of the kind, it had quite the contrary effect, and led to the establishment of a match factory' in Victoria by an English firm, and a consequent loss of revenue, comparing the returns of 1894 with those of 1899, and taking no account of the increase of population in the meantime, of £10,000 a year. The Melbourne match factory supplies about three-fourths of the Victorian demand, and, applying those figures to the whole consumption of Australia, it is evident that if the duty of Is. per gross had been retained, there would have been a loss of revenue of £50,000 a year. Now that the rate has been reduced to 6d., the loss, taking into account the increase of population, and assuming that no excise duty is put on, will be about £30,000 a year. I think it better that the local factory should disappear than that the revenue should he a loser to that extent. A duty of 6d. per gross is equivalent to an ad valorem duty of from 28 to 33 per cent., and the import charges amount to a further protection of from 18 to 23 per cent., so that the total protection is about 50 per cent. As I did not wish to be unfair to the local manufacturers, I asked them to put before me whatever facts they thought would tell in their favour, but, before referring to the information which they have supplied me, I wish to point out that the reduction of the duty from Is. to 6d. has been followed by a proportionate reduction in the price of matches. the Victorian duty of Is. per gross was in force, the price of imported matches in Melbourne was from 3s. 2d. to 3s. 6d. per gross, duty paid, according to brand, and in Sydney, the price was from 2s. Id. to 2s. 6d. per gross, according to brand ; while the price of Victorian-made matches in Melbourne was 3s. per j gross, less 5 per cent., and in Sydney between i 2s - Id. and 2s. 6d. per gross. That statement is confirmed by a letter which I have seen from Messrs. Anthony Hordern, and Sons, of Sydney. Since the duty was reduced to 6d. per gross, the Melbourne price for locally-made matches has come down to 2s. 4£d. per gross. That fact was published a few days ago in the Argus. Mi. MAUGER - But why was company's reply published 1",24
64,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I am going to give their reply. I was furnished by them with an advance copy of the letter which they sent to the Argus. In that letter they say that the reduction was owing to a forced realization, because they preferred to sell at that price rather than submit to the possibility of7 having to pay an excise duty of 3d. per gross later on. I ask honourable members what weight they attach to that statement ? Messrs. Bell and Company must have been conscious that their case against the imposition of an excise duty was a bad one, or they made a rather stupid commercial transaction. They say that consumers have for years past been paying the same price for matches in Sydney and Melbourne, namely, I d . for two boxes. It seems to me that that is a deceptive though I do not say a designedly deceptive statement. The prices I have given are for merchantable quantities, and they show that the price has been increased or decreased in proportion to the duty . 7 The value of a single box of matches is so small that it is impossible that its price could be affected by a variation of duty.",25
65,Mr TUDOR,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"-Then the merchants pocket the profit. The honourable and learned member sees no objection to that, but he does not wish the manufacturer to make a profit.",25
66,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I do not intend to argue that question. No matter who pockets the profits, the revenue loses. The following letter from the company restates some of the with facts which they put before me at an interview. Complaining that a statement was made here about the poor quality of their matches, they sayWhen We have not received a single complaint during the last five years, and yet we manufacture for all the leading merchants of Melbourne, and also for Cameron Brothers Limited, who are the largest distributors of matches in Australia. We are ready at any moment to submit this question to experts, and are prepared to stand or fall'by their verdict. I do not think I said anything about the quality of the Victorian matches, but if I did, it was merely by accepting the statement of some interjector. Upon inquiry I have found nothing to disprove their statement that their matches are as good as the imported matches.",25
67,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Then we can manufacture one article which is as good as the imrjorted article. not the Mr TUDOR - The honourable and learned member would not make that admission in regard to South Australian furniture.,25
68,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I did not make the statement attributed to me in regard to South Australian furniture. My denial of it will - be borne out by honourable members who heard my speech, and by an exact transcript of the notes of the debate taken by the Hansard reporters. I said that the industry, from the point of view of those who had proposed a 25 per cent, rate, to lead to high wages, appeared not to be flourishing, as a wages board had a few years ago been asked for ; and advantage was taken of a jocular interjection, which had no local reference, that I made about the wriggling of drawers, to try to secure my political decapitation. To remove misapprehension, let me repeat what I said-that one can obtain first-class locally-made furniture in South Australia, but one must pay for it . I know that, because I have made a personal inspection of some of the factories, and have seen the work which they turn out. At the same time, I stand by my original statement that the industry and the consumers would be better off without the duty. The case for the wax match industry has been supported by the Age with an ability which I admire all the more because of its inherent weakness. They point out that the raw material used in the manufacture of wax matches is pretty severely taxed-that stearine, for instance, pays a duty of 3£d. per lb. But, according to the gospel of the protectionists, if an import duty is placed upon a commodity, it will eventually be supplied locally without any increase of price, and the evidence given before the Victorian Tariff Commission in 1895 was that the stearine used in the wax match industry is supplied by local manufacturers, so that the existence of an import duty upon it cannot affect the price. The report of the Tariff Board, which is dated March, 1895, shows that the glue which is used in the match industry is manufactured locally. How, therefore, can it be affected by the duty ? I am arguing from the protectionist stand-point, that the import duty does not affect the price of the article, except to bring it down. Again, the wrapping paper which was taxed at 6s. per cwt. in Victoria, is now rated at 3s. per cwt., so that they cannot rely very much upon that item. .On strawboard, which has been rated at 4s. per cwt. in Victoria, the Government proposed a duty of 2s., and it was reduced at the instance of the free traders to Is. If we had had our way, it would have been made duty free, as I believe that very little of the article is used in the match industry. If this excise duty is passed, I believe there is not a free-trader who would not support a proposition to remit the duty of 3d. per gross on boxes. We did not wish the duty to be imposed, and we are quite willing that it should be struck' out. I ask the committee to impose this excise duty in order to prevent a tremendous leakage of revenue. Mr COSfBOY (Werriwa) - I trust that the excise duty will be imposed. If the import duty on matches had been reduced to 3d. per gross as I desired, I should not have suprjorted the imposition of an excise duty. If all the matches used in Australia were imported, even subject to a duty of 6d. per gross, the revenue would be about £35,000 a year. What I object to is that any one should have the right to derive so much money from other members of the community without making a contribution to the Treasury. As the local manufacturer can raise the price of matches he sells by 6d. per gross, it is clear that he ought to give back at least half of that sum. To my mind he ought to return a great deal more, and think himself lucky if he got a return of one halfpenny for the collection of 5^d. for the Treasurer. To show how considerably the price of matches is affected by the rate of duty, I have only to mention that on the day sifter it was reduced from Is. to 6d. per gross, the local manufacturer was quite willing to reduce the price of his < matches to merchants and others by 6d. per gross, and has already done so, showing that he had been taking advantage of the duty since its imposition. At the present time the factory pays very little more than £1,500 a year in wages, and if it supplied Australia with all its matches the wages' hill would amount toonly £3,000, while the loss to the revenuewould be about £35,000. It is a very considerable loss indeed, and men calling themselves labour men, vote for such a thing. Why not instead pass a law, giving the whole of the £35,000 to the men instead of only £3,000; and they tell us they do such things in the interests of the workers. In the first instance the Ministers said that they intended to have an excise duty on matches, and that they were perfectly prepared to stand by their proposal. But when any honourable member on that side gets up now and says that the price of all the raw material is increased, it is absolutely different from the statements they have hitherto made. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports wished to get a duty on stearine, he screamed himself hoarse in denouncing every one as vile and mendacious who - dared to assert that the price of the article was raised by the imposition of the import duty. He asserted that because there was a duty of l£d. per lb. imposed, the article was very much cheaper than it had been. The fact that he has made a statement of an exactly opposite nature is not surprising. I presume the only place in which he thinks it is not necessary to make a correct statement is in this chamber. I should be very sorry to think that any honourable member would make such a statement outside, when proof to the contrary can be so readily afforded. In this instance the duties on the raw material have been considerably decreased. Prom the point of view of the protectionists, the imposition of a duty cheapens the price of the article, and therefore the company is getting the full benefit of the duty of 6d. per gross. That amounts to from 35 to 20 per cent, on the f.o.b. price in London, and the cost of bringing out the matches runs from 15 to 20 per cent., so that the present protection which this factory enjoys is about 50 per cent. I trust that the excise duty of 3d. per gross will be agreed to, and that if not the item will be recommitted. Sir JOHN. QUICK (Bendigo) - For a long time there has been a small clique in Victoria doing all they possibly could to damage the reputation of the Victorian match factory, and trying to crush it out of existence. . These individuals have not the courage or the ability to geb any Victorian to make this attack, but they have inspired honourable members who come from other States. They have been haunting the precincts of the chamber from day to day, and inspiring honourable members. I do not blame these honourable members, I am sure that the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is of too generous a nature to wilfully do anything which would savour of a vindictive character.",25
69,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I raised this question the hustings in South Australia.,27
70,Sir JOHN QUICK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Ye s ; but inspired by false information, which emanated from a little clique in Victoria.",27
71,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I made the same point at the elections last year.,27
72,Sir JOHN QUICK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,We all know the source of this false information. I thought that this wretched match-box question was fought out at an earlier stage of this interminable debate.,27
73,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,The excise duty was given notice of.,27
74,Sir JOHNQUIC K,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Yes; but the Government's proposals seemed to embody a very fair and reasonable concession in the direction of what is known as the free trade principle, amounting to a reduction of practically 50 per cent, on the old Victorian duty. Because while they imposed an import duty of Is. per gross, they proposed to levy an excise duty of 6d. per gross, which was equivalent to a reduction by 50 per cent, of the protection which this factory 7 had enjoyed under our protective system. Surely the most rabid free-trader ought to be satisfied with that reduction. My honourable and learned friend fought the battle to reduce the protective duty, inspired no doubt by the source I referred to, and succeeded in getting the import duty reduced to 6d. per gross. But. he is not satisfied with that reduction, and he now wishes to reduce the protection by another 50 per cent. It seems to me that the afftack on this industry is becoming too pronounced. It is partaking of the nature of a persecution. It is suggestive of a determined attempt to wipe out a Victorian industry. It is not a question of revenue, hut a question of the persecution and ruination of a Victorian industry. If honourable members had not been inspired in this way, no doubt they would not have taken the action which they have taken. The proposals 7 of the Government amounted to a reduction of the protection by 50 per cent. 7 The free-traders are not satisfied with this reduction, but also want to place an additional burden upon the industry in the 7 shape of an excise duty , bringing down the 7 protection to 3d. It has been said that there is a protective duty on boxes, and that according to the protective theory the price of boxes ought not to be increased. As a matter of fact the boxes locally produced are not used in the industry . Match boxes 7 on are imported. The tax on the boxes amounts to 3d. per gross: so that if the 3d. per gross is imposed the protection to the match industry will be practically wiped out 7 altogether. I hope that the committee will not, through a feeling of vindictiveness and a desire to injure the industry , give effect 7 to the malicious attempts made from time to time by a small clique to crush out one of the industries of ""Victoria.",27
75,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I must resent the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. This question was first brought up last October when, speaking to the general question, I instanced the match industry as one evidence of protection run mad in Victoria. I believe that I was the first to mention it, and that was before I had heard one word locally in reference to the match industry. Consequently there could be no suggestion of inspiration from any quarter in my case. I do not know the proprietors of the match factory , and have not been to it. They had 7 an opportunity of placing the facts of their case in the hands of honourable members, and I am sure that every fair-minded man would give consideration to their representations. But I am still convinced that it is not worth our while to make sacrifices in - order to maintain this industry. We are not justified in increasing the price of matches to the consumer for the sake of a few people in Melbourne. If the amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is carried, there will still be a margin of 3d. per gross in addition to the natural protection, which, considering that matches are rather a bulky commodity in comparison with their weight, must amount to a fair percentage. Personally, I should be prepared to leave no margin. I trust the amendment will be carried.",28
76,Mr TUDOR,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," It has been urged that as the match industry of Victoria is only a small one it deserves to be wiped out. It might as well be said to an individual-""You are only one person in the community and should he wiped out.""",28
77,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"What I said was that I would sooner the industry went to the wall than spend £50,000 a year to keep it going. "" ",28
78,Mr TUDOR,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I know that there are honourable members opposite who would rejoice if this industry could be wiped out. If they could go to their constituents at 7 the next election and say- "" We helped to strangle a Victorian industry,"" probably the announcement would be cheered. The narrow provincial feeling in some of the States is so keen, even to-da\ , in spite of federation, that there are honourable members who would be applauded for helping to cripple a Victorian industry, even though it is carried on under conditions which insure for the workers fair remuneration and reasonable hours of labour. Those honourable members would prefer that goods consumed in this country should be made by persons working without any restriction in the matter of wages and hours. Matchboxes are made in the east end of London for 2^-d. per gross, or sixteen boxes for a farthing. I have no doubt that the honourable and learned member for Werriwa would like to see such conditions prevailing in this part of the world. He believes in free-trade in flesh and blood. I do not.",28
79,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,The honourable member is not correct in making that statement.,28
80,Mr TUDOR,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Then I withdraw the remark; but it is well-known that there are some honourable members who believe in free-trade conditions as applying to labour as well as to goods, whilst there .are other free-traders who protest just as vigorously against that idea, but I cannot see how you can protect the worker, unless you protect the product of the worker. I believe that there should be a margin of at least fid. between the excise and the import duties. I feel sure, from the information that I have, that if the amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Australia is carried the factory in Melbourne will be 7 closed up. If the industry is carried on here we can legislate with regard to the labour conditions of those who are engaged in it , whereas if the goods are imported from abroad we have no control. I am prepared to give the industry an amount of protection that will enable it to be carried on under fair conditions. Therefore I trust that the committee will reject the amendment.",28
81,Mr BROWN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," A great deal of heat has been imported into the dis7 cussion. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo seems to be under the impression that members of the Opposition take a stand against this particular industry 7 because of some deep-rooted prejudice they 7 7 have against Victorian manufactures. I had heard of the Victorian match factory 7 long before I ever saw Melbourne, and of the 7 way in which the industry had been foisted 7 on the people of the State; and I took occasion to refer to the subject when I first ad7 dressed this Chamber. No Victorian has approached me with information of the character to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo takes exception, my information coming wholly from those interested in maintaining this industry on the lines on which it was established, that is, to a certain extent, under State patronage or protection. There is no justification for the charges made by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. The members of this Chamber have been supplied with interested information, which, when sifted, has been found to be largely fictitious; and I hope that if it falls to the ment to again consider the question of Customs taxation, some means, such as that provided i u a Royal commission or other body with power to take evidence on oath will be adopted for the purpose of presenting the real facts in connection with the various industries. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has himself been responsible, no doubt in good faith, for information quite at variance with other information, which has so far not been controverted ; and that instance alone shows the need for thorough and impartial inquiry, such as I have suggested. It is not fair in the interests of the community that a particular industry such as that under discussion should be subsidized by the State; but, at the same time, I do not see that the proper way to encourage a native manufacture is to impose an excise duty. I do not believe in the round-about method of imposing 6d. at the Custom-house, and then imposing an excise duty of 3d. in order to secure revenue j and I can only suppose that the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is possibly trying to remedy a defect created by the committee being led to vote for the higher rate. This industry has been living on the public of Victoria by means of the wretched system of indirect taxation which finds favour in this State. But that fact does not justify us in imposing excise at this particular time. I should prefer to see the customs duty reduced to 3d, and, therefore, I cannot support the amendment.",28
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Parramatta) For recklessness of statement it would be hard to beat the speeches of the two Victorian members whom we have heard this afternoon. One honourable member shrieked that we on this side of the House were simply the "" puppets of a small clique "" who are trying to destroy this Victorian industry, and that the members of this clique have been haunting the Chamber for some time. Such a charge by a representative of Victoria is exceedingly "" rich,"" in face of the fact that for the last six months honourable members have scarcely been able to get into the House for the number of Victorian lobbyists plying their business nightly.",29
83,Mr CHAPMAN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I suppose there were no importers amongst them.,29
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"No doubt importers had to lobby, but for every importer there must have been a dozen manufacturers lot of this Parlia- or their agents.",29
85,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I think the honourable member is wrong.,29
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"We have seen the honourable member for Melbourne Ports fetching and carrying for the manufacturers in the gallery every night, and making statements which five minutes afterwards he had to modify. If members of the Opposition chose to retort, we might call honourable members on the Government side, "" puppets of the manufacturers."" The practice of lobbying, if not checked, will earn for the House a by-name similar to that which has been earned for the Parliament of the United States. The honourable member for Yarra went further and practically said that honourable members on this side of the House, particularly New South Wales members, would be delighted to see the Victorian industries ruined. Can the honourable member suggest any motive for such fiendish delight, or point to any word or deed in the past to justify an allegation so slanderous? We on this side of the Chamber have as m u ol 1 regard for the interests of the working man as has the honourable member for Yarra. We desire that the match-making industry of Victoria shall be treated in the same way as is every other industry. We do not wish to close it up, or to inflict any harm upon it , but it should be made to stand upon its merits. Those interested in an industry that has been coddled and bolstered up in such a way as to disgust even an orthodox protectionist like the leader of the labour party ought not to ask for further support for it , and the honourable and learned member for South Australia is to be commended for his attempt to divert into the Treasury some of the money which 7 has hitherto passed into the pockets of the - manufacturers.",29
87,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Robertson) The Victorians cannot take to themselves any credit for the establishment of the matchmaking industry. The report of the V i c to r i a n T a r if f Commission shows that the d u t y upon wax vestas was imposed with a view to discourage their importation, and to promote the use of safety matches. It was stated in evidence before the commission that the local industry provided employment for 53 hands, of whom 4S were girls, two were boys, and only t w o were men, the wages averaging less t h a n 10s. per week. It was shown clearly that the in dustry was not one to be encouraged. Dr Gi'esswell saidThe destruction of bone to the extent even of the loss of the whole of the lower jaw might take place as the result of the handling of phosphorus in this particular industry. The revenue of V i c to r is was depleted to the extent of £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 ""per annum, and the wages paid to those engaged in the industry did not amount to more t h a n £ 5 , 0 0 0 a year. The sum of £ 7 , 0 0 0 per annum got in to the pockets of the employers. The local manufacturers have derived i m mense benefits, and as the effect of the amendment will be to diver t in to the Treasury 50 per cent, of the profits derived by them from the i m p o rt duty , the proposal should have the strong support of the Treasurer.

We agree to include porcelain fittings, includin g lamp holders, except switches over 4 inches in the base, insulating tapes, meters, arc lamps and accessories, resistant coils, rheostats, static 7 transformers and terminals. I think the honourable member for K o o y o n g who has made suggestions with respect to these articles is satisfied that this will meet w h at is required in that particular line. The honourable member for Dalley desired to include in the free list electrical, pneumatic, and 19 hydrauli c machine tools.

96,Sir GEORCE TURNER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"We propose that.

122,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"It is perfectly competent at this stage for any Minister who has not spoken to go through the whole list, and indicate which items they will agree to recommit, and which ones the recommittal of which they will oppose.

129,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"No. On the motion that the report be agreed to, the Minister for Trade and Customs moved that not all items, but certain items, he recommitted ; then other honourable members moved that certain items, of which some are printed and some are not, be recommitted, and I am now proceeding to put the items one hy one to the House.",33
130,Mr REID,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I wish to ask vou, sir, whether the debate was not practically closed when you put the question which, for the sake of convenience, you are now stating in parts. The fact of the question being put in parts, I think, does not have the effect of reopening the debate and enabling an honourable member to speak while we are practically dividing.",33
131,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The right honourable member is perfectly correct. I had only commenced to put the question, and did not desire to put the items so speedily as to prevent honourable members from moving for the recommittal of other items. But since I have put the first portion of the question no further discussion can be permitted. Mr 'V. L . SOLOMON - The difficulty is that an honourable member is not permitted to speak in support of any motion to recommit which he has given notice. Each of the proposals before the Chair is absolutely a separate proposal.",34
132,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I have already ruled that it is not so. I will repeat my ruling. I rule that there is one motion submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs. Other proposals have been submitted by other honourable members. On the original motion each proposal to recommit might have been discussed in detail.,34
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"You have sir, that an honourable member cannot speak twice on any subject. Suppose that after an honourable member has moved for the recommittal of an item, some other honourable member gives notice of a motion to recommit an item that is not mentioned on the paper. That, if carried, goes to the committee as an instruction, and we cannot have a word to say about it. Surely there must be some means whereby the House can discuss the instruction 1 Otherwise it cannot fairly be called an instruction of the House to the committee.

137,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Tha i point has already been disposed of. No further debate can take place. If when I am putting any motion an honourable member prefers some other wording to the wording which I put, ruled, and wishes the wording to be modified in any way, I have no doubt that the House will consent to such modification, hut not to the extent of debate or of an amendment such as I understand the honourable and learned member wishes to move.",34
138,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The point I should like to put is whether you, sir, could not suggest to the House some other way in which honourable members might be able to say a few words on the subject. I am not sure whether the ruling you have given is not right, but I should like to have the items put in such a way that honourable members will have the opportunity which they would have had if they had known in the first place that this proceeding was to he adopted.",34
139,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The honourable and learned member cannot discuss the question. I see no way in which any debate or amendment can now be submitted to the House. It is perfectly competent for the House 7 either to recommit, or not to recommit, but it is not possible to amend any proposal to recommit which is now before the House.",34
140,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,The standing orders have been suspended.,34

142,Mr CROUCH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, mentioned soap dyes as coming under item 4U, but it will be found that item 40 refers only to nuts.",35
143,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I am not responsible for any mistakes which any honourable member may have made. If an honourable member in proposing to recommit item 40 means item 41, I cannot help that.",35
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I understand, Mr . Speaker, that you rule that there is no way in which we can alter or modify' any of these items. The difficulty is that when we get into committee the Chairman will immediately rule that the items as they appear here are instructions from the House. They are proposed now after some honourable member who is interested has spoken, and you rule 'that honourable members cannot express an opinion as to any modification, the time for that having gone by. But honourable members have never had any chance of expressing au opinion. The consequence is that these items go into committee as instructions from the House, when in reality they are not so, because the House, as such, has never had an opportunity of considering them.",35
145,Mr SPEAKER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"That point can best Forrest, Sir J. be answered by a reference to item 41, Groom, ""Oilmen's stores,"" which I am now putting, Higgins, H. B. and which the Minister for Trade and Isaacs, I . A. Customs has moved shall he recommitted Kingston, C. C. with a view to adding the words "" and Lyne, Sir W.

C. whole question for review, and that proposal was put and negatived. The question now is that the item be recommitted with a view of adding the words I have mentioned. It would have been competent for any honourable member to propose that, instead of there being any limitation, the word "" reviewed "" be inserted. Tho whole question, and not any particular duty, would then have been open for review; but the time for that has passed.",35
146,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I think that there to he a discussion of the whole matter, though I am not at all sure that the Speaker is not quite right.

In Committee of Ways and Means (Second recommittal) : Mr CONROY..:- I should like to know whether you, Mr Chairman, intend to ask anybody to take the chair in your place. You have been voting this evening, and that has never been done before.",35

149,The CHAIRMAN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I consider it not only a reflection, but a personal insult.",40

152,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I am sorry I cannot meet the evident wish of the committee, and allow this item to go without discussion. It will he remembered that during the discussion of the exise duty on methylated spirits I pointed out that the difference between the excise and the import duty was so enormous as to amount to five times the cost of production of the spirit. The Government themselves had evidently not considered to what extent protection^was'afforded to the local manufacturer, and the Minister for Trade and Customs admitted that there was reason for NCES. reconsideration. I can assure honourable members that 6d. per gallon as a price for spirits suitable for methylation, taking it at proof, is a liberal if not an extravagant estimate ; and my intention is to move that the duty be 9d. per gallon.",40

Item 21-Fruit s and vegetables . . . bananas, per central, Is. on and after 28th November, 1901. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I move That the words "" and on and after 18th April, .1902, 6d., be addedn When this item was previously under discussion I moved, on behalf of the honourable member for Wentworth, that bananas be made free. When that amendment was negatived, it was sought to reduce the duty from Is. to 6d., but the forms of the House presented a difficulty, and the second amendment could not be submitted. Under the circumstances the Treasurer agreed that an opportunity should be given for a reconsideration of the matter on recommittal. The main arguments then put forward in favour of the amendment were that bananas are a wholesome form of food, required by a very large number of people, mostly of the poorer classes, and that it is, to the last degree, desirable that the Commonwealth should encourage trade with the islands. One main branch of that trade is in bananas, and unless we wish to see New Zealand snatch this commerce from us, we should deal liberally with the islands in the Tariff.",40
155,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I trust that the committee will not agree to this proposal. Original!}' it was proposed that the duty should be 2s., and after a reduction to 9d. had been suggested, it was ultimately fixed at Is. Under all the circumstances this is not an unfair degree of protection to give to those who are engaged in bananagrowin g in Queensland.",40
156,Mr THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," Fro m every aspect it is unwise to place a d u t y upon bananas. It will be of no practical assistance to the Queensland growers, who already possess the V i c to r i a n market and do half of the trade with New South Wales. The b u l k of the island bananas are brought in to the Commonwealth at a time when Queensland cannot supply the market. The effect of the d u t y will be not only to deprive our people of a wholesome f r u it for p a r t of the year, but to neutralize our efforts to extend commercial relations with the South Sea Islands. The present d u t y has already had a serious effect upon the earning power of the vessels which provide our only means of communication with the islands, and upon which we are entirely dependent for the maintenance of trade relations. Some honourable members have stated that the d u t y is small, but if the banana planters in either Queensland or the islands secure. are turn of Is . per hunch net they consider they are doing very well.

Item 04A - Piece-good s to be used in the manufacture of cloth made waterproof with india rubber pursuant to departmental by-kiws, ad valorem, .10 per cent. Motion (by Mr KINGSTON) proposed - That the words ""and on and after 18th April, 1902, 74 per cent.,"" be added.",42
166,Mr VL SOLOMON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"South Australia). - The Government, after mature and deliberate advice from their officers, put in print a proposal that these goods should be admitted under a duty of 5 per cent. The only alteration made by the House in referring that proposal to the committee was to strike out the words "" 5 per cent.,"" and provide that the item should be reviewed in order to permit of these goods being admitted absolutely free if the committee chose. After the lapse of less than two hours, the Government change their proposal from 5 per cent, to 7J per cent. That is not a fair way of treating the committee. I am inclined upon this occasion to follow the Government in the original proposal they submitted, and I move That the figures "" 7\"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figure ""5.""",42
167,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I think the honourable member for South Australia will ' be disposed to withdraw his amendment when he understands the true position. The increase of the duty from 5 to 7 i per cent., as now proposed by the Government, really means less protection than a duty of 5 per cent, would give. At present the duty upon made-up waterproof cloth, or waterproof cloth, in the piece, is 15 per cent., while the duty upon piece-goods which can be made up into waterproof cloth with the rubber is 10 per cent. The Government originally suggested that the difference should be made 10 per cent, by the reduction of the duty on piece-goods to 5 per cent. They now propose to increase that duty to 7^ per cent., which leaves a difference between the two of 7^ per cent., less freight.",42
168,Mr VL SOLOMON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"South Australia). - I did not move the amendment under the impression that I was moving a free trade item, but merely in order to find out a reason for the sudden change in the proposal submitted by the Government from 5 per cent, to 7k per cent.",42
169,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I am very sorry that the Government have changed their minds in regard to this matter, but I recognise that it is hopeless to follow the honourable member for South Australia.",42
170,Mr THOMSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I must agree with the proposal of the Government, because the duty upon made-up waterproof is 15 per cent. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment agreed to. Item 65 - Tents , tarpaulins, sails, and flags, ad valorem, free.",42
171,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I propose to move that the duty upon tents, tarpaulins, sails, and flags be 10 per cent. Mr ""V. L . SOLOMON - Fiv e per cent, is what the honourable member promised.",42
172,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The leader of the Opposition asked whether I would accept 5 per cent., hut he would not accept that duty, and divided the committee upon the question. If I said I would propose 5 per cent., as I do not wish to do anything wrong, I move That the words ""and on and after the 18th April, 1902, ad valorem, 5 per cent.,"" be added.",42
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," In my opinion it would he better to take the duty off the raw material than to impose a duty upon tents and tarpaulins. We are constantly asseverating our sympathy with those engaged in the primary industries, who, under the most adverse conditions of 11812 Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES. ] life, have continually to struggle against the rugged forces of nature. If thei-e is a class to whom we should show favour more than to another it is those who are unable to make homes for themselves, and for whom a tent is the only covering from the violence of the elements. To place a duty upon tents is a piece of unrefined cruelty to such men.",42
174,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," On e of the blessings of this country is that in many parts of it men do not require tents at all, and prefer to sleep under the open sky. The honourable member for Parramatta talks of persons sheltering from the violence of the elements in tents, but many a time when the winds have howled and the rain fallen, I have found myself in the open, unable to make my horse move with whip and spur, and afraid to take shelter from the howling storm lest the ligntning's flash should strike the tree under which I was sheltering, and kill both horse and rider. It seems to me, however, that it would be much better if, instead of playing the fool by endeavouring to use high-sounding language, honourable members would allow the committee to get on with business.",43
175,Mr BROWN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I am in sympathy with the desire of the honourable member for Parramatta to make tents free, hut, as there is a duty of 5 per cent, upon the raw material, I feel bound to vote with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, so that the local manufacturers may not be placed at a disadvantage in competing against manufacturers abroad.",43
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," To test the bona fides of honourable members, I move That the amendment be amended by the insertion of the word ""calico"" before the word ""tents.""

178,Mr GLYNN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," As at first fixed hy the committee the duty upon gas engines was 20 per cent., while oil engines were admitted free. Therefore, I think the Government should be content now with a duty of 10 per cent, upon both kinds of engines. I believe that the Treasurer was at one time of the opinion that they should both be placed upon the free list.",43
179,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I allowed oil engines to he placed on the free list under a misapprehension, as I thought they could not be made here; but when I found that they could be made here, I desired to place both gas and oil engines on the same footing.",43

181,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I think that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for South Australia is a very reasonable one. As oil engines were at first made free by. the committee, I think 10 per cent, is a much fairer compromise than 15 per cent. Of course I should like to see both kinds of engines admitted free, but I do not think the committee is disposed to agree to such a proposal.",43
182,Mr BROWN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," It seems to me that the proposal of the Government is a retrogressive one. While there may not be any great difference between the mechanism of gas and oil engines, they differ greatly as to their possibilities. The use of gas engines must be confined mainly to the large towns where gas is easily obtained, while 011 engines can be used any where, and are being largely used in the country districts for driving all sorts Of farm machinery. They are also of service in butter factories, and of great use in a large variety of agricultural and pastoral industries. They are easily understood and managed, and they are not likely to create fires as steam-engines sometimes do. I shall be glad if the honor-' able and learned member for South Australia will withdraw his amendment for the present, to afford the committee an opportunity'' to say whether it will stand by the old proposition that oil-engines shall be duty free.",43

The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN - I believe I am following the practice that has been adopted by the Chairman - amendment.",44
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I submit that that question was not referred to the committee. Honourable members may have desired in the House to instruct the committee to fix the - duty at 10 per cent., but no amendment was moved, because the Speaker ruled that the question could notbediscussed, andnow we are told from the Chair that the duty cannot be remitted. It is absolutely preventing discussion either in the House or in committee. It is a magnificent instrument to place in the hands of a Ministry. The rights and privileges of honourable members are completely put aside by these rulings. I do not think that the Chairman has ever given the ruling that has been attributed to him. submit that there is no reason why an honourable member cannot move that oil-engines be duty free, if he can move that the duty he altered in any way. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - It ruled in the House that if the consideration of an item was desired to be re-opened, an honourable member should move that the item he reviewed. In this case the resolution was not to review the item, but to consider whether the duty on gas and oil engines should be 15 percent., and the only question to be decided is, whether that proposition shall be accepted or negatived. If it is negatived the duty will remain at 20 percent., but on a further recommittal the 33 s committee will have an opportunity to review the item. I take it, sir, that according to previous rulings from the Chair, the committee must either negative or confirm the proposition that the duty on gas and oil engines be 15 percent. The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN - Accord ing to a ruling of the Chairman a resolution as received from the House must (Mr be either agreed to or disagreed to, and therefore the duty cannot be increased or decreased. I propose to adhere to that ruling.",44

An y proposition is capable of alteration if the amendment is relevant. You, sir, are not bound by the rulings of the Chairman.

I have expressed the opinion here that 15 per cent, is a reasonable duty, and oue which the. consumers can properly afford to pay. There are no special parts connected with the manufacture of oil or gas engines that are materially different from the parts of driving or pumping engines, or engines made for other purposes. Therefore I am going to ask the committee to support me in getting a duty of 15 per cent, on other engines. That duty is a fair one, in view of the decision of the committee in the past, and I shall certainly vote for the proposal. Amendment agreed to.",45

193,Mr KNOX,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I am quite agreeable to the duty being made 15 cent., which is a necessary conclusion to what the committee has already done. B u one point that should be cleared up is what constitutes a high-speed engine. Treasurer has said that a high-speed engine one which makes 400 revolutions per minute. I have a large amount of information which shows that all the experts in Australia who know anything about the subject indicate that an engine which makes 200 revolutions I moveper minute is a high-speed engine.

The Tariff simply says that the duty on speed engines shall be so' much per cent., and what constitutes a high-speed engine left to be determined in the administration of the Customs department. Some experts have told us that the number of revolutions has nothing to do with determining the speed of engines; but that a high-speed engine is one in which the crank or cranks run in a chamber. All we can say is that high-speed engines shall be liable to a certain duty.",45
195,Mr BRUCESMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," Is it not a fact that at the present time these water and steam engines are upon the free list, and will not the effect of passing this amendment be to make them dutiable at 15 per cent ?1",45

Amendment agreed to.",45
199,Sir JOHN QUICK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," In the absence of the honourable member for Moira, the That the following new item be inserted:"" Combined harvesters, on and after 18th April, I The intention of the amendment is that shall be a fixed duty instead of an ad valorem duty on combined harvesters. The stripper and harvester is an agricultural to implement of very great value and utility, that which was invented in Australia as the that result of many years of experiment and development. It is purely an Australian highmachine invented, to meet Australian requirements, as the result of Australian is conditions. There is a great local trade in connection with the production of these implements. The trade is not confined to one or two firms, but there are no less than fifteen firms engagedin the production of the machines in the various States. come to the knowledge of the manufacturers that makers of agricultural implements, in countries which I need not mention, have sent emissaries to Australia to "" spy out the nakedness of the land,"" so to speak. They have purchased specimens of the machine, and sent them to their respective firms abroad in order that they might be imitated. As the result of this it is understood that a determined effort is to be made by those foreign manufacturers to imitate the machines-practicall y to engage in a piratical enterprise. This will be n great disadvantage to Australian manufacturers. There are special reasons why manufacturers want a fixed duty instead of an ad valorem duty. The value of a machine as placed upon the market by Australian manufacturers is about -£85. I believe there have been no importations up to the present, but it is apprehended that an invasion will take place, as it is known that some of the enterprising gentlemen to whom I have referred are engaged in the operation of imitating and pirating Australian ideas. It is considered only a fair thing that the Australian manufacturers should be protected by a fixed duty against the designs of these manufacturers across the seas.",45
200,Mr SKENE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," Some time ago I mentioned these machines as entitled to special consideration As the honourable tuxl learned member for Bendigo has said, the stripper and harvester is purely an Australian invention. There is a history attached to it which I trust the committee will permit me to relate. It occurs to the mind, naturally, that the invention might have been patented, in which case the present trouble would not have arisen. But there were some peculiar circumstances connected with the first exhibition of the machines which prevented the complete invention being protected. As long ago as 1S79 the South Australian Government offered a prize of £4,000 for a machine of the kind. A competition took place at Gawler, and 39 firms competed. None of them were successful, and only some small prizes were awarded. But one man took the matter up privately, probably borrowing, a little in the way of ideas from each machine exhibited, so that he was not entitled to the whole of the credit. He worked on the 33 s a ' machine for years, and in 1885 he started making combined harvesters. From 1885 It has to the present time there has been a gradual increase in the success with which the machines have been produced; so much so that, at the present time, as the honourable and learned member for Bendigo said, there are about fifteen makers in the Commonwealth. There are two in South Australia, two in New South Wales, and several in Victoria. W it h in the last five years the machines have become a complete success. Some of the details have been patented, but the machineshave not been patented altogether, through what is called "" prior publication,"" in consequence of the disclosure of the parts at the exhibition at Gawler in 1S79. Machines have been purchased here and sent both to the United States and Canada, where they have been imitated and copied, and are now being sent out to Australia tocompete with the locally-made machines. I have beard of three or four being imported lately, but I have not seen any of them. In my opinion a fixed duty of £ 1 5 would betoo high, the selling price here being from £ 8 5 to £90. For reasons which have just been hinted at, the makers of these machines would prefer a fixed duty, but I think they would be satisfied with a lower rate. It iswell known amongst people who are interested that there is going to be keen competition in these machines, and I suggest that the fixed duty should be on only a value roughly approximating invoiced price, and not on the selling price. If we take £ 2 0 or £ 2 5 off the selling price we have left £ 6 5 - as the invoice price, and 15 per cent, would mean .about £ 9 15s. each machine. If the honourable and learned member for Bendigo will accept a suggestion to make the duty £10, that will mean something like 15 per cent, on a fairly invoiced implement.",46
201,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Why cannot the local machines compete with those imported 1,46
202,Mr SKENE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"America n manufacturers have a great advantage in the fact that a great many other implements are manufactured hy them along with those under discussion ; and it is feared that the latter may be invoiced at a very low price. I am informed that the profit on each machine is only about £ 1 0 , and, if the duty be fixed at that figure, the manufacturers here will know what they are doing. I do not think that the difference between a fixed duty of £10, and a duty of 15 per cent, on £ 6 5 , will affect the .selling price or be detrimental to the agricultural community. The local inventors and manufacturers of these machines should be given some little consideration, and I advocate this duty only because of the exceptional circumstances. Every one practically 'despaired of getting these machines perfected, but the difficulties have been overcome, and, in consideration of the inventive spirit, pluck, and perseverance displayed, and in view of the fact that no patent can be obtained, I ask the committee to impose a duty which will mean something like 15 per cent, on a fair invoice price.",46
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,What equivalent to 15 per cent. 1,47
204,Mr SKENE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Afixe d duty of £ 1 0 would be about 15 per cent, on an invoiced price of £ 6 5 .  <ou each machine, or the invoiced price must be more than £ 6 5 .",47

206,Mr BROWN,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I hope ''the committee will not abandon the principle which we laid down at the - outset, of eliminating everything in the nature of fixed duties, which largely - obtain in the American Tariff, and more than anything else have led to . abuses in this connection in the United States. If the percentage duty is considered not sufficient to cover the duties which have been placed on the raw material, I should prefer to increase the percentage. It is said that the machines cost between £ 8 0 .and £ 9 0 , but improvements may be effected - which will very materially reduce the price. I am not prepared to say that no machines - of this description are made in America ; but I do not think there have been any importations ; and I trust we shall adhere to the ad valorem principle.",47
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL, I have been told that the invoice price of these machines is from £ 3 0 to £ 4 0 .,47

210,Sir GEORGE TURNER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I do not think the honourable member will find that I ever said that.,47
211,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Who is the authority for the statement that the invoice price is only £ 3 0 or £ 4 0 .,47
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"A gentleman who is interested in manufactures of various kinds; and on that price the fixed duty proposed would be the equivalent of from 25 per cent, to 33 per cent. The evident desire of the committee is to give the equivalent of 15 per cent., and under would be the circumstances the Government would be quite right in adhering to the percentage principle.",47
213,Mr BRUC ESMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I do not profess to know much about harvesters, but the honourable member for Grampians tells us that, so far as his information goes, the invoice price of these machines is £ 6 5 .",47
214,Mr SKENE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I have no definite information.,47
215,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The honourable member for Parramatta tells us that he has been informed that the machines can be invoiced at from £ 3 5 to £40. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, no doubt very laudably from his point of view, made a proposal for a fixed duty of £15, which he is now willing to reduce to £ 1 0 . But why depart from the percentage principle, especially when there is such a wide difference as that shown between £ 35 and £ 6 5 ? The honourable and learned member is evidently content with a duty of £10 on the assumption that the machines cost £ 8 5 .",47
216,Mr SKENE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,That is the selling price.,47
217,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"We have nothing to do with the selling price. The question is, what the proposed duty will amount to on the invoiced price 1 In the face of the difference of opinion, why should we not retain the duty of 15 per cent., taking the chance of what the cost price may be ?",47
218,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"AV e do not know what 15 per cent, would mean.",47
219,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"We do not know what a fixed duty of £ 1 0 would mean; honourable and we are legislating in the dark. The duty might amount to 50 per cent., and I am sure that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo would not think of proposing such an impost. He is at present submitting a duty with an algebraic "" x "" ; and the best thing we can do is to apply the percentage principle.",47
220,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," A fixed duty of £ 1 0 could not possibly amount to 15 per cent. I have seen models of these machines, and have paid much attention to them at the different agricultural shows throughout Australia.",48
221,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Has the honourable member ever seen an invoice from America ?,48
222,Mr MACDONALD,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"PATERSON - I do not trust invoices; and the honourable and learned member for Parkes as an excommercial man, plus a lawyer, knows that invoices are often what are commonly' called "" faked."" In view of the fact that we are protecting Australian brains which produce machines more economical in their working than the best manufactured in America, I shall vote for a fixed duty of £ 1 0.",48
223,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Robertson) Honourable members who advocate a fixed duty have not made out a case that this particular article is entitled to any duty. Patent rights afford the means of giving premiums to brains, and this particular manufacturer, we understand from the honourable member for the Grampians, garnered the ideas of the various manufacturers who assembled at Gawler many years ago. The machine having been perfected, others have copied the principle of its construction, and similar machines are now being made in Canada and the United States. The freight from Chicago to San Francisco is as great as that from San Francisco to Australia, and taking into account the expense incurred in importing the machines, and the fact that labour is as expensive in Canada and the United States as in Australia, no protection should be needed by local manufacturers. The profits made by the manufacturers in the past have been very high, and they wish to have a fixed duty imposed in order that big prices may still be secured to them. If honourable members moving in this matter are sincere in their desire to protect the brains and energy of local manufacturers, they should adopt an ad valorem, duty of 15 per cent., which would be the equivalent of a fixed duty of £ 1 0 . But they have not made out a case for the duty. The argument that has been used with regard to "" faked"" invoices would apply equally to any other importations.",48
224,Mr MCCOLL,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Some of the American firms export to their own managers within the Commonwealth, and there is no check upon their prices.",48
225,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"American manufacturers are as honest as any others, and as an ad valorem duty would be the more equitable, the committee should adhere to the principle they have already laid down.",48
226,Mr WATSON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," Some honourable members have overlooked the universal experience with regard to the relative advantages of fixed and ad valorem duties. It has been found that wherever the values of articles do not fluctuate to any considerable degree, it is preferable from the point of view of honest trading, to have fixed ratherthan ad valorem duties. A d valorem duties have led to wholesale swindling of theCustoms in the United States, .and although American traders are as honest as any others, they must have recourse to the same methods as are adopted by their competitors. There is no fluctuation worth speaking of in the values of harvesters, and a fixed duty would not only help fair traders amongst the importers, but would involve no unfairincidence as between the users of one machine and another. Where largesums are spent in advertising and canvassing, the selling price seldom bears a. proper relation to the actual value of the article. That applies to reapers and binders, and the mere fact that the selling price largely exceeds the cost of the goods landed within the Commonwealth does not necessarily indicate that the importers are reaping very high profits. The import value of the combined harvesters might be put down as' between £ 5 0 and £ 6 0, out they are sold at between £ 8 0 and £ 9 0 . If an ad vcdorem duty were adopted there would he a great danger of the exporting firms in America, which are also importing firms in Australia, placing their own values upon the goods imported. These firms would have invoices purely for Customs purposes because they would simply consign their goods from their factories to their managers in Australia. The combined harvester is an absolutely Australian machine, which enables the farmer to do his work with onesixth of the labour previously required, and at one-sixth of the cost involved in the use - of the ordinary stripper. If we can by imposing a fixed duty equivalent to an impost of 15 per cent, ad valorem upon these machines, secure our own people against unfair trading, we are undoubtedly bound to do so. I have seen duplicate invoices sent here in regard to importations from America, and I am convinced that the same thing is quite practicable, and likely to be practised in regard to combined harvesters when they are imported.",48
227,Mr CONROY,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I trust that the committee will adhere to the principle - of imposing ad valorem instead of fixed - duties, and that they will make no exception in favour of any particular firm or firms.

228,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," ! move That the words "" sewing machines"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" sewing machine heads."" The sewing machine head is really the machine itself, and what I propose is that the cabinet-table and stand shall be dutiable. These articles are made largely in New South Wales, and I have consistently voted for New South Wales industries. Since the Government included sewing machines in the free list, the industry has been shut down, and it is one which employs a considerable amount of labour, and paysgood wages. I do not propose that the machine itself shall be subject to duty, but I appeal to the committee, in the interests of an industry which has been, and can be, car24 ried on successfully within the Common25 wealth, to put a reasonable duty of 15 per cent, upon sewing-machine cabinets and stands. A YES.",49
229,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I feel certain the committee will not agree to this amendment unless the honourable member for Melbourne Ports gives us some information in support of it . He says that this industry is carried on in New South Wales. We knew that before. I understood him to say also that, owing to sewing-machine stands being included in the exemption list, the industry has been shut down. I ask any honourable member whether it is likely that an industry which has existed for many years absolutely without any protection NOES. is likely to be shut down because duty has had to be paid upon some of the materials used in connection with it during the last few months ? I venture to say that this proposal is an outrageous one ; hut if the honourable member could show that the industry had suffered by reason of the imposition of duties upon the materials used, I should he prepared to support him. What are the raw materials of the industry which are taxed ? The cast-iron stands are made here, and there is then only the wood-work, the handle, a hinge or two, and some varFAIRS. nish. I have taken the trouble to make a calculation, and I find that a gallon of varnish is sufficient for 48 of these sewingmachine tables-that is to say, £d. per table. The cover handles cost 3d. each, the lockplates cost 3d., the cover key costs I d . , and the hinges and lock together cost 9d. The total duty would amount to 3£d., and with £d. for the varnish, the total per table would be 4d. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports says that this industry is going to be ruined because of a duty of id. upon each table, and he asks ns to put a duty upon these stands in order to enable Beale and Co. to avoid the payment of this duty. I should like to ask the honourable member whether the wood used is Australian wood 1",49
230,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I do not know ; some of it may be.,50
231,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"This is the only thing the honourable member has said he does not know since we have been here. I believe it is Australian wood that is used ; but whether it is or not, the honourable member has consistently voted against every attempt to make the admission of similar woods free. I have shown that the duty payable upon the whole of the materials necessary to make one of these sewingmachine tables amounts to 4d., and I ask honourable members not to agree to the amendment.",50
232,Mr WILKS,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," The article.the honourable member is so concerned about is mode by a factory within the confines of my electorate. The honourable - member f o West Sydney put a strong case before the committee when he showed that the amount .misstatement. of duty involved is only 4d. per table. have here a document sent to me Cabinet Makers' Association of New South Wales. They lament the fact that the duties already imposed do not assist them, and they want some protection for sewinghe machine stands. They sayIn the first place we wish to emphasize the fact that ns the Federal Tariff stands at it practically penalizes the production tralian goods. Taking, for instance, the cabinet work of sewing machines, we find them included under the free list, while the raw material, such as timber, glue, methylated spirits, with only one exception, namely, veneer, is heavily taxed. I may say that I voted to have all those articles admitted free, but if the Ministry imposes a tax upon them, it is not my duty as a free-trader to fall into the mesh vote for the protection of the finished article. It has not been the fault of the Opposition that these taxes have been placed upon the, raw material, and with respect to this Tariff I will use the words of the Cabinet Makers' Association. They - sayI t will thus be seen what an injurious effect upon a large number of our men this Tariff blunder will cause, and so strong is the feeling about it that we send you the following resolutions. That is a statement of the feeling of the Cabinet Makers' Association of New South Wales, and while I regret as a free-trader that I cannot support their resolutions, I must vote against this amendment.",50
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I have heard some statements made during the last few minutes which I think must have been made under an absolute misconception. I heard the honourable member for West Sydney make the statement that the duty upon these parts of sewing-machines would amount only to 4d. That is an absolute misstatement. I have taken the trouble to find out for myself, and I find that the duty would amount to 5s. or 6s. Mr 'HUGHES - On what ?",50
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"What is the use of talking nonsense? The honourable member has got his lesson from some one outside, who ought not to be allowed to prevent members entering this chamber.",50
235,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,I rise to a point of order. r The .honourable gentleman has stated that I have been guilty of making a deliberate He must simply accept I what I have said until he can bring some by the evidence to disprove it .,50
236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The honourable member has no right to charge me in the manner he has done, with having said that made a deliberate misstatement. What I said was that his statement must have been made .under a misconception, and present that he had been receiving information of Ausfrom a certain person who stands around the door, and who should not be allowed to prevent members coming into the chamber varnish, &c; in the way in which he does.",50
237,Mr HUGHES,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," I am not going to have.my source of information spoken of in that way. I got my information from a reliable source, and I know precisely where the honourable member got his. and He got it from a manufacturer who is in",50
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL," The honourable member questions my statement that the duty amounts to 5s. or 6s .but I have taken the trouble to see these sswingmachine frames made, and to inquire into the process of manufacture. However, as I understand that the Treasurer -'wants to get away, I shall have a few words to say on this subject tomorrow. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - I understood that the intention was that we should finish the recommittals this evening, and I maintain that a loyal dispositiou to carry out that intention has been exhibited by honourable members on this side.",50
239,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Nothin g of the kind.,51
240,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I differ from the honourable member. The honourable member for West Sydney entered into details, showing the exact duty upon item after item of the various things which go to make' up a sewing-machine frame, and the Home Secretary questioned his statement. Is the Minister prepared to refute the statement'of the honourable member for West Sydney line by line ?",51
241,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"I think that honourable members have been endeavouring to get on with the work, but we hove not progressed as fast as I should have liked. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Then why not finish before we adjourn t",51
242,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"Because the strain upon Ministers is very heavy, and I know that the Treasurer. feels it severely. We meet early to morrow, and I ask' honourable members to assist us in finishing the recommittals then, so that the second reading of the Tariff Bill may be moved, and the leader of the Opposition may have an opportunity to make the speech which he desires to make upon it . Sir EDWARD BRADDON. - Has the leader of the Opposition agreed to that course ?",51
243,Mr KINGSTON,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,He has.,51
244,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Macquarie) I understood that the leader of the Opposition thought that we might go on further to-night t,51
245,Mr MAUGER,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,Then why does not the honourable member let us go on 1,51
246,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,WESTERNAUSTRALIAN POSTAL,"The members of the Opposition have .exercised what are their legitimate rights. Th.ey have not spoken at great length, but they have been forced to reply to the arguments of honourable"" gentlemen opposite. There has certainly been no obstruction. Progress reported.
