SKILLING AUSTRALIA'S WORKFORCE BILL 2005 Cognate bill: SKILLING AUSTRALIA'S WORKFORCE (REPEAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 June, on motion by Mr Hardgrave: That the bill be now read a second time.",17
3,Mr HAYES,BUSINESS,"Werriwa) (9.02 am)Before the debate was adjourned last evening I was explaining both my involvement in the process of reform and my involvement in the National Training Authority, both of which are primarily based on increasing the portability of skills between occupations and across industries. In the 1990s I was appointed by the Australian National Training Authority-ANTA, as it is known-to a panel to judge the quality of training programs. My role was to identify training initiatives which were best practice, to recognise who was doing things well and to work out ways in which these programs and initiatives may be extended-in other words, to work out how you could take tried and tested and successful programs and use them to enhance the skills and development of youth and employees to the benefit of themselves and their employers to produce more productive employees. Later I became the independent chair of Manufacturing Learning Australia. MLA was aimed at enhancing the productivity of Australian manufacturing and the promotion of learning across occupational groups by helping to develop and recognise workplace orskills. In this capacity I worked with all groups involved in vocational education, from employers to unions and from individual workers to group training companies, and of course with the government agencies, including ANTA. With the financial support of the Australian National Training Authority my role with Manufacturing Learning Australia included the development of training packages in the hydrocarbon, oil refining and chemical industries as well as plastic, glass and cement manufacturing. The training packages developed were aimed at recognising the skills that were portable across a range of industries, in an effort to reduce duplication in training, and skill development to help achieve some cost savings through economies of scale. Although these industries were across diverse areas it was found that commonality existed and that consistent training packages could be developed and introduced across many of these industries. Similarly, in my period with the Police Federation of Australia. I was involved with a body that established and identified common skills in areas such as public safety. Again, while they were seemingly highly independent industries with often vastly differing skill sets, we were able to identify a number of common skills for police, fire and emergency services as well as the Australian military. As a result, again with the support of ANTA, we saw the introduction of training packages for these common skills across the occupational groups and the formal recognition of these skills. I mention these experiences not simply to indicate a degree of knowledge of the area but to lend weight to the important work that ANTA was involved in and the initiatives and reforms that it has assisted. The area of training and reform that I have been associated with has had a dual purpose-namely, to increase the quality of training and portability of qualifications while, importantly for business, achieving economies in training costs. This brings some context to the debate and begs the question as to why these bills have been introduced. The Australian National Training Authority has been successful and has achieved significant reforms. The abolition of ANTA from 1 July is not about skills development, it is not about the government acting decisively in an effort to alleviate pressures on business created by the skills shortage and it is certainly not about a commitment to VET. This is about ministerial control. VET has a history of being the poor cousin in the education family. I know that ANTA has worked tirelessly to raise the profile of VET, and now we have ANTA being subsumed by the Department of Education, Science and Training. I have grave concerns that VET will again be relegated to the status of a second-class citizen in the education and training bureaucracy as the department continues to focus on schools and universities. However, this is not my only concern about these bills. As I said earlier, the devil is in the detail. In this case the comes in the form of the statutory conditions which must be complied with before financial grants will be made available. In my first speech in this place I took the opportunity to outline my concerns about the government's industrial relations agenda. It would ordinarily seem odd, in speaking on bills on vocational education and training, that my mind would turn to industrial relations, but the statutory conditions associated with the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 give me that opportunity. Once again the government has sought to piggyback its industrial relations agenda onto unrelated bills. Once again the government could not resist the opportunity of using a carrot and stick approach to force its industrial relations agenda down people's throats. And once again it has attached industrial relations conditions to financial assistance grants. Under the provisions of this legislation a condition which must be complied with for financial assistance is the implementation of workplace reforms. TAFE colleges will be required, under these bills, to introduce more flexible arrangements, including AWAs where constitutionally possible and other forms of individual contracts where TAFE colleges are ineligible for Australian workplace agreements. I strongly support Labor's amendments to break the connection that these bills seek to create between vocational education and training and the continuation of the government's industrial relations agenda. Let us keep education funding and industrial relations quite separate. It is interesting that the government has only recently sought to make up for the inadequate response to Australia's skills shortage. It is interesting because the skills shortages that we are experiencing are not simply detail the product of a buoyant economy or low unemployment, as the government would have people believe. The skills shortages that businesses are experiencing are the result of a lack of commitment to vocational education and training by this government over many years and a continual decline in business investment in training. During the election campaign the government set about trying to hide behind economic management and employment growth as reasons that we are experiencing skills shortages. In fact, that was the excuse used in the first line of the Minister for Education, Science and Training's media release on 26 September 2004 entitled ‘Building our trades-skilling Australia's workforce for the future'. In that media release the minister claimed that the government had: ... an integrated and comprehensive plan to ensure that the value of the trades is enhanced as a path. The document goes on to outline the government's policies on vocational education and training, including such things as the creation of new training colleges, the provision of new learning scholarships, the establishment of a network of industry careers advisers and, of course, the provision of an $800 tool kit for apprentices. At no time did it make mention of the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority and at no time did it make mention of financial assistance being tied to the extension of workplace reforms and the introduction of Australian workplace agreements within the TAFE system. In fact, the first time this plan was mentioned was when the Howard government ministry was sworn in on 22 October 2004. I find it interesting that the plan that the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education in his second reading speech referred to as ‘the most significant piece of legislation for vocational and technical education in the past 15 years' did not rate a mention until well after the election. It did not rate a mention until the government realised that the $800 tool kit for apprentices was not going to solve the skills crisis. It did not rate a mention until the government realised that it could attach its industrial relations agenda to yet another bill providing financial assistance in an area that has been overlooked for funding for quite some periodan area that has been desperately in need of financial assistance. What is more surprising is that the announcement of such a significant change was made without any consultation. In fact, during Senate estimates hearings last year, the Department of Education, Science and Training even admitted that it did not have a role in the decision to scrap the Australian National Training Authority. As Pat Forward, career the Australian Education Union's TAFE secretary, said: It's perplexing that people who have been at the forefront of vocational education for 15 yearsstate education departments, TAFEs, unions, small business-weren't involved in these decisions. I also find it particularly interesting that, in the most significant change that vocational education and training has seen in 15 years, we now see the needs of students seemingly taking the back seat. In my experience with the development of training systems, the focus has been on the benefit to those being trained. I do not deny that the initiatives I have personally been associated with have resulted in cost savings, but first and foremost they have resulted in training improvements. They have been driven by a business need-a need to have high-quality training in order to produce better, more adaptable and more productive employees. However, the most significant change in vocational education and training in the last 15 years has turned this approach on its head. I do not deny that the needs of business are an important consideration. Any change and reform to education and training should not be driven solely by a desire for a quick-fix, enterprise-specific solution. The considerations of business should be seen in the light of having well-trained, high-quality and highly skilled employees well into the future. I absolutely want more training places for young people. In my electorate, the second largest occupational grouping is tradespeople and those in trade related industries. There are thousands of tradespeople in Werriwa. In fact, two of them are my sons-one an electrician and the other a carpenter. I am completely indebted to those TAFE teachers, themselves highly skilled tradespersons, who have educated and mentored my sons. And there are plenty of other people in Werriwa, both at school and just out of school, who would like nothing more than the opportunity to attend TAFE and gain trade qualifications. They want to become tradespeople. They are among the 270,000 people who have missed out on TAFE positions since 1998. However, there is one thing they do not want-that is, to study and work hard to obtain their qualification only to find out in a couple of years time that, because theirs is one of the fast-tracked, enterprise-specific qualifications, it is somehow considered to be of lesser quality than those qualifications obtained in a more staged and traditional manner. People in my electorate are finding it increasingly difficult to believe that everything is fine on the economic horizon. In the main, they have yet to significantly share in and experience the great job growth that the government trumpets almost daily. The unemployment rate in Werriwa remains just below seven per cent and youth unemployment remains around 24 per cent. My constituents want more training positions, but they do not want to see training places and a curriculum drafted specifically for a quick fix to an immediate enterprise condition. I am sure that all members of this House want an extension of training opportunities. I certainly want them for my constituents. People want the skills shortage addressed-businesses want it addressed, the government wants it addressed, and those who have missed out on TAFE places due to funding cuts want it addressed so they can have the opportunity to fully participate in the jobs market. Let us increase funding to vocational education and training. Let us increase the number of people who will be able to gain skills and qualifications that allow them to seek and find employment. Let us increase the number of people with relevant, high-quality skills that will last them well into the future. Let us not get caught up in the trap of trying to cut corners to overcome an immediate skills shortage. If we are going to do it, let us do it right. Let us build the skilled work force that Australia needs to participate in a global economy, and let us do it without attaching industrial relations reforms to measures in a bid to force an ideologically driven agenda on people. I support the extension of funding for vocational education and training and my constituents support that extension. But, more importantly, I support Labor's commitment to remove the connection between education funding and the government's industrial relations agenda. The government should not be seeking every opportunity to hold to ransom key expenditure areas, especially those previously deprived of funding, in a bid to prop up its industrial relations agenda.",17
4,Mr RUDD,BUSINESS,"The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 brings to a head two of the great debates for our country's future: firstly, the future of the Federation and, secondly, whether in fact our national vocational education training system has any future at all. The bill is the latest manifestation of what we should describe as the new centralism of the Howard government. The Hawke and Keating governments believed in cooperative federalism. Labor premiers like Wran, Cain and Goss had no intention of surrendering their legitimate rights to Canberra, nor did federal Labor governments try to bludgeon or blackmail them into doing so. The Hawke and Keating governments worked effectively with them, and also worked wherever possible with conservative state governments-or at least the more sensible of them, such as the Greiner and Fahey governments in New South Wales. In an earlier life I had something to do at an official level with the new federalism ject of both the Hawke and Keating governments. For nearly five years I was the Queensland government representative on the national steering committee of the Special Premiers Conference, or what later became known as COAG-the Council of Australian Governments. During that period officials, premiers and prime ministers-Labor and Liberal; state, territory and Commonwealth-did some good work collectively for the country's future. We agreed on such national projects as the mutual recognition of quality standards for goods, services and professional qualifications across the federation. We agreed on such national projects as national competition policy. We agreed on such national projects as the national Asian languages and studies strategy for Australian schools. None of these agreements were easy. They involved long-term negotiations that were often protracted, often difficult, often acrimonious-but all ultimately centred on the states and the territories and the Commonwealth's views of the national interest. It was cooperative federalism at its and those who study the federalism project well in this country would agree that the period in the first half of the nineties represented some of the best achievements we have had in the federation's history in terms of cooperative federal undertakings in the national interest. One of the best examples of this approach was the 1992 legislation establishing the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, as the coordinating body for a national training system: a strong, independent, tripartite body supported by the Commonwealth and state governments, industry and the trade unions and funded to provide broad based advice to the entire sector. The bills were introduced into this House by the current Leader of the Opposition, who was then Minister for Employment, Education and pro- Training. The Labor government saw even then, 13 years ago, that Australia would face an increasing demand for vocational training and education in terms of what sort of work force we would need for the future and that active measures would need to be taken in order to meet that future demand-in cooperation with the states, in cooperation with the private sector, in cooperation with the unions. The result was a legislative package that met the needs of all parties and that, on the whole, has served Australia well. ANTA came into being as a compromise between the Commonwealth and the states. The Keating government initially proposed a wholesale Commonwealth takeover of TAFE. The states rejected that proposal. Instead, a number of us at officials level were commissioned by the Prime Minister and by premiers to fashion a compromise, to fashion something which would still achieve national outcomes in the national interest but which would not see the surrender of TAFE and training from the states to the Commonwealth. We sought to create a model which best, would guarantee a minimum maintenance of effort on the part of the states, guarantee some $720 million of Commonwealth growth funding and, through a national policy body comprised of the Commonwealth and the states, set national training priorities, given the country's future work force needs. This, again, was cooperative federalism at its best. This was created 13 years ago because the Keating government, in partnership with the states and territories, and in the midst of difficult economic times, recognised that this nation needed a long-term, genuinely national strategy for meeting the economy's long-term skills requirements. The model recognised the role of non-TAFE providers. It was not some sort of state-centric monolith; it recognised the multiplicity of service delivery models. But it also recognised that because education, training and skills development is a public good-even within the context of classical neoliberal economic frameworks-there is a core role for government to provide long-term planning, policy direction and, most critically, funding. This is because we on our side of politics have the audacity to believe in something called nation building, that public goods do not spontaneously combust out of the air, that there is a core continuing role for government and that the role of the state is not just some sort of conservative minimalism which says basically that it all stops and starts with the defence of the state or the maintenance of public order at home. We are proud of the fact that we believe in nation building in which government has a core role to play-government and the robust provision of public goods creating the conditions and circumstances where market forces can then unleash their creativity, enterprise and productive force. That is how you grow a country, not by taking the meat axe to programs like the Australian National Training Authority, as this government has already done in other fields of education endeavour including higher education, first by incrementally and then decisively effectively withdrawing from the field. Let us face the facts: the core ideology the government, as demonstrated by what it has done rather than by what it says that doing, is the withdrawal of the Commonwealth's funding role in education and training. This government has never articulated a nation-building role for itself in this sector, and I believe history will damn it for that, as it will damn this Minister for Education, Science and Training as one of the worse in the country's history. What we have at present in the approach to this bill is a triumph of conservative ideology over the needs of Australian nation building. Also it is a triumph over the basic dictums of common sense. Businesses around the country are demanding a greater, not a lesser, role from government when it comes to the planning, funding and delivery of education and training programs. How does this bill in any concrete sense actually respond to the national skills crisis which has been documented by the OECD, the Reserve Bank of Australia and various Australian peak industry bodies? The government's response is simple: vacate the field. That is not a policy; that is an instrument of surrender presided over by a piece of, unfortunately, wasted space when it comes to the level of policy advice which is provided to the government on these matters through the minister and his office. Unfortunately, when it comes to this debate, the minister has been primarily preoccupied with other matters. Perhaps those other matters include his interest in becoming deputy leader of his party. But while his eye has been off the ballMr Hardgrave-Thank you for the promotion, and I can't say I was planning to do that. But thank you for the promotion.",20
5,Mr RUDD,BUSINESS,"Not you, Minister. Mr Hardgrave-I'm the minister in charge of these bills.",22
6,Mr RUDD,BUSINESS,"No, you are the junior minisof ter for someone who actually runs the show. Mr Hardgrave-You've been trying to it is promote me. Thanks for the promotion!",22
7,Mr RUDD,BUSINESS,"You are the junior minister to someone who actually runs the show and whose eye is completely off the ball. In fact, the systemic problem of the government at the moment, Minister, is that so many of you have your eye off the ball. You have got the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the minister for education all wrapped up in the internal leadership brawl of your own party. It is going on around the building all the time. When it comes, however, to core questions of the nation's long-term policy needs, including those of education, skills and training, what we find is that 50 per cent or more of this government's energies are now dedicated and directed to and distracted by the internal political game, not focused on the core challenges of government: your portfolio responsibilities and the need in particular for nation building in the skills and training sector. The Prime Minister, in a casual aside in a press release, unilaterally announced the abolition of ANTA and the national system of vocational training which the 1992 legislation established. Unlike Labor in 1992, this government consulted no-one, certainly not the state governments and other stakeholders in the vocational education and training sector who are vitally affected by this legislation. This was apparently because the Prime Minister has decided that, for reasons of administrative convenience, he wants ANTA abolished by 1 July 2005. It is just neater doing it that way, it seems. If this was to be achieved then the legislation had to be drafted and introduced very quickly with no time for consultation. In other words, the primary consideration here has been political, not one related to education or the economic purposes of what should be the case with legislation of this nature. No coherent reason has been given for the abolition of ANTA. There has been no formal critique of its work or analysis of its outcomes. The real reason is simply that ANTA, which was deliberately created to operate on the basis of cooperation between the various sectors, was an impediment to the minister's desire to run everything himself and impose an ideological agenda on this area. He has already sought to impose it on schools and universities. This government thinks it knows best about everything, consistent with its new centralist approach that no-one else has an opinion that is worth listening to, even in areas in which the Constitution clearly places the domain within the states. This bill is typical of the style which this government and the minister responsible to it has demonstrated in its new centralist, not new federalist, approach. The Prime Minister and the minister have made much of the $4.4 billion they say they are putting into training over the 2005-08 triennium. But, in fact, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out in her speech in the second reading debate, this not only is half a billion less than the Prime Minister promised during the election campaign but is almost entirely made up of existing money rebadged and recycled. There is very little new money on offer here. A shake-up of the vocational training system might have been justified if its objective was to address Australia's looming national skills crisis, but this bill is not based on any acceptance by the government that Australia is facing a critical shortage of skilled labour. The Minister for Vocational and Technical Education assured us in his second reading speech that there is limited evidence of economy-wide skills shortages. In fact, there is plenty of evidence of economy-wide skills shortages: look at the Reserve Bank, the OECD and other authorities. The government has thus achieved the remarkable feat of introducing a major piece of new legislation which demolishes an existing, and on balance successful, system while not addressing the skills crisis confronting the overall economy. This legislation is conceptually bereft. I turn briefly to some of the more objectionable elements of the legislation. The government is using the bill also as another vehicle for imposing its ideological agenda in industrial relations. The abolition of ANTA means that Commonwealth funding to the states and territories for vocational education or educational facilities such as TAFE colleges will now come directly from the Department of Education, Science and Training and will thus be under the direct supervision of the minister. The bill provides that grants cannot be made to a state unless there is a Commonwealth-state agreement in place and it stipulates that such agreements must be concluded during 2005. Given that it is already June and that this bill has not yet been to the Senate, this means that the Commonwealth will be saying to the states at the end of the year, ‘Sign this agreement now or you get no funding.' This, we think again, is symptomatic of new centralism, not new federalism. We also see this being used as a vehicle to introduce the government's industrial relations changes into the system as they have sought to do through the university sector as well. Australian workplace agreements have been complete failures in the operation of the industrial relations system more generally beyond the education sector. After nine years of vigorous promotion by this government, only three per cent of Australian workers are on AWAs, not all of them willingly. Furthermore, clause 12 of the bill makes a condition of grant that provides for aMr Abbott- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",22

9,Unknown,BUSINESS,Opposition members interjecting,24
10,Mr RUDD,BUSINESS,"It seems that the minister wishes to close down the debate. If we look at the bill as a whole-there are two projects before us: how is this a vehicle through which you seek to construct a new federalism of the states, and what are you doing through this bill to construct something which meets the nation's future skill requirements?-we see in the bill, and the ideology underpinning the bill, no evidence of a coherent or constructive approach. From our perspective, and from a perspective of nation building, we do not believe that this is the right way to go. We urge the government to reconsider its approach and, more broadly, reconsider its approach across the field to its new ideological enterprise otherwise badged as the new centralism. The bill should be opposed.",24

18,Mr HARDGRAVE,NOES,"Moreton-Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (9.59 am)-I move government amendment (1) as circulated: (1) Clause 12, page 12 (line 6), omit ‘that will enable government funding to be reduced'. Following the introduction of the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 into this House on 11 May this year, this amendment corrects a drafting error in clause 12 of the bill, specifically paragraph 12(1)(f). The Australian government is seeking reforms in TAFE institutions to ensure that they become more entrepreneurial and commercially oriented, but due to a drafting error the paragraph did not properly reflect this government's intention, so this amendment is to correct the record. The government's commitment to vocational and technical education cannot be questioned. This commitment includes an offer of almost $5 billion to the states and territories for the period July 2005 to December 2008. This is the greatest commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australia's history, and it represents a substantial injection of funds for the state and territory governments who run the institutions that provide technical and Hockey, JB further education around this country. These proposed reforms will not penalise TAFE institutes but they will provide them with greater autonomy so that they can better respond to local industry and business and community training needs. If we are to reform Australia's national training system, it is absolutely essential to see the reform of TAFE, which currently delivers 85 per cent of publicly funded training. I submit the amendment to the House.",28

Bill read a third time. NA COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA'S SKILLS NEEDS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Hardgrave: That the bill be now read a second time.",34
30,Ms MACKLIN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Jagajaga) (10.37 am)The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005 provides for the establishment and operation of the government's proposed Australian technical colleges. These were announced during the election campaign. The announcement fed two needs for the Howard government at the time. One was its insatiable desire to attack the state and territory governments, to try and circumvent the state and territory governments' constitutional role. This time the battlefront was education and training. In his announcement, the Prime Minister lauded the system, saying that the colleges would ‘operate independently of the State education system'. As we now see, with the implementation of this announcement, the reality is somewhat different. The Prime Minister has had to recognise that the states and territories register schools and are responsible for curriculum. We have had to have a big backdown on that ridiculous rhetoric. The other objective of the government during the election campaign was to finally appear to be doing something about Australia's worsening skills crisis. This proposal comes from a government that unfortunately, even in the minister's latest comments, still refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the skills crisis that our country faces. The Prime Minister said that the new colleges were designed to ‘accelerate national skills development in traditional trades'. The government's definition of accelerated skills development includes waiting until 2010-it is going to take that long-before we have a handful of colleges producing their first qualified tradespersons. If that is accelerated development, I would hate to see this government taking its time. Mr Crean-That's doing it in a crisis.",35
31,Ms MACKLIN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,That is right. SomehowMs Gambaro-At least we're doing something.,36
32,Ms MACKLIN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"The parliamentary secretary at the table says that this is doing something. If this is doing something, it is a disaster. You are right: it is a disaster, and it is a disaster of this government's own making. This government has been here for nine long years. We know what a disaster it is. It is a disaster because this government refuses to properly fund TAFE and refuses to make sure that there are enough opportunities for young people to get apprenticeships. Ms Gambaro-Talk to businesses.",36
33,Ms MACKLIN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Labor does talk to businesses. It is this government that has created this skills crisis, created the problems that business confronts today. As a result of this legislation which is in the parliament right now, there will not be an additional tradesperson for business-for business, Parliamentary Secretary-until 2010. That is how long business is going to have to wait for this government to actually do something. Our position on these technical colleges has been very clear. We believe that they duplicate existing world-class programs and infrastructure in our TAFEs and schools. We believe that the government should invest in what is already in place, what is already working-building on what we have rather than reinventing the wheel. We will not stand in the way of the technical colleges, because any action-any final action after nine long years-is better than the Howard government continuing to do nothing. We will support the bill in the parliament, but our support should not be mistaken for uncritical and unquestioning support of this technical college proposal. We question the motivation for the Australian technical colleges and we still have very many unanswered questions about implementation. We have tried to get answers to questions through Senate estimates. I will ask some of the questions again here today. I hope that when the minister sums up at the end of this debate he will answer some of them. One of the critical problems is that Australia has a skills crisis. We do have a skills crisis, and we have a skills crisis because this government has stripped our TAFEs of revenue for the last nine years. We need action now, not in 2010. That is why I move the second reading amendment which is being circulated in my name: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) creating a skills crisis through its continued failure to provide the necessary opportunities during their nine long years in office for Australians to get the training they need to get a decent job and meet the skills needs of the economy; (2) failing to train enough Australians in areas of skill shortage and relying on skilled migration; (3) exacerbating this crisis by failing to introduce Budget measures to train more Australians now, including Labor's Trade Completion Bonus for traditional apprentices; (4) making Australian business wait until 2010 for the Technical Colleges to produce their first qualified tradesperson; (5) failing to double the number of school-based traditional apprentices and provide extra funding to support schools in taking up the places; (6) failing to further invest in our world-class school and TAFE systems to create opportunities for young Australians to access high quality vocational education and training at all schools, not just 24 Australian Technical Colleges; (7) its uncooperative and hostile attitude towards the States and Territories in establishing these Colleges, despite the central role the States and Territories will play in any successful operation; (8) failing to provide new support to other regions that also have high youth unemployment, an industry base and skill shortages, but are not listed for a Technical College; (9) inappropriately using vocational education and training as a vehicle through which to drive their ideological industrial relations agenda which bears no relation to successful student outcomes”. Mr Crean-I second the amendment.",36
34,Ms MACKLIN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"As I say, we need action on this skills crisis now, not in 2010. The lack of skilled workers has emerged as a critical issue for the Australian economy, and it is a crisis of this government's own making-a crisis born of the fact that it has provided inadequate investment in Australia's skills base during its very long time in office. I will go through a few facts, because I can see that those on the other side are already getting agitated. We have a shortage of skilled people because this government has actually cut education and training investment since coming to office. An OECD report this month found-people should take this into account; it is the OECD saying this-that Australia had one of the largest declines in public investment in universities and TAFEs of any OECD country. We dropped by 8.7 per cent while the majority of our competitors increased their investment. That is the reality; that is what this government has done; that is why we have such a serious skills crisis. We are one of only seven OECD nations to actually reduce government funding for tertiary education per student between 1995 and 2001. What an extraordinary achievement by this government. That is what has created the skills crisis. The Howard government missed the opportunity to reform Australia's education and training system to address the skills shortage. From the time it was elected, it confused cutting education investment with real reform. It is no wonder we have a serious shortage of skilled workers that is hurting Australian businesses. The parliamentary secretary is right: it is hurting Australian businesses very and badly. Who has been in government running this system for the last nine years? None other than the Howard government. Unfortunately, though, we do have a federal minister who still does not seem to get it. Only a month ago in this House the Minister for Vocational and Technical Educationhis head always, ever present, in the sandoutrageously claimed that there is limited evidence of economy wide skills shortages. So maybe the parliamentary secretary should suggest to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education that he talk to a few businesses and get the picture about how serious the situation is. Obviously the minister has not got the message that the parliamentary secretary has, and the minister also has not heard the warnings being shouted by everyone from the Reserve Bank to the OECD. Our economy needs action now. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia personally told the minister that it had $44 billion worth of civil and mining earthworks in the pipeline but had been forced to shelve projects because of the skills shortage. According to the government's own Skills at work report released this year, in 2001-02-get this, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick-just 0.7 per cent of all the Howard government's training expenditure was in the mining area. No wonder they have got serious skills shortages. What we say is that the government should be training more Australians in areas of need right now. Unfortunately that is not their intention. It certainly has not been their track record. You only have to look at their actions over the last nine years, because they speak for themselves. When the government were first elected they demonstrated their attitude towards skills development, and they have held true to form ever since. These are the facts: the government, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer, slashed $240 million out of the VET sector in its first two budgets in 1996 and 1997. These are the facts. This was swiftly followed by the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement, which abolished-let the parliamentary secretary know-growth funding altogether and froze funding to the sector for the next three years. Is it any wonder that we now face a skills shortage? These funding cuts and the subsequent freeze have meant that more and more TAFE colleges have had to close some of their training facilities, putthem. ting many teachers and, of course, students in our TAFEs under enormous pressure. They have threatened the quality of training and skills development in this country. At the same time that we had a federal government cutting funds in 1996-97 and freezing funds for the next three years, we had businesses crying out for skilled staff. We also know that there is a major shortage of TAFE places. This is the direct result of this federal government's education and training policy. This skills shortage has developed under this government's watch. Noone else is to blame. Of course no doubt all the government's speakers will try and blame someone else-that is their usual effort. They should look at their history: they cut funding in 1996 and 1997 and they froze funding for the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement. This is what happened. This is why we have a skills crisis. No-one else is to blame. The government has refused to provide any growth funding for more TAFE places through the Commonwealth-state training authority for six of the last nine years. They are the facts. That is why we have a skills crisis. Its current offer for a new Commonwealth-state funding agreement-the skilling Australia's work force agreement, as it will be known-contains very little that is new. So what has been the approach of the government, given they have been cutting funding for training and freezing it? Instead, this government has had the approach of taking an imported skills quick fix. Since 1998 we have had a massive increase in the number of skilled migrants. One hundred and seventyeight thousand extra skilled migrants have been brought into this country while, at the same time as all those skilled migrants were being brought into Australia, 270,000 Australians were turned away from TAFE. Ms Gambaro-Talk about international skills shortages, Jenny-everyone's got",37
35,Ms MACKLIN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"So we have got the reality of this government bringing in lots and lots of extra skilled migrants-178,000 extra skilled migrants-while at the same time turning 270,000 Australians away from TAFE. The parliamentary secretary at the table says there is an international skills shortage. If that is the case, we should be pulling our weight. We should not be turning 270,000 Australians away from TAFE, which is exactly what this government has done. Instead of action over the last nine years, we have now got the government introducing these new technical colleges. We know that they were dreamt up on the run during the last election campaign, announced with very scant detail. Only now is the government actually figuring out how they might be implemented. If we just look at some of the confusions and contradictions, they certainly demonstrate that the government had no idea about how the colleges would work. The government has proposed 24 colleges that apparently will be in operation by 2008. It intends that each college will accommodate up to 300 year 11 and 12 students, so a total of 7,200 when fully operational. Implementation will be phased in from 2006. The first question everyone would want to know is: how much will it cost? Unfortunately, that seems to depend on who you ask and when. It was estimated that to operate these technical colleges right across Australia it would cost $289 million over four yearsthat was back in September 2004, when the government announced the policy during the election campaign. But a couple of weeks after that the department of finance obviously had a look at the proposal, and the figure they thought it would cost was $273 million over the same period. So that is two estimates of cost. Part 3 of this bill details latest figures the government have come up with to fund their technical colleges. The bill reveals that the government will be spending $33 million less over the next three years than they promised during the election. So the figure now is $255 million in the four financial years ending 2007-08. Far from delivering the skills that Australian businesses need to deal with today's crisis, businesses will have to wait until 2010 for the first skilled tradesperson to come out of these technical colleges, and the government will spend $33 million less than it promised during the election campaign. The government is characterising the extra out years included in the budget's forward estimates, which were not included in its election policy, as a $343 million initiative. However, it is always very important with this government to compare apples with apples to see whether, in fact, it is keeping its word-and no-one on this side of the House is surprised that it is not. Another interesting footnote of detail that the government keeps quiet about is its admission in the budget papers that funding for the technical colleges will more than have to just over $49 million in 2010-11. So the government will outlay less than it promised during the election-apparently the colleges will be costing less-but what has it said about the cost to students? We have a whole range of different views on that. We on this side of the House certainly know what the government's form is like when it comes to student fees. Certainly, since it came to office, it has nearly doubled fees for university students, and that does not even take into account the latest fee rises facing most university students this year. What does the government intend for students in these technical colleges? Once again, the answer seems to depend on who the you ask and when. Perhaps, you would say, the most authoritative place to start is with the Prime Minister. He promised during the election campaign that no fees would be charged at the technical colleges-‘no fees'. That is what he said during the election campaign. The Minister for Education, Science and Training verified it in this chamber on 7 December 2004, when he said: ... as was stated throughout the election campaign, as has been stated by the Prime Minister, as has been stated by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and as has been stated by methat is, the minister for educationthere will be no fees applying in the technical colleges. That seems pretty plain, doesn't it? He says ‘no fees'. But that clear statement was subject to immediate and, you would have to say, pretty panicky qualification by the vocational and technical education minister, who began talking about ‘no additional fees' being charged at these technical colleges. But what does that mean? To what does ‘no additional fees' refer? What reference point should families use to determine whether the fees charged by an Australian technical college are in addition to what it already charges? Certainly, the department has not been able to shed any light on this issue. I would appreciate it if we could get a clear answer from the minister when he sums up at the end of this debate. Earlier in the year, the department did admit before a Senate estimates committee that fees for technical colleges, as with other nongovernment schools, could range from nominal levels up to much more expensive levels, depending on the school; nor, again according to the department, is it said or implied that these fees will be charged at the same levels they are charged at TAFE colleges. Therefore, one would need to imply further that that is the case with private trainbate, ing organisations. Once again, if the minister could clarify all of this, it would be helpful. But none of this touches on the fees that will be charged at greenfield sites-colleges that are newly built and not part of any preexisting fee reference point. We want to know what fees will be charged at these new technical colleges, the ones that do not have any association with existing schools or TAFEs. We have had no guidance whatsoever on the parameters for these colleges or on the levels of fees they can or cannot charge. Two weeks ago in Senate estimates, we were told that the fees would not be capped. We would certainly appreciate the minister, at the end of this debate, clarifying these issues. Unfortunately, he did not clarify them during his second reading speech, so I am sure that the students who are thinking of going to these colleges would appreciate it if he did so. It would be helpful also if the minister could shed some light on the confusion about whether or not the technical colleges will be able to turn a profit. In his discussion paper earlier in the year, the minister stated that the technical colleges would be required to run on a non-profit basis. But this seemed to be news to the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, which told the Australian Financial Review that any provider, whether private or public, would expect to make a profit from the government's technical colleges. It said: It would need to be a commercial arrangement ... where there needs to be the opportunity to cover costs and have a return for the operator ... So, according to the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, many potential providers will not operate a college unless they can make a profit through student fees. Once again, if that is the reality-if they are to be not for profit-perhaps the minister could clarify it at the end of the debecause obviously it will cut out many providers. It looks as though the Howard government's takeover at this stage will make getting a trade much more expensive. We would also like some answers as to where exactly these technical colleges will be located. The minister has indicated that announcements on successful proposals for colleges that will open in 2006 will be made by the end of July, with announcements regarding colleges to open in 2007 and 2008 to be made by the end of this year. But nobody has been able to tell us how many will open in 2006. I cannot see why that should be confidential information. The minister must know how many will open. We are debating this legislation right now and he should inform the parliament how many he expects will open in 2006. We certainly know that in New South Wales the deadline for the registration of new non-government schools has already passed. So, as I understand it, there will not be any greenfield Australian technical colleges opening in that state in 2006, and I understand that other states are in a similar position. If that is the case, will the minister us know whether any of these new technical colleges on greenfield sites will be opening in 2006? The public was also promised an open tender process during the election campaign. This did not eventuate. Instead we have had a request for proposal process. This closed last May. We have asked to look at the proposals. I cannot see why they cannot be made public. As we understand from the minister's statements, these are not commercial proposals, so there should not be any commercial-in-confidence concerns. I hope that the proposals will be made public. The bill provides for funding agreements between the government and the colleges, and we know from the bill that funding will be dependent on many conditions which are not detailed in the legislation. Apparently they are going to be determined on a case-by-case basis. You could contrast that with the approach taken in the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill, which we have just debated. Labor have strongly opposed the inclusion of the requirement to make TAFEs offer all staff Australian workplace agreements. Fortunately that provision is not detailed in the text of this bill, so I hope the government will see sense and not impose that requirement on our technical colleges. We do not think that technical colleges are the place to promote this government's ideological industrial relations crusade. We do not think that vocational education and training should be used as a vehicle with which to drive through an agenda which bears no relation to successful skills training and educational outcomes for students. The proposed locations are somewhat of a mystery. The government has said that the colleges will be: ... located in regions suffering serious skills shortages and high rates of youth unemployment and let which are supported by a significant industry base. But we do not know how these factors were weighed up to determine the actual list of 24 locations announced during the election. I think it might have had something to do with an unmentioned factor: marginal seat politics. One area that is very close to my heart is the northern suburbs of Melbourne. In that area we have very high levels of youth unemployment, serious skills shortages and a very significant industry base. There is a terrific school in those northern suburbs: Northland Secondary College in East Preston. They have recently pioneered Ntec, a new $3½ million manufacturing and technology centre. This was developed in response to chronic high levels of youth unemployment in Melbourne's north and the fact that we have significant skills shortages. There is no question that this area could benefit from the development of a college like Ntec. Ntec will offer vocational education and training certificate courses in engineering, automotive skills, furnishing and electronics. All this will feed in together with the Victorian Certificate of Education and the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning. Ntec will also have all of the other things that the technical college proposal is looking for. They have involved local industry, group training organisations, the TAFEs and, very importantly because of the location of this school, Koori organisations as well. So we actually have a government secondary school with an industry advisory committee delivering technical education in areas of skills shortage-exactly what this government should have been doing over the last nine years. But unfortunately the northern suburbs of Melbourne are not among the 24 chosen locations and so, despite fulfilling all of the published criteria, I fear that Northland ondary College and Ntec are not going to become an Australian technical college and therefore will miss out on the additional resources that the government is providing to support exactly the same proposals elsewhere. That is a great loss for the northern suburbs of Melbourne. There are other such places around the country too-Coorparoo Secondary College in Brisbane's north, the Oatley campus of the Georges River College in Sydney, Salisbury secondary college in Adelaide and the proposed Manea College in Bunbury in Western Australia, just to name a few. All of these schools are doing a great job delivering technical education as part of their senior curriculum. The Howard government should be investing money in supporting programs in schools like these. Maybe they should take the advice of the member for Page, who was reported in his local paper last year as commenting that the technical colleges should be ditched in favour of pumping desperately needed funding into the local Wollongbar TAFE. I was there on Friday with the Leader of the Opposition. I know that Wollongbar TAFE have put in a proposal, and I certainly hope that they are successful in having a technical college associated with that terrific TAFE. Unlike this government, we on this side of the House are committed to reforming secondary schooling so that it provides more vocational options as part of school education, in cooperation with the states and territories. We believe that the key to encouraging young people to study traditional trades is supporting schools to expand vocational training opportunities and target training where it is needed most. This is in significant contrast to the Howard government's technical college plan, which is going to duplicate infrastructure and restrict access by hiving off the traditional trades into an alternative Sec- stream. We believe it would be much more effective to encourage young people to study traditional trades while they are at school and to have trades as a mainstream part of the curriculum in all of our schools. We have proposed a new trade apprenticeship school incentive scheme, to double the number of school based apprenticeships and give schools the extra funding they need to support them in taking up these school based apprenticeship places. We think that is the direction our schools should be going in. We believe this government should be training more Australians now through that mechanism, rather than businesses having to wait until 2010. And, of course, there will not be 7,200 extra tradespeople in 2010-nothing like it, because the first technical college is not even going to start until next year. Add four years to that and you have a very long wait for the vast majority of students to come out of these technical colleges and provide qualified tradespeople for business. It is no wonder that business is screaming out now for the government to do more and more. That is why I suggest to the government that they pick up our other proposal-for a trade completion bonus-to get additional qualified tradespeople into business right now, rather than waiting until 2010.

36,Mr BARTLETT,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"There were certainly no surprises in the comments by the member for Jagajagatypically strong on rhetoric and negativity, very selective in considering the facts and very short on memory of Labor's own dismal failure in the area of vocational education and training. Labor had an answer to the skills shortage; there was no doubt about that. Labor's answer to the skills shortage was to depress demand enough so that noone wanted skilled labour: keep the economy depressed, keep the level of unemployment high enough-it averaged 8.5 per cent over Labor's 13 years-and there will be no shortage of skilled labour. That was Labor's answer. The reason for the current tightening of the labour market is nine years of strong employment growth and the lowest level of unemployment for 28 years. One of the hallmarks of this government's approach to education has been a determination to rebuild vocational education and training. We had a period from the early seventies through to perhaps the mid-1990s when the preoccupation in education was with higher education, leading to the neglect of technical education and vocational education and training. The imbalance that we saw for 2½ decades brought with it a number of problems. It brought the gradually growing problem of a shortage of skilled labour, with fewer and fewer apprentices-fewer and fewer people wanting to take on traditional trades-and fewer qualified tradesmen in the work force. A point that the member for Jagajaga refused to acknowledge was that in the 13 years under Labor apprenticeships fell to their lowest level in 30 years. To now get up and criticise the government for not in last nine years correcting Labor's 13 years neglect is somewhat rich and hypocritical. So the first problem we had because of that trend for perhaps two decades was a growing shortage of skilled labour. The second problem-one that no-one seems to have mentioned-that resulted from the preoccupation with higher education was that the needs of the 70 per cent of students who do not go to university were unfairly neglected. The preoccupation with higher education-with universities-meant that the majority of kids went through senior secondary school without their real needs being met. The focus on matriculation, on academic studies and on preparing students for university meant that the other 70 per cent of students felt that their needs in senior secondary school were largely overlooked. It meant that many of those kids left school feeling alienated, dissatisfied and that their experience in secondary school had not adequately met their needs. It also put unfair pressure on those students in senior years to perform. It said to them, ‘If you don't reach a standard that gets you into university, if you don't matriculate, you are somehow a failure and a second-rate student.' I think that excessive imbalance, that obsession almost-(Quorum formed) It is obvious that the opposition is going to play this game all morning because it does not like being reminded of the facts. Its answer to the skills shortage was to keep people in the unemployment queues. If people are looking for work then there is no skills shortage. I remind the members opposite that, during their 13 years, apprenticeships fell to a 30-year low. This government has been rebuilding the level of apprenticeships in this country. The other point I was making is that our focus on reinvigorating the vocational education sector since we have been in govern the ment has corrected that imbalance which put of so much pressure on young people by keeping too much focus on higher education. Let me outline the government's record so far in nine years to address the neglect of Labor. We have had a strong focus on vocational education and training in our school system, developed the new framework for vocational education in schools and put substantial funding into it during that time-$283 million between 1996-97 and 2000-01. This is much more money than the opposition had even considered or come close to delivering when they were in office. We also incorporated vocational education in the 1999 National Goals for Schooling in the TwentyFirst Century, putting vocational education on the agenda for our secondary schools. The results speak for themselves. The number of students doing vocational education and training in schools has trebled in six years under this government. The number of students doing school based new apprenticeships more than trebled in six years under this government. Earlier, the member for Jagajaga said: ‘Listen to our policies. We'll double the number of school based apprenticeships.' We have already trebled them in just six years under the policies of this ernment. The results are there and they are clear for everyone to see. This year's budget brings a record amount of $2.5 billion, an increase of $280 million, for vocational education and training. Under this government, we have seen almost a trebling of the number of apprenticeships in this country, from a level of 144,000 in 1996-a 30-year low-to 394,000 apprenticeships this year. This bill continues this government's strong record on vocational education and training, its strong record in increasing the level of skill in our work force and its strong commitment to and record in increasing the number of apprenticeships. What does this bill do? It will encourage students to enter traditional trades. By doing so, it will help address the skills shortage, start young people on a path to a worthwhile, satisfying and rewarding career and add to the country's productivity and output. How will it do this? Twenty-four Australian technical colleges will be established in regions where there is an identified need. I am pleased to say that Western Sydney will be one of the areas that will get a technical college. Some 7,200 students a year will be able to undertake their senior secondary studies to year 12. They will be able to do it with a focus on vocational education and linked into a school based new apprenticeship in an area of need. Those students will not have to focus on a university matriculation. They will be able to complete their year 12 studies while focusing on preparing for a career in a traditional trade. Over the next four years, $343.6 million will be committed in addition to the recurrent funding that would normally go to those schools. We will see a number of colleges commence next year and then the rest building out in 2007 and 2008. Importantly, these colleges will be led by a governing body consisting of local industry and community gov- representatives to make sure they meet community needs in employment, skills et cetera. This will allow the sort of flexibility that has not been there to date-the flexibility needed to make sure that we are meeting the needs of young people as well as the needs of local employers and local industry. It will help us to rebuild the skill basis of our work force in traditional trades and provide the quality training for young people to set them on the path of a worthwhile career. Our aim is to see trade qualifications in this country valued as highly as university degrees so that more and more young people can reap the rewards that this offers. This initiative is not on its own. It is part of a suite of measures that we have seen in this budget to increase the emphasis on vocational education and training. As I have said, there is a record $2.5 billion in this budget for vocational education and training. This is a very positive and worthwhile initiative that will deliver results. It continues this government's fine record on vocational education and training. It will help many young people and help rebuild Australia's skilled work force. It goes far further than anything we saw under the 13 years of the Labor government. It had nothing to offer then and it has nothing to offer now except negativity and rhetoric.",43
37,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005 represents the government's totally inadequate attempt to address the major skills shortages faced by the Australian community today. It is about time the government understood that investment in Australia in a number of key sectors is currently being held back because of the major skills shortages that exist in the Australian economy. What is the government's solution? The government's solution is this It effectively puts in place the government's inadequate election commitment to establish and operate new technical colleges in competition with existing technical colleges. It also allows the government to appropriate some $340 million over four years and, importantly, to set conditions on the spending of that taxpayers' money. I am of the very firm view that it is about time the Commonwealth started to cooperate with the state and territory governments on the all important issue of apprenticeship training. Instead of that, this bill is about the duplication of existing skilling structures which I believe should be based on cooperation between all levels government rather than on duplicating existing arrangements and establishing new technical Thecolleges. government has effectively decided to avoid cooperation and coordination. Instead, rather than putting taxpayers' money into the training of young Australians, it has decided to invest it in bricks and mortar. Despite mand for skilled labour peaking at this particular point in time, the government has effectively decided that it is better to address the skills shortage by having-guess whatsome people graduate from the newly established technical colleges in 2010. With my shadow ministerial responsibilities in the resources sector, I am someone who goes around Australia on a regular basis and let me say this: the demand is there now-not in 2010. People want the investment to be made now so that we can increase exports todaynot in four years time. The truth of the matter is that the market cannot predict what demand in 2010 is going to be, but it can see what is happening on the ground today, in 2005. Maybe it is about time some members of the government got out and sat down and talked to some of these companies about their immediate demands to overcome the huge skills shortages which are currently bill. holding back investment in Australia, undermining job creation, reducing exports and reducing the size of the potential economic cake that all Australians should benefit from. The truth of the matter is that serious skills shortages are being experienced by the Australian community. As far as I am concerned, the government's complacency is alarming. One should also not forget that these very serious skills shortages are now having an impact on the wages structure in Australia. Industry is competing, with employers cutting one another's throats to try to attract the available tradespeople in Australia. That clearly has potential inflationary ramifications for the overall management of of the Australian economy. There is no room for complacency, but I think there is an alternative approach. It is about acting now to get people into the necessary skilled occupations, so as to produce the goods, attract investment, increase exports and enlarge our economic cake in 2005 de- and 2006; it is not about producing new tradespeople in 2010. I want to remind the House of Labor's commitments at the last election. They were immediate. They were about creating some 36,000 new vocational education and training places each year and also trying to assist young people to stay at school to commence apprenticeships. To address the skills shortage Labor offered to pay TAFE fees for secondary students who wanted to get a vocational qualificationthat is, those who would commence an apprenticeship at school and partly complete it, so that when they finished school they were not only job ready but also attractive to employers because part of their apprenticeship, the initial year, had been completed at school and they had also completed, appropriately, years 11 and 12. Further, in recent months the opposition has set out some simple steps that would enable us to go a long way forward in addressing the immediate skills shortages that have resulted from nine years of neglect. The government likes to talk about apprenticeship numbers. We ought to break them down and then go to the hard traditional trades where we need the tradespeople. There we have gone backwards year after year. The apprenticeships the government is talking about are what used to be referred to as traineeships. They are at record numbers in industries such as the retail industry and areas such as the clerical area. Where we need the hard training to occur-in the skilled trades areas, where we need people such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and bricklayers-we have gone further backwards in recent years because, rather than being willing to break the figures down trade by trade and show where we were failing as a community, the government simply wanted to play a numbers game and talk about overall figures. We propose some further alternatives which I think are pretty practical. Firstly, we need to provide a $2,000 trade completion bonus to help cut the 40 per cent drop-out rate in traditional trade apprenticeships. Secondly, we need to provide a large boost to school based apprenticeships. This is something that is very much supported by industry, because they see the benefit of keeping kids at school and getting them job ready by partly completing an apprenticeship. Thirdly, we need to consider the tax structure in Australia and create incentives. Here Labor proposes a practical alternative, providing a welfare to work bonus to increase work force participation by income support recipients. That is about basing our efforts to attract people on a carrot approach, in order to try to get them to face up to their responsibilities and also in order to meet the needs of industry. The government's approach is to make small changes at the margins and not to confront the real barriers to apprenticeship training in Australia. It likes to talk about new technical colleges. As I have said, these so called new technical colleges will not produce a single tradesperson in Australia until 2010. Who knows where the Chinese economy, which we live off now, is going to be in 2010? Who knows where the Indian economy, which we hope to live off in the foreseeable future, is going to be in 2010? But we know in 2005 that, if you go to resources areas such as Gove, Groote Eylandt, Mount Isa, Karratha, Paraburdoo or Port Hedland, you find you just cannot get the tradespeople who can actually do the job required to actually expand our export potential. The truth is that industry wants these tradespeople now. All the government can say is, ‘We've got the solution. We're going to increase skilled migration.' That is unacceptable. We have got to train Australians now to fill these skilled vacancies and not put off the issue until 2010. We have to focus on real skills development and get incentives in place to get people into meaningful, secure jobs. This reminds me of the fight about industrial relations. It is a meaningless dispute that will add nothing to increasing productivity in Australia. If you want increased productivity in Australia then skill the Australian work force. Kicking the guts out of child-care workers, hospitality workers or cleaners by trying to reduce the mean wages that they currently receive-because they are at the bottom end of the wages ladder-is going to do nothing to assist the Australian community to increase productivity and exports and, in doing so, to enlarge the economic cake. That is not where our problems are. Our problems are at the higher skilled levels, where we do not have the tradespeople to do the job at the moment. In that area at the moment the industrial relations framework is irrelevant, because bosses are falling over one another to offer the small number of tradespeople that are there higher and higher wages and better conditions of employment, just to try to attract them to their workplaces. It also means that some of those employers are now fronting up to some of their broader responsibilities, such as familyfriendly workplaces, and it means that pressure is on government in some of those communities to front up to their responsibilities. Where is a decent school in Karratha? Where is a decent child-care centre in Paraburdoo? Where is a decent hospital in Groote Eylandt? They are the issues that are meaningful in the minds of workers, firstly, attracting them and, secondly, encouraging them to remain in those isolated communities to do the job. We are not talking about cutting wages and conditions or about new apprentices qualifying in 2010; we are talking about how we immediately solve skills shortages in the foreseeable future in Australia. That takes me to my portfolio responsibilities of tourism and resources. If you go to the tourism industry at the moment, what do you find employers talking about? They are talking about labour shortages, skills development, vocational education and training and professional career development pathways. They are the biggest issues facing the tourism industry, which is one of the engine rooms of jobs growth in Australia. I refer to a transport and tourism forum which recently provided me with the results of a poll it undertook on the issues of concern to its membership. The survey showed that 75 per cent of respondents said there was one issue that they were concerned about: that was how in their industry they fill shortages of skilled people. Some regional areas are being forced to go through a period of transition to create new opportunities, and tourism is important to some of those regions. While parts of the industry excel in long-term career development in hospitality and tourism, the sector is often also forced to rely on a work force for whom the job is temporary or short termsomething they do while they study, raise families or wait to take up vocations. This creates continual ongoing costs-the cost of training and retraining and the cost of recruitment-which further disadvantage this Australian industry because of the failure of this government to do something meaningful for it. The industry has to work out how this government responds to its need to develop a plan to establish long-term training and career development, and TAFE itself has to be more flexible in responding to the industry's needs. If we are going to achieve a good response, we have to achieve it through some national coordination and cooperation-state and territory governments working with the Commonwealth government and with the private sector and local schools and communities to get our training agenda right. In particular, I think the tourism industry, in a cooperative model with state and territory governments and the Commonwealth, has to work out what it needs in order to make progress to produce the skilled people required for the future. The international tourism market is pretty tough and in some ways we are disadvantaged because of distance, so we have to make sure that we produce a quality service for those people who do come to Australia, because we want them to come back and we also want them to encourage others by word of mouth-so that, because of their recommendation, others will want to come to Australia. To produce a quality service, you have to have a skilled work force. That takes me to the TTF survey. Let us deal with some of the issues that came out of that. Firstly, basic customer services skills were identified as the highest priority for skills training. Secondly, a shortage of chefs and a need for a greater uptake of trade apprenticeships in that area were identified. Why aren't we putting more emphasis on starting those apprenticeships at school? We should encourage people to partly complete their apprenticeships by the end of years 11 and 12. Importantly, they would be attractive to employers, because they would be job ready. We then move to something that is not just a problem for the tourism industry: the shortages of trained electrical and mechanical tradespeople that are being experienced, as I have said, by a range of industries, including the resources sector and the building sector. Finally, the TTF survey identified that trained food and beverage staff are in short supply. I think it is about time the government started talking about those things. We not only want apprentices to start training for trades; we also want them to complete the training, which is why in the recent budget discussions Labor proposed a further incentive to avoid the drop-out rate. To try to discourage young people from accepting when they are approached by an alternative employer who has no history of training but who says, ‘Don't finish your apprenticeship; come and work with me and I'll pay adult rates in the third or the fourth year,' Labor proposed an incentive. Dropping out is no good to them in the long term; they have to finish their trade training. As an incentive, Labor proposed a completion bonus of $2,000-a carrot for young people to complete their trade training. An amount of $1,000 would be paid halfway through their apprenticeship, and a second $1,000 would be paid at the completion of it. That is a real incentive to young kids, and it says: ‘Don't accept that carrot of a couple of thousand dollars over 12 months and avoid your requirement to finish your apprenticeship. Finish it; pick up the incentives and in the long term you'll be far better off.' That is the message we have to get through to young people. I now go to the resources sector. In a recent fact-finding mission to major mining and oil and gas operations in areas such as North Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Pilbara in Western Australia, I found that all the industry want to talk about are the skills shortages that exist today-not what they may be in 2010-and the problems that confront them. If you go to Gove you will find 46 vacancies and if you go to Groote Eylandt you will find 43 vacancies. They want these people now, because they cannot expand their operations and produce products which will gain export earnings for Australia without them. Because of the failure of government to deliver over the last nine years, we have to confront these problems now. Let us take the resources sector as an example. The sector shows how important this issue is and why we have to solve these problems today. Over the decade to 2003-04 the value of exports from the minerals and energy sector grew by 95 per cent, reflecting just how important it is to Australia's export performance. That growth has occurred over a decade so you would think the government would have seen the skills shortages coming, but all of a sudden, in 2004, we heard the suggestion: ‘We're going to create a few new TAFE colleges to solve the problems that exist in 2004 and 2005.' It actually requires bit of forward thinking and planning. It also requires working with local communities. I refer, for example, to a local initiative in my own electorate-the Northland Secondary College, which was referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have an electorate in which there are still kids do not even finish years 9 and 10, let alone start an apprenticeship or go to university, because of some of the social problems we have. But I have a local secondary college that is actually trying to do something about this in the existing structure. We have created a skill centre for school students, the manufacturing technology centre. This centre offers years 11 and 12 kids VET certificate courses in engineering, automotive and furnishing in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The initiative was made possible by a grant from the Victorian government and also by the support of ANTA, an organisation abolished as a result of a bill passed in this parliament this morning. It is working at a local level, drawing in the national organisation made up of state and territory governments and the Commonwealth, ANTA, and also bringing into play the role of the rian government with a grant of $750,000. That school is actually producing young people today, not in 2010. Similarly, in Queensland, go to the Gladstone Schools Engineering Skills Centre, a major resource and export centre in Australia. See how the private sector and Queensland TAFE, with the local schools, are working together to produce the results: practical, local training. You do not need a new trade centre in that town; they have one that is producing the results. The program itself is based on the ACCI employability skills framework. It is producing the goods. It is avoiding duplication, avoiding ineffia ciencies and avoiding competition for scarce resources out there in the Australian community. There are other examples, such as in Tasmania. The coalition's election policy on technical colleges was designed on the run, based on a mainland template for a situation who that does not exist in Tasmania. Tasmania's emphasis on workplace vocational education and training, as opposed to school based VET, is quite different from that of most mainland states. There is no demand for a greenfield site on which to build a separate college. The reality is that the money allocated to this policy in Tasmania should be spent on adding to and expanding the current VET training system within the existing framework for skills development and training in Tasmania. That is because Tasmania has decent senior secondary colleges, with a number of independent schools also providing relevant VET courses, in addition to TAFE and private providers. Why duplicate it? Why create a mess? In conclusion, it is about time the government fronted up to the fact that, as a result of its massive funding cuts in 1996, it has progressively and continuously inadequately Victo- funded TAFE and VET Australia-wide. In that context, I also urge the community to examine the Queensland government's white paper on vocational education and training that was released last week. It is a practical endeavour to bring to a head some of the challenges that confront us on trade training. I commend the second reading amendment to the House, and I simply say to the government: stop; have a look at the policy; sit down with state and territory governments and the private sector and try and get it right. We all accept that there is a trade shortage in Australia. Try and work out a cooperative model, not a confrontationist model.",45
38,Mr FAWCETT,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Wakefield) (11.40 am)I rise to support the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005. Firstly, why do we need such a bill? It is because the economy is growing at such a rate that unemployment is going down to record lows. In fact, long term unemployment was down to around 102,400 in January 2005. Whilst the unemployment figures are terrific, the other result is a huge increase in the demand for labour. The work force requires employees, not only at the skilled end but right through to the unskilled end. This is something that the members opposite do not seem to acknowledge-that the demand for labour is not just at the skilled end; it is also at the unskilled and semiskilled end. In the electorate of Wakefield, which I have the honour to represent in this place, I now see road signs appearing on a regular basis calling for workers to come into the poultry industry: ‘Immediate start. Workers required.' They are looking for people with low-level skills to come in. Why? Because it is not just a skills shortage; it is a labour shortage because of the growth in the economy. Wakefield, in the northern region of Adelaide, manufactures over 70 per cent of the state's output, so the skills shortage and the labour shortage are things that people are talking about frequently and looking for answers to, particularly because in Wakefield there are some pockets of very high youth unemployment. There are a number of barriers which explain why these young people are not completing school, why they are not moving on to further training and why they are not able to move into employment. Some of the solutions that have been identified are a couple of things that come back to culture and a couple of things that come back to mentoring relationships. That is where the technical colleges provide an important solution, because they attempt to link industry and the employers with the young people who need to finish school and move into that training. This is vital. In the city of Playford, around 25 per cent of the working population is employed in manufacturing industries. What has been happening with apprenticeships there is not a sad story. Despite the comments from those opposite to the effect that the New Apprenticeships scheme has only focused on traineeships, the fact is that in Wakefield traditional trades have risen from around 210 in 1996 to 720 in 2004. That is not traineeships; it is traditional trades. That is an increase of 243 per cent. If we have had that kind of increase, why is there a problem? The problem is that the economy is growing, there are more jobs and, importantly, employers are looking for an outcome. One of the things that the technical colleges are looking to do is to say to the employers, ‘You provide the pull factor. You tell us what the training is that you need. You provide the mentoring and the relationships with the students that will encourage them to hang in there with the schooling, to move through the education system and to take up the work.' The important part is not government rhetoric; the important part is how the community has responded to this. In Wakefield, the community response has been overwhelming. I have had individual parents write to and email me, meet with me and talk to me about how excited they are that finally there will be a recognition of the value of trade training and of the fact that this is not something you do if you cannot make it to university-that we are establishing again that this should be a first choice for the 70 per cent of our young people who do not go to university. Employment groups and groups who look at doing structured placements and training for students have all welcomed this move. More telling, though, is the response of business-and I am not just talking here about the peak bodies who tend to come to many of the meetings in Canberra with government departments. I have been amazed at the number of individual businesses-employers who may only have three or four people working for them, through to medium sized businesses-who have said, ‘We cannot wait to be involved.' They have signed up with a number of the bids that have been put forward from Wakefield to say, ‘We will support this process because we want to have an input into what is taught and how it is taught, and we want to establish a relationship with these young people to encourage them to continue through their training, to get their qualifications and to come and work in our businesses.' We have also seen interest from some in the mining sector. They have realised that, in order to attract people to work for them where their mines are, they need to come down and support the bids being raised in Wakefield so that they can have people trained in metropolitan Adelaide and then take them to where they have the work. Importantly, there has also been a lot of positive response from the education sector. Despite the comments from members opposite, even the TAFEs are now realising that this is not a duplication. This is providing the means and the focus for these young people to choose to engage in vocational and trade training. The TAFEs are realising that they have the opportunity to become one of the principal suppliers of the trade training to the technical colleges. This is not about duplication; this is about working with the community and working with existing sources of training, such as RTOs and TAFEs, so that young people have the opportunity to have that mentoring relationship with an employer, to receive the training they need and to move into a job. I have had a number of meetings with state schools, independent schools and schools in the Catholic sector. They were involved in nearly all of the bids from Wakefield. They are also excited about this. One of the reasons they are excited comes back to this question of culture. Trades should be valued as a first choice. Too often over the last 10 years-and, in fact, even before that-we have had career counsellors, teachers and other people say to students that if they do not complete year 12 and go to university then they are somehow a secondclass citizen. These colleges have been welcomed by many schools, and certainly welcomed by parents, as an attempt to increase the value that our society places on trades. Another cultural change is that this now has an industry pull factor. Rather than the education system pushing out young people using the syllabus they think is important and with the focus they think is important, we now have the opportunity for industry to become involved and to say, ‘These are the skills we need and this is how we need our young people trained.' More importantly, because they have that opportunity now they are getting on board. We have real employers from industry who are signing up to say, ‘I want to be involved in the board. I want to establish relationships with these young people and bring them into jobs.' So strong has the support for this been that some of the groups who are working together on the bids in Wakefield have said that, regardless of the outcome of the government's decision on technical colleges, they will move ahead anyway because the model has such benefits for the Wakefield business community and for the young people in Wakefield. At the moment there are at least three bids in Wakefield. Each of those groups has talked to each other and agreed that they will support whoever wins. Whilst there are a variety of ways in which these colleges could be implemented-hence the three bids-all the groups recognise that there is an incredimake ble need for training and an incredible need, given youth unemployment and disengagement, to provide the opportunity for young people to move through that training. So there is strong support across all sectors of the Wakefield community for this. I am very happy to support this bill because it provides opportunity for young people. It does not duplicate anything. It involves the community and it involves business in a process that will see good outcomes for our young people. It is the latest in a range of measures that the Howard government has put in place to support vocational training and trade training. The number of new apprentices has actually increased 280 per cent since 1996. As I said before, some of those are traineeships. In the case the Wakefield, there has been a 243 per cent increase in the traditional trades. This governcent ment has not been asleep at the wheel; this government has grown the economy to the extent that the demand for labour, skilled unskilled, is increasing. The technical colleges are the latest round of measures put in place to provide a future for our young people and our industry.",50
39,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I appreciate that a quorum had to be called on the member for Macquarie. I was quite surprised, because he often speaks about educational matters. While government members were not too interested in his contribution, I certainly listened to it. He came up with the ludicrous proposition-the kind of conspiracy theory that one would associate with the John Birch Society or the Citizens Electoral Council-that in some way Labor deliberately instigated unemployment in this country so that we would not have a skills shortage. What a preposterous concept-that a government of any political stripe would fashion that kind of policy for that kind of outcome. It really does you wonder about the disrespect for the electorate shown by the member who came forward with that proposition. It is similar to the way in which the current government has, at various stages, ignored interest rates in terms of their relationship with overseas rates and their relativities. This skills shortage has been quite a while coming. The Australian Industry Group estimated last year that 175,000 people will leave trades over the next five years and only 70,000 will enter them. Similarly, there have been comments by a variety of other organisations, such as the Dusseldorp Skills Forum and the ACTU, about the crisis we face. The Dusseldorp Skills Forum said that the taking on of apprentices had declined by 16 per cent since the early 1990s-that since 1997 the proportion of teenage starters in traditional apprenticeships fell from 40 per to 33 per cent. The ACTU estimates a shortfall of over 130,000 skilled workers over the next five years. As I said earlier, the and AiG has been similarly concerned. The member for Macquarie said that Labor have a ‘solution'-this ridiculous theory that we create unemployment. I say that the current government has a ‘solution' to our skill shortages; that solution is the importation of labour into this country. We are seeing an attempt to solve these problems through a massive surge in skilled migration. When the Labor government was defeated in 1996, Australia's skilled migration intake was 25,000 people a year. The government is proposing that 97,000 people come into the country next year under the skills category. Graeme Hugo, an expert in the population debate and in the broader issue of migration, noted in an article that, in 1995-96, 29 per cent of Australia's migration intake was skills related. Next year that figure will be 62.3 per cent. Long gone is the interest in family migration. Long gone is a reasonable level of refugee and humanitarian intake. There is an obsession with solving this country's problems in skills creation and skills acquisition through migration. It is interesting to note that in the middle of last year there were 590,000 visitorstemporary entrants-in this country. Of those, only 170,000 did not have the right to work. In other words, 420,000 visitors had a right to work. This is the reality of what is happening in this country. A government which professes to be hard on refugees‘Lock them up, kick their heads in, restrict them'-is at the same time undermining the development of skills in our labour market with its obsession with solving these problems through migration and temporary entrants. The member for Macquarie says that the opposition has a solution to these problems. I say that this government has only one solution to our skills crisis-that is, migration. In the period since Labor lost office, this government has brought in 440,000 peoplenearly half a million people-under the skills category. Employers are told, ‘Don't worry, mate. We'll just bring in a few skilled migrants so that you get some plumbers and electricians. You do not need to train anybody. You do not need to have apprentices. We can solve that for you.' These people can come in as skilled migrants and they can bring in their families-from northern Lebanon or Moldavia, for instance. Which employer is going to be silly enough to train Australians when the government solves these problems through migration? Migration is a crucial ingredient with regard to what is happening in this country. Contributing factors to this problem are corporatisation, the amalgamation of companies and privatisation levels, along with the fact that large corporations and large public service entities no longer train apprentices. Despite their obsession with migration, the government now have a supposedly new idea to solve this problem. Rather than respecting an internationally renowned institution-our TAFE system-they have decided to set up a competing alternative. After underresourcing the TAFE system for a decade, they now propose to have a new set of colleges. This skills crisis is supposedly immediate. They are telling us the crisis is happening right now. But under their new proposal nobody will come out of these colleges until 2010. The crisis is so great that they are upping the skilled migration intake from 77,000 last year to 97,000 this year. It is so drastic, immediate and serious that they are further increasing the skilled migration intake. Yet under their proposal we will not get people out of these colleges for another five years. Is the crisis serious? Yes, it is. Is this a solution? No, it is not. Our TAFE system is internationally renowned. In the past when we took in skilled migrants we could be confident that the systems of a number of other countries in the British Commonwealth were similar to ours. There was a culture that encouraged people to go into the trades, and their skills were internationally recognised. This government does not want to do anything about TAFE; it wants to solve the problem through migration. This government-despite a 16 per cent increase in the number of TAFE studentsfroze the level of TAFE funding at 1997 levels. During the period of the Howard government, hundreds of thousands of people have been turned away from TAFE. They cannot get in; there are no places. That is the kind of situation we face. I do not dispute the member for Wakefield's contention that part of the problem is a cultural issue: people watch television and see glamour jobs in new fields and say, ‘Why would I take up a traditional trade?' There is no doubt that that is happening. However, there are a few other issues. Last year 40 per cent of people who took up apprenticeships did not finish them. Why is that? It could be that they are faced with competing possibilities. Previously everyone thought they would be in the same job for 40 years and that was very comforting. The employment situation for younger people is very insecure. There is casualisation of the work force. People do not know if they will have their jobs in three or four years time. At the same time, I concede that a culture is developing where people become attuned to not staying in the one job for too long. Those are contributing factors, but that 40 per cent drop-out rate is due to the conditions faced by apprentices. Under this government's new industrial relations proposals, people in the trade sector will have their wages reduced by $100. That is not going to encourage people to stay in the trades. The 40 per cent drop-out rate is very much related to pay rates. In the first three months of their apprenticeship, a building apprentice in Victoria receives $5.24 an hour. For the remainder of their first year they receive $6.74 an hour. Those apprentices would earn far more at a fast food outlet. This government resists the rights of people to negotiate their wages and to have some say in the workplace. Under the government's proposal the starting rate would be $313 a week. Apprenticeships are not attracting people and, of those they do attract, there is a high drop-out rate. There is insecurity, and the wages are so low that people are leaving. We do not need a new-fangled concept involving a set of colleges which will not produce people for many years henceforth. We do not need to solve this problem through migration. The government says this crisis is immediate. The problem with migration is that processing times are, in general, about a year. Philip Ruddock, the previous minister, said years ago that if you have this level of intake you reduce the skills base and the quality of the people coming in. If you are going to get people here more quickly to solve the problem, you reduce the standard of processing and the level of inquiry into their skills. Solving this problem through skilled migration produces other problems. There are very few sectors of this economy where barriers have not been established by professional organisations against people coming into this country to work. We all know that in every city in this country there are people who are driving taxis who entered Australia under the skills category also but who never again entered their skilled occupation in life. The situation is that employers demand Australian skills before they hire people. The reality is that even when you have an intake of nearly 100,000 people-as this government will have next year-a significant number of those people will not work in the sectors in which they are qualified to work; they will never work in those professions. So it is no solution. One aspect of this budget that has not been debated very much is a new proposal. It is bad enough that the government have attempted to solve Australia's skills shortages by importing 440,000 people in the skills category over the last decade, but they have now come up with an even more ludicrous idea in this budget. They are actually proposing that people come here and take up paid apprenticeships in rural and regional Australia. They are not even interested in Australian youth-to encourage them, give them incentives and involve them in apprenticeships. They are going to go to Budapest, Berlin and Brasilia and try to find people in the streets there to come to Australia to do apprenticeships. That is the kind of solution they are putting forward. As I said, this proposal, bring the people into the market for another five years. In the interim we will have a continuation of this obsession with skills entry into this country. We will have this obsession with basically doing nothing to try to encourage people into apprenticeships. We will have the hands-in-the-air denial of the fact that we can do it ourselves. We will have the de-skilling of our work force. That is the direction of the government, and the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005 will do nothing to solve it.",52
40,Mrs MAY,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I have to take on board some of those comments made by my colleague from the opposition and say that I think the announcement of the Australian technical college initiative during the last federal election was indeed welcome and certainly demonstrated the coalition government's continuing support of education pathways for young Australians. The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005 provides for the establishment of 24 technical colleges in regions identified around Australia as having skill shortages. These technical colleges will become centres of excellence in trade training, attracting capable and competent year 11 and 12 students who want to begin training for a career in the trades while also completing their senior secondary education. The colleges will offer both academic and vocational education to students while completing their school studies. In other words, the colleges will offer another career pathway for talented students in years 11 and 12. Apart from undertaking trade courses in skills identified as having shortages in industry, there will also be a common curriculum to incorporate English, science, mathematics, information technology skills, employability skills and small as it is, will not business skills. Industry has indicated for some time that graduating school students are not work ready and do not have the necessary skills for employment in a number of industry areas. Some of those skill shortages are in engineering and include trades such as metal fitters, machinists, fabricators, toolmakers and welders. Mechanics, auto-electricians and panel beaters are also needed in the vehicle industry. The construction industry, which is particularly important for the Gold Coast-where I come from-is also facing a huge shortage of skilled personnel in areas such as bricklaying, plumbing and carpentry. These areas of skill shortages have been identified by industry, and the coalition government is making a very significant commitment to ensuring those skill shortages are addressed by committing $343.6 million over five years to support this initiative. For too long in this country vocational education has suffered an identity problem. There has been an attitude in the community that only a university degree will secure employment. In many cases it has become a status symbol, and as a country we have paid a significant economic and social cost for this attitude. One-third of students who commence a university degree do not complete the degree. That is not to say we should undervalue a university education; it is a pathway that many young people aspire to and it is a pathway we should support. But the Australian technical college centres of excellence, providing world-class training and facilities in the trades, will be a valuable addition to the choice of education pathways for young Australians. It gives them a choice-a strong career choice that will secure employment in the future. One of the technical colleges will be established on the Gold Coast. This was a welcome announcement and one supported very strongly by both industry and the education sector on the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast region has a total area of 1,404 square kilometres, and, as many of my colleagues have heard time and time again in this place, we are now the sixth largest city in Australia and the fastest growing area in Australia. This rapid growth has certainly posed some challenges. It has created significant economic and infrastructure development requirements for the region, which are further compounded by the thousands of tourists that visit the city each year. The training and skills needs of the Gold Coast region are exacerbated, because it is estimated that at any one time there is an average of 77,000 visitors, including daytrippers, per day in the Gold Coast tourism region-that, on top of a population that has now topped the 500,000 mark. Our region has identified skill shortages in the area of tourism and hospitality, an industry that plays a significant role in the life economy of Gold Coast City and that continues to be our largest industry. The recent completion of the new convention and exhibition centre has further stimulated the tourism and hospitality industry, with considerable benefits to existing hotels and associated retail and service industries. We have skill shortages in the building and construction industry. With our strong economic growth, this sector continues to be strong due to the large number of residential and commercial projects currently under construction and planned for the Gold Coast region in the future. The retail sector is one of the largest employers in the Gold Coast area and continues to grow in line with population growth. And the aged care industry has been identified as an area of growth, largely because of the ageing population. New aged care facilities are being constructed, and home and community care is also an area of growth as many ageing people stay in their homes for as long as possible. Other industries are also evolving on the Gold Coast-industries in areas such as the health and medical area, information and communications technology, the marine industry and education. All these industries will need a skilled work force so that Gold Coast city can continue to grow, prosper and share in the economic wealth of this country. The blueprint for the Australian technical colleges is visionary. The colleges will be linked to and endorsed by industry. In fact, the colleges must be industry driven. Industry has responded to the concept in a positive way. Industry will have an active role in developing curriculum, meaning that students have the education and skills that industry is looking for. The colleges will have a governing council led by local business and industry which will provide strategic direction and set performance measures. This leadership will ensure that the colleges are able to adand dress directly the need for skilled tradespeople in key industries in regional Australia. Colleges will develop expertise in a range of industries and have the flexibility to adapt their training provisions to meet changing work force and local industry needs. All the colleges will be run autonomously by their principals, who will also be able to engage teaching staff on a performance pay basis, attracting those with sought-after and up-to-date industry skills and experience. The teaching staff will be drawn from industry as well as from the government and nongovernment school system and the private and public training system. It is my view, and that of many industry representatives in my area, that the strength of these technical colleges is the partnership between industry and education providers. It is a positive step, engaging educators with industry leaders. The partnerships can only strengthen the quality of the curriculum, strengthen the teaching of skills and ultimately ensure that young people in Australia, particularly in the trades areas, receive the best training available. There has been some criticism that the federal government is moving into an area of education that is the domain of state governments and that state governments will not support the concept. It is my understanding that state and territory governments have provided in-principle support for the Australian technical college initiative. This is other example of states working with the federal government to achieve a positive outcome, particularly for young Australians, so that they have very clear, direct pathways through to industry and jobs.G I commend the federal government for this initiative. It is a positive move forward in the area of education and addressing skill shortages in our country. It will be a new career path for around 7,000 students receiving tuition through colleges around Australia. I look forward to working with the winning consortium on the Gold Coast in establishing the Gold Coast technical college. I commend the bill to the House.",55
41,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I rise to comment on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005 and support the amendment of the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga. The bill does not satisfy the requirements of this country in providing the skills needed the workplace. Most independent observers have commented that the government's intentions in this regard have been short sighted and an example of policy on the run. From the way in which the bill is constructed and from the comments by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education before the bill was introduced into this place, we can see that very little thought has gone into it. Some time ago, on 1 March this year, I had the good fortune to meet the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, Mr Gary Hardgrave, in my own electorate. He attended a public meeting-a meeting of interested parties, if you like. I was not personally invited to that meeting, but I was not excluded from attending. I was happy to arrive. On arriving at Taylors Lakes convention centre and meeting with me, in a very ancordial way, the minister seemed entirely shocked and dismayed that I had not been formally invited. Nonetheless, he was happy to see me there. There were about 30 people at the meeting-people who were showing a particular interest. Most were representatives of education institutions, particularly Victoria University, a good university in the western suburbs of Melbourne, and secondary schools. They were looking at how the Commonwealth was going to dispense taxpayers' money in assisting young people's training needs. I could probably spend the remainder of my time talking about the philosophical and political problems I have with the bill, but I will not do that. Whilst this is an idea based on a very flimsy premise, I will do my best, subject to the enactment of the bill, to assist in providing young people in the electorate of Gorton with opportunities. Even if the idea is flawed, the process is flawed and in much of the bill is motivated by ideological blindness, I will do my best to assist the government, because, in the end, I would like to see young people in my electorate given an opportunity. But I have to take some time this afternoon to comment on the concerns I have and the obsession that it seems this government has with respect to the industrial relations agenda. I have to do that because the public have to be alerted to the fact that in every portfolio the government seems to be more concerned about smashing collective bargaining than about introducing training, building roads or providing required resources to other areas across this nation. It is important that I remark upon what is on the government web site with respect to Australian technical colleges. I went to the web site this morning. There is a very neutral explanation of the intention of the government. The Australian government will fund the establishment and operation of 24 Australian technical colleges, providing, it says, high-quality tuition in both academic and vocational education for students in years 11 and 12. It runs through a number of questions and answers. To that extent the format is good. It allows people who may want to be part of a consortium making an application to be involved in running these colleges to understand the government's mind-set with respect to the construction of the colleges and the way they will be administered. I was then struck by the amount of questions that seem to go not to industrial relations in general but to Australian workplace agreements. It is quite extraordinary. Under ‘governance'-and when I think of governance I think of things far more substantial, comprehensive and important than the particular registered agreement that an employee may be bound to-there are all sorts of questions on the Commonwealth government's web site that go to the Australian workplace agreements being proposed. Indeed, it makes clear that the college staff will be employed must be offered Australian workplace agreements. That is interesting because (1) they have decided to put central to their idea a matter that I would argue, and that I think most commentators in the area of education would argue, is incidental to the providing of training and education to people and (2) it is really at odds with this government's own Workplace Relations Act. The Workplace Relations Act provides a number of instruments that an employer and his, her or its employees may enter into to form an arrangement for their employment conditions. Whether the agreement or award is based on division 3 or division 2-in other words, whether it is a settlement of a dispute or an arrangement based on the corporations powers-there are myriad options. There are awards, which we know of, which are always at threat under this government but still exist; certified agreements; section 170LK agreements between employees and employers with no other parties, which are perfectly valid; section 170LJ agreements between registered organisations, employees and employers; and AWAs. The Workplace Relations Act does not compel parties to offer a particular instrument under that act. In fact there is no expression or provision in the Workplace Relations Act that would compel an employer to offer a collective agreement over an AWA or vice versa-no compulsion whatsoever. What we see here, interestingly and most ironically, you could say, is a third party using funding-in this case the Commonwealth for the establishment of a college-to compel an employer to offer a particular instrument, whether that employer wishes to do so or not. To me, that is meddling between the parties. To me, that is a third party intervening between employees and an employer and that I guess that is ironic, given the rhetorical commentary from the Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and other ministers which says: ‘We need to devolve workplace relations matters. We must allow parties to make decisions.' But the Commonwealth's web site has question after question and answer after answer about AWAs. Effectively it says-as I say, contrary to the Workplace Relations Act-that the employer is to be forced, bludgeoned, coerced or whatever into offering AWAs, which other employers need not do. Interestingly, it even goes further-I guess just in case there is some loopholeand says that any company entering into a contract with that ATC must also offer AWAs. The conditions that are being placed on establishing Australian technical colleges really do illustrate the absolute obsession this government has about introducing what are very unpopular instruments. Let us be very clear: this option, Australian workplace agreements, has been in place in the country now for more than eight years. Basically, in that time they have managed to achieve about three per cent of the work force. I remind the House that this is when the government is actually pushing public servants, Commonwealth departments and agencies to enter into these arrangements. It is assisting workplaces, particularly those that are not organised, to go on to AWAs. But, after nearly nine years, three per cent of the total work force are currently employed under AWAs. So really what we have here is the government asking itself: ‘How do we change that? I guess what we start to do is use the Commonwealth largesse, we use the taxpayers' own money, to force certain employers to enter into arrangements or offer arrangements to employees.' This distraction, this sidelining of the substantial matter before us because of the Howard government's obsession with the industrial relations agenda of the seventies, does not help explain or help the government suggest that it cares about this area of public policy. As we know, it now seems to be unarguable that there is a skills shortage crisis. I mentioned yesterday in debate on another bill that the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation unanimously agreed there was a skills shortage crisis; that is, 10 members in total, including six government members, agreed that there was a crisis in this country and it had to be addressed. So no-one is suggesting that we should not be spending more of our resources to do something about it. But it seems to me that this proposal is based on a false premise. This policy was made on the run and is distracted by industrial relations matters. It is about perhaps taking over parts of the states' jurisdiction and not about focusing on training for young people. Notwithstanding all those reservations, I have had, and still have, one pleasant surprise, and that is the government has proposed that a college be located in Sunshine. Honourable member interjecting",57
42,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"No, not Ballarat. That area is also in dire need of training, and I am sure that you will hear a lot about that very soon from the member for Ballarat. Sunshine is an area with a real skills need. Many young people there do not have many opportunities to acquire particular training and skills for them to be gainfully employed. So I am very happy about this decision. That is one area I will not argue about with the government. I have said that the government quite often seems not to place the resources where they count or are needed but instead places them in areas that may assist incumbent government marginal seat holders. I still hold to that in the main. Looking at the sporting grants, you will see that the member for MCEwen got 16 of the 27 grants for the whole nation. Looking at some of the regional grants, you will see that the member for Wentworth got one-and I did not know that he was anywhere near a region. I do not want to disabuse anyone of the notion that there is a real problem. Ministhe ters have really big whiteboards. Talk about the whiteboard affair; the whiteboards in those ministers' offices must be very big. However, I do not want to be entirely unfair because on this occasion, notwithstanding the problems that are associated with the inception of the ATCs, there is a proposal that a college be located in Sunshine-a region that covers my electorate and the electorates of the members for Maribyrnong, Gellibrand, Lalor and those in that area. This will provide an opportunity for possibly up to 300 young people. I have said to the minister-and I have not changed my view on this-that, notwithstanding all those reservations, I want to see places for young people in this region. I will do everything I can to involve the industry in the area, along with educational institutions that are looking to involve themselves in consortia to take the lead in relation to the ATC that is proposed. I am happy to see that Victoria University has decided to take a proactive role in seeking to involve itself in establishing a so called ATC. Indeed, I would also thank Sunshine Secondary College, which, subject to its application being accepted, will play a very important role. I know it has a very strong interest in this and I understand it is genuine about what it is seeking to do. Along with other bodies, such as the AiG, and local businesses, it may have a chance to get something off the ground that might work. I believe that, notwithstanding the problems associated with this construction, we have to make good with what we have. In seeking to do that, I support the parties involved. However, there is no final position on that. It is important that I explain also that, when we talk about ATCs, no bricks and mortar are involved. The view held by many in the local media was that somehow there would be the construction of a site. Certainly, students will have to be housed in current arrangements, in either TAFE colleges, secondary colleges or the Victoria University. There is nothing wrong with that, but I think it is an important point to raise. It is important to alert the local community to that so that they do not have the misconception that the Commonwealth is somehow spending a significant sum of money to build a college. Indeed, it appears that the government is interested more in having a say over IR matters than it is in constructing discrete colleges. I have had conversations with a myriad of people who have shown an interest in the ATC proposal for Sunshine. I suppose that the money will go there and they will work in with it. But they told me that this is a waste of money. They told me that, in many respects, if the money were just given to TAFE colleges, a second level of bureaucracy would be cut out and we would have a better chance to deal with industry and supply apprenticeships at the workplace. Indeed, we would be more effective in doing that. My other concern is that, even if someone succeeds in finishing one of these so-called apprenticeships, it will not necessarily mean that they have a job. They will not be tied to employers and, therefore, will still be seeking work after the completion of their course. So I am concerned about how, with their level of competencies and qualifications after course completion, they will be accepted by industry. In the end, if this bill is enacted and the funding comes on stream allowing young people in my region to avail themselves of the opportunity to get further training, I will be assisting those industries and educational institutions that have shown an interestand, indeed, those young people who are in real need of opportunities. If you measure the suburbs I represent in the electorate of Gorton, you will see that their opportunities, when compared with those in many other parts of Melbourne and other parts of the country, are indeed wanting. This is a flawed option. This is a fly-by-night arrangement. But I will seek any opportunity, if ever I get it, to assist local young people to acquire the skills they need and hopefully the job they need.",59
43,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I am pleased to be able to associate myself with this important legislation, the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005, an initiative of the Howard government. I think it will bring great benefits to our national economy and also to local areas of need. The member for Gorton said that this was a flawed bill and that he did not really support it, but he was grateful that the area he represents had been determined as one of the 24 areas in need of a college. I appeal to those opposite to leave petty politics aside on this fundamental issue of relevance to all Australians. This bill, for first time in a major way, places a national focus on the importance of trades. It sets a pathway for dealing with the skill shortages that are a feature of our success in getting unemployment down. I will remind those opposite, who automatically think they have to oppose everything the government puts forward, of a couple of things. The member for Gorton said that this was something thought up at the last minute. Nothing is further from the truth. Policy consideration took place over many months and was taken to the last election, an election where we had ideas on a range of fronts-and this is one of them-and those opposite opposed them. They know in their own heads and hearts, and from their own electorates, that this policy was welcomed by the Australian people. It was one of the things that resonated with the public, who want to see a greater focus on trades and a greater recognition for the value of trades. The message I got in my electorate of Casey, the message the member for Gorton got in his electorate-which explains his on the one hand, on the other hand 20-minute contribution-and the message the member for Ballarat would have got in her electorate was that the public were grateful, relieved and fully supported the fact that the federal government, at a national level, was going to commit to Australian technical colleges. This is the result of governments at state and federal levels neglecting to see the value of trades 20 or 30 years ago, in the eighties. The message that we sent to school-aged kids was that the most important thing was a university education. The message that we sent in Australia was that, if you did not go on to university, somehow you had not succeeded-as if you could ever have a situation where every single student could go to university and do a degree. What happened, at the state level particuthe larly, was that trade schools were seen as places for second-class students, the value of apprenticeships declined and we ended up with a problem that requires resolution. The member for Gorton says that we should just give the money to the states. That is what we have been doing, but if that were to work it would have worked by now. That is the absolute bottom line. The states have more access to resources and have had massive increases in direct funding in this area. If giving the money to the states were to work it would have worked a long time ago. This is not just about money; it is, very importantly, about symbols, about ensuring that students who choose that pathway when they are 14, 15 and 16 know that it is a pathway of equal value: a pathway to a university or into a trade and an apprenticeship-a pathway that 70 per cent of young Australians, which is the number that do not go on to university, take. In local areas, particularly in my electorate of Casey, we need it. We do not just have the traditional trades-I will come back to this in due course-but we have new and emerging, technical and highly paid trades that require great skill and training. Some local industries, not just in Victoria but across Australia, are at the export frontier. The outer east and the Yarra Valley areas have the highest proportions of people working in trades. The demand for trade skills and vocational education is high. I appeal to those opposite to leave petty politics aside and concentrate on the big issue. We went to the last election with this policy. It received great support from the public and we are legislating it. The best thing opposition members could do for their communities is to support it. When this bill is passed by this House and the other place, it will inject $343 million over the forward four years into Australian technical colleges. It will establish over that period 24 technical colleges in areas of need. When they are all up and running it will see more than 7,000 young people every year going through those Australian technical colleges. What is wrong with having Australian technical colleges and state based technical colleges? What is wrong with having choice, a bit of competition, extra options and extra resources? What is wrong with the Australian government at a national level having a national focus on trades, in the same way that we have a national focus on universities? Nothing is wrong with it, which is precisely why the policy measure which was announced by the Prime Minister received such wide support throughout the election campaign in the great electorates of Casey, Deakin and Aston, where there is a need for this program. That is why it received support. Now that the election is over, of all the things that were said during the campaign, nothing resonated more strongly than the Prime Minister's statement-which he made when he announced this policy-that he wanted to see an Australia where someone was as proud of a trade qualification as they were of a university degree. Nothing resonated more strongly than that. Those opposite know that, because they went through the campaign trying to explain why they were opposed to the Australian technical colleges that people wanted. The election is over. The Leader of the Opposition from that time, who set them on that course, has departed and they have a wonderful opportunity to move forward, get out of the quicksand and try to support policy in an important area that will make a real difference. I want to briefly talk about the benefit that this bill will have in the electorates of Casey, Deakin and Aston-some of those 24 areas of need where there will be technical colleges. I alluded earlier to the fact that Casey has one of the highest proportions of people working in trades. It is a diverse electorate. It includes outer suburbs of Melbourne, part of the Yarra Valley and part of the Dandenong Ranges. By virtue of that, it has a mix of traditional trades in the automotive area, with great companies like Australian Automotive Air that are at the cutting edge of automotive technology and exporting right around the globe. As well, as you move into the Yarra Valley, you find the horticultural industry, which is increasingly becoming one of the major export success stories for Victoria and Australia. Minister De-Anne Kelly, who is sitting at the table, would be very familiar with the transformation that has happened in agribusiness in parts of the Yarra Valley and in parts of her electorate, where, over 20 years, trades that were once quite straightforward have become very technical. There is a great desire for people to do apprenticeships in the new and emerging areas of horticulture, viticulture and tourism, just to name a few. Those are industries that were not even thought of 20 or 50 years ago. Policy needs to change to reflect that and to fill the demand that is very much part of the outer suburban story in all our capital cities. At 5.1 per cent the unemployment rate nationally is a great success story. Casey is under the national average, at 4.1 per cent. The flipside of that is that the demand for skilled tradesmen is very high indeed. This bill is a major step forward. It is comed by the community. I particularly welcome the fact that community representatives and local businesses are involved at every stage. I think that is important for all of those 24 areas, so that those local businesses and local concerns very much help in the moulding of the trades and the vocational education that is offered in each particular area. It means that there will not be a one-size-fitsall approach and that in each of those 24 areas there will be some local recognition and involvement, which is critical on the ground. This is an important bill and one that should have the support of all members of this House and the other place. I commend it to the House.",61
44,Ms KING,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I rise to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005, which introduces the government's election commitment to establish 24 technical colleges for year 11 and 12 students. I also want to signal my support for the second reading amendments to be moved by the shadow minister for education and training, which highlight the absolute failure of this government to address Australia's skills needs. I am supporting the bill because, frankly, any action to improve the current situation is better than nothing. However, I hold serious concerns and reservations in relation to the lack of thought that has gone into this policy and the proposed establishment and operation of these Australian technical colleges. It is incumbent upon us in opposition to point out to the government where it has got policy wrong. This policy initiative has been a classic case of policy on the run. It seems that the policy was cobbled together at the last minute, to be dished up to the Australian public in the context of last year's election. It fails to seriously address Australia's skills crisis wel- and falls well short of what you would have hoped for in a nationally coordinated approach to addressing our skills needs. The lack of transparency surrounding the selection of areas to be targeted by this policy is a case in point. What criteria were used to determine the areas with the highest skills shortages? There are many questions hanging over the locations of the colleges, and it looks to me as though pork-barrelling has again come to the fore. There appears to be a strong correlation between coalition seats and marginal Labor held seats and proposed regions where the Australian technical colleges will be located. In fact, one of the only exceptions seems to be in Sunshine, and I share the surprise of the member for Gorton that there will be one located there at all. In addition, this bill duplicates many existing TAFE and secondary school structures, not only making an already complex system more difficult to manage and navigate for young people and employers but also wasting valuable resources by duplicating existing administrative systems and infrastructure. If you cast your mind back to the context in which this policy emerged, you would have hoped that the government had some clue about what it was actually trying to do. It had years in government with unions, employer groups and the media warning of a looming skills crisis. But instead of responding to this crisis the government is so ideologically opposed to the TAFE sector that it has starved it of funds. The government also failed to see the problems that this would create downstream in the declining numbers of Australians in trade apprenticeships. At the same time as running down the TAFE sector, the government has pursued market driven solutions to training through encouraging a plethora of privately registered training organisations. That is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but at the same time the government failed to recognise that, by not continuing to collect data on skills needs, it was contributing to a system operating with imperfect information. The system could never meet growing skills demands, because it did not know what they were or where they were. In a classic example of spin over substance, the government became so obsessed with how apprenticeship numbers were reported in the media and perceived by the public that it created New Apprenticeships. By rolling traditional trade apprenticeships and one-year traineeships together, the new classification hid the fact that trade apprenticeships were declining. The government failed to negotiate with the states and territories to develop a national plan to address training and skills needs. It also cut the ing guarantee, which provided a significant incentive to employers to take responsibility for continually upskilling their work force and staying ahead of the problems of the ageing work force. With all of this, it is no wonder that a skills crisis has emerged. The government's own policies have actively contributed to it. What has been the government's response? Despite all the advanced warning they have had about the looming skills crisis, their response has been a quickly cobbled together announcement on skilled migration and the rushed election announcement of the Australian technical colleges-the bill we are debating today. This announcement appeals to a popular notion which has no basis in fact: that the decline in trade apprenticeships is the direct result of the closure by state governments of tech schools. There is absolutely no basis in fact for this. I look at my own electorate and what has happened there. Sebastopol College-which used to be Sebastopol Technical Schoolhad a declining enrolment rate. Within my community, it was seen as the place of last resort for kids who were not going to go anywhere. Sebastopol tech was the place from where you might get into some trade training but it was in real trouble. Now in Sebastopol College you see a school absolutely filled with pride. Whether the kids from there go into university, stream into TAFE, go into arts or into their own businesses, there is room for every one of those kids. It is seen as one of the desirable schools within my electorate which, alongside Mount Clear College, have for some time been offering pathways into trade and vocational education and training. If the government were really serious about assisting industry and employers to do something about the skills crisis, it would have looked at better trainpathways between those two schools in my electorate and the TAFE college and the registered training organisations, rather than setting up new structures and duplicating existing structures. But no, it needed to try and have some sort of announcement during the context of an election campaign, so it decided to support the popular myth that unless you have a tech school you do not have tradespeople. That is just not true. Like most things that this government proposes, it sounds good on paper but the substance is lacking. The proposed initiative is scant on detail and appears to have been cobbled together at the last minute to curry favour within certain electorates. Of signifimodel. cant concern are the differing funding figures which are coming out of the government in relation to the colleges. At the time of their announcement in September 2004, it was stated that it would cost $289 million over four years for their creation. However, after looking at the proposal, the Department of Finance and Administration declared that they would now only cost $273 million over four years. This bill shows that the spending will again be reduced to $225 million. It seems pretty clear that the government simply had no idea how much it would actually cost and simply pulled a figure out of the air for the benefit of its election campaign. There is also the question of the fees that students who attend these Australian technical colleges will pay. It seems that the government has changed its stance on this. The Prime Minister declared that there would be no fees charged at the colleges-after all, these are for year 11 and year 12 secondary school students. Despite this promise, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education has since claimed that there will be no additional fees for students attending Austrapeared lian technical colleges, which is a far cry from there being no fees charged to students attending Australian technical colleges. Another prime example of the arrogance of this government with this bill is that the government's supporting documentation does not even indicate a possible model as to how these colleges might operate. I understand that different models will need to operskills ate in different locations and that the government is keen to get ideas from local communities as to how these colleges might operate, but I would have hoped that the minister had at least a bit of an idea about how these were going to work and how his policy proposal was going to be implemented. Communities have had to scrabble around desperately trying to develop a Many are now calling them ‘virtual technical colleges' because there are no buildings involved in many of the expressions of interest that have been put in. They have really had to struggle to develop a model, with absolutely no guidelines from the government, all because the government did not have a clue. The government made the policy announcement but did not know how it was going to implement it. The departmental officials have had to go around and say: ‘What does this thing actually mean? What is it going to look like?' They are still not really sure. Although there will be some standard governance and administrative requirements, without strong guidelines for operation they will not be as effective and efficient as they possibly could be. It is simply another example of the government cobbling this policy together at the last minute in the election campaign. Furthermore, the funding arrangements for individual colleges are also extremely vague. Many of the conditions on which funding will be based are not included in this bill that we are debating but have apin speeches and public comments by the minister and others-they are yet to be formalised. I am going to support the bill because I think something is better than nothing when trying to assist young people into trades that better match industry needs. But while supporting the bill for this reason, I do not believe that it adequately addresses the chronic shortages affecting many communities, including my own. We are currently experiencing a situation where there has been a statistically significant and sustained decline between 1993 and 2001 in the training rates in traditional trades-a statistically significant decline in trade apprenticeships from 1993 to 2001. The ACTU has estimated that Australia will experience a shortage of around 130,000 skilled workers over the next five years at the current rate of decline. The plan to create 24 Australian technical colleges will not fix this problem. Rather, Australian businesses desperate for skilled work- ticeships. ers will have to wait until 2010 to see the first graduates and until 2011 and 2012 before the vast bulk of qualified tradespeople emerge into the work force. The shortage of skilled workers demands a more broadly based solution attacking the problem on a multitude of fronts. There must be greater investment in existing institutions such as secondary schools and TAFE in order to expand vocational training opportunities within the curriculum. In addition, it is essential that there be incentives for individuals who start trade apprenticeships to actually complete those apprenticeships. In my electorate, there are approximately 580 apprenticeships, and the estimated noncompletion rate is 40 per cent. Of those 580 apprentices who start their trade, 230 will drop out of that training. If you do not have some sort of incentive to make sure that they complete that training then you are really not going to do anything about that 40 per cent. With this sort of drop-out rate, the government should be encouraging young people who commence a trade to actually complete the trade. Within the Howard government's Australian technical colleges policy there are no incentives or assistance for people to actually gain employment afterwards or to complete their trade training. We have come out with our trade completion bonus, a policy to try to build incentives into the system to make sure that apprentices who start their trade apprenticeships actually get to finish them. One of the other policy announcements that the government has made has been about increasing skilled migration. So you have two policy fronts-skilled migration and the Australian technical colleges. You do not have a broad-based approach to try to increase the number of people who are employed or who are completing trade apprenPeople in this place will be pretty familiar now with the story of MAXITRANS, a wellrespected supplier of retail road transport trailing solutions within my electorate. MAXITRANS had to employ labourers from offshore, simply because there had not been enough investment in apprenticeship places, particularly in welding and metal fabrication, over the past five years to enable it to employ local people to meet its contract obligations. This is in an electorate where there is a teenage unemployment rate of 34 per cent. The government does not have a strong vision to fix this skills crisis. The push for increased skilled migration is a short-term solution. They should be looking at what the problems and disincentives are for young people going into trades in the first place and trying to do something about those. I can only imagine how the young unemployed and their parents must feel when, because of a lack of planning and a lack of investment by this government, they see tradespeople from overseas coming to Ballarat to fill vacancies. Additionally, the government has again brought out the populist myth that kids should leave school early and be discouraged from staying on if they do not intend to further their education beyond year 12, as though somehow schools are forcing them to stay in meaningless education. Many teenagers who believe universities are not the best option for them-and there are many of them, and so there should be-leave school with very little idea of their alternatives. If they are not assisted in that first year of leaving school, they are at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The issue is not so much at what year young people leave school; it is what they leave school to go firmly believe that, unless young people either have an apprenticeship or a solid job offer with training prospects or are enrolled in another course, they should be actively encouraged to stay engaged in the education system as long as possible, until they do have those things lined up. I hear too many stories of young people and older people failing basic year 9 literacy and numeracy tests within my electorate when they go for jobs. With teenage unemployment rates in my electorate at 34 per cent, who does the Prime Minister think these kids are who are unemployed for this length of time? They are, on the whole, early school leavers who now have been unemployed for well over 12 months and have little prospect of finding a job. The Prime Minister is keen to create a further decline in this area in his call for more young people to leave school earlier. This will only lead to there being more young people who have few prospects into the future. Without clear pathways to training and employment, there will be no change to the skills crisis. I want to return now to the point about the location of these colleges. I think it represents a real problem of credibility for the government. As I mentioned earlier, there is a significant correlation between coalition held seats and the 24 proposed regions for the Australian technical colleges. All, I believe, were announced during the 2004 election campaign. According to the Australian technical colleges web site, Queanbeyan was announced as an area where a college would be built, as decided by the minister. Interestingly, Queanbeyan is in Eden-Monaro, a seat hotly contested by both sides in the last election. Other targets included the region surrounding Bairnsdale and Sale. That region is in another hotly contested seat, which was held by the Nationals' Peter MCGauran. Corangamite was also targeted, with a techto. I nical college being located in Geelong. We have also just heard from the member for Casey that a technical college is going to benefit the members for Deakin, Aston and Casey. That college will be located in an area with an unemployment rate of only 4.1 per cent. There has been absolutely no transparency about how the locations for these colleges were selected. Were these locations selected on the basis of need in relation to lack of training availability, apprenticeship numbers in a given region, unfilled job vacancies, employment prospects and industry demands? Who would know? This has been a cobbled together policy, with the 24 locations announced in the context of a federal election. The skills crisis is of particular concern in the electorate of Ballarat. There are simply not enough individuals in the traditional trades and there is a high youth unemployment rate. I know that there is a great deal of anger in the region about the fact that Ballarat was overlooked as a location for an Australian technical college by the Howard government, despite the situation facing the region. In fact, the City of Ballarat and BRACE, a registered training organisation, have put in separate proposals to the government and have challenged the government to say how these 24 locations were decided and why it has not decided that there are other areas of need and what it is going to do about those in relation to Ballarat, and they have tried to come up with some solutions for the government about those matters. Another issue of concern that is highlighted in this bill is the issue of duplication. There are numerous impacts in relation to this that have not been considered. Of concern to some schools is the potential threat that duplication poses to the viability of existing government and non-government schools, TAFE programs and infrastructure. Due to the fact that traditional trades training will be streamed into these Australian technical colleges, there may in some instances be reduced demand for the existing institutions and services and for vocational education and training within those schools. Those are the things that schools have been raising with me. Similarly, low participation in government funded institutions and services will lead to reduced funding or possibly the removal of funding due to decreased popularity. This can be seen in the fact that there is no significant new funding for the Commonwealth State Training Funding Agreement, which covers TAFE programs, accompanying this bill. So duplication is another issue. In the remaining time. I have, I want to touch very briefly on the industrial relations agenda contained in the bill. It is also evident that the Howard government is attempting to push through its industrial relations mantra in this Australian technical colleges bill. Here we have a government which spends more time pushing its own political agenda than it does on deciding how much money it is going to spend on implementing its policy proposals. Though not explicit in the bill itself-but detailed in statements supporting it-funding for individual colleges will be influenced by their promotion of Australian workplace agreements. Specifically, this bill has the effect of funding not being available to Australian technical colleges unless Australian workplace agreements are offered to staff. Perhaps of great concern to staff at these Australian technical colleges is the potential autonomy of the principals. They will be free to set performance pay packages, as well as having substantial power in employment. I am also concerned that in smaller communities, as has happened to just about everything controlled by this government, these places will simply become Liberal Party mates clubs, rather than being places that necessarily assist young people into trades. I will be watching with great interest the appointments to the boards of the colleges in the 24 locations. The government, in pursuing this industrial relations agenda through the Australian technical colleges bill, is not guaranteeing that you will get the best trained, qualified and experienced staff. In fact it is a thirdparty meddling between employers and employees by dictating that Australian workplace agreements must be offered. I think the member for Gorton made an extremely important point in his contribution to this debate: nowhere does the Workplace Relations Act state that employers must offer enterprise bargaining agreements to employees. Why is the government absolutely determined that individual contracts have to be a condition of funding for Australian technical colleges? You would have to say it is purely driven by ideology, not by a desire for real flexibility in the workplace or by making sure that you get the best possible people in these colleges to train people. I will be supporting this bill, despite its many weaknesses. The 24 Australian technical colleges are a response to a problem, but it is neither adequate nor timely. One of the major flaws of the policy is that it lacks substance. This policy was cobbled together at the last minute by a government keen to win votes at the last election, and the policy continues to be changed from one day to the next in both the funding allocated to it and what the colleges will actually look like. There is no clear framework. (Time expired)",63
45,Mrs MOYLAN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005. I was listening quite carefully to what the member for Ballarat had to say, and I think she made a useful contribution to the debate, but I have to say it does concern me when people start saying that our government has not done anything to address the skills shortage and has created problems in this area. As I hark back to Labor's administration, it developed a culture which really only valued university education and neglected technical and skills training. And I think the unions also have to take some responsibility for having contributed to ensuring that technical and skills training became a stumbling, lumbering dinosaur and locked into a 1950s mentality. I remember going just a few years ago to visit a die-making factory. The people there had rung me-I think I was shadow minister for small business at the time-and they raised the skills training issue with me. This is when Labor were in power. They were saying that they were unable to get the government to consider new technology and new training methods in skilling up die makers. Indeed, they had so much work they were turning it away; it was going to Korea and other countries but coming back to them to do the finishing. They were able to produce the work more competitively, cost-wise, but also at a higher quality. The whole family was engaged in the business working seven days a week. The problem was that die making required somebody to first do an apprenticeship in fitting and turning and then go on to die making. I think, if my recollection is right, it was a six-year program. It meant by the time somebody was into the second apprenticeship in die making they were adults on adults' pay, and it just became uneconomic. But the most important point was: why were we persisting with the 1940s1950s model of skilling die makers when most of the work was being done by computer aided technology? The whole industry had changed so much we needed a new approach and it was not forthcoming under the previous government. I know that the Australian National Training Authority has done a very good job-and there was debate on that issue earlier-but I think governments have a responsibility to modernise their approach to skills training. This government has certainly tried to do that. I believe deeply in education at all levels. I think we desperately need those people who have great intellectual skills and make a tremendous contribution through our universities. We have produced some brilliant people in all fields-science, medicine, the arts, culture, the social sciences-and right across the disciplines. Their contribution is tremendous, but if we look at people in any profession, whether they be a brain surgeon, an engineer or an architect, for them to be able to do the work they do there have to be people who are capable of designing and producing the range of equipment and materials needed for them to operate effectively. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Brendan Nelson, has widened the public debate about the whole issue of education, to bring some level of balance back into it and to send out a signal to our young people that says: ‘We value you. We value you for whatever talent you can bring to your community.' Young people have a variety of talents. Not everyone wants to or can pursue the intellectual pursuits required in the discipline of getting a university degree. But that in no that way devalues the contribution that many of our young people can and do make to our communities. I see this in our schools. I have to say that I am always very pleased when I go to visit a school in my electorate. It is hard to publicly credit them all, but I took the minister to the Swan View Senior High School recently. They have a large number of Aboriginal students. They have worked so hard in helping these young people discover their talents. They value those talents and the school works hard to make sure those students make the most of whatever abilities they have. They have a program which has been very successful in encouraging both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students to complete their schooling; but, more importantly, they value the talent of their students and try to direct them into the areas where they are most suited. I met two students who had come back to the school for the occasion who had graduated from the school in jewellery making and design. They had been invited to work for one of the top jewellers in New York, and today they are working for one of Perth's top jewellers. They are wonderful young people who are lit and enthusiastic about what they are doing. They feel like they are valued for their talents and the way they contribute to their families and their communities. I would like to give some credit to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Brendan Nelson because, since he has taken over this portfolio, he has worked extremely hard to bring balance into the policy to ensure that the message about valuing young people's talents and abilities, wherever they are, is recognised. The Motor Trade Association of Western Australia came to me because funding was going to be removed from some very successful pilot projects that were set up by the automotive training industry in WA. At their request, I talked it through with the minister to see if we could make sure the funding for these pilots would be ongoing. These pilots have successfully concluded. They were about making sure that young people understood what the modern motor trade industry is all about and the kinds of skills they need in this day and age to build motor vehicles and all the systems we have come to appreciate in motor vehicles. They had been having trouble recruiting new people into the motor trades, but there are now a number of young people attached to the Swan TAFE college who are doing apprenticeships in the motor trades area. The program was also about convincing the parents to encourage their young people to look at options other than university. Some people will feel very defeated if a university degree is all that is valued in our communities, and I do not think that is a healthy situation. There are lots of other programs in other schools. Northam and Narrogin have very good programs to recognise and encourage the development of individual skills. They value that and they make sure young people know they are valued for that. This bill makes sure that we have an investment in education. It is not an expense; it is an investment. Education is an investment in an outcome that is very important not only to our industries and our ongoing national prosperity but also to the development of our young people. It is an investment in making sure our young people feel that they are valued contributors to their community and that they are able to reach their goals and aspirations and make a contribution they can feel proud of. The funding of $343 million over five years is no small commitment to supporting an initiative to locate colleges throughout Australia which, I understand, will provide tuition for 7,200 students, with up to 300 students in each college. The first of these colleges will be operational, I understand, from around 2007. As I said, education is a key element not just for Australia's future but for every person to have an opportunity to maximise their abilities and develop themselves as contributing members of their families and the wider community.",68
46,Mr HATTON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL," Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as you would know, one of the benefits of being a Deputy Speaker is that you get to listen to other people in the debate. If you are speaking in the debate, it is particularly helpful to get a broad cross-view of what people in both the government and the opposition have been saying. It is also particularly useful if you want to track the ‘snail trails' given to government members-the specific phrases and arguments which they should include in and mould their speeches around. The level of cant, humbug and propaganda at the core of the government speeches on this trade issue is almost unbelievable-except when put into a larger context. Throughout this parliament and the last parliament we have had the absurd situation of government minister after minister-and now member after member-talking about the dreadful situation in the 1980s when Labor was in office federally. They have argued that federal Labor in the eighties and nineties was trying to convince everybody in Australia that only a university education was worthwhile. That is cant, humbug and pure propaganda. The people who represent the Labor Party in this House today and the Labor Party governments since Federation have worked with might and main towards the goal of a proper, appropriate and full education for people at all levels of the educational spectrum. The government's argument is inverse snobbery-but they have been doing this for so long and so insistently, with speaker after speaker parroting the line that has come out from the minister, that it needs a bit of extra time and a bit of extra exposure. The member for Pearce, in what was otherwise a reasoned speech, pulled out this line and said, ‘Isn't it terrible that in the eighties people were told-and young people have been influenced by this-that the only real thing is a university education?' Where did I hear that line before today? I heard it from the member for MCPherson. You can tell she is a believer by the fervour with which she put this forward. She was talking about an underrating of the trades. She said, ‘There is a problem in the electorate in that people underrate the trades.' She then went on and used the same sort of line: ‘This is really a problem caused by the previous federal Labor government. People only want to go to university; they've been told that that is the only thing to do.' The reality, from my point of view, is that from 1996 until now this federal government has pulled not only money and resources but also application towards the task away from the whole question of providing education at the trade level in Australia. They have denuded the states' capacities to do a proper job at the TAFE level, in exactly the same way as they have denuded the states' abilities to properly care for and administer the states' hospital systems-there has been in the order of a billion dollars pulled out of that. We know what they have done progressively to rip away the very foundation of effective trades training in Australia. We also know that when the former member for Goldstein, Dr Kemp, was Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in Australia, the government introduced the notion of ‘new apprenticeships' and the government-not only when he was a minister but through successive ministers and members-argued the great glories of new apprenticeships. The reality is that new apprenticeships are traineeships. They are not full, old-style apprenticeships; they are the quick and easy method of trying to get people through as fast as you can in areas that are not hard-core trade areas but are the ones seen as vocationally appropriate because there is an increased demand-fair enough-and where you could push a lot of people through without putting much money in and say, ‘Gee, haven't we done a terrific job with apprenticeships? See how we have fixed this with all this burgeoning growth in apprenticeships.' You could now argue that there has been a 40-year decline in fundamental apprenticeship training in Australia, but this government has supposedly fixed it by cutting real and significant money from technical and further education institutes Australia wide. At the same time the government has introduced a group of traineeships which were second-order apprenticeships. They required less time, less effort in terms of how they were put together, less application and less intensive approaches in terms of the amount of money that education institutions needed to invested. So here we have government membersthe member for Pearce and, previously, the member for MCPherson-arguing this wellworn line that the government tries to get in wherever they can. They say, ‘Labor are snobs and Labor only want people to be educated at university.' But the best and clearest statement. I have heard so far of the government's real argument came from the member for Casey. He said, ‘One message sent in the eighties was that you had to go to a university.' He talked about that a little bit and he went on to talk about what this bill is about and what this debate is about. He said, ‘It is not just about whether you go to university or do a trade but it is about symbols.' He said that the pathways should be of equal value, and that there should be an equal value between universities and trades or apprenticeships. This argument is a bit like that of Mr Blair-in the United Kingdom, where it may have been marginally appropriate-arguing that there was something called New Labour. People were coming to Australia and saying, ‘Where there was an old distinction between the hard left and the hard right in Britain, New Labour could come forward as a completely new product.' Some people then took that and said, ‘Well, let's place it in Australia.' I have always thought that it was an absurd notion that a new labour party needed to be set up in any context where there was a mixed economy and where there was no real fundamental argument between hard right and hard left, and between capitalism and communism. Equally, to argue here that you need to impose some kind of new reality-a new symbol-to say that there should be equality between the universities and the trades is bordering on the insane. This could only arise out of the cant, humbug and propaganda that the government have been proceeding with for a defined purpose-to try to turn upside down people's normal perceptions of what the Labor Party is about, what this opposition has striven to achieve, and what we fundamentally value as really important foundation stones of the society. Education, whether it be through trade training or university, is fundamentally important to this economy. This government has walked away from technical and further education for the last 9¼ years. This government came up with its own bright idea, just before the last election when the penny then was dropping: maybe new apprenticeships were not enough in those soft trade areas. Maybe the fact that the ACTU said that there are 130,000 skilled trades jobs going begging in Australia, because this government has not put the effort in and has not been concerned enough to provide for the future, is finally starting to be realised. As the member for Reid so cogently argued, in the 9¼ years that this government has not done what it should have done in skilled trade provision through our education system-(1) because it is too hard, (2) because they do not want to do it, (3) because it would cost too much money and effort, or (4) because they were ideologically against it-it has, instead, substituted skilled people from overseas. They have increased the program from 77,000 to 97,000 skilled migrants per year. They are bringing people into Australia because they are not training young Australian people in trades. The government have the temerity to argue that we on our side do not value trade trading and that we value university education above that. They have deserted the field for 9¼ years and deserted the thousands of kids who wanted to get into TAFE places year after year, but now those hundreds of thousands of people who could have gained trade trading over that 9¼ years, if there had been proper support from the Commonwealth for the TAFE system, have been utterly placed outside the system. Instead of providing that support-it is not well known, but the member for Reid referred to it here this very day-we have the other great substitution. It is not the yearly intake; it is the four-year temporary entry visas that have been given to people who are already skilled tradespeople to allow them to come into Australia and to work at their skill and who are then expected to leave. When this was first introduced it was for companies like IBM or Xerox or the other major multinationals who argued a case to government that people with specific trade capacities were not available for their particular industry or that, because of the nature of their multinational organisation, they needed someone from the Singapore office or the Ottawa office to be in Australia for a fouryear period in order to let their company run well and profitably. They would be given a four-year temporary entry permit and at the end of those four years they would be off to somewhere else within the company's multinational structure. There have been 440,000 people who have come under that scheme during the time that this government has been in office. Guess what: this is the great hidden migration into Australia. A government that, while it was in opposition, spent more than a decade pillorying our government over the immigration issue has been running a secret immigration program. Apart from the fact that it has dramatically jacked up the level of immigration into Australia under the total program and the skills program, almost half a million people have been brought into this country, and at the end of the four years, guess what: they are not going back to IBM or Xerox or some other multinational. These are tradespeople from Ireland, England and other places in Europe who come into Australia, and at the end of four years they rock up to the immigration department. There are 50,000 or 60,000 people a year who say: ‘Look, I've been working here for four years. I'd like to apply to stay in Australia. These are my trade skills. This is where I've been working. I'll sign your form. Thank you very much for that reduction in the number of points I need. I am now going to become a proud permanent resident of Australia.' Every one of those 50,000 to 60,000 people is taking a place in the work force from people born in Australia, educated in Australian primary schools and secondary schools and not able to get a place in an Australian technical and further education college. Mr Ciobo-What a disgraceful comment.",70
47,Mr HATTON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Yes, it is disgraceful, Member for Moncrieff. It is disgraceful, because for 9¼ years this government has presided over a reduction in trade training in this country. This is a government that does not believe in training in hard educational skills areas and that does not believe in all the traditional trades because its costs a lot more money and because the institutions of old that used to provide it-Telstra, the State Rail Authority and others-have been so changed in their nature that they are no longer major providers of apprenticeships and training in Australia. But the government has decided that it could not do it or that it did not want to do it, so we have a substitution racket going on. The government is not providing the real education that is needed but is providing for increased immigration and special programs that have been hidden from public view where you have people substituting for the people that we owe our first loyalty toAustralians born and bred, who should have the ability to go and do what they want to do. If they want to do trade training, they should be able to get into that trade training and be supported through it by the national government, which should properly support technical and further education, and by the state governments. If they are not working hard enough at those programs, make sure that you take the leaders in national government and get the changes made. What do we have in this bill? We have another substitution for really tackling the damental problems that Australia faces in the trade skills area. We have a substitution of 24 colleges, strategically placed in marginal seats-except, as we have heard, in the case of the member for Gorton and the area of Sunshine in his seat, to his fundamental surprise. We have technical colleges where the fundamental prerequisite is not contained in this bill at all. Go to the web site and you will find it; go to the minister's instruction and you will find it. We do not have bricks and mortar technical colleges; these are technical colleges that will exist within ing technical colleges or schools. Or they will be almost virtual technical colleges, because the $343.6 million that is being provided by these bills will go towards people trying to aggregate demand, to put together proposals for trade training in the traditional trades on the fundamental ground that you cannot be in it unless you have Australian workplace agreements. That is a fundamental prerequisite. Those Australian technical colleges, if they are dealing with and taking services from other entities, also have to have Australian workplace agreements in place if they are going to be part of that process. As the member for Gorton so cogently pointed out-and I would not be aware of it, except that I was in the chair and listened to what he said, and he made a fundamental case-in 9¼ years the government, so utterly wedded to Australian workplace agreements, have achieved a mere three per cent rate of placement. Try as they might throughout the Commonwealth Public Service and everywhere else they could put pressure on, they have not been able to convince people that these things are good. So what are they doing? It is not in this bill; it is outside this bill, but it is still mandated as a fundamental foundation. If you want to put a technical college together, you have to sign up to a fun- mandated Australian workplace agreement. You do not get all the other choices that every other business in Australia gets. There is the argument that the college will be run by a body overseen by local businesspeople and that it will have a feed from local business in terms of the needs within the area. But I thought that was what we had achieved in technical and further education. That is the way it was grounded. That is the way it has grown. That is why it is a fundamental and vital part of our educational system. What we have in this legislation is a existproposal that you can have technical and further education operating as the new ATC model only if you accept the propagandist basis of the government's approach to industrial relations. This is the government's religious basis. If you look at the policies of John Howard from 1974 on, the member for Bennelong has consistently been about one fundamental thing-the introduction of an IR system that is his preferred IR system. Come 1 July and after, no doubt we will see more of it. The member for Gorton was right: in this bill and other bills the fundamental religious impulse is evident. I think it is a good thing to have a division between church and state when it comes to running a government in a civil society. I think the religious nature of the Prime Minister's attachment to his particular approach to IR beggars that distinction between church and state. It has gone beyond the normal, rational bounds. To have in this bill a fundamental provision that is outside education and training but is a prerequisite for those 24 technical colleges getting a guernsey-they have to sign up to an exclusive, mandated system of industrial relations, vocations. including Australian workplace agreements-is just beyond belief. Further, to have the line run by one government member after the other-and, indeed, argued by the member for MCPherson-that the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people at large are at fault because they do not value trades training highly enough is an absurd inversion of the truth. is propaganda over reality. What this government has not gone near, even with the introduction of this proposal, is that, if you do not train people and train them well enough and adequately enough, if you do not have enough skilled workers across all of the fundamental areas in an economy-an economy that is much more complex, much more diversified, much bigger and a much more difficult challenge than before because of the changes in the 1980s and 1990s-you will not have future productivity and the ture levels of growth that you should have. You will have an economy running into the doldrums, which is what we have now. (Time expired)",73
48,Mr CIOBO,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I am very pleased to speak to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005. portant bill because it firmly delivers on a commitment that I and, more broadly, the coalition made during the last campaign. During the last campaign, it was my pleasure to join with my colleagues on the Gold Coast in announcing to the people of Moncrieff that the Gold Coast would be the location for the establishment of one of 24 Australian technical colleges. I highlight that the establishment of these colleges represents a concrete step forward. More young Australians will have the opportunity to undertake skills based new apprenticeships at a time when Australia certainly needs additional skilled young Australians in traditional trades and From my perspective, this bill is a very real way in which the Howard government once again demonstrates its responsiveness to what is a very serious skills shortage in Australia. It is a skills shortage that is born as a consequence of 14 years of strong economic growth which is, of itself, a by-product of having a government that is able It to manage the economy effectively and responsibly and to ensure that all Australians have a higher standard of living and a better chance of securing a job, of obtaining a good education and, more importantly, of living out the rest of their lives in a safe and secure environment, both economically and socially. That stands in stark contrast to the legacy of the Australian Labor Party and to the diaall tribe of sorts that I heard from the member for Blaxland when it comes to not only their fu- attack on Australian technical colleges but also the perverse way in which they have got so fundamentally wrong what has occurred in Australia over the last decade and four years. In particular, I am amazed that the Australian Labor Party credit the skills shortage to the Howard government not providing enough skills training. I will turn to It is an imthat issue in just a moment. More importantly, the Australian Labor Party talk about how there was no skills crisis while they were in government. There is a simple reason why there was no skills crisis while the Australian Labor Party were in government. It was because there was a jobs crisis when they were in government. When the Australian Labor Party were in government, there was an 11 per cent unemployment rate. There were record interest rates. The overall result was that Australians had very limited opportunity. Young Australians would be going through school uncertain of whether there would even be a job to go into when they graduated. That is the legacy of the Australian Labor Party. That is the reason why there was no skills crisis under the Australian Labor Party. People were in a jobs crisis and were going around trying to secure any form of employment they possibly could at a time when we were apparently having the recession we had to have. It was at a time when Paul Keating and the Australian Labor Party were standing up and boasting about the fact that they had got interest rates up to 18 per cent, they were breaking the back of inflation and what a good message it was for all Australians. They are not sentiments that I subscribe to in the slightest. I turn very briefly to the accusation that the member for Blaxland made when he said that fewer Australians are in training now than there were when the Australian Labor Party were in power. I heard comments echoed by members opposite to the effect that the member for Blaxland was right. Let us just look at the reality. Let us look at apprentice and trainee participation rates for 15to 19-year-olds: in 1996, the participation rate was 5.9 per cent; in 2003, the participation rate was 8.3 per cent. What about the training rate? Again, to tackle head-on the erroneous examples that the member for Blaxland gave, the training rate was 11.2 per cent when the Howard government was elected in 1996, and it is now 16.3 per cent. That is a very different story to what members opposite allege. It is an entirely different story message that the opposition would like people to believe in this chamber-if they were to sit down and swallow hook, line and sinker the line that the Australian Labor Party are running. Likewise, there is the line that the Australian Labor Party runs about how these technical training colleges are wrong because they sit outside the TAFE system. Let us look at the TAFE system-something that traditionally was meant to provide for Australia's vocational education and training. We see what an abject failure the TAFE system has been, predominantly, I would argue, because state Labor governments give TAFE absolutely no priority at all. It is interesting to compare the cost of education at a TAFE college on the Gold Coast with the cost of education at a university. Not only is there no deferred payment scheme for vocational education and training under TAFE, which sits in contrast to what occurs at universities, but the cost of undertaking a course at TAFE, thanks to the Queensland state government, includes an up-front payment and is also actually more expensive than the cost of doing a university course and paying HECS fees. That shows the perverse way in which state Labor governments continue to ignore the TAFE system and fail to provide TAFE funding which would empower young Australians and provide training opportunities for them into the future. To get back to the comments that the member for Blaxland made, what most upset me in his contribution was the hoary old chestnut that in some way skilled immigrants coming into this country take away jobs that belong to Australians. I really thought that thinking like that was ejected from this country in the 1940s and 1950s. I really thought that members of the Australian Labor Party would have more moral fibre than to come into this chamber and try to portray immito the grants as taking jobs off Australians. It is an absolute disgrace that the Australian Labor Party would claim that immigrants coming into this country detract from the overall fabric of Australian society and deny young Australians job opportunities. It is an outright lie and we have decades of experience to indicate why that is incorrect. Make no mistake: Australia is a nation built not only by those of us who were born here but, more importantly, by a very significant proportion of immigrants. They add to Australia's social fabric in a very meaningful realistic way. Despite the roly-poly, topsyturvy economics of the Australia Labor Party, any person with a basic knowledge of economics would be able to explain that immigrants actually help grow the economy, promote job opportunities and promote opportunities for business. And skilled immigrants bring wealth into this nation, which means that all Australians are better off. is a lesson that the Australian Labor Party obviously need to learn before they make allegations that immigrants take jobs from Australians. It is wrong. Regarding the Australian technical college that will be operating on the Gold Coast, I have been very pleased with the very strong response I have received from industry and stakeholders in training organisations on the Gold Coast. In particular, we have a booming hospitality industry on the Gold Coast, coupled with a booming construction and building industry and a booming marine industry. These three industries represent very great and significant opportunities for young Gold Coasters. These three industries provide career paths and security of employment for young Australians. They also, of course, have an unrelenting demand at this point for new people to move into these industries to acquire skills and ensure that they continue to add value to the activities that industry is undertaking in these three areas hospitality, marine and construction. A number of consortia have approached me about putting in bids for the Australian technical college that will be built on the Gold Coast. Whilst I have not attached myself to any particular bid, overall I have been exceptionally impressed by the way in which stakeholders and industry are working collaboratively to ensure the success of the Australian technical college that ultimately will be placed on the Gold Coast. Irrespective of which consortium is successful it demonand strates the way in which you can use collaboration between industry and training organisations to maximum effect. For example, I have had the Australian Institute of Training and Development, the Restaurant and Caterers Association, marine industry representatives, Bond University, Griffith University, Boss Homes, AB Paterson College and other high schools on the Gold Coast all sitting That down together to talk about what they need to do hand in hand to provide opportunities for young Australians. The establishment of the new Australian technical college on the Gold Coast is part of the national framework that this bill provides. Funding of $343.6 million will be provided over the next four years to support infrastructure development and the additional costs associated with the delivery of the specialised programs the Australian technical colleges will provide. I think it is very good that we are encouraging young Australians to undertake their secondary studies in years 11 and 12 and at the same time undertake school based new apprenticeships. The fact that the Gold Coast Australian technical college will specialise in a particular tradeand we do not know which trade until the successful bidder is announced, but presumably it will be in one of those three industries of hospitality, building and construction or marine-and also provide for at least of three additional trades is a positive for young Gold Coasters. The fact that this bill also has a requirement for colleges to be linked to a registered training organisation and to have a governing body chaired by a local businessperson and consisting of local industry and community representatives, as well as providing flexible employment arrangements through AWAs, means that these Australian technical colleges will not only be flexible but will be practical and, most importantly, will ensure that they are responsive to the needs of industry and can adapt to ensure that the education provided to young people undertaking their studies at these colleges will be the best and most relevant to their future endeavours. I will make some concluding remarks about these ATCs. First and foremost, I am very pleased to be able to deliver on a commitment that I and my colleagues on the Gold Coast gave to ensure that there will be a new ATC on the Gold Coast. I am very impressed with the high level of collaboration between industry and training providers. I wish all of them well with their respective bids. I am certainly looking forward to seeing the new ATC on the Gold Coast. Because of industry, government and training providers all working together, young Gold Coasters going forward will have the best opportunity they have had for many years to secure a relevant education and complete their secondary studies. Industry will be provided with young Australians, well trained in specialist skills, who can be sure of a secure job future and be sure that, whatever industry they go into, they can meet employers' demands. They will have a guarantee-or as close as one can get to a guarantee-of ongoing employment. I commend the bill to the House and urge all to support it.",75
49,Ms GEORGE,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Throsby) (1.46 pm)Before I comment on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005 and the obvious limitations that I see in the government's response to the skills crisis that is facing our nation today I want to respond to a number of remarks made by the member for Moncrieff. I was very disappointed with his response because it typifies the attitude of this government. The government would not acknowledge the crisis in terms of skills shortages across a range of traditional industries. Now even the business lobby has been telling the government that this skills crisis is one of the substantial constraints facing business across our nation. Belatedly, the very Howard government have now come to realise that there is such a thing as a genuine skills crisis, but they will not accept any responsibility for the fact that this crisis has developed while they have been asleep on the watch. There is nobody the government can blame other than itself for allowing this situation to develop. In 2004, according to independent advice by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research, there was a four per cent drop in the number of trainees and apprentices in training nationally in Australia. When the member for Moncrieff and others on the government side come into this House pretending that this crisis does not exist-even though belatedly acknowledging that problems are emerging in a range of industries-it is always somebody else's fault; it is never the government's fault. I can tell the member for Moncrieff and others on the government side that I looked at the figures in my own electorate of Throsby. I asked the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education just what occurred from 1996, when the Howard government was elected, to 2004. On the government's own admission, the number of trades and related workers in training-that is, apprentices in training in the traditional trades areas-fell from a level of 880 in 1996 to 870 people in training in 2004. So in my electorate we are training fewer people in the traditional trades than in the first year of the Howard government. And having 870 people in training in 2004 was a marked improvement on what was happening in the early 2000s. In 2001, the number of people in training had fallen to only 630. The member for Moncrieff and the government continue to obfuscate the issue. They talk about the huge growth in the training of new apprenticeships, as the member for Moncrieff did, without distinguishing those who are in training as trainees and those who are in training in the traditional trades. It is true to say that in the electorate of Throsby in 2004 there were 2,150 trainees and apprentices engaged in training, a substantial increase over the 1996 figures. But when you break down the figures, you find that there has been a huge decline in the areas of greatest need-the traditional trades. I understand that the government went to the last election with a promise to create 24 new technical colleges and that two tenders have been submitted from my region for the creation of such a college. The colleges in themselves are not something that we on this side of the House oppose, but we do oppose what we see as the government's very limited response to the skills crisis that is confronting people today. It is here. It is in front of all of us. It is in front of businesses in my electorate. It is a crisis that is going to At best, the proposals that the government has incorporated into this bill will only see students graduating with an apprenticeship qualification in the year 2010. So this is a very limited response to the major crisis that is confronting our nation and that is acting as a substantial brake on potential employment growth this year and into the future. It is reasonable for the opposition to query whether this initiative is good public policy. I have come to the conclusion that it is not. I have major reservations about this proposal because it does not deal with the issues that are confronting the people whom I represent, both the young unemployed in my electorate and the businesses-predominantly small businesses-who are crying out for skilled labour now. The decision to establish these 24 colleges will barely make a dent in the crisis. At best, we will see 7,200 students go through these colleges when fully operational. That represents only two per cent of all Australian students in years 11 and 12. The overwhelming majority of senior secondary students will have no affinity and no connection with these colleges. That lucky two per cent will be years away from graduating as qualified tradespeople. Businesses in my electorate cannot afford to wait year after year for action from this government. They are crying out for more skilled workers now, not in four or five years time. As we know, the estimates are that we will have a shortage of over 130,000 skilled workers in the next five years. The 7,200 students who will graduate from these new colleges will be just a drop in the bucket in dealing with this crisis. After eight years of dragging its heels and being asleep on its watch, this government has finally been forced to acknowledge that there is in fact a skills crisis. But its responses to that crisis are far from adequate. I think it is unsatisfacgrow. tory just to rely on the argument that employment growth and lower unemployment levels are the reasons that this skills crisis has emerged. Since 1998 this government has turned away 270,000 people from TAFE and created a huge skills deficit by not putting its fair share of funding and investment into our vocational education and training system. How do you justify or explain why this government turns away 40,000 Australians from TAFE each year and fails to meet the unmet demand in that system? If this government invested the funds it is using for these new colleges and put that money into the existing TAFE stream it could, on our reckoning, create more than 45,000 desperately needed new places. Instead of wasting millions of dollars duplicating Australia's first-rate TAFE system and limiting this new training initiative to a mere two per cent of senior secondary students, I believe, and I think my community believes, that this government would be well advised to allocate those resources to the system that has historically trained tradespeople and made a significant contribution to economic growth and development in our country. I fear that the government's response, while being very limited, has got much more to do with its blind pursuit of and zealotry about the IR agenda that we have seen raised in this chamber in a number of debates on legislation that has come before us. the proposals contained in this bill to establish these 24 colleges are really driven by an IR agenda as much as they are driven by the needs to deal with the skills crisis that convided. fronts our nation here and now. I find it very surprising that, although not specifically mentioned in this bill, the government has indicated in both the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum to the bill that the conditions of funding of these colleges will include industrial requirements, specifically the provision for AWAs, individual contracts of employment, and performance pay. You might ask: what on earth has this radical industrial relations agenda got to do with the nation's skills crisis? The more people out there in the community understand the intent of this government to try force through an IR agenda that has nothing to do with addressing the real skills crisis, the more they will be horrified to understand the real motivation of this government. As I said earlier, on the time frames outlined by the government, the proposed colleges will not deliver a single additional qualified tradesperson till 2010. That is hardly an adequate response to the needs that confront businesses that I represent in my region. To go back and say to them, ‘You'll have to hold your breath and wait till 2010 when the first apprentices graduate from these colleges,' seems to be a totally inadequate response to a crisis that the government should long ago have acknowledged. Given the staggered commencement dates, detailed school registration processes and curriculum approvals that will have to be undergone, there is every likelihood that the colleges will be operational later rather than sooner, with the vast bulk of qualified tradespeople not emerging until the years 2010 to 2012. I again say this is a totally limited and inadequate response to a crisis that is confronting I believe all of us in our electorates. I am sorry the member for Moncrieff is not here but I just cannot believe that he will not look beyond the figures that are proIt is very easy to quote the total number of new apprentices without actually looking at the breakdown between those being trained as trainees and those being trained in the traditional trades. If he does not believe me, I suggest the member for Moncrieff have a look at the recent survey conducted by the independent National Centre for Vocational Education Research. It showed that the numbers of apprentices and trainees in training fell four per cent nationally during 2004. Those figures are beyond dispute. The number of apprentices and trainees in training is that at the lowest level since December 2002. Very disturbing is the fact that the number of and people withdrawing from apprenticeships almost outstripped the number of completions. So we have a huge drop-out rate among apprentices, and the government is not responding to this. It has no positive proposals to address that problem. The number of apprenticeship commencements fell in the 12 months ending in December 2004. It fell to a level equivalent to about a five per cent drop, which is terrible news for businesses crying out for skilled workers, particularly skilled workers in the traditional trades. Regrettably, it has been nine long years that the government has been asleep on its watch. It has not heeded the warnings about the impending skills crisis that have been given out for some time now by industry, employer organisations, the union movement, the TAFE system and the TAFE directors themselves. Government members would be well advised to have a look at the Senate inquiry report entitled Bridging the skills divide, which outlined about a year ago the very serious situation facing Australia. But again, despite the very good, practical and far-sighted recommendations contained in that report, nothing was done. At least, finally, we have got to the stage of the government acknowledging that we have a skills crisis. I see even the minister is now saying that perhaps we ought to review the incentives that have been provided to employers to take on and train young people in the traditional trades. What I find very disturbing in this debate is the attempted portrayal by government members of the Labor Party as, supposedly, having no concern, no involvement and no desire to ensure that our TAFE system keeps on changing so that it keeps up with the demands the economy requires. I for one do not accept that criticism at all of our side in political debate. The Labor Party has had a long-term interest and involvement in the vocational sector, and I know that in my area we have been working very hard with community members to put in place an apprenticeship pilot program that provides incentives to local small businesses to take on and train young people. In the space of the last year, about 120 young people have been taken on as apprentices by small businesses in the Illawarra, and they are now doing their prevocational training through the Wollongong Institute of TAFE. So there are local responses to this growing problem, but much more needs to be done by this government if we are to continue to have in the TAFE system the levels of investment that will meet the unmet demand and address the obvious skills shortages that are out there in the community. Also, in terms of this debate, not only has the government been asleep at the watch but it does not really have a coherent strategy or a clear understanding of how to go about dealing with the impact of skills shortages at a regional level. It is fair to say that you can access reasonably reliable data on national and state trends, and the department does that adequately, but when you try to go beyond those global statistics to look at the impact of skills shortages at a regional level, information is sadly wanting. The government needs to develop a clearer picture of the impact of the skills shortages at regional levels, in order to assist businesses in trying to develop a coordinated solution to address the problem. There is no magic bullet, and there is no one solution that in itself is going to solve the crisis. Regional trends may be quite different for a variety of reasons. For example, in the Illawarra our close proximity to the booming Sydney labour market has had a significant impact on the ability of local firms to attract suitable applicants. In this 2001, according to the census data, 17 per cent of employed people in the Illawarra region commuted outside our region for work. That had grown from only three per cent in 1981. So regional skills shortage problems have a variety of underlying causes, and a multifaceted strategy is needed to address the specifics of each region and the problems they are contending with. The problem that we have locally is not just that we do not have enough skilled workers as a result of the general skills but also that we have an inability to recruit skills that are required locally, because the labour market is competitive and more attractive wages and conditions often take labour out of our region. What we have done locally is to create a task force in the Illawarra. That task force is grappling with the identification of current and future skills shortages and trying to tackle those shortages through a variety of responses. Our apprenticeship pilot program is one of those responses. Our local research body, IRIS, has prepared the first part of an Illawarra skills shortage study, which shows that most skilled labour in our area is now in short supply relative to demand. I will list the occupations with the most critical shortages to give you a feel for the problems in our region. Aged care nurses and carers are at the top of the list, which goes through to boilermakers, chefs, electricians, engineers, fitters and turners, registered nurses and truck drivers. So it is not just in the traditional areas that there are obvious problems; an acute crisis is also emerging across a range of very important occupations that service the needs of our community. With regard to the crisis of skills both at the national and regional level, I reiterate that this bill is a very limited response crisis that faces us and that will continue to face businesses in my region today, next year and the year after. They are not happy to be sitting around and waiting for a totally inadequate response which will see, at best, 7,200 new students graduating as apprentices some time in the period between 2010 and 2012. The bill before us confirms to me that this government has no coherent strategy or plan to tackle the crisis at either the national or the regional level. The severe skills shortages have developed while this government has been asleep on its watch, and it has only itself to blame. Having 24 new colleges crisis training a maximum of 7,200 students who will not graduate as tradespeople until at least 2010 is, in my view, a totally limited and inadequate response to a crisis which everybody acknowledges is posing severe economic restraints on future capacity in our economy.",78
50,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005 implements the government's election commitment to establish 24 Australian technical colleges in identified regions across Australia. High-quality training and facilities will be offered, which will further increase Australia's vocational and technical education system. Today Australian industry faces a shortfall in a number of traditional nationbuilding trades. If we fail to meet this issue head on, our economy will suffer. Therefore, it is imperative that we encourage more young people to continue with vocational and technical education. During 13 years of trades Labor government, their answer to skills shortages was to place young Australians on the dole queue, providing Australians with ‘the recession we had to have', record interest rates, which resulted in record bankruptcies, high inflation and an economy spiralling downwards. In direct contrast, this Austo the tralian government has provided an environment of strong economic growth, featuring record low unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation. Through this bill, the government is encouraging young Australians into trades and to continue on to trade based self-employment or to opening their own small businesses. That is what this government is all about. Technical colleges will promote a strong career path in trade occupations in key industries as a helpful and satisfying opportunity for young people. This new form of instruction is about taking industry to education, education dictating to industry, which is the philosophy that Labor favours-that is, Labor is all about control, rather than allowing the free market to grow and develop on an international level. That is the major difference. By providing instruction linked to workplace requirements and offering high-quality training facilities, the colleges will become centres of excellence in trade training, where capable and committed students who are interested in pursuing a rewarding career can start their vocational training. The colleges will play a pivotal role in raising the profile and status of vocational pathways in schools, encouraging more young people to consider a career in the traditional trades ticipate in the training, as a positive development for the training system as a whole. The passage of this legislation will enshrine the underlying principles of the Australian technical colleges. The principal object, as stated by the minister, is to address the skills needs of the Australian economy through the achievement of a number of key goals. These goals include promoting pride and excellence in trade skills training for young people; providing skills and education in a flexible learning environment to build a solid base for secure and rewarding careers; adopting a new industry-led approach to providing education and training, in partnerships with local communities; meeting regional labour market needs; and establishing an industry-led governing body for each Australian technical college which sets out its strategic directions and performance objectives and selects the college principal. The goals include providing trade training that is relevant to industry and that leads to nationally recognised qualifications through school based new apprenticeships and academic and vocational education which is relevant to trade careers and leads to a year 12 certifinot cate. They also include ensuring the autonomy of the principal in each Australian technical college to manage that college, to select the best staff and suitable education and training partners and to meet the targets and performance measures set by the governing body of the college; and encouraging an environment of freedom and reward for effort for the staff of the colleges through flexible employment arrangements which provide rewards linked to excellent performance. They include providing employability and business skills to young people, recognising that many successful graduates will operate their own businesses, and developing expertise in a range of industries in a region, with the flexibility to meet changing work force and to par- and local industry needs. The passage of this bill will enable up to 7,200 young Australians per year to undertake high-quality education and training at an Australian technical college in an area of need. Students studying at the colleges will be provided with tuition in trade related vocational training, leading to a national training package qualification, and in academic studies which will allow them to complete their senior secondary education. Students will commence a school based new apprenticeship in a trade where there is an identified need. They will have a strong foundation to continue with their preferred trade after they complete year 12, but they will alsoand this is very important-keep open the option of going on to further academic study if they so choose. This is a win-win situation for industry, employees and Australia in general. The bill will make available some $343.6 million over the period to 2009 to support the establishment and operation of the 24 new colleges. This supplementary funding will support infrastructure development as well as the additional costs associated with the delivery of the specialised services which the colleges will provide. This funding is over and above the general recurrent funding which colleges will be eligible to receive from the Australian government under the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 and the recurrent funding provided by state and territory governments. This bill will provide for funding agreements between the Australian government and relevant state and territory governments or the Australian Technical College Authority for the colleges over the period 2005 to 2009 for the making of payments to establish and operate such colleges. The bill therefore provides for agreements to be tailored to the needs of each individual region. Each of the 24 regions is different in the challenges that it faces and the skills shortages that are parernment ticularly obvious. The bill does not prescribe any particular model of operation. This is a hallmark of this government, which provides for flexibility and innovation in the marketplace. We as a government respect the ability and the rights of people in each of these regions to shape their own destinies. Each college will be able to operate in a manner which best suits the needs of industry and students in the particular region in which the college is established. The Australian government will consider any model which has the backing of local community, business and industry groups and which meets the broad requirements for the colleges as set out in the discussion paper and request-for-proposal documentation. This flexibility to accommodate local needs will be especially important in the tial years of each college. Colleges may commence operations by offering training in a specialised trade-or trades-that is of particular relevance to the local region and that is in one of the industry groups which have been identified by the Australian government as a priority. Over time the colleges will be expected to broaden their range of training on offer, based on the needs of the local community, employers and young people. This bill will ensure that the colleges provide specialist training of the highest quality. It will be a condition of funding that, by the time each college starts providing tuition to students, it meet all relevant state and territory requirements for registration and accreditation so that it can operate as a school and deliver curriculum leading to the achievement of the senior secondary certificate of education relevant in each of the eight states and territories. This, of course, will enable the colleges to qualify for general recurrent funding both from the federal govand, indeed, from the state and territory governments of Australia. The colleges will be led by a governing body consisting of local industry and community representatives. Industry involvement is critical to the success of the colleges. As a result, the skills taught to students will be directly relevant to the needs of the local industry, enhancing young people's prospects for further training and employment. This in turn supports the long-term prosperity of each of the regions in which the colleges are located and, of course, assists Australian businesses to remain competitive in a global economy. The college principal will have the autonomy to manage the operations of the college and will be responsible for meeting the targets and performance measures that are set ini- by the governing body and for the employment of staff. To ensure that colleges are able to attract and retain staff of the highest quality, the principal will be able to offer staff the option of an Australian workplace agreement-once again, flexibility that the Labor Party opposes. Through these agreements, the colleges will be able to offer staff rewards for performance, such as performance pay, and other attractive working conditions. The 24 regions that the Australian government has identified for the establishment of the colleges all face particular challenges in relation to the availability of trade and will clearly benefit from the establishment of such colleges. They were selected by taking into account a number of factors, including the existence of a strong industry base, skills shortages and the level of youth unemployment. The Australian government is committed to raising the profile of vocational and tech- for: nical education. For too long the attitude in our secondary education has been to promote tertiary education as the only viable option for young people who wish to be successful in their careers. These new technical colleges will change this attitude and restore to trade qualifications the status that they deserve. Attracting young people to trade related professions is vital for Australia's future and is an important step in providing for the long term skills needs of industry. The Australian technical colleges initiative offers a new approach to achieving this and forms an important part of the Australian government's overall strategy for tackling our skills needs. I will use my electorate of Braddon as an example. We have had a number of forums of business leaders, community leaders and education leaders from both private and public schools. They have all been enthusiastic and excited about this new change in direction for the delivery of vocational and technical education. The only criticism has come from the Education Union. I suppose one should not be surprised at that. The Australian technical colleges will promote trade qualifications as a highly valued alternative to a university degree and will, to finish with a quote from the minister, ‘develop a reputation that will show students and parents that vocational education and training provides access to careers that are secure, lucrative and rewarding'. I commend this bill to the House. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (2.16 skills pm)-The opposition will not be opposing the passage of the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Bill 2005. However, I rise in the House to support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister for education, the member for Jagajaganamely, that the government is condemned (1) creating a skills crisis through its continued failure to provide the necessary opportunities during their nine long years in office for Australians to get the training they need to get a decent job and meet the skills needs of the economy; (2) failing to train enough Australians in areas of skill shortage and relying on skilled migration; (3) exacerbating this crisis by failing to introduce Budget measures to train more Australians now, including Labor's Trade Completion Bonus for traditional apprentices; (4) making Australian business wait until 2010 for the Technical Colleges to produce their first qualified tradesperson; (5) failing to double the number of school-based traditional apprentices and provide extra funding to support schools in taking up the places; (6) failing to further invest in our world-class school and TAFE systems to create opportunities for young Australians to access high quality vocational education and training at all schools, not just 24 Australian Technical Colleges; (7) its uncooperative and hostile attitude towards the States and Territories in establishing these Colleges, despite the central role the States and Territories will play in any successful operation; (8) failing to provide new support to other regions that also have high youth unemployment, an industry base and skill shortages, but are not listed for a Technical College; (9) inappropriately using vocational education and training as a vehicle through which to drive their ideological industrial relations agenda which bears no relation to successful student outcomes”. That is a very comprehensive second reading amendment that the honourable member has proposed, and I will be speaking to elements of it. We have heard some very interesting points raised in the debate thus far on the government side. I note that the member for Casey exhorted members of the opposition to leave petty politics aside in considering this proposal. His exhortation rings a bit hollow when one examines the contents of this bill. It reeks of political interference and it reeks of political control. That is the nub of this proposal. This is a political bill put forward by a government that cobbled together a proposal in the context of an election and now has to work out how it is going to implement it. You would go a long way to find a piece of legislation related to education and training which was as dysfunctional as this bill. We are told that the purpose of the bill is to address national skill shortages. I cannot think of a less effective way to do this. The bill is an admission by the government, after nine long years in government, that the coalition have presided over a dramatic increase in the skills shortages in Australia since they came to power. They can find a billion dollars to fight wars; they can find $100 million for useless advertising in the lead-up to an election to get themselves re-elected; yet some 20,000 young Australians cannot get access to the vocational education and training that they require to find secure employment and structure a meaningful life for themselves and their families. This skills shortage must be addressed in order to keep the economy growing and keep the banks from the doors of all those ordinary Austraand lians that the Treasurer has encouraged into such huge debt-which stands at $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. The community is always pleading with government, both state and federal, to tackle the duplication that we have in many fields of government-such as health, education and transport. This government never seriously entertains these concerns; it only pays lip-service to them. Its agenda is to gain more power and more control over the vocational education system of this country as well as the higher education system. What do we get from this particular piece of legislation? We get the establishment of another dual system in this country. We laboured long and hard during the Hawke and Keating years to get a national approach on vocational education and training. The government, in a flight of fantasy to get itself elected, has committed an enormous amount of money to these technical colleges. As we have heard in this debate, most of them are located in marginal coalition electorates. There is a proposal to locate a college in the Geelong area. I am not so stupid as to think that the government believe that because I am such a good fellow they will locate a technical college in my electorate. In Corio we have the Gordon Institute of TAFE, which is a fine educational institution-one of the top vocational education and training institutions in this country. Indeed, the honourable member for Denison, who is in the chamber, will note that in 2003 the Gordon tech won the award for being the Victorian training provider of the year. When I saw the proposal to locate one of these new colleges in my electorate, of course I smelt a rat. What was the rat? With due deference to the honourable members who are here today, it was to save the skin of the honourable member for Corangamite, who is now in the chamber. We know that the honourable member was skating very close to the line in an electoral sense. This proposal did not grow out of the Geelong community, it did not grow out of consultation with business or the education sector or the City of Greater Geelong or, indeed, with the member of parliament in whose electorate this facility may be located. No; it grew out of the coalition campaign team sitting down and saying: ‘We've got to save the skin of the member for Corangamite, so we'll give Geelong one. The member for Corio happens to represent most of the Geelong region, so we'll cover it by locating one in Geelong.' Mr MCArthur interjecting Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-The honourable member can bah all he likes over there in the back blocks. We know that he is one of those Western District graziers; he had a real technical education at Geelong Grammar, with the equestrian centre-or was it the rifle range? Listen, old sport, I learned to shoot out in the paddock, not in a rifle range. I will pit my skills against the Deputy Prime Minister's any day. He learnt his skills at the range at the King's College. But you do not need a technical education from Geelong Grammar. You need to expand the resources at the institution that has effectively serviced the Geelong region for the past 150 years. Mr MCArthur-We'll save your seat, Corio. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I can understand the honourable member opposite. He has his bag of money and he has been re-elected. Of course we will accept the stupidity of the Howard government in our area if it brings a dollar. But the reality is-and the honourable member knows it-that the Geelong region is well served by an excellent secondary and vocational education system. The only limitation of the Gordon tech is that it has been screwed down financially by the Howard government, as was the case when previous Liberal governments were in power. This has prevented the sons and daughters of working people in the Western District and in the Geelong region from accessing the education that they deserve. That has always been the legacy of those opposite. When the Hawke and Keating government came to power, we proudly put $14 million into the Gordon tech to refurbish it. That educational institution had fallen into disarray under state Liberal governments, which had neglected it and, in so doing, had limited the opportunities of young people from the Western District and Geelong to access a decent education. Not only did the Labor government do that; we put between $10 million and $12 million into the James Harrison centre to expand training opportunities for the manufacturing industry. What do we see in this government's brilliant piece of planning? We see that these colleges will target the automotive and building trades. The Gordon tech has a specialist institution, built by Labor, which provides rifle courses in those trades. Wouldn't you think that a minister with any grasp of the portfolio who wanted to get some efficiency into the allocation of resources would put resources there? That is the logical thing to do. What are they going to do? They are going to build another edifice in the Geelong region to save the skin of the honourable member for Corangamite. I am not so proud that I will not take the gold, but I have to tell you: this is a massive misallocation of resources. This bill sets up a Commonwealth school VET system alongside an already functioning, nationally coordinated, state-run TAFE system and the existing school education system. Those systems came together under the Australian National Training Authority, which provided a national approach to the provision of vocational education and training in the Geelong region and nationally. I have always regretted the loss of technical schools and the contribution they made to young people's lives and to the nation. I would fully support the Commonwealth assisting the states through funding the reestabagainst lishment of technical schools within each state's education system. This would provide hands-on vocational education to a large number of currently disengaged students. These technical colleges will fail because they are being established by a bureaucracy which has no direct experience in secondary education or TAFE. How does anyone think you can build an effective and efficient secondary program when it is based on all students being involved in the school based New Apprenticeships program? Has a reputable and independent research organisation done a study of the effectiveness of SBNAs in the schools as they now exist? Can the minister identify a single student who has ever completed an SBNA? I bet he cannot. It would take a student 10 years part-time to complete an apprenticeship. Has anyone done a study on the articulation that SBNA students have in full-time apprenticeships? I think the minister should ask a few key questions of his advisers, as they have put him in an embarrassing position with this proposal. It is really doomed to failure. The minister should get out and talk to a few school administrators about the problems that they currently face in making SBNAs workcoordination issues, timetabling problems, transportation problems, finding willing and able employers",82

52,The SPEAKER,RULINGS,"Yesterday I undertook to examine the use of offensive or disorderly words in the context of a quotation. As was noted in question time yesterday, it is not in order to use offensive words a member by means of a quotation. However, it is also the case that the determination as to whether words are offensive or disorderly rests with the chair. With regard to the comments made yesterday, while I did not form the view that they were unparliamentary, I was of the view that, in the context of the debate taking place at the time, the use of terms such as ‘corruption' and ‘crooked' could be conceived as a personal reflection and as such should have been withdrawn. With regard to the specific concern raised by the member for Hinkler, my ruling yesterday should in no way be viewed as changing the existing rules applying to the use of critical third party or media comment in debate.

56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Forget it. You have lost this argument comprehensively. I know you will never take any advice, but I would get onto something else. International Counter-Terrorism Cooperation  is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the latest developments in the government's international cooperation to counter terrorism?",89
57,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. This country makes a very significant contribution to the task of dealing with international terrorism. I think we can be proud of the contribution Australia has made in the region and beyond. One component is that we have signed a series of memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism. We now have signed 11 of those memoranda. Today, it was with great pleasure that I signed, in the presis ence of our own Prime Minister and President Musharraf of Pakistan, the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism with Pakistan. These MOUs provide an excellent framework for collaboration with other countries-in particular, our regional partners such as Indonesia, Malaysia and, importantly, India-in areas such as law enforcement, with collaboration between our police forces, exchanges of intelligence and of course information, and in some cases capacity assistance in defence and border control. These MOUs are making a real contribution to our own security and to the security of our region and the broader international community. We had today a very good discussion with the President of Pakistan about the war against terrorism. I think it is worth saying yet again, as I said yesterday, that Pakistan's President and his government have made good progress in dealing with terrorism at a number of different levels. All of us have reflected on the fact that, although the war against terrorism has a long way to go and although there will be setbacks in the future-and it is important to make that qualification-and although we should not be complacent, nevertheless a good deal of progress has been made in breaking up the al-Qaeda network and its effectiveness and also, closer to home, in dealing with Jemaah Islamiah and other like organisations. Australia has played a very significant part in this war against terrorism in our region and even beyond our region. The signing today of the memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism with Pakistan is an illustration of our absolute determination to make sure that terrorism is defeated. Private Members' Bills",89
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of today's comments by the member for Indi, claiming that the member for Kooyong and those supporting the member's bill are political terrorists? Does the Prime Minister agree that these members are political terrorists; and, if so, is that why the Prime Minister will not allow the parliament to debate the member for Kooyong's bill?",89
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very proud to lead a very rich and diverse coalition party, and it is a coalition of all the talents. I find it fascinating that the Leader of the Opposition has had seven or so months since the last election to put something forward in this area. Through you, Mr Speaker, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he wants a debate on a private member's bill, why doesn'the introduce one himself? Consumer Confidence",89
60,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the people of Ryan recent data on consumer sentiment. What does this information indicate about the outlook for the Australian economy?,90
61,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I can outline to the people of Ryan that information about consumer sentiment as measured by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute was released today. Although it showed that consumer sentiment had fallen by a slight amount, 0.5 per cent, this was following a 9.5 per cent surge in May in response to the budget. Consumer sentiment is still up by nine per cent on where it was at budget time. Sentiment concerning the current state of family finances in the 12-month outlook rose. No doubt that reflects the anticipation of tax cuts which will be implemented in Australia on 1 July. The economy has moderated somewhat since last year. Rather than looking at an economy with four per cent growth, as we got used to, it is more likely that we will look at an Australian economy going down to be in the three per cent band. As I have said on numbers of occasions, this is not unwelcome. We have been looking for a moderation in the housing cycle for some time. It also looks as if we are now seeing a moderation in relation to consumption. The Reserve Bank governor, in a speech yesterday, said that he viewed the recent moderation in growth as more likely to prolong the economic expansion than to end it. That is certainly my sentiment. If consumption moderates and the housing cycle moderates, and we get some more sustainable growth in relation to those things, the duration of this current economic expansion should be prolonged. Notwithstanding that, labour market conditions are the best they have been for 29 years, with unemployment at 5.1 per cent. Our participation rate is at an all-time high. And over the last year 330,000 jobs were created in the Australian economy, with almost 70 per cent of them being full-time. This does not mean that the government should rest in relation to economic reform. It means that the government should continue and should engage in new areas of economic reform. Let me name labour market reform as the most important micro reform for the Australian economy. If we can put in place real, vibrant labour market reform, this will set Australia up in structural terms for a much more prosperous future, for more jobs and higher wages. Private Members' Bills",90
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and follows his answer to my last question. Prime Minister, if I bring forward a bill dealing with the type of subject matter the member for Kooyong's bill deals with, will he allow it to come to a vote?",90
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is able, under the procedures of this place, to bring something forward-and you will get an appropriate response from the government. Water Management",90
64,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the new industry analysis of Australia's water and infrastructure needs? What action has the government taken towards the issues identified in this report?,90
65,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his great interest and indeed his past experience as a very effective state minister for water in New South Wales. I am aware that on the front page of the Australian today the attention of the nation has been drawn to the Barton Group's work. I take that as another welcome indication of the nation's very real interest in how we can better manage our national water resources. The report makes it clear that nationally Australia is now on the right track-as a result, I think I can reasonably say, of the government's key water policies, particularly the National ter Initiative, with the backup mechanisms of the National Water Commission and the Living Murray initiative. These are world-class policy prescriptions. I am thankful that, though it took a long time, most of the states and territories have risen above political point scoring and joined up. We await Western Australia joining with us. We in this country are now on track in veloping nationally compatible access entitlements and nationally functioning water markets and trading. As the OECD has recently acknowledged, in many ways we are showing world leadership in this area of the integrated management of environmental water. We are also now moving in areas of measurement, monitoring and the collection and retaining of information, because they have been surprisingly lacking. We still need a lot of technological development to enable us to accurately measure water usage, particularly in our rivers and ground water systems. A great deal is happening in urban water reform, although some of the states are going to have to lift their game and do a lot more. And we are seeing serious investment in infrastructure through the $2 billion Australian Water Fund. We are seeking a judicious mix of measures for water savings, greater efficiencies and more water infrastructure so that we can do a better job with our water nationally. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister announced a batch of programs out of the Water Smart Australia program for water efficiency and saving projects in Queensland. Last week, he announced a $55 million contribution-a dollar-for-dollar match with an equivalent contribution from New South Wales-for structural adjustment for six overallocated ground water systems in New South Wales. We have now allocated nearly $90 million to support investments of some $250 million. There is a great driver or mulWa- tiplier here in Queensland and New South Wales, and there will be more coming shortly. So, just six months on after the National al- Water Commission was set up, it is already getting down to the serious business of leadership and implementation of the nation's water plans. I think all Australians welcome that. I am glad to be able to again respond to de- community concerns about water and the need for us to do more. I do want to make this comment: it is sobering that over the last couple of decades expenditure on water infrastructure in Australia-and I do not want to be overly political, but that has been a state responsibilityhas fallen way off the pace. In terms of what the OECD averages are, we are way off the mark. We have taken a very strong Commonwealth lead here. So far the $90 million we have invested has generated a further $250 million from the states, the territories and the private sector. We will need a lot more of that and less of what the report infers, and which is reported in the media as state governments having plundered the profits of water utilities and having failed to reinvest in the sector. So we look forward to better outcomes from the states and the territories. We assume they will continue to lift themselves above politics in this area. I conclude by making this point: the report makes it clear that Australia does not have a shortage of water but, rather, an underinvestment in water systems to meet the needs of future generations and that our systems for sharing and managing the resource have not been strengthened sufficiently in recent decades. We have a way forward. The National Water Initiative is providing that. That is good news. I know it enjoys the very strong support of the Australian people. Australian Technical Colleges",91
66,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Can the minister confirm that a coalition backbench briefing on the government's technical colleges states ‘the colleges will not operate entirely as outlined in the government's vision'? Doesn't the long list of technical college changes already include breaking the Prime Minister's promise of no student fees, cutting funding in the first three years by $33 million, and pulling out of the public tendering process? Minister, isn't this proof that the technical colleges were dreamt up on the run during the election and will not deliver a qualified tradesperson until 2010?",92
67,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer, essentially, is no to each of the parts of the member for Jagajaga's question. But I can say that today the people of the 24 regions, who are very enthusiastic about the Australian technical colleges proposal",92
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Very. They want more.,92
69,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do want more, Prime Minister. We will have to deliver on what we promised and we can work from there. I am happy to say publicly that I will be putting a bit of pressure on to try and pro- certainty? duce a bit more. But at the end of it they are wondering what the Labor Party are up to, because the biggest backflip this side of the last election has occurred in the last 24 hours in this place. We have got the Labor Party in the Senate actually going against Kim Beazley's, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Brand, own apparent support for the Australian technical colleges. He said on 10 March in this place, when talking about the pending legislation that the member for Jagajaga has asked about: We on this side of the House say, ‘If you really want to do thatthat is, the legislationgo ahead and do it. That's fine. We'll put the legislation through in the Senate. We are not worried about that. If you want to ... go ahead and do it.' But instead the member for Brand has allowed his opposition senators to delay the bill by sending it off to a Senate committee. In fact they are delaying this legislation that the member for Jagajaga is asking about for the reason of allowing those who have opposition to the bill to actually express it, denying the fact that we have been around to all 24 regions, we have spoken to local industry, we have spoken to local business, we have spoken to local education and training providers, and we have spoken to local communities, including local governmentseverybody has had a view on this. The Labor Party are for it one minute and then, on the other side of the street, they are against it. Which side of the street are they on right now? Taxation",92
70,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Does Australian business now have certainty about the tax withholding rate applying to wages from 1 July this year? What has provided business with this certainty and what has stood in the way of this,92
71,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I can inform the House that 850,000 Australian businesses now have certainty about the tax schedules to apply on 1 July and that every Australian income taxpayer will receive a tax cut on 1 July this year. The Labor Party campaign to defeat tax cuts on 1 July has been defeated. It has been defeated because the Australian Greens announced that they would not disallow the schedule, One Nation announced that it would not disallow the schedule, Senator Shayne Murphy announced that he would not disallow the schedule, the Australian Democrats announced that they would not disallow the schedule and there is only one party that has determined not to determine a position. It is the irrelevant party, the Australian Labor Party. What was standing in the way of certainty for 850,000 Australian businesses? It was the Leader of the Opposition. I was interested to read in the Canberra Times-now suitable for quotation in this House-one disgruntled Labor backbencher quoted as saying: We've been left like a shag on a rock now ... the other parties have decided to pass it. There has been some debate going on as to who is responsible for this brilliant strategy. do not think it is fair that the Leader of the Opposition take full responsibility. I have noticed in the Australian that the cartoonist is now drawing the Leader of the Opposition as Humpty Dumpty-Humpty Dumpty who sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. I will remind the House that in that budget lockup was the member for Lilley, his offsider the member for Perth, and Senator Conroy-all of the roosters were in that lockup. As Labor searches for who is responsible for this strategy, it raises the great conundrum of Australian politics: which came first, the rooster or the egg? That is the great conundrum of Labor Party politics. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance. We have had talk about nursery rhymes. We have even had the Treasurer talking about shagging, which I do not think is parliamentary. I ask you to draw him back to the question.",92
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will come back to the question.,93
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the modern barnyard which represents the parliamentary Labor Party, what came first: the rooster or the egg? I read in the Australian that senior MPs have been critical of Mr Swan, the member for Lilley. One Labor frontbencher told the Australian, ‘If there's a reshuffle, Swan has to be the first victim.' Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If we are going to go through animals, we can talk about how the dog became a dingo",93
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will come to his point of order. Mr Albanese-but we do not think it is relevant to the question.,93
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will come back to the question.,93
76,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That quote-if there I is a reshuffle, Swan has to be first victimwas not delivered in Chinese, I want to say in defence of a certain member on the Labor front bench. Anyway, I would point out to the House that this side, the Liberal and National parties, has a majority in the House. Whilst ever the Liberal and National parties have a majority in the House, the member for Lilley will have the confidence of this House to remain as shadow Treasurer-and long may he reign. Family Law Reform",93
77,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House how the government's wide-ranging family law reforms will help families in need, particularly in relation to the child custody inquiry report titled Every picture tells a story?",93
78,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I know of her interest, as chair of that committee, in the progress that is being matter. I also know that members opposite from time to time have been interested in the progress that is being made. I certainly thank the honourable member, because I know she has welcomed the innovative family law reform package announced in the recent budget. I was waiting to hear from the opposition in relation to that matter. I checked very carefully whether or not there had been any observations and I had to go a long way back to find any. It was in November 2004 that I saw a statement from the opposition, which said that the government failed families. It made these points. The first point was that we had failed to provide any funding for proposed new family relationship centres. The second point was that we had failed to provide money for expanding children's contact programs. The third point was that we had done nothing to expedite hearings in the Family Court. The fourth point was that we had provided no money for ongoing relationship counselling or post-decision counselling. A further point was made that there had been no extra funds to fund legal aid or community legal centres for grandparents who were routinely denied support in courts. For that reason, I had hoped there would be some supporting comments after the budget. I went through each of the items raised and, if you look at the response we gave, we have delivered on each of them. First, we provided $200 million over three years for 65 new family relationship centres, which are the cornerstone of the package. We have delivered 30 new children's contact services across Australia. We are introducing a new single combined registry for providing families with simpler and quicker access to justice. We have delivered more than 100 new early intervention services to help families stay together. We have delivered $1.6 million for grandparents to participate in lemade in this gal aid family conferences. So, far from having failed Australian families in relation to the implementation of the committee report, we have responded very fulsomely. Far from failing families in need, we have delivered in full. This is in contrast to the opposition, which clearly has no policy, no ideas and nothing to say about helping families. Asylum Seekers",94
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the minister's confirmation yesterday in question time that he personally discussed Mr Chen Yonglin's case with the Chinese ambassador on 2 June, seven days after Mr Chen had applied for asylum. Did the minister, in his conversation with the Chinese ambassador, discuss what might happen to Mr Chen if he was returned to China?",94
80,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As I explained yesterday, I had a very brief discussion with the Chinese ambassador; I think it was on 2 June. I think it was on 3 June, by the way, that the formal application was lodged for a protection visa. Not surprisingly, I am not going into the details of that conversation, except to make one point-that is, everything said by me in that conversation was perfectly proper. Workplace Relations: Reform",94
81,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister advise how workplace relations reform will boost economic growth? Would he advise the House of any alternative policies?,94
82,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I noted comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, to a presentation of the Institute of Company Directors yesterday, in which he said: ... industrial relations reform is valuable and it does contribute to higher economic growth. These seemed like clear and unambiguous comments by Mr Macfarlane. However, the Leader of the Opposition attempted to downplay them on AM this morning, arguing: ... we don't know what questions the Reserve Bank governor was asked, and we don't know the context in which he gave his answers. That's been beaten up in one newspaper today. For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, I repeat the question-and the answer which Mr Macfarlane gave. He was asked: I wonder if you might comment on the quantitative effects on growth of industrial relations form. If the Government is successful in its indusword, trial reform agenda, would that have an impact on growth of a quarter per cent per annum or half a per cent or whatever? Mr Macfarlane answered: I think industrial relations reform is valuable and it does contribute to higher economic growth, and the reform that's been undertaken to date, although it's disappointed a lot of people, has I think had quite a profound effect. It's meant that the economy can run faster without generating inflationary influences to the extent that used to be the case. So I think there's undoubtedly value in industrial relations reform. That is a clear and unambiguous statement by Mr Macfarlane. I was asked about alternative views. There is an alternative view from the Leader of the Opposition. On AM this morning we heard the following from the Leader of the Opposition: We reformed the industrial relations system. … … … ... as far as we're concerned, the reforms that needed to be there in industrial relations, the enterprise reforms and the flexibility that came with all of that, that's been done. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition says the lemon has been squeezed dry. When the Leader of the Opposition speaks about industrial relations reform, he has a lot to say about the past but he is very coy about what he will do in the future and about what his policy would mean. The Australian had a word for this policy yesterday. The Australian used the dreaded R-word, the word that the Leader of the Opposition will not use. In fact, a spokesman for the opposition after the caucus meeting was reported in the Australian as saying that it was not the R-word because: ... he would never use that expression because our pitch is about moving forward.",95
83,The R,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"word, roll-back, is the Labor love that re- dare not speak its name. If it is not the Rthen what is it? Is it a rollover? Is it a backflip? Is it a wind back? The reality is that once again the Leader of the Opposition is backtracking from the roll-back. Telstra",95
84,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under standing order 99 my question without notice is to the honourable member for Hume, in his capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Given the serious ongoing objection of the National Farmers Federation to the further sale of Telstra, which was reported yesterday in an article in the Australian entitled ‘Farmers to reject T3 sale', will the honourable member seek a reference from the minister to enable the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to inquire into the level of support for the sale of Telstra among primary producers?",95
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With regard to that question, the recent practice is that a committee chair can only reveal private matters if authorised to do so by the committee. With that proviso, if the member for Hume would like to answer the question, I will call the member for Hume.",95
86,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am quite happy to answer the question. My stand on this issue is a matter of public record and is not subject to cheap political actions like this. Workplace Relations,96
87,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to material prepared by him and circulated in his electorate, outlining the effect of industrial relations changes proposed by the government. Isn't it the case that the Deputy Prime Minister has actually produced a picture of what the future will be like for working Australians under these changes-namely, a workplace in clear breach of safety standards, with no hard hats, no hearing protection, no gloves and no safety glasses and where workers will be without basic protections, without bargaining power and without safety nets?",96
88,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On this side of politics there is no stronger supporter of our approach to industrial relations. It has increased the number of jobs available right across the economy, including in regional Australia. It has improved living standards, it has increased take-home pay and it has increased flexibility. One of the greatest threats to itand I can tell you this, whilst I fully supportMr Stephen Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked a specific question about material produced, circulated and authorised by the minister.",96
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister has just begun to answer the question.,96
90,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I fully support the responsibility of employers to ensure their workplaces are safe, but I will tell you this: the industrial manslaughter legislation proposed in New South Wales was so anti-job and so bad that your own people made you withdraw it. Mr Stephen Smith-I seek leave to table the offending material. Leave not granted. Mr Stephen Smith-No leave? Too scared?",96
91,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,96
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members will recall a ruling I made earlier this year on that very point. Bougainville,96
93,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the prospect for stable and democratic government in Bougainville?,96
94,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. As members of the House may know, the member for Bowman was an observer of the Bougainville elections recently. I thank him, by the way, for sending in a report that he produced. It is a report that demonstrates how successful these elections have been. Today is a historic day, not just for Papua New Guinea and Bougainville but for Australia. Today is the day of the inauguration of the autonomous Bougainville government. The Australian government, and I am sure the Australian people, warmly welcome this. Let me congratulate the new president of that government, Joseph Kabui, and the other 39 elected representatives. Joseph is a good friend of many of us. I think a lot of members of the House would know Joseph Kabui quite well. The Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Michael Potts, is representing us today at this historic event. The election of the autonomous government in Bougainville very much brings to an end the Bougainville conflict. I remember, and I know that the Prime Minister would remember only too well, the events of early 1997, with the Sandline crisis and the very robust response by the Australian government to an attempt by the then Papua New Guinea government to bring in mercenaries to try and solve the Bougainville conflict. I think our robust response was really the beginning of a process that the Papua New Guinea government pursued to achieve peace in Bougainville. We contributed in many ways to the peace monitoring groups. We provided substantial financial assistance. Something like 3,800 Australian Defence Force and civilian personnel have been involved with those peace monitoring groups. We have also had aid programs on the ground that have helped to deliver what I have often said when I have been in Bougainville is important: a peace dividend to the people of Bougainville. Let me say in conclusion that there is some debate about the number of people who died either directly or indirectly as a result the Bougainville conflict, but estimates range from about 10,000 to 18,000. I make the point that three or four times as many people died in the Bougainville conflict as have died, I believe, in the Northern Ireland troubles and conflict since 1969. It is worth remembering that. This has been a very bloody and a very nasty affair. The previous National Party government of New Zealand, the present government of New Zealand and the Australian government all deserve a tremendous amount of credit for making this peace process possible. The Prime Minister and I have both been so involved in this. To know today that that government is being sworn in in Bougainville is tremendous. It is a great moment for Papua New Guinea and a great moment for Bougainville, but it is also a great moment for Australia. Sustainable Regions Program",96
95,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the $500,000 grant that he approved for the Atherton Hotel under the Sustainable Regions Program in October 2003. Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that he was advised in early December 2003 that the grant to the Atherton Hotel was in clear breach of the program guidelines because the hotel was in direct competition with a number of other clubs and hotels in the Atherton district? What has the Deputy Prime Minister done about this grant since learning of the breach nearly two years ago?",97
96,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot recall the precise details of the matter that the member for Oxley raises. I will have them checked out and report back. But this is another attack by the Labor Party on regional programs. That is what it is. These are the same proof grams that they say they are going to withdraw lock, stock and barrel-that is, of course, except for the five in the member for Brand's electorate. It is interesting to note that we have been having a bit of a look to see how many Labor Party members actually support regional program funding in their own electorates. We have found quite a few, but the one that particularly interested me today relates to the shadow minister Mr Kelvin Thomson, the member for Wills. He has been writing letters in support of applications as well, despite his absolutely hypocritical public stance. Organ Donation",97
97,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House on progress being made to lift the rate of organ donation in Australia?,98
98,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for her question. I know how important this subject is to her. As the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers recently unanimously agreed, Australia has a very good health system. It is not perfect, but it a very good health system by international standards. Our challenge is to make a good system even better. One area where there certainly is room for improvement is organ donation. Australia has the world's best organ transplantation success rate but, along with New Zealand, the world's worse organ donation rate. Last year, thanks largely to the work of the Hookes Foundation, half a million more people joined the organ donor register and the organ donation rate actually increased by 20 per cent. But there are still nearly 2,000 people on waiting lists, and every year more than 100 people die waiting for an organ transplant. In conjunction with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Divisions of General Practice, the government has recently commenced a nationwide mail-out inviting people to register as donors. I am pleased to say that already some 250,000 people have responded to that mail-out, but through you, Mr Speaker, I appeal to our fellow Australians: don't ignore this appeal; don't waste your chance to help save a life. This is important: you can't-or you shouldn't-take them with you, and this is a chance to leave something worthwhile behind. These are the sorts of incremental improvements that the Howard government is putting in place to make a good health system even better. Sustainable Regions Program",98
99,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"3.15 pm)My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I again refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the $500,000 Atherton Hotel grant. Did a member of the Deputy Prime Minister's staff tell Atherton businesses in direct competition with the Atherton Hotel in June last year that it would beMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That question has is already been asked and the minister has fully answered it.",98
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Wills has not completed his question. I will consider it in the light of the point raised by the member for Mackellar.,98
101,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Did a member of the Deputy Prime Minister's staff tell Atherton businesses in direct competition with the Atherton Hotel in June last year that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Atherton Hotel to use any Commonwealth funds to develop a poker machine venue? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that just months after he had approved the $500,000 grant to the Atherton Hotel, its owners applied for 21 poker machine licences for machines to be located in what was the breakfast servery and in the general meals room? Is it not the case that the taxpayer funded expansion of the Atherton Hotel has created the space required for these machines?",98
102,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I can confirm is that no Commonwealth moneys were used for the purchase of gaming machines. That was specifically provided for in the terms of the grant. If it is legal for them to develop a tourism facility, over and beyond that I do not quite see what the point is. I have to say that the Labor Party's hypocrisy on this issue knows no bounds whatsoever. I again refer to the comments I made just a moment ago that the member for Wills has paraded around this country, pretending",98
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. These are very specific questions about the use of $500,000 at the Atherton Hotel in the Atherton Tablelands. This is not an opportunity for a general range over the issue.",99
104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Deputy Prime Minister is in order.,99
105,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I again want to make the point that the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this knows no bounds. The member for Wills is out there almost on a daily saying that none of these programs should ever go ahead, that the whole program ought to be stopped lock, stock, and barrel. The member for Brand of courseMs Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a very specific question about one grant. As the Leader of the Opposition indicated, it is not an opportunity to attack the member for Wills. Could you ask the minister to be relevant to the questions asked?",99
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume her seat. The Deputy Prime Minister will come back to the question.,99
107,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I make the point that in reality the member for Wills is a supporter of this program when it suits him. That is the reality. If there is any further information be provided to the House in relation to the Atherton Hotel, I will provide it. Australia-US Free Trade Agreement",99
108,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the Minister for Trade inform the House how the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement is helping the seat of Barker and other region and rural seats?,99
109,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Barker for his question. The seat of Barker, being a rural seat, has of course benefited from the outcomes of our negotiations of a free trade agreement with the United States. The government prosecuted the case in advance of, during and certainly after the conclusion of negotiations that this agreement would unambiguously benefit the Australian economy, particularly in rural and regional Australia. The Australian Labor Party opposed us when we brought legislation before the parliament. They continued to raise negativities about the benefits for rural and regional Australia but the benefits continued to basis, be delivered day in and day out. We have seen the benefits for the beef and dairy industries and today we heard about benefits for the citrus industry. In the member for Barker's electorate in the Riverland, through the export company Riversun of Renmark, Australian citrus growers have seven ships booked over the next 12 weeks to deliver 1.6 million navel oranges and 500,000 cases of mandarins to the United States. The important point on this is that, yes, our citrus trade has existed in recent years with the US but as a result of the free trade agreement with the United States, the duty on citrus has been dramatically reduced. Before the free trade agreement, the duty was $US21 a pallet. These shipments will be going to the US paying only 30c a pallet duty-that is the reduction. It has made our to product much more competitive and desirable in the US market. The savings are worth over half a million US dollars to this particular exporter into the US market. That is not all. We know that the Australian exports of lamb to the US faced some considerable challenges with safeguard measures that the Clinton administration put on our lamb exports to the United States. Prior to the free trade agreement, our maximum amount of tonnage exported to the US was 31,000 tonnes. According to Steve Martin from the Australian Meat Industry Council, this year we are likely to exceed 40,000 tonnes of lamb meat into the United States, which is an extra $65 million to Australia's lamb producers in a year when we are suffering from severe drought. It is a very welcome extra income for Australia's lamb producers. Contrary to a lot of the comments made by the Labor Party about the US free trade agreement over the course of this debate that there were no benefits for rural and regional Australia, the facts indicate that there are. Many industries across rural and regional Australia and the people who work within those industries are very appreciative that this government had the backbone to take on the challenge of negotiating this agreement for their benefit and for the benefit of future generations of Australians.

110,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"3.22 pm)My question is again to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister again to the $500,000 Atherton Hotel grant. Did a member of the Deputy Prime Minister's staff tell Atherton businesses in direct competition with the Atherton Hotel in June last year that the grant represented: A significant step in developing a new image for the tablelands region. Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that one of the features of this hotel is its topless maids and performances by the ‘Stump Bikini Babes'? Is this the new image the Deputy Prime Minister is proposing for the Atherton Tablelands?",100
111,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. This area of Queensland has been very hard hit by a number of very difficult adjustment issues, including the virtual closing down of the Australian tobacco growing industry. In the face of very real social and economic pressures we have attempted to help the area restructure to develop new industries. An integral part of that has been to try to provide it with the infrastructure that would underpin a viable tourism industry with the jobs that a tourism industry would provide. The guidelines and the framework provided for this particular business enterprise have not, I am advised, been contravened. I just repeat that our objective has been to try to enhance business opportunities in a quite severely affected and depressed area of Queensland. National Smartcard",100
112,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services. Would the minister advise the House of initiatives to improve service delivery infrastructure for Australians?,100
113,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question-and isn't it great to have a Liberal representing Elizabeth in South Australia? It is great news for the people of Elizabeth and South Australia. This government is determined to improve service delivery to all Australians. Australian families are generally fed up with having to fill in government forms, particularly when they claim Medicare, and also going into Centrelink offices in order to claim the benefits that they are entitled to. The financial services industry moved away from banking passbooks and limited trading hours in the 1980s, barbut the government still pursues a process of asking people to fill out forms and go into offices. I can advise the House that the government is now developing a detailed proposal for the introduction of a national smartcard and that technology is going to provide easy access to welfare as well as health services. Current legislation ensures vigorous privacy and security standards are part of a citizen's private information protection. The microchip in a smartcard will add additional security to the protection of individuals' tion. We are going to work closely with the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that any improvement in service delivery using new technology will safeguard every Australian's legitimate right to privacy. We are developing this proposal as a whole-of-government proposal. I can advise the House that the Prime Minister raised this with the premiers at COAG two weeks ago and the premiers are right on board and have embraced the Australian government's approach to have a single standard and single protocol for the development of smartcard technology in Australia. I know that the Queensland government is developing a $300 million smartcard for public transport in Queensland. However, there is a danger to all of us that we are going to end up with different ‘rail gauge' technology across Australia during the introduction of the smartcard. We are going to avert that, because we are going to deliver, in partnership with the states and in partnership with the private tor, common standards and common protocols that ensure that Australians are going to receive the sorts of services that they should get in the 21st century with 21st century technology.",100

133,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What do the cases of Cornelia Rau, Vivian Alvarez Chen Yonglin have in common? The answer is that between them they are symbolic of the two great hallmarks of the Howard government and all those who sail within it. The two great hallmarks of the Howard government are, firstly, rank incompetence and, secondly, rank arrogance when that incompetence is exposed. Those two, together, are the hallmarks of HMAS Howard Government. Of course, that cocktail-one part incompetence, one part arrogance-is not limited to the matters which are subject to the MPI today. We see its components-the two hallmarks of the Howard government-at work in the economy, where we have record foreign debt. We see them in foreign policy more broadly, where, when it comes to the Enhanced Cooperation Program in Papua New Guinea, $800 million has been flushed down the S-bend. We see them in the situation we are in with airport security, where four years after September 11 there is still effective system for the screening of staff at airports. We see them in the government's response to the effect of the current drought on our primary industries-in the budget in May there was no mention of the drought, but, whoops, by June, suddenly there is one. We also see them in episodes like that at ANZAC Cove, where the government effectively authorised another foreign government to demolish the site. We see incompetence and arrogance time and again from this government. There is in fact more incompetence in this government than you can poke a stick at, but the real doozey is this: once the incompetence is exposed, the arrogance kicks in. ‘Who, me, responsible for any of these things which have gone wrong?' ‘Who, me-moi-responsible for wrongly detaining Cornelia Rau, an Australian citizen, for nearly a year?' ‘Who, me, responsible for deporting an Australian citizen unlawfully for four years?' ‘Who, me, responsible for not knowing the difference between asylum and a protection visa?' When did we in this parliament ever hear a minister stand at the dispatch box and say, ‘I am responsible for this'? How long has it been since we had a minister stand at the dispatch box and say, ‘I am accountable to this parliament for this thing which has been so radically stuffed up'? When did we last have in this parliament a resignation? When did we last have in this parliament a minister taking responsibility for things going radically awry in their portfolio? The reason none of these things has happened is that the central organising principle of this government is as follows: namely, they believe, arrogantly, that they can now get away with anything. Their view is that, if you have someone locked in the slammer for nine months and you can get away with it, that is terrific. If you have got Vivian Alvano rez languishing in a hostel for the dying for four years and you can get away with it, that is terrific. The bottom line is that they are so used to getting away with it that this is their standard way of behaving. When some of those opposite say, ‘Maybe we could possibly try to change this system which is falling apart at the seams'-when some of the backbench over there put an idea up-they get crushed by the camp commandant, Prime Minister Howard. By the way, on that question, it is interesting to ask: what is the deputy camp commandant-the alternative camp commandant, the Treasurer-doing in this whole debate on immigration on that side of the House? How vocal has he been on these immigration matters? Where has he been in the debate as far as the gang of four on the Liberal Party back bench are concerned? Missing in action. He wants to pretend that he is somehow the softer, kinder, gentler, alternative leader of the Liberal Party. He is MIA, missing in action, when it comes to that debate within their own ranks, and not just MIA but internally taking the club to those who have dared to raise this matter within the Liberal Party backbench. When it comes to the matters before us in this debate, alive in this debate is a principle which says: if you can get away with it, terrific-arrogance, no accountability; simply pretend it has not happened. If you have been brought up on a discipline which says that you can get away with ‘kids overboard' and you can get away with going to war in Iraqyou can get away with all these sorts of things-then frankly you can understand how this arrogance now becomes part of their day-today operations. That brings us to the case concerning Chen Yonglin. The facts on this case are fascinating when you peel them back. We started with the foreign minister saying that Mr Chen did not apply for asylum, that instead he applied for a protection visa and that, if you wanted to know anything about that, you should go and see the immigration minister. Well, whoops. That is where Alex got it wrong. He forgot to telephone Amanda, because what Amanda said, more or less at the same time, was this",102
134,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith will refer to members by their seat or their title.,104
135,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In fact, the immigration minister had said that Mr Chen had applied for asylum-whoops-and it had been rejected. And, if you wanted to find out why it had been rejected, she said that was a matter for the foreign minister. So the foreign minister was saying that Mr Chen did not apply for asylum. The immigration minister said that he did apply for asylum and, on top of that, that the foreign minister had rejected it. They cannot even get their story straight on something as basic as this, which had been kicking around in the media for some time by that stage. So that was plan A. It fell over badly. Plan B was the second cunning plan, when it was starting to go wrong. The second cunning plan was as follows: Mr Chen did not formally apply for protection. Okay, he might have applied for it, but he did not formally apply for protection. I reckon that is terrific! Here we have a letter from Mr Chen which is entitled ‘Re: Seeking political asylum in Australia', dated 25 May. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs said that that does not constitute a formal application for asylum. There are some on the back bench over there and some on the front bench who sometimes question the ability of the foreign minister. Far be it from us to do that, but, frankly, if the foreign minister is presented with a letter of this type, which says at the top of it ‘Seeking political asylum in Australia', I would have thought that even the foreign minister, given the severe challenges he faces in terms of his professional development, would have concluded that that equalled an application for asylum. But, if there is any doubt on that score, it is interesting-and remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, his case is that there has been no formal application for asylum in Australia to go to the relevant visa subclass, visa subclass 800. On the question of what constitutes a formal application for asylum, it says, in subsection (1), ‘Form: Nil.' There is no form to fill out. It is almost unique among all the visa subclasses. There is nothing to fill out. The expectation by this minister in cunning plan No. 2 is as follows: someone out there who is sufficiently desperate to apply for political asylum works their way through the Migration Act and regulations-which are about as long as that document on the table, before you get to the guidelines-and says, ‘Oh dear, what's the relevant form to fill out?' only to discover that there is none. Of course the letter from Mr Chen constituted an application for asylum. He said so at the top of the letter. So alternative plan No. 2 comes crashing down. There we come to cunning plan No. 3. The first cunning plan was this: Mr Chen did not apply for asylum. Cunning plan No. 2 was that he did not formally apply for asylum. Cunning plan No. 3 is as follows: he really should not have applied for asylum all along. That is where Mr Downer then took the argument. I will quote what Alexander ‘Lord' Downer had to say.",104
136,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith will refer to members by their seat or their title.,105
137,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The foreign minister said: ... it doesn't make as much sense for people to just apply for political asylum and expect the Foreign Ministerwait for it to ... make a decision ... The foreign minister said that out of his own mouth. How outrageous that we should stand here and expect the minister, poor overworked minister that he is-a bit of tennis, a bit of golf, a bit of well-paid lecturing, rewriting the history of the Second World War-in between all of these minor and major distractions, to have time to actually make a decision. What an extraordinary expectation we have for the invisible minister, who does not seem to be participating in this MPI debate: that he have time to reflect on this and to make a decision. The problem with cunning plan No. 3 is as follows: if Mr Chen should not apply for asylum in the first place, then why is it that, in the minister's department's annual report, it lists as one of the functions and powers of the department ‘granting territorial and extraterritorial asylum'? That is the 2004-05 annual report. And, of course, it raises the basic questionMr MCGauran-Can anyone understand what he's saying?",105
138,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,105
139,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Minister at the table, I am glad you opened up at this point, because nobody in this parliament could understand a word you said yesterday. It was incomprehensible. It was psychobabble 101 and 102. Nobody understood what you had to say, and the panic which broke out on your front bench and your back bench was extraordinary. You had not even bothered to read your brief. Cunning plan No. 3 falls over because we have a statement from the foreign minister that Mr Chen should not have applied for asylum all along; he should have done something else. Why do you have provisions for asylum in the Migration Act? Why do you have a visa subclass for asylum? Why do these things exist? The foreign minister plainly preferred that they were not used, but they were. But underneath all of this there is a much deeper problem, and these were the matters that were the subject of questions in this House yesterday-questions so effectively answered by the minister sitting at the table! They go to the whole question of the provisions of the Migration Act concerning the protection of confidential information. Section 336F of the Migration ActMr MCGauran interjecting",105
140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will restrain himself!,105
141,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"refers to the unauthorised disclosure of identifying information. What is all that about? Basically, if someone walks in the door and applies for protection, it says specifically that you cannot provide confirming information about such a person's identity to the country or a representative of the country from which that person is seeking protection. You can understand the logic of that. If someone is seeking asylum, the bottom line is that you expect them to have protection from those from whom they are seeking asylum. This raises a very interesting series of questions in terms of how this government has handled this matter over the last three weeks. That is why you had such an outbreak of anxiety on the front bench over there yesterday when these questions were posed. Let us look at the sequence of what happened. Remember that we have had confirmation already from the immigration minister that her officials, through the Sydney office of the department of immigration, contacted or had contact with the Chinese ConsulateGeneral in Sydney about the Chen Yonglin case. Remember what the provisions of the act say: no unauthorised disclosure concerning identity. I would have thought that this raised very interesting questions about the application of section 336F of the Migration Act on that point. But there is more. We also had confirmation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that his departmental officials were engaging not the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney but the Chinese embassy in Canberra on the question of Mr Chen's case. All of this is before it becomes a matter of public record when it appears on the front page of the newspapers on or about 4 June. This was all happening before that, when it was in the private domain. Then we have something further again. Not only do we have contact between the Sydney office of the department of immigration and the Sydney Chinese Consulate-General and contact between the department of foreign affairs and the Chinese embassy here in Canberra but also, on top of that-as the minister let slip yesterday-the minister personally, on 2 June, had direct contact with the Chinese embassy on this case. I remind the House again of the solemn obligations outlined in the legislation concerning the protection of confidential mation for anyone seeking a protection visa. This is why we have not heard any consistent, coherent response from those opposite on these key questions. We may at last have an answer to the following unanswered conundrum. Honourable members will be aware of the fact that as the Schapelle Corby case unfolded we in the opposition were in regular contact with the government, obtaining public service briefings from the government, on the details of that case. We have done the same in relation to the Douglas Wood matter in Iraq. We have sought to do the same in this case as well. When the matter first hit the airwaves on Sunday of the week before last, we requested briefings. On three occasions we requested briefings from the immigration minister, and those requests were all denied. What do they have to hide? I have grave fears that it may be to do with the application of the provisions of section 336 of the Migration Act on the protection of confidential information. This is what we end up with-we have a foreign minister who is too busy to attend to this matter in detail but who delivers the Earle Page lecture. Alexander Downer the Lionheart, defender of tyranny, says that only political conservatives are out there as consistent defenders of freedom. On that basis, Minister, I would have thought that when you were presented with an application for asylum-and taking your own words to heart-you would have taken action, not dithered and not delayed, to proceed with providing protection to this individual seeking sanctuary in this country. On one hand Alexander Downer says that only political conservatives defend freedom, and on the other hand we see his actions on this matter. He stands condemned as a hypocrite. (Time expired)",105
142,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) infor- (3.48 pm)-The honourable member has taken yet another cheap shot by making unsubstantiated-let alone proven-allegations against DIMIA officials in regard to the approach by Mr Chen seeking to make a protection visa application. The honourable member should know that Mr Chen approached the department on 26 May. Mr Rudd interjecting,106
143,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have been briefed. That is because the department issued, on 8 June, a media statement headed ‘Setting the record straight-contact with the PRC consulate'. The member continually makes charges against DIMIA to the effect that they are in breach or potentially in breach of the Migration Act on the basis of confidentiality, yet the department issued a statement several days ago outlining the circumstances of Mr Chen's contact which shows unequivocally that no departmental officer is in breach of the Migration Act and that departmental officers acted dutifully and lawfully at all times. When is the honourable member going to abandon his posturing and grandstanding and address the facts? Mr Chen contacted the New South Wales office of the department of immigration, wanting to speak with the state director. He claimed to be a diplomatic official. A DIMIA officer advised him that she proposed to firm this with the consulate. Mr Chen then gave us the phone numbers for the consulate so that we could check his identity-and that is all we were checking: purely his identity. The DIMIA official did not convey anything other than his name and asked whether he was a consular official. The answer was in the affirmative. It does not matter how many times DIMIA sets out the facts in this case; the member opposite is intent on clouding the issue. By doing so, he casts aspersions the competence and even the legality of DIMIA officials' actions. How many times does the honourable member have to be told? No DIMIA official has broken any immigration law. They are not in breach of section 336F. Section 336F, for the information of honourable members, limits the circumstances in which personnel can identify those who are applying for a protection visa in terms of passing on information to their home country. Mr Chen was not a protection visa applicant at the time of the phone call from DIMIA to the consulate. He participated in that contact so as to establish his bona fides. Quite frankly, the shadow minister, for his own political purposes, is not interested in the facts. In the unlikely event that the member opposite has not seen the media statement of 8 June, I will table it. One thing is for sure: from this point on, the honourable member has no justification, no excuse and no reason to continually misrepresent the actions of DIMIA officials. This is a pretty simple matter. Mr Chen has applied for a protection visa. That is being considered in the normal way but with a high priority at present. He was not granted territorial asylum. Again, for the information of honourable members, the grounds on which asylum-sometimes known as political asylum-may be granted are not governed by any convention or treaty and are the con- prerogative of each country. There is no agreed definition in international law of territorial or political asylum. Territorial asylum in Australia has been granted only in the rarest of circumstances, most notably-as has been replayed in the media at some length-in the Petrov case. No application for territorial asylum has been granted in Australia since 1980. Where is the criticism of the foreign minister or of the government in considering Mr Chen's on application, to the extent that there was one, for territorial asylum? Is the honourable member for Griffith suggesting that Mr Chen should have been granted political asylum? If so, he should say exactly that. He obviously wants a bet each way. On the one hand he criticised, by inference, the government for not granting territorial asylum. If it had been granted, it would have been the first time it had been granted since 1980; it has been granted only a handful of times since Federation. On the other hand, if he were in government and in the same position-in possession of the same facts, policy considerations and public interest matters as the government-he would not have granted an asylum visa. The hypocrisy is staggering. Mr Chen is being properly assessed for protection, and in that the department has a lot of experience. We receive approximately 1,000 applications for protection visas from the People's Republic of China nationals each year, although last year that figure was down to 733. On average, approximately six per cent of applicants are granted protection visas, which is not an unsubstantial number or percentage of approvals. The member for Griffith has a lot of answering to do in his misrepresentation-let's not overstate it-and even in his denigration of immigration officials in the face of the stated facts. The department made it perfectly clear in its written statement that contact with the consulate confirmed only that Mr Chen worked there; it did not disclose any information about his whereabouts or his intentions. The fact that he wanted to seek a protection visa or asylum was not known to the department at the time of the phone call. Mr Chen lodged his application for a protection visa on Friday, 3 June. DIMIA offered to meet with him early in the following week so that they could conduct an interview for his application. But at his request the interview has been rescheduled for a later date. I am a little puzzled that this MPI is put forward on the basis of criticising the government's handling of asylum and protection visa obligations. I would have assumed that the shadow minister for immigration would have been participating in this debate, especially given that the member for Griffith's entire presentation has been on immigration issues. The shadow minister for immigration has been sidelined. He was not in the chamber for the member for Griffith's presentation, other than for a brief interruption when he put a piece of paper on the dispatch box for the information or edification of the member for Griffith. I think it is a pretty sad sidelining of the member for Reid. He is not even going to second this debate. Where is the shadow minister for immigration? This is a debate not so much about foreign affairs or asylum obligations; it is about immigration, as the shadow minister for foreign affairs has made abundantly clear during his contribution. So the member for Reid is definitely on the outer. He is not being allowed to ask questions on immigration. The two questions on immigration that have come my way since the last election were both asked by the member for Griffith only yesterday. So the member for Reid has been unceremoniously dumped. If that is how the Leader of the Opposition humiliates his shadow ministers, no wonder there are such rumblings about the quality of his leadership. As I said, on average, we receive 1,000 protection visa applications from PRC nationals each year. In 2003-04 we received a total of 3,500 protection visa applications, of which 733 were from PRC nationals. Australia has a strong record of support for genuine protection visa applicants. We process several thousand applications each year. There are well-defined processes in place to do so as speedily as possible. We have to ensure that all applicants receive a fair hearing. Interestingly, in recent years applicants for protection visas have largely come from China. In 2003-04 they topped the list of the citizenship of the various nationalities of the applicants and they did so again in 2004-05, although the figure was substantially lower, at 382. They have the highest number of applications for protection visas. In 2003-04, protection visas were granted to 77 applicants, which is about 10 per cent of the total number of applicants; in 2004-05, that figure was 57, which was over 10 per cent. Mr Chen can be assured, as can all members of this House and the general public, that his application is being treated with the utmost seriousness and that it will be very fairly determined. But because the minister for immigration may well be the final arbiter on this issue, I am limited in what I can say. It is prudent to exercise caution in this matter and not to discuss his details at great length and certainly not beyond what he or those acting on his behalf have put into the public arena. The minister may end up being the final decision maker on Mr Chen's protection application if he is unsuccessful at the primary stage, where the department of immigration makes the decision, and then at the review stages, where the Refugee Review Tribunal and possibly the Federal Court system also make decisions. Australia has a world-class refugee assessment process. It exceeds all of the expectations of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in such processes. The high commissioner suggests that refugee determinations be accompanied by at least one review opportunity by the courts or by the merits review process. Australia provides both. In addition, Australia provides an opportunity for the minister to use an intervention power under section 417 of the Migration Act, where a person who is not a refugee is allowed to remain in Australia on broader public interest grounds. Australia provides a full independent merits review using the specialist tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal. That allows the applicant to put forward any new claims or information they wish to submit and to remedy shortcomings in their earlier applications to DIMIA. Judicial review is also available to test whether protection visa decisions were made in accordance with the law. DIMIA's processing of protection visa applications was recently audited by the Australian National Audit Office and its report was published earlier this year. The decision making was found to be well managed and conducted by well-trained and supported officers. So what do we have here? We have a shadow minister making a great deal of noise, careless with the facts, and trying to stir up a controversy where none exists. Mr Chen presented at the DIMIA Sydney office. His identity was established without breaching any confidentiality, let alone causing any breach of the Migration Act. He was not successful in being granted territorial asylum, but he has now gone down the route which is well travelled by a great many of his fellow country men and women, a significant proportion of whom, I believe, have been granted protection. He will be dealt with according to the most transparent and best practice in Australia. The member for Reid is yet to make his appearance in the chamber. The member for Griffith in his anxiety to pursue higher office within the opposition-it is always fascinating to see members of an opposition fight over the spoils of defeat-is undermining his own colleague. This is an MPI on immigration. Where is the shadow minister for immigration? Mr Rudd interjecting",107
144,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can tell you one thing: the shadow minister for immigration is always well briefed. I may not always agree with his conclusions, but there is never any doubting the integrity he brings to his portfolio responsibilities. I am sorry we cannot say the same thing about the member for Griffith. The member for Griffith has, with the concurrence of the Leader of the Opposition, humiliated the member for Reid. Who has ever heard of an immigration MPI being conducted by the foreign minister, so much so that the member for Reid has displayed his displeasure by being absent from the chamber? What is so pressing that the member for Reid is not here to support the member for Griffith? It is simply because he does not appreciate the disloyalty being shown by the member for Griffith.

145,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith is warned.,110
146,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise today to speak on this matter of public importance-the failure of the government to properly implement Australia's asylum and protection obligations. It seems that the member for Gippsland had a degree of difficulty in understanding many of the points that the member for Griffith made earlier, so I will go over a number of those points for his benefit so that we can properly understand all of the relevant points. The Chen Yonglin debacle is yet another example of this government's absolute incompetence in handling issues of asylum. It is now tragically obvious that the government has simply lost control of all matters pertaining to asylum and immigration. Its list of blunders is growing day by day. First of all, look at this absolute tragedy of Cornelia Rau. The details we all know: an Australian citizen thrown into detention because of the ongoing bungling by DIMIA-an outrageous situation compounded by the fact that some of the blame was foisted onto the states. As a former police officer, I can tell you that that is not the case. The blame lies with DIMIA and their actions at the time in the state and Commonwealth jurisdictions and the differentiation between those. In the case of Cornelia Rau, we have a woman locked for months behind the razor wire of a detention centre. A woman suffering mental illness treated in such a way is absolutely horrendous. Then we have Vivian Solon's case, and that is even more appalling-an Australian citizen deported to the Philippines and her whereabouts unknown by her family and friends who were distressed for years as to what had become of her. It is an outrageous situation that this has been allowed to happen-an Australian citizen being deported, thrown out of her own country because the minister in charge has taken her eye off the ball. That is what has happened. Her startling incompetence has left the bureaucrats to run the department. If the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs cannot handle the job, then the Prime Minister must replace her with someone who can. These are just the cases we are aware of. We do not know the full extent of the bungling, we do not yet know the full extent of the incompetence and we do not know the depths to which other cases have gone. The government's behind closed doors inquiry will ultimately reveal an immigration and asylum system in complete and utter disarray. They know they are in trouble, and that is why they have locked the Australian people out of it. That is why they have stopped them from hearing the full details, because they know that when the full details come out people will be outraged at the extent of the incompetence. Make no mistake about it: the responsibility for these monumental stuff-ups lies with the government. It is their responsibility. They will blame the bureaucracy in an attempt to spin themselves out of trouble. We all know that this is this government's modus operandi. This is their agenda. Their arrogance has grown to such a height that they believe now that they do not have to be accountable to the Australian people. They believe that it is not necessary now because of the depth of their arrogance. But the fact remains that the ministers responsible have neglected their responsibilities. We are seeing this time and again on these issues. In this case we are now seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs playing pass the parcel with the life of Chen Yonglin. These government ministers have committed a litany of blunders as they ineptly bungle their way through the immigration system. If we look at the facts clearly and follow the time line, we can see how this has happened. First, on 8 June the foreign minister said in a press conference that Chen had not applied for territorial asylum. He said: Look, this is quite a semantic point because he certainly applied to stay in Australia and the only fairs. semantic and minor point that I would make is that he didn't make a direct application to me as the foreign minister, for political asylum. And again on 8 June, in an interview on the ABC's AM program, the foreign minister said: Well, he didn't lodge a formal application at all. But, as we heard earlier from the member for Griffith, Chen's letter dated 25 May is headed: ‘Re: Seeking Political Asylum in Australia'. Ms George-It is pretty clear, isn't it?",110
147,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Absolutely. In his letter he directly requested political asylum from the Australian government. In that letter he said: I, a Consul for Political Affairs (First Secretary rank) of the Consulate-General of the People's Republic of China in Sydney, together with my wife JIN Ping and my daughter CHEN Fangrong, now seek political asylum from the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. The foreign minister has said that Chen made no formal application for territorial asylum, but schedule 1 of the regulations under the Migration Act makes clear that there is no form. He could not formally apply because there is no form. To make the record absolutely clear, let me read from the schedule in the Migration Regulations: 1131. Territorial Asylum (Residence) (Class BE) Form: Nil. Visa application charge: Nil. This is bungling we are seeing. So who at the end of the day is actually responsible for handling the Chen case? The immigration minister says it is a matter for the foreign minister. On 6 June, she told the ABC: Well, I think it's clear that he has had a request for what is more properly described as territorial asylum refused, but that's not a matter for me. That's a matter for the Minister for Foreign AfAnd then on 9 June she said: Anything said to Mr Chen in relation to territorial asylum by immigration officials was in fact simply passing on information from Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Anything in relation to someone seeking territorial asylum is a matter for Mr Downer to respond to. But the foreign minister says Chen's case is a matter for Immigration. On 5 June, on the Sunday program, he said: I don't want to get into a commentary about it, because the immigration department are going to have to look at this application. And then on 8 June he said: It's much wiser to have a considered process which can be worked through by the immigration department; they're the experts in considering these cases ... But the foreign minister's own department's annual report lists the power to grant territorial asylum as one of its specific functions. In its annual report of 2003-04 the department says: The department exercises, or participates in the exercise of, the following functions and decision making powers: … … … granting territorial and extra-territorial asylum ... If the ministers in charge are confused about who is responsible, how can the system be run effectively? You simply cannot run an immigration system based on incompetence and confusion. I am also deeply concerned by the possible unlawful contact between the Australian government and the Chinese embassy on this issue. The Chinese ambassador told Lateline that the Australian government asked her if Chen would be persecuted. She said: I was asked by the Australian Government about whether he will be-whether he will face persecution if he returns to China, as he said, he won't. But sections 336 E and F of the Migration Act 1950 make such communication with a foreign government a criminal offence punishable by two years prison. Section 336E(3) of the act specifically states that disclosures of information which would identify an applicant for a protection visa to a foreign country in respect of which the application or claim is made are unauthorised. And Section 336E(1) of the act makes the disclosure of information identifying an applicant for a protection visa a criminal offence punishable by up to two years prison or a fine of $13,500. Yesterday, in response to opposition questioning, the foreign minister gave an ‘absolute assurance' that his department had not breached Australian law in its dealings with the Chinese embassy on the Chen case. But the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in this place refused to give the same assurance when asked an identical question. So which is it? Have government representatives committed an illegal offence in their handling of this matter? The challenge today is now clear. The Howard government must guarantee it has not broken its own law by not protecting Chen's identity. There is also a challenge for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, arising from his refusal on two occasions to deny that his department had spoken to the Chinese embassy directly about what would happen to Chen if he was returned to China. These three government ministers now have an obligation to immediately set the record straight. There are chronic problems within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Under the current minister's watch, DIMIA has spiralled down into absolute chaos. We are seeing that and said in so many cases now. Confusion and incompetence reign, and that is no way to run an immigration system. The minister has lost control-it is as simple as that-and the government has failed to provide our nation with a working and competent immigration system. The Prime Minister has failed to ensure that his ministers are doing the job. It is the Prime Minister's responsibility to fix the problems that his neglect and his government have created.",111
148,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we have been witnessing here this afternoon in this matter of public importance is simply an attempt at mud slinging. It is a case of: throw enough mud and hopefully some will stick. But even the execution of this strategy has been pathetic. If you sat here and listened to what we have had to put up with for the last three-quarters of an hour, you would have heard psychobabble 101 and 102 and cunning plans 123-simplistic, extreme, tortured, cute arguments. This has been embarrassing. It was a low point for the opposition here this afternoon. It was like being flogged with a lettuce leaf. The opposition seek to smear the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and, through it, the government. It is muck raking, plain and simple, in the vain hope of distracting everybody from Labor's tax debacle. It is an attempt by the member for Griffith to show to his colleagues that when Labor is in a big pickle he has the ability and the ticker to turn things around. The member for Griffith is trailing his leadership coat here today and this afternoon he tripped up on his coat. His was a pathetic argument. In his argument, the member for Griffith has been reckless and a touch desperate. There is a lot at stake here-people's reputations. There are solid citizens doing their jobs who have just been trashed here this afternoon for no good reason other than to save the skins of the opposition. It has been reckless and it has been desperate. The member for Griffith has been saying this afternoon, in here and in other places, that the government should basically do away with due process and give Mr Chen a protection visa. That is what he is saying, that is what he is asserting and that is at the core of his argument. The member for Richmond also supported that line of argument. The member for Griffith, without looking at Mr Chen's case and without looking at his bona fides, is saying, ‘Let's circumvent due process.' But a protection visa without due process basically amounts to political asylum. That is what they are saying: ‘Why hasn't the government immediately given him political asylum?' Because political asylum is granted at the total discretion of the government of the day without due process. But, quite rightly, all Australian governments since Federation have been extremely reluctant to provide political asylum-for obvious reasons, for responsible reasons, for good governance reasons and for sensible reasons related to our relations with countries all around the world. You do not take that sort of decision lightly. In fact, there really been only one occasion since Federation when political asylum was granted, and that was in 1954 with the Petrov affair-the  the height of the Cold War. They were circumstances fundamentally totally different to those we have seen in the last couple of weeks with Mr Chen, yet the opposition blithely stand up and imply that the government should provide a protection visa without due process, which equals political asylum. Political asylum has only been given on one occasion since Federation, yet before us today the member for Griffith was sayingdespite not being born when the last example of it was given-that he expected the government to bypass due process and in effect provide political asylum. If the government followed the ad hoc process suggested by the member for Griffith, it would result in an immigration system ending in a shambles. The 3,000 people applying for protection visas each year would all be queuing up to go on the 60 Minutes TV program if the member for Griffith had his way. The member for Griffith talks about incompetence. The incompetence here today has been demonstrated on the other side of the House, and it stemmed from the decision to oppose the tax cuts a few weeks ago after the budget. That is where the incompetence lies in this place. The member for Griffith has the gall to stand up here and suggest incompetence on the other side of the House. That is why the opposition is desperately looking for a distraction. It has bungled badly by seeking to stop tax cuts for all Australians, so the opposition is on a fishing expedition to detract attention from Labor's tax embarrassment. We have had assertions and innuendo about Mr Chen Yonglin. We have had assertions and innuendo about 50 immigration detainees being interviewed by Chihas nese officials-a perfectly proper practice, if you look into the facts. The member for Griffith and his colleagues do not let facts get in the way, though. We have had assertions and innuendo on Australia's position on China's human rights, Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez. Let me look at the legitimacy and the appropriateness of actions taken on these issues by the government, starting with the case of Mr Chen Yonglin. Mr Chen sought political territorial asylum in a letter dated 25 May. That is a matter of public record. It was addressed to DIMIA and delivered to DIMIA on Thursday, 26 May. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs decided not to issue an instrument that would have allowed Mr Chen to make a formal application for political asylum. The member for Griffith understands this, surely. Surely he understands that it requires an instrument, yet both members of the opposition stood up here today and carried out this charade, saying that in some way the government could have and should have provided political asylum at short notice on the basis of a letter. It requires a minister to issue instrument. The opposition must be aware of this requirement. If not, the member is certainly incompetent in his actions. Mr MCGauran-Or worse.",112
149,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I suspect it is incompetence or worse, absolutely. The minister decided not to issue an instrument and, in communicating that decision to Mr Chen, officials also advised that if he wished to stay in tralia he could apply for a visa, including a protection visa, but that he must follow due process and not receive political asylum by default. On Tuesday, 31 May Mr Chen met with DIMIA's New South Wales deputy state director and a representative from the protocol area of DFAT. At this meeting, DFAT reiterated the advice that he was not receiving territorial or political asylum and was unlikely to be granted a protection visa. His visa options, including general migration options, were explained by DIMIA and he was immovable in his request for the protection visa option. He was then handed an application for a protection visa. Mr Chen formally applied for a protection visa on 3 June-again, that is a matter of public record. This will be considered by DIMIA on its merits and in the normal manner. The government regard this approach as appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing we have heard today would suggest that there are any circumstances which would alter this normal due process of assessing a protection visa application. Any other public comment about Mr Chen could prejudice consideration of his application. Around 1,000 Chinese nationals a year apply for protection visas in this country. Such applications are not unusual, and this application will be treated in the usual way. In fact, 77 of those 1,000 applicants were successful in getting a protection visa last year. Why should Mr Chen be treated any an differently to the other 1,000 from China who applied for protection visas last year or the other 2,000 who applied for protection visas from elsewhere around the world? This is a normal case of an application by a Chinese national for a protection visa and due process will be followed. A number of contacts with DFAT officials were initiated by the Chinese ConsulateAus- General in Sydney and the Chinese embassy in Canberra about Mr Chen. In none of those contacts was anything done improperly to convey information about Mr Chen's intentions. In fact, in every case, due process has been followed and the letter of the law has been followed by the minister and the department. This debate is a failed attempt to create a smokescreen for Labor's embarrassment over their decision to block tax cuts for all Australians. It is grubby politics, because the opposition have been prepared to seek to trash the reputation of fine public servants and responsible government ministers for no other reason than to save their own political skins. The actions of the government in regard to Mr Chen and all others applying for protection visas have been proper and according to due process. We will not be intimidated by the crude and pathetic attacks from the opposition. (Time expired)",114

NA COMPANY BILL 2005 Cognate bill: NA COMPANY (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr MCGauran: That the bill be now read a second time.",117
153,Mr MCCLELLAND,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"The opposition support the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998 and the Film Licensed Investment Company (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2005. It is non-controversial legislation. But, while it is non-controversial, it is nonetheless important. There is a history in modern Australia of, in particular, federal government intervention in, and assistance to, the film industry. That has been very important to the success of our film industry. Certainly it is recognised that the Whitlam government made some tremendous inroads in the film industry. Speaking on my own behalf, when my father was minister for the media he took particular pride in it. But he refers to the tribution made to the film industry by, in particular, John Gorton in the Fraser government. There is certainly a history of the Australian government contributing to, and assisting in, the development of Australia's film industry. So, in that context, today we can contribute to the further development of our unfortunately now lagging industry and get it back to the industry that we all had pride in. Regrettably, the Australian film industry is currently suffering from a low level of local to production, while private investment in the sector is also languishing. The share of the Australian box office patronage enjoyed by Australian films is also falling; whereas, paradoxically, foreign films in which Australian actors feature or star are doing exceptionally well in the box office. So clearly ample talent is available to the Australian film industry. What we need to do as a parliament is to encourage that local investment. Concern about the future viability of the industry as it is currently funded has been expressed in many quarters, but it has received particular attention since the Academy award-winning actress, Cate Blanchett, at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards in London earlier this year, publicly rebuked the government for its inactivity. She said: It's such a shame about funding in Australia ... We recognise that, and we also recognise that this legislation is at least a step in the right directionMr MCGauran-New funding from you?",118
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Minister, restrain yourself.",118
155,Mr MCCLELLAND,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"It is in terms of encouraging the minister for this step in the right direction, but perhaps it is too modest a step in the right direction. Under the current government, the film industry has endured a con- period of steep decline and the engineering of the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998 reflects the current problems and uncertainties of an industry suffering from government neglect. The bill is something of a bandaid but, as I have said, we acknowledge it as being a step in the right direction. It is essentially a modest proposal that, if fully successful, will result in an injection of approximately $20 million into the Australian film industry over the next two years. That is not going to produce blockbusters, but there have been successes even with modest production budgets in the Australian film industry. Given the current investment malaise in the industry, that is certainly a modest target. The bill seeks to promote further private investment in the film industry by allowing a 100 per cent up-front tax deduction for taxpayers investing funds in the company licensed to raise the proposed $20 million. While such shares are tradeable, the up-front deduction will be available only to the origienjoy-either nal investor. These funds will be raised by June 2007 and must be invested by June 2008. The bill contains a number of welcome provisions that seek to encourage a broader, more diverse film industry. These include limitations on the level of share ownership available to any individual as well on the level of possible foreign ownership, and there are requirements that films funded under the scheme portray Australian perspectives and Australia's cultural diversity. That criterion is strongly supported by the opposisome tion. The bill also ensures the use of a competitive process for the allocation of the licence to raise the funding. Criteria have been established to ensure Australian management and direction of the successful company, which again focuses on creating what is essentially an Australian product, reflecting Australia's culture and cultural diversity. That is a goal and an outcome that the government have proposed and, again I note, is supported strongly by the opposition. But there is a long way to go before the Australian film industry is restored to health. immediate, perhaps, is the need to complete a review of the tax act in regard to film vestment and to ensure that tax rulings do not undermine promises held out to potential investors in Australian films. The Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005 is a modest proposal but, as I have said on several occasions, we recognise it as a step in the right direction. For that reason, Labor supports these measures. It is generally accepted, as all members would recognise, that going to the movies or hiring a video are very much traditions in themselves and part of the Australian culture. It is relatively cheap and accessible entertainment and certainly something that we all going as a couple or taking the children along to a film that may interest them. However, it is incumbent upon us that we do not take Australia's place in this industry for granted, for in doing this we put at risk not just a pastime that is cherished and enjoyed by Australian families but also Australian jobs and the opportunity to promote Australian culture throughout the world. While we all cherish the Australian cultureit is a particularly balanced and desirable culture-I think promoting it throughout our region would assist in taming, if you like, of the more obsessive and fundamentalist views that tend to be emerging in some countries in our region. I reiterate two of the very welcome provisions of the bill: that films funded under this scheme ‘portray Australian perspectives and Australia's cultural diversity'; and that the scheme places limitations on the level of share ownership available to any individual, as well as on the level of possible foreign ownership. It is important to recognise the need to protect the diversity of our industry. Diversity in our mass media is integral to the Australian public's ability to communicate Most with one another and has been recognised over many years by all governments as being in- fundamental to our democratic system. While the film industry may not necessarily raise political issues, I think its ability to raise and promote issues in various forms in an entertaining way but nonetheless in a thought-provoking way can be important for the stimulation of debate in our community and to enliven interest in various issues among those who go to the movies. Certainly in terms of diversity, we as an Australian culture are a combination of many cultures. In that combination we are uniquely Australian, and this is a particular feature of our community that can be promoted through our film industry. Unquestionably, media diversity fundamentally enhances the quality of what we consume as publicly available information each day. I think we all have to recognise that globalisation and the forces of economic rationalisation have seen and will continue to see our mass media undergo centralising phenomena. Indeed, the potential is there for our media to be overtaken by foreign interests. It is therefore much more important than ever that government finds the balance between free market forces and the prerogative to assert our own national identity in media marketplace. In that context, we think the bill strikes the appropriate balance. Australia has a proud tradition in filmmaking, and the continuation of this tradition must be assured in the fiercely competitive 21st century global environment to which I have referred. Investment capital has never been more globally mobile. Hence, there is an onus on government to encourage Australian investors to focus on their own backyard. Great Australian films are many, they are unique and they are award winning. Some truly great Australian films go back to the initiatives of the Whitlam governmentfor example, Wake in Fright, which I recall featured Harry Secombe as a teacher in outback Australia. I think the movie Squeeze a Flower, Squeeze a Grape featured an Italian migrant making his way in Australia. The movie The Adventures of Barry MCKenzieMr MCGauran-What about Chips Rafferty? How far back are you going?",118
156,Mr MCCLELLAND,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"I am going back to the 1970s at this stage, but I would recognise the minister going back even earlier than that. At that stage, to give that movie a kick along, I recall that the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and his wife, Margaret, featured in the return of Barry MCKenzie to Australia. In 1978, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith was a provocative movie regarding what was unquestionably a violent act. It was based on the book by Thomas Keneally, which many children have studied at high school in recent years. In 1981, Gallipoli, while a source of national pride, showed the horror of the historic assault on The Neck in Gallipoli and the loss of literally hundreds of lives in a very short space of time. In less than half an hour, so many Australian lives were lost in that fruitless attack. Then there is Muriel's Wedding, written by PJ Hoganindeed, it launched him to international the fame. We are talking about not only actors, producers and directors but also writers obtaining benefit from assistance from the Australian film industry and then going on to benefit Australia as well. In 1990 Flirting and in 1994 The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert were movies with a more entertaining perspective. In 1999 Two Hands was a wry look at the seamier side of some of our capital cities. In 2003 we saw Japanese Story. Naming these films is like thanking people at an official function. We have had a vast range of very successful, very entertaining and tremendously creative Australian movies. More recently, we saw The Castle and The Dish-and the list goes on. Those movies all added in their own way to our understanding, interpretation and promotion of some aspects of Australian culture, if not-in the case of The Adventures of Barry MCKenzie-perhaps mocking an Australian characteristic. These examples of Australian films recognise the benefits that have been achieved and can be achieved through government assistance. It is often forgotten that the Australian film culture is almost as old as Federation. I take the point of the minister in leading me down here, but The Story of the Kelly Gang had its world premiere on 26 December 1906, at Melbourne's Athenaeum Hall. With a running length of just over an hour, it was, at the time, the longest narrative film made in Australia, and possibly the longest in the world. It was only Australia's second full-length film and came out six years after Soldiers of the Cross, widely regarded as the world's first feature film. As for the actor chosen to play Ned in the film, apparently there were several actors. This came about when the stage actor originally cast to play Ned Kelly complained about his low wages after completing the first few scenes and just walked off the set. Obviously Actors Equity was not around in those days. Unable to afford another professional actor, the producers frantically hauled in some of the extras on the set and shot them either disguised in the traditional Ned Kelly armour or on horseback using long and wide camera shots. With careful editing, the face of the original actor was entirely eliminated. His name did not appear on the credits, and to this day, despite exhaustive research, his identity is a mystery. When the film was reviewed by the Bulletin on 24 January 1907, it was treated very badly. The Bulletin said: Those splendid bushrangers never come within a hundred yards of a woman without taking off their hats and on occasion they remove their hats dustry. as often as nine times to one woman. Today we should not fail to take our hats off to what the Australian film industry has offered Australians and what it has achieved for Australia in promoting our culture over what has been an interesting and enjoyable history in the last 100 years. In that context, it is wholly appropriateindeed, it is timely-that the government recognises the Australian film industry. I am delighted that the government is doing just a bit more than it has done in the past to ensure that Australia's national identity continues to be celebrated in feature films. Appropriately implemented and managed, the provisions of the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005 will encourage greater investment in our own film industry; and that is wholeheartedly welcomed by our side of politics. The industry contributes to our entertainment, to the development of talent in Australia, and to the appreciation and understanding of the Australian culture internationally.",120
157,Mr BAIRD,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"In speaking on the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005, let me begin by saying that it is interesting to follow my colleague the member for Barton, the member on the other side of the river. I think he is preparing for a long-distant future giving after-dinner speeches, imagining that he is going to be the minister for the arts. I do not know if it is ever going to happen, but certainly it was a long and nostalgic review through the annals of time. The member for Barton started off by saying that he was not sure and blaming the government for the film industry having trouble, but he did not commit to any increased funding for it. There was much rhetoric; there were lots of reviews of the halcyon days under Gough. But there was nothing as to substance and increased funding or how to solve the problems of the inAll of us have strong support for the Australian film industry. We have been impressed by the calibre of Australian films. In my own office I have a young actor, Nathan Seidl, who has been in several productions. I know that he is hoping for a strong and vibrant industry to come to the fore. We want to see a vibrant and strong local film industry in this country for several sons. One is that it is a significant employment generator. There are currently some 26,000 people who work in the industry overall-in television production, video production and films. We have seen The Matrix produced here, as well as parts of Star Wars. The industry is significant in terms of some recent films such as Somersault, Rabbit Proof Fence, Japanese Story and particularly some films that have been funded under the FLIC scheme. Crackerjack is one that was produced that way and has gone on to gain some limited box office success. In terms of this project, we are gaining ability to write off 100 per cent of the funds invested. You are allowed to invest up to 50 per cent of the total cost of the production the film. Some would question why you would put it into the production. Obviously the production is the most expensive part of the film overall. Bruce Davey, who is a partner of Mel Gibson, came to speak to the government committee that I chair-the committee on small business, tourism, arts and sports-about what he saw as some of the issues confronting the industry. His emphasis was that it is still a market driven situation. You cannot expect that, simply because the government puts funding into a film, the film is going to survive. You need to be careful that you do not produce only art house type films with a limited distribution; you have to look at the commercial, bottom line effect. Under the FLIC scheme, we are encouraging people to put their investment into commercial projects. The opportunity is there. This is a significant amount of funding overall. In the next 12 months we will have some $180 million invested by the government in the film industry. That comes through the Film Finance Corporation and the Film Commission itself. The assistance will reprerea- sent some $10 million this year. Around $2.1 billion annually is contributed to our GDP by the film industry as a whole. As I said, close to 26,000 people work in the industry. Australian films have been received well by both local and international audiences. As it stands at the moment, without the support of the government very few Australian films would be made and very few Australian shows would appear on TV. Recently in a visit to New York I was invited by the Consul General, Ken Allen, to attend the Australian short film festival. It had a high level of support and a large numthe ber of people in attendance, and it was very positively received by the group. I noticed that most of the films that were reviewed on of this particular night were those that did receive some level of government support by the Australian Film Finance Corporation. So it is not only giving commercial benefits but also showing something about Australian culture. Rabbit Proof Fence says something about the Indigenous culture in Australia, our own background and the history of the Indigenous people. Japanese Story looks at the Australian mining industry and the vastness of the Australian landscape. The Australian Film Licensed Investment Company Scheme is one part of a picture designed to create larger levels of private finance. It is well regarded that Australia's domestically based film and television industry is having issues competing on the world scale. The member for Barton did actually mention that. Although our talent-our writers, directors, actors and crew-are seen as amongst the best in the world, they are forced to move overseas in order to enhance their careers. Australia has a very small box office. As such, for a film to be solely targeted at an Australian audience, the return on investment is automatically limited by the size of our audience or box office. This can help explain the decline in production levels and domestic box office figures for Australian films. Most of Australia's key international players have pledged their support to help create a more vibrant domestic industry. I feel it is equally important for the governdirectors ment to step up to the plate to assist them this task. The FLIC scheme is part of the government's commitment to enhance the sector. When it was started in 1999, the FLIC scheme was responsible for $63 million worth of domestic film feature production. As I mentioned, Crackerjack, Dirty Deeds and The Bank came out of the program. It is part of a broader program of measures brought down in the 2005-06 budget by the Treasurer. This package is worth $88 million over four years. From this we have seen direct funding for feature films in the forthcoming financial year coming to near the $160 million mark, not $180 million as I previously commented. The package is targeted for a whole-of-industry approach. The package extends to the current 100 per cent deduction for the funds invested. With a sector that is so reliant on government funding, a decrease in this commitment by the government would break the individual projects, not to mention potentially have a devastating impact on the industry as a whole. What we are trying to achieve in the FLIC scheme is to encourage the private sector to invest-to encourage private investors and private individuals to put their funding into the scheme to be able to claim a 100 per cent investment write-off on their taxation. The history of Australian films over recent years has not exactly been one where you could expect huge capital gains or major profits. That is why we need a scheme which is going to have the 100 per cent tax write-off. have seen the flow-on in our own film production from having films such as The Matrix and Star Wars produced partly in Australia, using our skills in film production and across the board in terms of the film corporations-so their skills have been developed. We have not only leading Logie winners and film actors but also leading producers, screen and make-up artists, right across the in board. To encourage the industry on an ongoing basis is significant all the way through. I encourage more of this type of program for more investment in the film industry in the longer term, because of its benefits for Australian cultural life, for employment creation and generation for many of our young people in the film industry, for the potential for them to be offered overseas jobs and contracts, and for the showing of Australian films internationally. It is a great opportunity. It is one which captures the imaginations of not only Australians but also people around the world. If you mention the Australian film industry to people when you travel internationally, there are many supportive comments. I have been amazed at how many people have seen Australian films. We need to continue this program. It is a good initiative. I am pleased to see the member for Barton has indicated that the opposition support this continued program. It is clear that the industry is in a dip at the moment. Undoubtedly there are many factors involved in that. But at least we are seeing the government committing to further funding, so that can add to the overall vibrancy of the industry. But we need to monitor it. It is a competitive area. Internationally we see the Canadian film corporation investing major funding. The Singapore people-and London, as well-are developing their own sound studios, film studios and assistance from the government. While this is welcome, we need to make sure that we do not fall beWe hind in this area, that we continue to monitor it and that we encourage all those many talented young people-such as the young man I have in my office-to look to a film future in Australia.",121
158,Mr MCMULLAN,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"I want to support the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005 and the Film Licensed Investment Company (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2005. Like the member for Barton, I welcome any initiative to provide further funding to the film industry, particularly at this time when it is in crisis. The vious speaker, the member for Cook, said it was suffering a bit of a dip. I think it is ally in a very serious crisis. The percentage of the Australian box office being spent on Australian films is at a record low, and the production slate is very low-although we are seeing some re-emergence of some quality films from Australia, and one welcomes that, and we want to see more of it. I want to say something about the film licensed investment companies, the origin of the proposal-that is, the 1998 proposition-and this proposal to continue it in a slightly reduced form, and something about more fundamental issues relating to the crisis in film and television production. The Film Licence Investment Company proposition, when originally introduced by legislation in 1998, was based on a report by David Gonski, who is a significant figure in the Australian arts and finance sectors. The original proposition did not pick up all of the Gonski propositions. It was proposed then that there be more than one Film Licence Investment Company, but there was not sufficient market demand for more than one to be successful-although more than one licence was issued. I notice that the proposition now put forward by the government is less ambitious. It has quietly dropped the 1998 proposition for more than one company and, with that exception, I assume they are continuing with their previous initiative. But in 1998 the provisions did allow for more than one and more than one licence was issued, although only one company fund effectively became operational. That company fund did make significant contributions to production finance available in Australia; they were relatively small but, nevertheless, welcome. This being a commercial investment proposition, it was originally envisaged that it would have a greater eye on the commercial reliability and prospects of the propreductions. But I do not think the evidence backs that up. I do not think there is anything actuto suggest that the films produced under the Film Licence Investment Company Scheme are more commercially oriented than those funded by the Film Finance Corporation-in fact, they are perhaps less so. Nevertheless, many doors need to be made available for film financing. It is an area in which investment decisions with a commercial element are also subject to elements of subjectivity and judgment. To be able to go to the Film Finance Corporation and to state film bodies with Film Licence Investment Company propositions for operations under 10BA opens more doors and allows more judgments and a more diverse set of judgments to be made and, therefore, provides a broader range of film opportunities. On the face of it, it looks like a pretty inefficient structure because there are so many different sources of financeCommonwealth, state, 10BA film licence investment companies, the Film Finance Corporation and the Film Commission. But, as I say, I think the idea of having many different doors is appropriate. This is not an area where you can simply streamline it into one. It would be more efficient administratively and there would be fewer overheads, but there would be a narrower range of judgments being exercised. I do not regard film licensing investment companies as a major contribution to the financing of Australian films; I think their contribution is quite minor, but it is positive and I welcome and support it. Underpinning the problem that the FLICs are trying to deal with is the crisis in film and television production in Australia and, at an even more basic level, the failure to invest in the fundamentals that create the basis on which a successful film and television industry can be built. Prior to the 1998 election, I attended a function at which Geoffrey Rush spoke; he had just won an Oscar for Shine. He said, I think very effectively and accurately: ‘I could never have become the successful actor I am, were it not for the original government funding of the Queensland Theatre Company that enabled me to develop my craft and skills as an actor'-and to develop them to a level where he could transfer them and become the successful film actor that he is. He was making the profound point that, if we do not invest in the underlying fundamentals of the experimental and major theatre companies, we will not produce quality actors. At the moment we are living off the fat of investment in previous years that developed leading Australian figures in global films. World leading Australian actors, directors et cetera are essentially the product of great investment over many years in institutions like NIDA. If we do not continue that investment, we will find that there is a bit of a gap at the top in five, 10 15 years time. The first problem is a failure to invest in the fundamentals. The second problem is a failure to invest at the television production level, where many of the skills are developed and many of the people are kept employed, which enables them to be available, when required, to the film industry-and not just actors, but electricians, carpenters, drivers, caterers and all those who go to making a successful production. I want to refer here particularly to the crisis in drama production at the ABC. On 19 May, an article by Amanda Mead in the Australian reported, ‘The ABC will stop producing Australian drama altogether if the federal government does not increase its triennial funding this year.' That warning was issued by the managing director, Russell Balding. He went on to say: The ABC is nearing the day when it will not be able to commission any Australian drama at all because of the cost and the funding restraints ... This issue was taken up by John Wood when he received his Logie. He said, ‘Kick some money into the ABC.' If we are not receiving basic quality and cutting-edge production from the ABC, we are not developing the training and skills that will create the potential for a successful film industry in five or 10 years time. There is something else that we are not doing-and I do not think the FLICs assist in this. This is not a criticism of FLICs; it is not what they are designed to do. This can only be done successfully by bodies like the Film Commission. We are not investing enough in scripts. The success of films essentially revolves around scripts. We do not give enough patient support to enable scripts to be refined and improved and for third, fourth and fifth drafts to be written. Great Australian scriptwriters who have been hired to go to the US are paid more for revising a third or draft of a script into a fourth draft than they get for the whole exercise in Australia. We need to be more prepared to invest in scripts if we are to have quality films. Finally, we are very strong on doing things on the supply side of the film industry-and we have to do that-but we have to make sure that we are doing something on the demand side as well. I do not mean ‘demand side' in terms of Australians getting the opportunity to go and see films; there is plenty of opportunity for that. I mean ensuring that there is ample opportunity for Australians who invest their taxes in Australian films to get a chance to see them. The nature of the distribution system is such that, if you live outside the major capital cities or you do not live in a town that has a multiplex, you will probably not see an Australian film; they will not come to the smaller centres. We need to do something on the demand side, and I will have something to say about that issue on another occasion. The film industry is one of the ways in which Australians tell our stories to ourselves and to others. I welcome any support that makes it more possible for Australians with creativity, imagination and ideas to turn those into successful films. Film licensed investment companies are one small contribution to that and, small as it is, I welcome as a small step in the right direction. I support the bill.",124
159,Mr BILSON,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Dunkley-Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs and Trade)) (5.01 pm)-I rise to wrap up the debate on the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 2005 and commend the members for Barton, Cook and Fraser for their contributions. The government recognises the importance of a viable local film and television industry and the significant contribution of the sector to our economy and our cultural life. As a whole, the Australian film and television industry contributes some $2.1 billion annually to GDP and employs more than 25,500 people. The government wants the sector to produce increasing numbers of films that appeal to audiences both here at home and abroad. The government provides a range of support to this sector to ensure its long-term sustainability. Without government intervention there would be few local voices on our screens. Despite that support, the government acknowledges that it has become increasingly difficult for our television and film sector to compete both locally and abroad. The government is aware that the local film sector is in the midst of a difficult period. While key creative Australians attract international accolades, production levels and the box office performance of local films have fallen. In response, the government has introduced a package of measures worth $88 million over four years to strengthen the local film and television sector. The package is aimed at attracting greater levels of private finance, redressing the current downturn in local production and keeping the sector competitive through script and skills development. The package is a carefully balanced strategic intervention that takes a whole-ofindustry approach. It is comprehensive and it acknowledges that there is no single quick fix that can address current challenges. The increases in direct funding to Australian government film agencies, recently confirmed in the 2005-06 budget, will bring total direct funding to a high of almost $160 million in 2005-06. The government is also committed to encouraging greater private sector investment in our local product and increases in direct support are complemented by measures to make the film sector more attractive for private investors. The extension of the Film Licensed Investment Company scheme, known as FLIC, is a key element of the government's film package. The government will soon be calling for submissions to a review of sections 10B and 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and has announced that it will amend the act in regard to the interaction of foreign losses quarantining rules. Both of these measures were sought by the sector. Private investment is an important complement to direct funding by government. In Australia, film and television financing is usually a combination of investment from the marketplace, government funding and private investors. The extended FLIC scheme seeks to encourage growth in funding from individuals and corporate entities and to restore investor confidence in the local film and television sector. The pilot FLIC scheme commenced in 1999, attracted around $21 million in investment and triggered $63 million worth of feature film production alone. It produced successful films like Crackerjack, Dirty Deeds and The Bank. The focus of the scheme is on encouraging investment in the production of Australian films. Production is the most costly aspect of film-making. Without adequate funding and appropriate investment levels to improve the quality aspects of production, the chances of success for a film or television program are significantly diminished. The extended FLIC scheme will allow investors a 100 per cent up-front deduction on the purchases of FLIC shares in the year of investment. These funds will immediately flow to the FLIC. Subject to certain licence conditions being met, the FLIC must be an Australian owned and controlled company raising funds primarily from Australian investors in qualifying Australian films. The extended scheme will allow a single FLIC licence to raise up to $20 million over a two-year period at a total cost to revenue of $8 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08. The issuing of a single licence will minimise the duplication of administrative costs that may result from the issuing of multiple licences. The FLIC licence will be allocated following a competitive process, and applications for the licence will be sought following the passage of this legislation. Funds raised by the FLIC will be invested in a range of film and television productions, thus spreading investor risk across a production slate. Investment in marketing and distribution activities will be permitted under the extended scheme up to a maximum of half of the amount which the FLIC invests in production. Co-investment from other market players will also be permitted under the extended scheme to maximise the value of productions. The intention is that the FLIC moneys will act as a trigger for other commercial organisations to invest in Australian productions. This will result in films with bigger budgets and quality high-end production values. This, in turn, leads to greater opportunities for commercial success and improved returns for FLIC investors. The extension of the FLIC scheme has been welcomed by the sector as a timely intervention in a difficult market where investor confidence in Australian films is low. It seeks to revitalise private support and combine with other recently announced taxation measures to restore investor confidence in our Australian industry. I commend the bill to the house.

162,Mr GRIFFIN,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"The Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005 seeks to prevent the unauthorised commercial use of indicia and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games and to provide a secure environment to raise revenue through sponsorship. The bill also includes provisions to prevent ambush marketing. Labor supports this bill and will neither seek to amend or oppose its passage through the House or the other place. With the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games only eight months away, the bill will seek to provide the necessary support in the lead-up, during and in the immediate aftermath of the games, to protect indicia and images associated with the staging of the games. The main provisions of the bill are to provide an authorisation scheme to restrict the use of key words, phrases and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. The term ‘indicia' refers to these phrases and/or words. The bill also provides a range of potential remedies, including injunctions, damages, corrective advertisements and seizure of goods by the Australian Customs Service. The bill also includes a sunset clause so that the bill will cease to have effect from 30 June 2006. This bill is complementary legislation to the Commonwealth Games Arrangements Act 2001, enacted by the Victorian government. The Victorian act only applies in Victoria and gives the power to seize goods to the Victorian police. The bill before the House allows the Australian Customs Service to seize goods and conduct similar functions and services to those it provided during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. This bill will provide protection for a range of indicia and images associated with the games, including the following expressions: Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games; Melbourne 2006 Games; Melbourne Games; M2006; M06; any other combination of the words ‘Commonwealth Games' or ‘Games' and the numbers ‘2006' and ‘18th' in numerical, written and roman numeral form; Queen's Baton Relay; and the words ‘bronze', ‘silver' and ‘gold' when linked with ‘Commonwealth Games' or ‘Commonwealth Games athlete'. Indicia related to the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games in languages other than English will also be protected. Whilst protecting particular words and phrases associated with the games, the bill also provides protection for images that could reasonably, when broadcast or presented, allow a person to think that the company or product is associated with the games. This association could be through oral or visual presentations. The bill, however, does not prevent parties providing informationincluding through reporting by the mediawhere the primary purpose is for criticism or review. This includes the use of criticism or review in newspapers, magazines, broadcasts-both television and radio-and film. The use of indicia and images for this purpose is not deemed to fall within the definition of a use for commercial purposes. The Victorian government are seeking to raise $130 million in sponsorship revenue from the games. This is an important revenue stream available to the Victorian government to assist them in the hosting of the Commonwealth Games in March next year. In return for sponsorship of the games, sponsors will be allowed to use indicia and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games to publicise their support for this sporting event. Under the Victorian act the Melbourne 2006 Corporation has set up an authorisation scheme where approved sponsors will be placed on a register. This register will assist the Australian Customs Service to determine who has the authorisation to use Commonwealth Games indicia and images. It is important to support and protect these revenue streams and in turn protect sponsors from ambush marketing. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of a business with the marketing of an event without paying for marketing rights. This can be through the use of goods that have the indicia and images woven, impressed and affixed on them. In the case of services this would include the use of indicia and images in advertisements or in commercial documentation like catalogues, brochures, business letterheads and invoices. Protecting these indicia and images would also give consumers greater certainty when purchasing officially licensed Melbourne 2006 Games merchandise. This bill gives powers to the Australian Customs Service CEO to seize goods that have been imported into Australia and have not been authorised and which do not appear on the register. These goods will then be in a secure location and the owner of these goods will be notified of the decision by Customs to seize them. The bill also outlines the rights of sponsors to apply for court injunctions from the Federal Court, Federal Magistrates Court or state and territory supreme courts against parties they deem to not have authority to use Melbourne 2006 indicia and images. There are remedies available to these sponsors, including damages and the use of corrective advertisements. At the same time the bill also provides for remedies against groundless threats by authorised users against other parties. Labor support this bill because we know the importance that revenue will play in the successful financial outcomes of the games. We support it so as to protect the legitimate rights of sponsors and their investment in the games. The Victorian government-in particular the Minister for the Commonwealth Games, the Hon. Justin Madden MLC-are undertaking an excellent job in their preparations for the games in March next year. They have undertaken a massive task and I am sure that every member in the House knows that they will deliver an outstanding games that will once again reaffirm Melbourne as the sporting capital of the world. While I am on my feet, and given the reference to not only the games but also the question of the Queen's Baton Relay, it is opportune to discuss some of the points about how that relay is operating and what has been occurring with respect to that. The fact is that once again we have seen evidence in recent days of the Commonwealth government seeking to politicise another event or occasion that is really about everybody in the community, not just politicians. We can recall this occurring in recent times around the issue of flagpoles at schools, where the held government essentially issued edicts that members of the coalition must be present and must take part and officiate at the functions for the presentation and development-the openings-of these flagpoles. That is an example of the government undertaking political activity in respect of national symbols and events. We see that again in what is happening with the Commonwealth Games in relation to the Queen's Baton Relay, which is mentioned very clearly in the bill as being one of the indicia and images that are under protection. In my view, these are attempts by the government to, in their own way, contravene their own bill. In effect, this is a form of unauthorised usage with respect to the Queen's baton relay. I would like to make a few points with respect to that particular issue, which relate to an earlier offence to the relay, dating right back to its commencement and opening ceremony. On 10 June, the Age reported: The February unveiling of the Commonwealth Games baton, and the announcement of its yearlong relay through more than 70 countries had politicians jostling for position like 1500-metre race runners. Pushed to the back of the field was Victorian Premier Steve Bracks, who watched from the sidelines as members of the federal Liberal Government enjoyed the frontrunning in the public spotlight. Finally, his turn came to take centre stage. “Good to see that I got on before the cleaners,” he reportedly muttered as he strode to the microphone at Parliament House in Canberra. It seems the Melbourne Commonwealth Games motto, ‘United by the Moment', is not casting its spell over the state and federal politiviews cians circling the event, like sharks hunting for positive publicity. According to insiders, tensions have been building since the baton launch within the Bracks Labor Government, over the amount of attention flowing to the federal Liberal Government, in particular, Victorian federal ministers Rod Kemp and Peter Costello. If we go to the correspondence that the federal government sent to the state government with respect to this issue, there are a whole range of things that were expected to be allowed to occur for coalition members. I refer to some extracts from a letter quoted in the Herald Sun. The first extract states: The runner who brings the baton to the podium should hand it to the Australian Government representative on the podium ... I am sure that, if I happen to be there, I will not be the Australian government representative and that the good member for Cowan here will not be the Australian government representative. But I am pretty sure that my friend, the member for Dunkley, for the moment anyway, would be the Australian government representative. And let us not forget the honourable parliamentary secretary sitting behind him, who would also be seen as an Australian government representative. The next extract from the Herald Sun is even better: Images of the Prime Minister announcing the international route, and the Treasurer announcing the national route, (must be) incorporated into the four-minute video presentation (shown at local celebrations) I do not think that that video is going to play well out there in punter land. Maybe it is best to only have it at celebrations where the crowd has been organised. Frankly, it is an affront to what these events are supposed to be about. The next extract from the letter states: To ensure the appropriate weight is given to the of the local federal member or senator, it is proposed that he or she ‘co-chair' the (local planning group) … … … The Australian Government does not see a need for State Government representatives to be members of the (local planning groups) for all states and territories, including Victoria. It is good to see that we have a proper understanding of the nature of the role of government with respect to these issues and that, frankly, there is a role for the federal government but not a role for the state government representatives. It says something about the way this government handles issues like this out there in public forums. It shows that the government sees this as an opportunity to promote itself in a partisan fashion in what is supposed to be a bipartisan event. The Canberra Times also said more on this issue. It said: The Federal Government is demanding its backbenchers be given the choice roles at community events during the Commonwealth Games baton relay. Games organisers have been told to ensure Liberal and National MPs have prominent roles at evening celebrations to be held in each community as the relay goes around Australia. State and territory governments are to be cluded form committees planning the local functions but those events must feature a video of Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello. … … … Federal Sports Minister Rod Kemp has written to the Games organisers enclosing a five-page list of the Federal Government's demands. I only went through about five paragraphs of it but there is more. The article continued: He said yesterday the list, obtained by the Canberra Times, was part of discussions about the coordination of the relay. It reads like a log of claims, and I have done a few of them in an earlier life, believe me. The article continued: ‘These discussions with the [Victorian] state government are ongoing,' he said. Justin Madden, the Victorian minister for the games, is concerned that this is politicisation. He is quoted in the article: ‘We are very determined to maximise community participation in the Games,' he said. ‘The Games is not about politics, it's about community. ‘As the baton passes around Australia it is a great chance to recognise community leaders rather than politicians.' The article continued: Mr Costello denied the Federal Government was trying to hijack the relay and pointed out the Federal Government had agreed to the request to pay for it. ‘The Prime Minister's launched it, I've launched it, we keep on launching it on a regular basis'Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are very accommodating to people, but the difficulties of doing any business with the Bracks government is not the purpose of this bill. We are not reliving the Scoresby behaviour and I encourage my colleague, who is no doubt enjoying every moment of it to come vaguely back to ex- the purposes of the bill before the House.",128
163,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,The member for Bruce has indicated that he understands the requirement for him to address his remarks to the matters that are in the bill.,131
164,Mr GRIFFIN,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are quite right. I again go back to the bill to note that one of the things this bill is designed to protect is ‘the Queen's Baton Relay'. This bill is designed to protect this relay. We are seeing attempts by this government to abuse this relay and use it in a manner for which it was never intended. Frankly, there is an argument here that the government could well be prosecuted under their own bill. Mr Billson-Do you mean the Bracks government?",131
165,Mr GRIFFIN,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"No, I mean the federal government. We have launches and videos and you have got to ask yourself: do the Australian people really deserve another video of the Prime Minister? The interesting question from that video will be: will the Prime Minister and the Treasurer be in the same shot? Can they do that these days? Or will it be a situation where they are at separate ends? It might be appropriate in relation to a Commonwealth Games to have an event between the two. You could have a run-off for the prime ministership between the two. It would be a fast walk in the case of the Prime Minister; in terms of the Treasurer I am not quite sure how that would work-we would have to get his mouth shut for a start, otherwise the wind resistance would be too much for him to go very far at all!",131
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,Order! The honourable member will make sure that this discussion on a friendly basis between two representatives from the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne does not continue and that he addresses his remarks through the chair and to the bill.,132
167,Mr GRIFFIN,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"I am very pleased to do that. Of course, as you know, the member for Dunkley has always been a solid supporter of mine over the years. He looks after my parents, who are constituents in his electorate, although I can be confident that they do not vote for him, because they have seen what this government has done on so many issues over the years-and this is just another example. As I said, this bill, which basically is signed to protect the Commonwealth Games baton relay, amongst a range of other symbols, is in fact being abused by the government itself. Some interesting points were made with respect to this issue in a Herald Sun editorial entitled ‘The games pollies play.' It reads: The Howard Government needs to be told that its MPs are not wanted as gladhanding VIPs during the Commonwealth Games baton relay. The 2006 Commonwealth Games are for the people, not the politicians, and Coalition MPs planning to hog the limelight need to take a step back. Even more inappropriate is the proposal for videos featuring Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello to be shown at baton relay ceremonies around the nation. The Federal Government is under the impression that its money is paying for its share of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Wrong. It is taxpayers' money. They will fund the Federal Government contribution of $103 million to the Games and baton relay, and the State Government's $700 million bill to stage the 12-day international event. … … … The arrogant list of demands sent to Victoria was approved by federal Sports Minister Rod Kemp. The Federal Government has already shortchanged the Commonwealth Games by withdrawing $90 million in funding for the redevelopment of the MCG, the main Games venue, over industrial policies. On this issue what we see is another example of the Howard government trying to appropriate national symbols and national events in a partisan manner, when they were designed to be bipartisan in the first place. We have seen them use the excuse of some federal funding to provide themselves with an opportunity to try to use the event as a propaganda exercise. It will be interesting to see whether the Prime Minister and the de- Treasurer will be included in the list of symbols to be protected. Maybe they will be an addition to the act at some stage in the future. One thing is for sure: although we agree and accept and commend the bill to the House and are pleased to support it, we certainly do not commend, support or accept the actions of the government with respect to the way they are handling the Commonwealth Games baton relay.",132
168,Mr BAIRD,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"It is particularly interesting to follow the member for Bruce in this debate on the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005. In his speech we had a combination of two things: one was a vague ramble through the notes provided to him by the minister's office, in which he showed no interest and which he seemed to have no inclination to read-his performance was so poor that he could barely read the words and the other was political point scoring. One of the things that you need to remember is that people have memories. As somebody who was minister for Sydney's Olympic bid, I well remember the requirements that were made by the then Keating government when they provided $5 million for the Sydney bid. They wanted everything. The Prime Minister and his wife had to be there and had to be provided with tickets for all events. They had to be given appropriate recognition at all the Olympic functions. They had to be included on the bid boardeverything. The Keating government gave five million bucks and they wanted the world. They wanted to be on the stage, with clear recognition of the Prime Minister and everybody there-all the ministers had to be up there. You must think that we cannot remember you guys and what you required in return for the extremely modest amount of $5 million. New South Wales had to raise the rest of the bid money, which at that stage was quite substantial-some $25 million. The federal government provided all of $5 million and it wanted the world. In relation to the Queen's Baton Relay, which you have been going on about for some length of time, $15 million is being provided by the federal government. Shouldn't they have some recognition? Mr Edwards-What about the taxpayer? Mr Griffin-What about the taxpayer?",132
169,Mr BAIRD,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"The same would apply in Victoria when you open roads. Of course the funding comes from taxpayers' money, but I would have thought that it is appropriate that representatives of the various governments involved have some recognition in the whole process. Of course, the opposition would not want to have any recognition at all-that is clear! They would want to go absolutely unrecognised and not mentioned! The Keating government wanted to be up front and totally recognised on every occasion. This is an extremely modest request, given the very large amount of money that the federal government is providing. They are providing $100 million in direct financial assistance and a further $170 million through the provision of support services. Total federal government funding is close to $280 million. Isn't it appropriate that some recogthe nition be given to the federal government for their involvement in and promotion of this event? I think it is entirely appropriate. It is a bit of a pity that the member for Bruce did not pay a bit more attention to the bill at hand and consider the implications of it. He did not seem to be worried about that. His speech was just a bit of a point-score, which shows where the opposition are all at. The piece of legislation being brought forward here is quite reasonable. It protects the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. We might remember that no sooner had the logo for the Sydney Games been produced, looking magnificent, than copies started to come in. The legislation was not in place and merchandise came in from Asia in large quantities, so legislation had to be brought in fairly quickly to protect the bid name on a whole range of merchandise: ties, jumpers, logos, brooches, armbands, watches and the whole bit. Of course, as we went into the Olympic Games legislation was enacted which covered the marketing of the games, because protecting these things is important for sponsorship and sponsorship is crucial to games of these kinds. The Sydney Olympic Games was a multibillion-dollar sponsorship event, and that is why it needed to be protected. You spell out what is included; otherwise everyone else will claim credit for promoting your games. Although a whole range of things are included in this bill, the legislation does provide exemptions for information provision, so, in terms of what the federal government is providing through the Queen's Baton Relay, that is entirely in keeping with the legisgames lation. The bill protects sponsorship, licensing revenue, indicia and images, particularly for the 2006 period. Anything related to the 2006 Commonwealth Games-and all the other things which are listed as part of the program-is protected. So sponsorships can be protected and ambush marketing-which is people claiming sponsorship when it does not exist-can be stopped. A similar approach was taken for the 2000 Olympic Games, and the key factor is the restriction of the use of key words, phrases and images for commercial purposes. All the words are set out in the attachment. It contains exemptions for the purpose of providing information for criticism and review by the media as well as factual reporting of what is happening. It enables the Australian Customs Service to apprehend unauthorised goods which would use such terms as ‘Commonwealth Games', ‘Queen's Baton Relay', ‘Friendly Games' or ‘Melbourne 2006 Cultural Program'. It covers that as well. It contains a sunset clause, which means that the legislation will cease to have effect from 1 July 2006. It complements indicia protection provisions in the Victorian Commonwealth Games Act. At the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the New South Wales government did not have any equivalent of the Victorian act-it was simply up to the federal government-but the Victorian police have the ability to apprehend goods. The Victorian act has an authorisation scheme and a register, a purpose test, and it recognises the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and the Commonwealth Games Federation. What we have in this bill is protection for the Commonwealth Games, which is going to be a major event watched by many millions of people around the world. The bill will ensure the financial viability of the by protecting the sponsors, the logos and the words that are associated with the games. I remember that in the Sydney Olympic Games ‘Ollie', ‘Millie' and ‘Syd' were protected, and we will also be able to protect the various similar kinds of words associated with the Melbourne games. This is important for commercial sponsorship reasons. It is also important to ensure that the games can operate without being ambushed by all the bogus marketers who might want to climb on board. The protection this bill provides will ensure that goodwill will be associated with the Melbourne Games. I congratulate the Victorian government on the preparation for these games. I think the games will be a great success and that they will be widely applauded. We certainly hope that, in line with what Juan Antonio Samaranch had to say at the end of the Sydney Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games in Victoria can be declared the best ever Commonwealth Games. We on this side of the chamber are doing our bit to protect the various logos and indicia for the Commonwealth Games, to ensure that we have a successful commercial enterprise that is appropriately protected. We do not want the political stuntsmanship that is going on on the other side of the chamber. Clearly the opposition spokesman had not read his brief. He picked up the brief from the minister's office, but he barely read the words through before he started to get into political punches which were a lot of nonsense. We are providing $260 million for the Commonwealth Games, but the Labor party do not want to see us anywhere. It is a case of ‘just send the money and disappear'. I think the minister had news for them. Yes, it is appropriate that the Victorian government get due recognition, but we would expect some recognition for the very large amount of money provided by this government for the games.",133
170,Ms BURKE,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"I too would like to speak on the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005 before the House today. When I first heard about this bill, I assumed its purpose was to protect the Australian public from video images of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer which will be screened at community evening celebrations in the leadup to the Commonwealth Games. Apparently that is not the case but, nevertheless, Labor will support the bill with vigour. As an Australian-and particularly as a Victorian-I am so proud that my home town will be hosting the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. The 18th Commonwealth Games will bring together 4,500 athletes from 71 nations. Approximately 40,000 international visitors and 50,000 interstate visitors are expected to travel to Victoria for the event, and we are most welcoming of their patronage of our great town. Regional centres will also play a part in the games celebrations, with Ballarat hosting the basketball and Bendigo, Geelong and the Latrobe Valley hosting parts of the games sport programs, in addition to various cultural activities. The economic benefits for Victoria are enormous, and we are set to experience significant employment growth as a result of the event. Based on work force demands for the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games, it is estimated that up to 35,000 jobs are likely to be created in Victoria. Industries expected to benefit include the construction, hospitality and tourism, transport, sport and recreation, and arts and culture sectors. That is why the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005 is so important. The bill is designed to prevent the unauthorised commercial use of certain images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. It will also provide a more secure environment in which the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Corporation can raise revenue through sponsorship and prevent ambush marketing. The Victorian government is seeking to raise $130 million in sponsorship revenue to assist them in hosting the games next year. Approved sponsors will be given the authority to use images associated with the games to publicise their support of the event. Clearly it is vital to protect these revenue streams and, in turn, protect the sponsors from ambush marketing. Labor supports this bill because we believe it is important to do everything in our power to ensure that the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games live up to the expectations of the Australian people and the mad sports nuts in Victoria and also that they provide the world's best to all the international visitors who will be coming to our shores for the games. I know that the people from Chisholm, especially the children, are excited about the opportunity to watch sporting heroes compete, and the chance for them to participate in games festivities themselves will be the experience of a lifetime. My mother still tells me with delight about her joy in going to the Olympic Games in Melbourne in 1956. She still has her original ticket. So it is wonderful that we can again share that delight and that dream with people in Victoria. That is what the Commonwealth Games should be about: inspiring dreams. It is a message to Australian youth that it is possible to achieve your goals. So what a pity it is that the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005 does not protect our games from blatant politicisation. First the Howard government tried to politicise the Australian flag through its school flagpole scheme. Now it is politicising the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Do members of the coalition have no shame? It was revealed this week that the Howard government is planning to use the Commonwealth Games as a propaganda exercise. The Minister for the Arts and Sport has written to Victoria demanding that coalition MPs and senators co-chair local planning groups and that the Australian government is acknowledged for its funding contribution. He has also requested that video images of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are shown at the community evening celebrations. Their images are irrelevant to the games, and it is inappropriate to drag politics into a non-political community celebration. Mr Farmer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask you to bring the member back to the bill before the House. She is waffling off the subject at the moment.",135
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,I thank the parliamentary secretary. The member for Chisholm will return to the subject of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill.,136
172,Ms BURKE,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Yes, and the protection of images of the Queen's Baton Relay that is being ignored in this bill is vital to the Commonwealth Games. The member for Cook, the previous speaker in this debate from the coalition, ventured heavily into this subject matter, and I think if you are going demonstrate political bias from the chair you should perhaps think more clearly about it, because I do take affront",136
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Order! The chair does not take kindly to suggestions of political bias from the chair. I was not here for the speech of the previous speaker. I was required to respond to the parliamentary secretary when he rose on a point of order. I responded. The way to conduct your debate is to link whatever your comments are to the substance of the bill, and I will listen to your comments.",136
174,Ms BURKE,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not mean to reflect badly on the chair. I was going to say that you were not here at that time and therefore could not have known. My next comment was going to be that you could possibly not have known what was allowed by the previous two chairs in respect of this matter. I certainly would not in any way reflect upon your occupancy of the chair-or upon anybody in the chair, for that matter.",136
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,I accept the member for Chisholm's explanation. Thank you.,136
176,Ms BURKE,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"I do believe that this piece of legislation is quite clearly related to my point, because great political bias has entered into this. I do not dispute that the Commonwealth should be given recognition for its sponsorship of the baton relay, but to take it over from the local community groups, to take it away from the people who are going to be nominated in their local area, is a disgrace. To overshadow it with any politician, be it someone from the government or from the opposition, takes away from the spirit of these games. This bill is here to protect the image of those games. All I am asking is that the Commonwealth and everyone else also protect the image of the great games before to us. Certainly the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is here today, knows about representing his country in sporting endeavours. He would not want someone to take away from his achievements in those areasto politicise this event. So I think that we need to call upon the government to take back their suggestions and to include everybody, regardless of their political persuasions, in this endeavour. In addition, the Commonwealth has asked that runners bringing the baton to the stage at community evening celebrations will have to hand the Commonwealth Games baton to a coalition member or senator. I think that is inappropriate. It should be handed to whoever is the most illustrious person from that area, or it should just be placed up on the stand. I do not think we need to make this a political event. It should be a community event. That is why these games are so great. So it is a disgrace. Rather than having a member of the community-possibly an aspiring young athlete or a hard working volunteer, someone who would love the privilege of being part of the relay-place the baton, the Howard government is wheeling out members and senators, turning it into a cheesy photo opportunity. So, for the next three years until the federal election, we will be seeing photos of gladhanding politicians waving the baton in Liberal Party campaign brochures across the country. I would prefer to see the photos of fine Australian citizens waving the baton proudly hung up in homes across the country. The Australian public is incensed at this, but not our blue-collared Treasurer, who is so in touch with the people of this country. He does not have a problem with hijacking the Commonwealth Games, according to a doorstop interview he held this week, because he thinks that if the Howard government paid for the baton relay it can do whatever it likes. I think the Treasurer has been in his post for too long. He has forgotten that it is not his money that is paying for this baton relay; the Australian taxpayers' money. It should be they who are participating in this event. It is they who should be highlighted through this process. I do want to thank the government for their sponsorship of this event and their support of the games. Up until now, this has been a fine, bipartisan event through the Labor government in Victoria and through the coalition federal government. So it is a pity that it has come to this. I certainly want to place on record my congratulations to the Premier, Steve Bracks, for the fine effort that he has made in this, and also to the Minister for Sport and Recreation, Justin Madden, who has worked very hard to ensure that next year we have a fantastic games. My message from this debate tonight to the Prime Minister is that when it comes to sport-unlike politics-it is not about winning or losing; it is about how you play the game. And playing politics with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games is shameful. We should be seeing more things which the Commonwealth has done to protect the games, like this bill tonight, and not more political bias.",136
177,Mr FARMER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"MacarthurParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training) (5.43 pm)-In the wrap-up of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2005 debate, I would like to thank the members for Chisholm, Cook and Bruce for their support for this bill. This is a very important bill. It recognises that the lessons of life are actually lessons of sport, and that the lessons we learn in sport here in this country are lessons that we can take with us through our business lives, through our political lives and through every aspect of our lives. That is one of the things that makes this country the great country that it is: our it is love and our passion for sport. The purpose of this bill is to protect the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games sponsorship and licensing revenue from being undermined by unauthorised use of the games indicia and images by competitors of the official games sponsors. The Australian government enacted similar legislation for the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games. While Victorian legislation has been in place since 2001 to protect games related words, phrases and images in the state of Victoria, there is a need for complementary Commonwealth legislation to ensure that the government can enforce this in the Commonwealth's jurisdiction-for example, so that Customs can seize offending goods at the border in the case of any goods being brought into this country that have been duplicated without authorisation. The key principle of this bill is to prevent the unauthorised use of games related words, phrases and images for profit, by restricting their use. However, third parties such as the media can use games related words, phrases and images, provided it is for the provision of information or for the purpose of criticism and review. There are no financial implications for the Australian government. The bill has a sunset clause and will cease to have effect from 1 July 2006. In summary, this bill works with the Victorian legislation to help ensure that the exclusive rights being paid for by the games sponsors are protected. This is a sensible bill that protects the business sport through the Commonwealth Games 2006. I commend it to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",137
178,Mr FARMER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"MacarthurParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training) (5.47 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (2005 BUDGET MEASURE) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 June, on motion by Mrs De-Anne Kelly: That the bill be now read a second time.",138
179,Mr EDWARDS,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Cowan) (5.47 pm)Although the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005 affects some 44,000 veterans and war widows, one would normally have described it as non-controversial. But in fact, as I will point out, this bill corrects a dirty deed of the Howard government. In essence, it gives to self-funded retiree veterans what all other self-funded retirees received last yearnamely a $200-a-year allowance. This is entitled the ‘seniors concession allowance' and is similar to the utilities allowance paid to those in receipt of a pension. These were election promises made by the Prime Minister as he sprayed billions of dollars around like confetti in his bid to win the last election. Basically, the seniors allowance is a non means tested giveaway to assist self-funded retirees to pay their power and gas bills, their car registration and their water bills, as a of trade-off for the utilities allowance given to pensioners. This allowance, which was first introduced in December 2004, is paid in two instalments each year, in June and December. The utilities allowance paid to pensioners is also paid in two instalments-in March and September. For veterans with the gold card who are already in receipt of the service pension or the income support supplement, the utilities allowance was paid along with that of the rest of the pensioner population. To be eligible for the seniors concession allowance, a person must hold a Commonwealth seniors health card. Consistent with other veteran entitlements, it is available at age 60, compared with the age limit of 65 for other retirnothing ees. But of course, as we know, gold card holders have no need of the Commonwealth seniors health card because all of their health care needs are taken care of. As a result, those veterans and war widows who are classed as self-funded retirees-that is, not receiving payment of the service pension or the income support supplement-missed out. This, it must be said, was either a negligent oversight or a deliberate ploy to save money. Either way, self-funded retiree veterans were denied, without any reason or explanation, what normal self-funded retirees were given. If it was a negligent oversight then the government should be condemned for its carelessness in ignoring 44,000 people, who were effectively discriminated against. If it was deliberate, the same applies. Perhaps some explanation and apology should be given. The silliness of this situation has been demonstrated by the fact that those veterans and widows eligible in their own right for a CSHC could apply for a CSHC and so become eligible. As I understand it, some in fact have done so. In that way the oversight or omission was circumvented, hence the silliness of this whole issue. The matter does not end there, though. One would have thought that with an error of this kind, where a sizeable portion of the population has been effectively cheated, payments ought to be made in arrears. Not so in this case; in fact, it is worse. The first payment to self-funded veteran retirees will not be made until December this year. That means a loss of two payments of $100 at least. Of course the gloss put on this is, as usual, one of extreme generosity and kindness. In fact the minister's deceptive spin in her budget press release did just that it made this measure the centrepiece. Veterans and war widows need to know that this is of the kind. They have in fact been short-changed. This is a benefit that was provided to everyone else late last year. This is typical of the duplicity and fudging of which this minister is a specialist. Indeed, when we look at the entire veterans budget this year, we see that it is a nonevent. If this bill constitutes the centrepiece and it is effectively a fraud, then the whole budget package is a fraud too. Let's look at the detail. Putting aside all the spin and rhetoric, the House will notice in the budget papers that there is only $10 million for new budget measures in 2005-06. Against this there are savings of $52 million, which flow on from the health portfolio. Apart from the long overdue increase in dental limits, there is no change in entitlements. As for the $411 million increase in the Department of Veterans' Affairs total budget, most of that is due to normal cost increases-$393 million, in fact. In the budget papers these are described as ‘parameter adjustments', ‘variation in rates and fees', ‘growth in numbers and/or usage rates' or ‘movements between low-cost and high-cost services'. The so-called initiatives for anaesthetists and allied health providers are part of those normal increases. To this $393 million you need to add $60 million, which was carried over from the budgets of previous years. So, in these government policy initiatives for veterans, the government has taken the veteran community backwards. The savings exceed new spending-it is as simple as that. So that is all there is to this paltry measure. Veterans have been conned again, and many feel cheated. I challenge the minister to show good faith to the veteran community by making this bill retrospective to December 2004. Only in that way can the honourable thing be done. However, having said that, I also say that of course the opposition supports the bill. I want to touch on an issue which has become much more prevalent in recent years and to which much more attention has been given within the veteran community and the broader community-that is, the issue of what is loosely termed ‘wannabes'. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, that you have spoken in this place on this issue. The Australasian military imposters web site contains this definition: Often called by the derogatory term “wannabe” these are men and women who may or may not have served in the armed forces, but who fraudulently misrepresent themselves as having served; often in a theatre of war by their words and actions, and by wearing of medals and other accoutrements to military service to which they have no entitlement. Bearing that in mind, I want to refer to 2003, when some legislation was introduced into this House to deal with that exact matter. The minister at the time put out a press release on 26 March 2003 headed ‘Increased penalties for defence medals fraud', which stated: Penalties for fraudulently claiming Defence service will increase 15-fold under legislation duced into Parliament today by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Danna Vale. “Our community holds veterans and serving personnel in the highest regard,” Mrs Vale said. “Their service and sacrifice in Defence of our nation deserves protection from those who wrongly seek to claim the same honour and respect.” Under the Federal Government's proposals, the penalty for wrongly claiming to be returned soldier, sailor or airman, or wearing medals to which an individual is not entitled, will increase $200 fine, to a maximum penalty of $3,300 and up to six months imprisonment. … … … Mrs Vale said the changes were a result of concerns of the Government and the wider community regarding practices that were unlawful, deceitful and disrespectful to veterans and service personnel. “The increase in these penalties will enable the Government to better protect the honour of Defence veterans and service personnel,” Mrs Vale said. “I call on the Opposition parties to support this legislation as soon as possible so that we can provide the increased protection.” I will come back to that last sentence shortly. Later in 2003-I do not have the exact date-the then minister responsible for medals put out a press release headed ‘Fake veterans to face imprisonment', which read: People fraudulently claiming to be returned soldier, sailor or airman could face six months imprisonment under proposed laws passed through the House of Representatives today. Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence Mal Brough said anyone falsely claiming to be a returned service man or woman should face the force of the law. “It's a disgraceful act that warrants a strong penalty,” Mr Brough said. “Many Australians have served our country proudly and wrongly claiming to be a veteran is an insult to those men and women.” introAlong with a maximum prison term of six months, the fine will increase from $200 to a maximum of $3,300. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill also increases the penalty for the wearing of medals to which an individual is not entitled. Both those press releases are fairly strongly worded and both address an issue which the veteran community is very concerned about. The unfortunate thing is that action is not meeting the rhetoric of those press releases. I from a will give you just one example. I recently received some correspondence from the bloke who is the webmaster for the Australian Special Air Services Association. He said: Graham, Below is a copy of an e-mail I sent to the AFP in Perth, regarding one of the many impostors. This chap has claimed to be one of the most respected Sgts in the SAS during Vietnam, and I guess the rest of his lies are in the e-mail below. The text of the reply from the AFP is at the foot of this page. From the response to my email, I can only assume that it is a budgetary consideration that prevents an investigation taking place. I do appreciate that prioritisation must occur. I also feel that resources must be made available for enforcement of ALL laws, not just those that get the most attention. I ask that you question the minister to consider providing the necessary resources to address this most frustrating situation that the Veterans community is facing. Regardsand it is not important to know his name. He also sent me part of a letter which he wrote to the AFP in Perth. It said: The veterans community is frustrated with the perceived lack of diligence being applied to such cases, which allows these people to continue living a lie. I also understand that this man ... fact be a Veteran, but there is certainly no record of any such person having served in the Australian Special Air Service Regiment. I would appreciate your consideration of this situation, and I am available to travel to Perth if so needed. Sincerely Webmaster Australian SAS Association I want to read to the House the response that this gentleman from the SAS Association received. A letter dated March this year headed ‘Re: Wearing of SAS Honours/Awards Whilst Not Entitled' said: Thank you for your correspondence concerning the above mentioned matter forwarded to our office on 7 March 2005. This matter was presented to the Perth Operations Committee on Monday, 21 March 2005. The AFP has primary law enforcement responsibility for investigating criminal offences against the Commonwealth. Operational activities and the needs of clients are assessed from a variety of perspectives to ensure that resources are directed towards highest priority activities. The AFP must therefore ensure that its limited resources are directed to the matters of highest priority and the decision to accept or reject matters for investigation is guided by this principle. Following the assessment of the information provided, it is with regret that the AFP is not able to accept the referral. They then invite the complainant to discuss the matter by further contacting them. When people choose to impersonate a veteran, in so many circumstances they will choose to impersonate a member of the Special Air Services. They will claim that there is greater secrecy; that they cannot talk about where they served, what they did or when they served. It appears that it is easier to get away with impersonating a member of the SAS than perhaps impersonating someone in may in other areas of service where records can be more easily kept. This is something that members of the SAS and members of the veterans' community, regardless of who it is that is being impersonated, are becoming increasingly agitated and concerned about. When you understand the rhetoric of the press releases to which I referred earlier, you can understand that many in the veterans' community feel that they have had their expectations raised by rhetoric in press releases but that there is no practical or real enforcement. In the final sentence of her press release at the time, the then Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence said: I call on the Opposition parties to support this legislation as soon as possible so that we can provide that increased protection. I call on the government to honour its own words and now, having put this legislation through with the support of the opposition, to provide the sort of protection that that legislation was supposedly going to provide. I know that the member for Hughes, the former minister, will be the next speaker from the government side. I invite the member for Hughes to explain to the House and to the veterans' community the rhetoric of her press release and why she and subsequent ministers with responsibility for this area have not met their needs. I call on her to explain why it is that, on the one hand, government ministers can raise the expectations of the veterans community but, on the other hand, do nothing to meet those expectations. It is a hoax. I hope that the government-and, in particular, those people who are responsible for this legislation-will do something now to defend the government's inaction. In closing, I want to also call on the ter to rethink a particular piece of policy which I understand she has signed off on. It relates to the access that children of veterans have to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. This is an access which is greatly valued by the children of veterans. I understand, however, that the minister has agreed to a proposal to cut off that access at the age of 36. I call on the minister to reconsider that piece of policy if that is indeed the case. I would think that the amount of money involved would be minimal, yet the assistance and help, encouragement and support that these kids of veterans have received through the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service more than warrant their continued access. It should not be a matter of dollars and cents because, as I have said, I think the amount involved would be minimal-indeed, negligible-so why is it that the minister has agreed to this cut-off age? I know this is something that the Vietnam Veterans Association in Western Australia is going to take up with the broader veteran community, and I would encourage them to do so. Last week in Perth, I addressed a meeting of Kids of Veterans at Hollywood hospital. It was very well attended. There were about 50 people there. I want to compliment them on the wonderful job that they are doing; I want to compliment the Vietnam Veterans Association in Perth particularly for the wonderful support that they are giving to these kids; and I want to say to Peter Ramsey, the President of the Vietnam Veterans Association, that he and his association should be very proud of the work that they have done in support of these kids over a period of a couple of years. I want to encourage him to keep up that work and that support. I also briefly want to acknowledge the wonderful work done by some of these Kids of Veterans members. Andrea Willsher, Danielle Garland, Tracey Negus, Angela Blaszminiskow, Rachel Healy, Meredith Haywood and Natassja Hannay should all be very proud of the leadership that they have shown and the work that they have done in setting up and supporting this Kids of Veterans organisation. They have been a wonderful encouragement to veterans; they have set a great example. These young people, some of whom have done it a bit hard, should be very pleased with all that they have achieved. In conclusion, I again call on the minister to recognise this group of Kids of Veterans and ask her not to adopt the cut-off of 36 years of age. There are some kids out thereI do not think a lot of them-who will benefit greatly from access to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, a counselling service which has done a great deal over a long period. I would hate to see that access shut off simply because someone has reached a certain age. I ask the minister to consider the arguments I have put tonight and to consider the views of the broader veteran community, who I know will support continued access to Kids of Veterans regardless of age. The opposition supports the legislation.",138
180,Mrs VALE,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"I welcome the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005. I note the comments of the member for Cowan and I take the time to point out that he well knows that the 2003 legislation is no hoax. It is sound legislation. If the member for Cowan has a problem with its enforcement, he should address that to the appropriate minister. Mr Edwards-You're the one who made the commitments in the House.",142
181,Mrs VALE,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"The commitments were sound. As the member for Cowan is well aware, that legislation is sound legislation, and it stands. The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005 is welcome legislation for our veterans and war widows. I appreciate having the opportunity to speak on the bill, which further strengthens this government's 2004 election commitment to recognise senior Australians, their needs and their carers. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to give effect to the 2005 budget measure to extend eligibility for the seniors concession allowance to persons who are gold card holders over veteran pension age and who are not otherwise eligible for the seniors concession allowance or the utilities allowance. The seniors concession allowance is an ongoing payment of $200 a year paid in two instalments, in June and December, that is indexed twice yearly. This payment is being made because state and territory governments have refused to accept this government's offer to extend important concessions to those Australians we call self-funded retirees. The seniors concession allowance was introduced for Commonwealth seniors health card holders in December 2004, in line with our government's election commitment to help self-funded retirees maintain the lifestyle for which they have worked all their lives. More than 44,000 veterans and war widows will benefit from the provisions in the 2005-06 federal budget, with this government's welcome initiative to extend the Australian government's seniors concession allowance to older veterans who hold a gold card. This government has committed $27.7 million to this initiative over four years to assist our gold card holders. This is on top of an estimated $282.6 million originally committed for the seniors concession allowance. More than 290,000 Commonwealth senior health card holders have already benefited from this allowance. The new initiative will ensure that an additional 44,000 gold card holders over veteran pension age who do not already receive the seniors concession allowance or the twice-yearly pensioners utility allowance will now get this extra support. The Howard government has already delivered on a 2001 election promise and has extended the gold card to all veterans over the age of 70 with qualifying service from any conflict, in recognition of their special and unique needs that increase as they grow older. This commitment by our government further recognises the special needs of gold card holders by way of extending the eligibility of those who have already served our nation to the seniors concession allowance. It ensures that all gold card holders over veteran pension age are able to receive some form of payment and/or concession through either the seniors concession allowance or the utilities allowance to assist in meeting their energy, rates and water bills. The seniors concession allowance is paid at a higher rate than the utilities allowance in recognition that those eligible for utilities allowances also hold a pension concession card and receive concessions from various state, territory and local governments that are not generally available to Commonwealth senior health card holders. This government considers that the hard working self-funded retirees should not miss out. This budget measure complements a range of other measures in this year's budget for veterans, especially in the health care area. The 200506 budget increased further funding for the care of veteran and Defence Force communities to more than $10.8 billion, a rise of $278 million on the previous year. I seek leave to continue my remarks on this bill at a later time. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

182,Mr COSTELLO,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"I move: That the amendments be disagreed to. I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005, and I will take the opportunity to explain, as I have already, why the House should not accept these amendments. These amendments were put to the House of Representatives and have already been defeated. These amendments would significantly change the legislation which the government announced in the budget and which has been passed by this House. Of course we know that this legislation will be passed by the new Senate when it comes into effect on 1 July and that the amendments that have been moved both in this House and in the Senate have been moved particularly as a covering exercise for the Leader of the Opposition, who on budget night said that he was opposed to the government's income tax cuts. He and his shadow Treasurer took every opportunity to say that they would be taxpayer's inflationary and lead to interest rate increases. Two days later, of course, he decided does not exceed that he could actually support income tax $27,475; and cuts of this dimension or greater dimension-he apparently had changed his view in does not exceed those two days. $30,000 We know of course why he changed his view in those two days. The reception that he got from announcing that he would oppose these income tax cuts-as reflected in public opinion, informed opinion and the opinion of his own backbench-was a very tepid reaction indeed. Of course it should have been, because these income tax cuts will do a lot to improve the structure of the Australian taxation system. The first thing that they will do is cut the bottom marginal rate from 17c to 15c. That is another reason why we should reject these amendments. If these amendments pass, the bottom marginal rate will not be 15c; it will be 17c. So people on those lower incomes will actually be facing a higher marginal tax rate. The second reason why the House ought to reject these amendments is that if these amendments pass there will be no tax cuts on 1 July. Carefully hidden in everything that the opposition have so far put is that their policy in fact is for no tax cut on 1 July. These amendments in fact take away the tax cuts which are due on 1 July. We have said in this House repeatedly, ‘Let Australians have a tax cut on 1 July.' Why are the Labor Party against it? Third, the amendments would not allow the increase in the threshold for those top marginal rates to take effect from 1 July 2005 and 1 July 2006. The amendments which the government has put in place will ensure that 80 per cent of Australians have a marginal tax rate of 30c or less. That means no bracket creep for 80 per cent of Australians within that wide band. The Australian Labor Party amendments would not allow that. In addition to that, the tax schedule the government has put forward means that only three per cent of Australians would be on the top marginal tax rate. In other words, 97 per cent of Australians would not be affected by it. This will make our tax system much more competitive. It will mean that our top threshold will be about the 16th lowest in the OECD, which puts us right back in accordance with international practice. The tax plan which the government has laid down has been passed by this House. It will be passed by the new Senate. The Labor Party has made itself irrelevant to this debate. It cannot tell you today where it stands on the schedules which will implement these tax cuts on 1 July. Its amendments were cobbled together. They make no sense. They do nothing for the tax system. They are a backcovering exercise for a Leader of the Opposition who misjudged budget night and has done nothing to get himself back into this debate. This House must reject these amendments so that all Australians can have a tax cut on 1 July and we can have incentive in our tax system. (Time expired)",146
183,Mr BEAZLEY,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"We of course support the Senate amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005, and we are very proud of the fact that every political party bar One Nation stood alongside the Labor Party in the Senate. We got the usual smirking, sneering speech from the Treasurer dealing with this today. It was a smirking, sneering address at the Senate. We are so irrelevant that we are all here talking about this! How completely irrelevant we must be that you are all here and we are all here talking about this! What you have done, Mr Treasurer, today is block a decent tax cut for the vast bulk of the Australian people. The reason you rant, the reason you sneer, the reason you catcall and the reason you mock is that you know in your that guilty consciences that as you pocket $65 you spit in the face of the seven million Australians who get $6 a week each from this. You know that your sneering, smirking abuse of those seven million Australians is being tumbled by more and more of them the longer that this debate goes on. It is as simple as that. The longer this debate goes on, the more and more they tumble to the fact that you have dudded them. You see, what you have done",147

186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,The Leader of the Opposition had his finger pointing at a particular person.,147
187,Mr BEAZLEY,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"The simple fact of the matter is this: this package was passed in the Senate with all the Democrats agreeing, all the Independents agreeing bar one-that being the One Nation senator-and the Greens agreeing with us that this, which the government is rejecting, represents a package which does two things. Firstly, it ensures a fair tax cut for the vast bulk of the Australian people and, secondly, it ensures serious tax reform. But what it actually does is encourage participation in the work force by precisely those groups that the Reserve Bank and others identify as needing to participate in it if we are going to start to deal with some of the blockages to growth that are in our economy at the moment. The Labor Party's package enhances participation because it starts to deal with the questions that arise from the very heavy effective marginal tax rates on those who are currently out of the work force and wish to enter it but who get massively penalised to the tune of something like 104 per cent. It is something like cent in the case of the quite substantial number of people who have received that $17 payment rise from the Industrial Relations Commission. It is very interesting that today the Melbourne Institute has come out with an analysis of these two propositions: the government's and ours. The institute itself has come to the conclusion that the Labor Party's package is fairer. It has come to the conclusion too that the Labor Party's package would generate more jobs. It has come to the conclusion as well that the Labor Party's package reflects genuine tax reform. The point is that we are about serious tax reform and a reasonable tax cut for most Australians; you are about greed and your leadership opportunity. So here is your chance, members of the government. Make a stand now for your ordinary electors. Make a stand for the people who elected you to come here. Make a stand for them and not for yourselves. Step out of the frame and allow your constituents through. Do the decent thing by them for once in your lives. Do what is right for ordinary Australians. Accept the amendments that we have moved and which are accepted by all other political forces in the Senate, bar One Nation-and you can keep them.",147
188,Mr BROUGH,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (6.25 pm)-On behalf of the working men and women of Australia, we will do the right thing: we will deliver a tax cut on 1 July. We will not say to them, ‘You will get zero dollars.' We will say to the Australian people, ‘From 1 July you will have lower effective marginal tax rates.' We are not taking the Labor way. Every person who sits here on this side can sense the relief of the Leader of the Opposition as today he has to get up for the very last time to try and explain to the Australian people the impossible: ‘I don't 104 per want you to have a tax cut.' Look at those opposite. They have been dragged in here. The whip has been up there, on the phone-‘Get them down here. I'll get their unions on to them. I'll make sure they're down here.' They have been dragged down here because they have to show support for the whale that is whumping here on the bench, a beached whale, who is in his death throes in a tax debate in this country that has been made absolutely irrelevant. And who has he been made irrelevant by? He has been made irrelevant by the Greens, the Democrats, One Nation and the Independents. The Leader of the Opposition cannot prevent Australians from getting the tax cuts that they deserve. All members of the House would be delighted to learn that not only is the Labor Party willing to ensure that Australians do not get tax cuts but also today, in the other place, its members stood up there yet again and denied Australians $2.4 billion worth of relief of tax in the form of the superannuation surcharge; they knocked it on the head again. We have had uncertainty for the business community since budget night",148

190,Mr BROUGH,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition interjects, ‘Who introduced it?' I will remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition opposed the introduction, opposed the reduction and opposed the removal. What a man of consistency. The only time he can make a decision is when it is to oppose something. But can he actually make a decision to do something for Australians? Absolutely not. Tonight the Leader of the Opposition got up here and, because he had nothing constructive to say and was looking for a way out and was so grateful that his five minutes were expiring, spent three minutes of that time with personal attacks on the Treasurer, the man who has delivered these tax cuts. This is a man with broad shoulders. This is a man who can stand up for Australian workers. This is a man who has said that Australians deserve tax cuts and he will do whatever it takes to ensure that they get them on 1 July. He stood up to the roosters. For the first time in the last nine years we did not get an MPI the day after the budget from the shadow Treasurer and for the first time we did not get a question to the Treasurer from the shadow Treasurer. Why? Because the Leader of the Opposition is on his own. He is out there wallowing away, trying to find some way to get out of the mire.",148
191,Unknown,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,Opposition members interjecting,149
192,Mr BROUGH,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Listen to the cacophony of noise and indignation. What they are trying to hide, no matter how many words they use, is that they want to do one fundamental thing: they want to deny every single taxpaying Australian a tax cut from 1 July. Every single person on this side understands that. Every single member of this parliament understands that and quite clearly many of those in the opposition do too, given their comments in the papers of late. In fact, not only those who sit on this side but many on the other side acknowledge that Australians deserve these tax cuts. They acknowledge that the Labor Party has made a futile attempt to prevent them being received and they say it is going to be damn good when people do receive them. Once and for all, the member for Brand can be put out of his misery and will not have to stand up to defend the indefensible.

197,Mr SWAN,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"This side of the House stands for fairness in the tax system. It stands for incentive in the tax system. It stands for rewarding effort in the tax system. It stands for giving all those workers in this community who have worked hard to make our economy strong a fair go-not something they will ever get from the Liberal Party. Today we have an analysis from the Melbourne Institute of the two packages, and guess who they think has developed the fairest package? The fairest package has come from the Labor Party. But the Treasurer had the hide to talk about his package being a reform package. There is no reform in his package at all; there is absolutely no reform in his package. This is what the Melbourne Institute had to say today: something like 78,000 people in total would move into the work force under the Labor package. That is a much more significant participation rate than anything the government package will produce. Let us have a look at the Melbourne Institute analysis: 78,609 individuals will be encouraged to enter the labour market under the Labor proposal, 75 per cent more than under the government proposal. And who are they? There are 121 per cent more single males, 81 per cent more sole parents, 76 per cent more females in couple families, 68 per cent more single females and 46 per cent more males in couple families. In the Labor package there is some genuine reform-the sort of reform that the Reserve Bank has been calling for, the sort of reform that the OECD has been calling for, the sort of reform that can make our economy strong and the sort of reform that can put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is because we have produced a tax reform proposal. What the government produced was a Sheriff of Nottingham proposal that would take tax relief from the great bulk of the lowand middle-income earners in this community and give it to a few at the top. Let us see just how obscene this government's package is. The government thinks it is fair to give 45 per cent of the value tax cuts to the top 10 per cent of workers, while 90 per cent of workers share the rest. Shame on the Liberal Party! This package is a slap in the face for those seven million workers who have been left out. It is a skewing of the tax system in a completely disproportionate way. And guess what? It is completely out of whack with traditional Australian notions of a fair go. What all Australians can see tonight and what they could see in the Senate this morning is what the Liberal Party stands for: advantage for the few to the detriment of the many. And that is what we are seeing with its industrial relations package as well. What the Treasurer, Peter Costello-the Sheriff of Nottingham-has done is serve a three-course meal to those at the top. They have been given generous tax cuts, generous superannuation and the promise of more to come. What have Labor done? We have stood up and fought for seven million Australians, to double their tax cut from $6 to $12, to give a fair go to all those people who are trying to move from welfare to work and to give them some real incentive. The government does not reward aspiration. The only people the government thinks have aspirations are those on six-figure salaries. That is why those opposite have gorged themselves on the government's $65 tax cut and that is why the government has left seven million workers behind, receiving only $6. We are going to continue to fight for Australian workers. We are going to continue to fight for the aspirations of lowand middleincome earners, to ensure that over the next three years the government does not use its complete power to rip money away from them without giving them some reward and incentive in the tax system. We are going to ensure that when the next election comes there will be a very clear choice. There will be a clear choice between the Beazley Labor of the way-the way to a fair go-and the unfair world of Peter Costello and John Howard.

We will not support these amendments because they significantly change the legislation that this government has introduced. We will not support them because they deny Australians tax cuts on 1 July. The question is: why does Labor not want Australians to have a tax cut on 1 July? We will not support these amendments, because they leave the bottom marginal tax rate at 17 per cent, when we want to reduce it to 15 per cent. We will not support these amendments, because older Australians will be denied what they deserve.",151

200,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Order! Someone will go for a walk in a minute.  tralian Labor Party has rendered itself completely and utterly irrelevant in this debate. They have done that because of their inexcusable and consistent vacillation on this issue. At the end of the day the best the Australian Labor Party could do following the federal budget was to determine not to determine a position. That was the Labor Party's income tax policy. The Labor Party can continually try to mislead the Australian people about these tax cuts, but the fact of the matter is that this government will have I will these tax cuts passed by the Senate. What is interesting is this continual argument that the Australian Labor Party puts forward that low-income tax earners are disadvantaged by this government's policies. The fact of the matter is that low-income earners get a greater result-a bigger percentage-from our tax policy. People who are earning $25,000 will receive a reduction of 28 per cent in tax.

What that analysis reveals is Labor's deceitful campaign to try to mislead the Australian people. Their constant whinging and whining is a deliberate attempt to mislead people.

208,Mr FITZGIBBON,FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT,"Hunter) (6.41 pm)It is an old ploy: when you have no substance to back your case you resort to personal abuse. That is all we got from the three stooges tonight: no substance but plenty of personal abuse. The Treasurer, now almost 10 years into the job, had one basic responsibility tonight: to argue the respective merits of the government's tax cut package, compared with the package that has been delivered back to this place by the Australian Senate. That is why we are having this debate tonight: to determine for the Australian people which is the fairer tax package. But, of course, we got none of that from the Treasurer. We got from him exactly what we got last time this bill was in this place: plenty of personal abuse but no substance whatsoever. Forget about the elites in this place. Forget about the elites that sit up just above us. It is well known in the Australian community that the Labor Party believes in a tax cut. The Labor Party believes that a government embarrassingly awash with money, having been formally recorded as the highest taxing government in Australian history, should be returning a dividend to the Australian community and to hard working Australian families. So we set about proving this tax cut could be fairer. We set about doing that by constructing and developing an alternative tax package-a tax package which this afternoon has been embraced by the Australian Senate. The reason the Treasurer came in here a couple of weeks ago and did not attempt to argue the merits of those respective tax cuts is that he has no argument. What he did was look for a distraction and a diversion. That distraction and diversion came in the form of his tax schedule stunt. Guess what? The stunt will not work. He did not mind dragging the tax commissioner through the mud along the way. The bad news for the Treasurer tonight is that that tax schedule disallowance debate is now behind us. That is now behind us, Treasurer. You have made that point yourself. Given that it is behind us, it is now up to you to argue the relative merits of these packages. Of course, you have arrogantly tonight avoided any attempt to do so whatsoever.",152

211,Mr HOWARD,MR DOUGLAS WOOD,"by leave-I am delighted to inform the House that the Australian hostage in Iraq, Mr Douglas Wood, is safe from his captors. Mr Wood was recovered a short while ago in Baghdad in a military operation that I am told was conducted by Iraqi forces in cooperation in a general way with force elements of the United States. He is now under the protection of the Australian emergency response team in Baghdad. I understand that he is well and is undergoing medical checks at the present time. I know that all Australians will be jubilant at this news. This man has suffered immensely and I want on behalf of all of the parliament to pay tribute to the dignity and strength of his family. He comes from a deeply impressive family. The strength, resolve and courage that his brothers and other members of his family have displayed and their understanding of the difficulty of this whole incident for all involved have been, I can only say, very deeply impressive. I want to record that I appreciate very much the cooperation between the government and the members of his family. We have of course focused very much on his well-being in returning him to his family. I do not, at this stage, for operational reasons want to comment further on the circumstances of his recovery. I want to place on record the government's great appreciation to the officers of the government who have done such wonderful work. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has displayed superb professionalism throughout this whole incident. The work of Mr Nick Warner, who has been the head of the emergency response team, has been quite exemplary. I want to pay a special tribute to Nick. He is an officer who is known to many of us and he has done great things for Australia, not only in Iraq also in the Solomon Islands. I want of course to thank the special forces, the other members of the emergency response team that went to Iraq, Brigadier MCCabe and all of the units in Iraq that have been associated with this. Can I also pay special tribute to the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has had the day-today carriage of this on behalf of the government. May I also thank the opposition, the Leader of the Opposition, and the member for Griffith, for their understanding at every stage of the difficulties involved and the need for us to unite to save an Australian. This has brought out some of the best things in our people. I also place on record my appreciation for the efforts of the Australian Islamic community and Sheik Taj al-Hilaly. Many people have tried. We are overwhelmed with reliefnothing compared, of course, with the relief that his family must now feel. Can I also say that at no stage has a ransom been paid. At no stage has the government compromised its position in relation to our commitment to Iraq, the level of our force commitment. I want to reiterate our commitment to the stability and reconstruction of Iraq and to the Iraqi people who are daily the victims of terrorism and crime. I did endeavour, before making this statement, to contact the Iraqi Prime Minister. I hope I will do so very shortly to express my thanks for the efforts of his forces. May I record again our thanks to our American friends for their constant support, availability and cooperation. It is a wonderful outcome for this man who has suffered so much. It is a tribute to the work of our Iraqi and American friends that this has come about.",153
212,Mr BEAZLEY,MR DOUGLAS WOOD,"by leave-This is a joyful moment for all members of the House. I suspect that in our heart of hearts so many but of us felt that this was not a moment we might enjoy and celebrate. I think many of us thought that when this terrible saga began it would not end as it has ended, with the rescue of the Australian hostage. I am of course not across all the detail of the organisation that went into this or how this rescue was effected. The Prime Minister briefed me very briefly before he came to the House. I suspect the Prime Minister has only just found out about it himself and is probably not across absolutely every aspect of the detail in these circumstances. Nevertheless, my foreign affairs spokesperson and I have been very conscious of the effort that the Australian government made to put in place a mechanism and a group of personnel in Iraq to keep the focus on the effort to liberate Mr Wood at the forefront of our attention, the attention of the authorities in Iraq and the attention of our allies and all our friends in the region. If it transpires to have been effected in the way the Prime Minister has indicated here from his preliminary advice and an Iraqi team did this, that is additional good news-that there is now a capability amongst some of the Iraqi personnel to effect the protection of people who go to Iraq to assist Iraq in its development. We welcome that as well. We join with the Prime Minister in the congratulations and thanks that he extended to various people who played a role in all of this, including the remarks that he made about the efforts of the Australian Islamic community. They recognised immediately this situation developed a fellow feeling with the Wood family and with Mr Wood. They did their very best with the contacts that they had and the angles that they could work to effect to secure the release of the hostage. From the outset the opposition said that the circumstances of Mr Wood's capture and imprisonment were such that no government could tolerate or give into or adjust policy to meet any demands associated with his capture. It is not the right thing to do to negotiate a change in policy on the basis of a terrorist act committed against you. Nor is it appropriate to pay ransom in those circumstances. Whatever the disagreements that the opposition has with government policy with regard to the situation in Iraq, that was firmly our view at the time, and it remains our view. You cannot have your politics in any way shaped by the actions of evil people. It is very important that this outcome has in no way compromised that position. But I think the lion's share of the tribute in all of this must go to the Wood family, who really have been extraordinarily resourceful and brave throughout. They have been people who, no doubt, plumbed the depths of despair and desperation as the days and weeks went by. It would have been enormously easy in those circumstances for frustration to in some shape or form break out into disagreement with how affairs were being handled or into condemnation of this or that activity-or perceived inactivity-by government or by any other forces associated with it. But that never happened. In the entire time the family maintained an enormously dignified, disciplined determination that whatever it was that the family could do to provide some form of assistance to secure a successful outcome the family would do. It speaks so well of all of them that they have sustained this. Our hearts went out to them right through this terrible time of trial and our admiration is there now where our hearts are-and our gratitude that this has been brought to a successful conclusion. Honourable members-Hear, hear! TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005 Consideration of Senate Message Debate resumed.",153
213,Mr FITZGIBBON,MR DOUGLAS WOOD,"Hunter) (6.54 pm)No member of this place could resent or regret being interrupted by such an unexpected and happy announcement as the one we have just heard from the Prime Minister, but before I was interrupted I was about to make the point that this lazy and cocky Treasurer and this lazy and cocky government underestimated the opposition's resolve on this issue. We do believe that a government which, through no credit of its own, is so awash with money-off the back of a minerals boom, off the back of terms of trade which are at a record high and off the back of a GST growing at nine per cent annuallyshould return a dividend to the Australian people. His test tonight, with the tax schedule debate now behind us-with his stunt and his distraction and his diversion now behind us-was to do what the Melbourne Institute did today and argue the case as to which is the fairer tax package. Once again tonight both the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer failed to do that. But he has not missed his last chance. There is nothing to prevent the Treasurer, after I finish my remarks, from coming back to the dispatch box and doing what he failed to do during the consideration in detail stage of the debate in this place a couple of weeks ago and what he failed to do during the debate on the Senate message here tonight: that is, get to that dispatch box and tell the Australian community why it is so fair for so many people-seven million Australians-to get only a $6 a week tax cut, while those sitting on that side so enthusiastically vote themselves a $64 tax cut each week. That is the case he needs to put. (Time expired)",155

VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (2005 BUDGET MEASURE) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed.",156
216,Mrs VALE,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I received leave to continue my remarks on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005. The budget includes $4.6 billion for health care, an increase of $203 million from the 2004-05 budget, and $6.1 billion for compensation and income support, up from $6 billion last financial year. Included in the veterans' health measures is $30.4 million over four years to increase fees paid to anaesthetists providing services to eligible veterans; $30.5 million over four years to increase fees for dentists providing services to the veteran community and to increase the annual monetary limit for high-cost dental services; and a further $18.2 million over four years to increase fees for a range of allied health professionals providing services to members of the veteran community. Eligible veterans will also continue to benefit from concessional rates on prescription medicines and from the payment of the DVA pharmaceutical allowance. Over the last nine years under this government, more than $86 billion has been committed in recognition of the special needs of veterans and war widows. This funding has risen from $6.5 billion in 1996 to more than $10.8 billion in the last budget, an average annual increase of 5.8 per cent. It is worthwhile, especially after the comments from the member for Cowan, to have a look at what the government was promising at the last election for our veterans and our war widows. Labor's plan for veterans offered a paltry range of initiatives, and it continues to reflect their lack of understanding of the real needs of veterans and war widows. Labor's plan had promised only $17.8 million of new funding over four years, compared to the $82.4 million under the coalition. Labor failed to address the issues of most concern to our older veterans and war widows-namely, secure health care services and practical help in the home. Labor failed to make any commitment to maintaining the 15 per cent premium paid to general practitioners to treat the 300,000 eligible white and gold card holders under Veterans' Affairs arrangements rather than Medicare. Under Labor's changes to Medicare, general practitioners would have had little financial incentive to maintain separate billing arrangements for white and gold card holders, which was a great concern to members of the veteran community. Labor failed to make any commitment to Veterans Home Care, which could have seen over 60,000 eligible veterans and war widows lose this valuable service. Labor failed and continues to fail to acknowledge the valuable contribution made by ex-service organisations to the welfare of veterans, and offered nothing to assist ex-service organisations with their work. Labor failed to offer anything further to assist the spouses of our most disabled veterans following their deaths. Labor continues to fail our veterans and our war widows. This bill provides clear evidence that the Howard government continues to deliver to our veterans, our war widows and our ex-service community. The measures in this bill are another strong government achievement. In fact, since this government was returned to office in 1996, there have been a number of very significant measures in support of veterans and war widows. Our veterans with disabilities are financially much better off. Our service pensioners, war widows and war widowers are better off financially. Health care for gold card and white card holders has been expanded. There is provision of extra care for our former prisoners of war, and the government has delivered on practical support for Vietnam veterans and their families, most especially for the children of Vietnam veterans. The government has also provided greater flexibility for younger veterans and our serving personnel. We have encouraged the respect and reverence due to our veterans and war widows by encouraging the recognition of and pride in Australia's military heritage and by providing a further $11 million in the 2004-05 budget to expand the excellent Australian War Memorial. This last point is very significant because this year, during 2005, a number of significant wartime anniversaries have occurred and will continue to occur. There has been the much publicised 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, which occurred, of course, in April. There are also many 60th anniversaries occurring this year, one of which is the anniversary of the landing at Labuan in Borneo, to which we recently sent a commemorative mission of 11 veterans. Significant campaigns in Papua New Guinea will also be commemorated this year by a return of old diggers to pay respects to the mates they left behind in that rugged and unforgiving terrain. Australian veterans and war widows also attended the 60th commemoration in Paris earlier this year to recognise Victory in Europe Day, otherwise known as VE Day. The government is planning appropriate commemorations here in Australia to recognise the 60th anniversary of the Victory in the Pacific. Such plans will be announced at the appropriate time by the minister. I take this opportunity to congratulate the minister for ensuring that our veterans, war widows and ex-service personnel continue to receive the respect and affection of a grateful nation. I join with them in eagerly awaiting the minister's announcement on Australia's activities to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Victory in the Pacific. The 2005-06 budget builds on a lot of hard work by the Howard government to ensure that our veterans, war widows and ex-service community receive the care that they need and the support that is truly important to this group of Australians. I welcome this legislation and commend it to the House.",157
217,Ms HALL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I was interested to hear the previous speaker say that the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (2005 Budget Measure) Bill 2005 delivers to veterans. I would have to say that, instead, this bill fixes up a problem that the government made. This bill rights a wrong. This bill covers up the government's ineptitude. This bill makes up for the fact that the government forgot about the veterans when it initially introduced this legislation. This is islation that, on the face of it, you would assume would be fairly non-controversial. Everybody in this House would agree that self-funded veterans who are independently funded retirees should receive the $200 a year payment that other self-funded retirees receive. Unfortunately for those self-funded retiree veterans, the government forgot about them when they drafted the legislation. They left them off. They did not give them the same attention that they gave to other self-funded retirees. This is very sad because the government went to the last election promising this $200 to all self-funded retirees. To think that they forgot our veterans-our veterans who fought for us and were prepared to give their lives for Australia. Here we are today, some six months later, discussing legislation to bring the treatment of the veterans into line with that of other self-funded retirees. Basically, the government failed them. The government went to the election with great promises, spraying dollars everywhere like confetti, and now they are finally getting around to delivering to our veterans. I will go through the details of how the system works. Basically the seniors allowance is a non means tested giveaway to assist self-funded retirees to pay their power, gas and utility bills. This was what the government promised this group of people in the lead-up to the election: help with things like their car registration and water bills. Selffunded retirees were given an extra $100 because the government recognised that, unlike pensioners, they did not get many of the discounts. We believe that that was blatant electioneering by the government. We believe that this was part of the vote-buying spree that the government went on before the election. This allowance is to be paid in two instalments, one in June and one in December. legBecause the veterans have missed out, they are not going to receive their allowance until December 2005. We are going to pass this legislation tonight, and then they will become eligible-but unfortunately this legislation is not retrospective. This legislation only goes half-way. It does not really recognise that our veterans deserve to be treated with dignity. They are not being treated in the same way as other self-funded retirees. I am afraid that this has really become the way of this government-it tends to forget and marginalise certain groups of people. I find it appalling that it has reached the point where it is doing that to veterans. So this rather non-controversial legislation which is going to extend an entitlement to veterans becomes quite controversial because in fact it treats veterans in a different way to other self-funded retirees-it actually treats them as lesser people. It treats them as lesser people and yet they were the people who were prepared to go and fight for Australia. I have been very disappointed with the government's performance in the area of veterans affairs. There have been a number of issues that have been raised with me by veterans. I think that it is about time that the government started doing more than building monuments and announcing celebrations. I listened to the previous speaker; she spent a great deal of time talking about celebrations. I have news for the government: the kinds of things that veterans need in the area that I represent-and it is an area that has a high veteran population-are services and financial assistance. They need some of the issues that were raised in the Clarke report to be dealt with and they need the government to be honest with them and not to adopt a smoke and mirrors approach to veterans affairs. If you look at this year's budget, you will notice that there is only $10 million for new budget measures in 2005-06. Compare that with the $52 million in savings that are going to be delivered, which come from flow-ons from the health portfolio. Apart from the long overdue increase in dental limits, there are no changes in entitlements whatsoever. There is a $411 million increase in the total budget of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but most of that-$393 million-is due to normal cost increases in the delivery of existing services. The so-called initiatives anaesthetists and allied health providers are part of those normal cost increases. When you add to that $393 million the $60 million that has been carried forward from the budgets of previous years, you will see that the government are giving less money to veterans. Savings have exceeded new spending. The government are trying to cheat, con and use smoke and mirrors to convince the veterans community that they care, that they are delivering to veterans. But that is not the case at all. The previous speaker raised the issue of children and caring for children. It is an I raised earlier tonight in the Main Committee during the consideration in detail of the budget. The government is looking at cutting costs in the services offered by the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service to children of veterans, regardless of their age. The government is thinking of introducing a cut-off point of 36 years of age. All the studies and every report that I have read on this issue show that the government needs to proceed with great caution in this area. As we know, the rate of suicide for sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans is three times the national rate. For that reason alone we need to be very careful about taking away that counselling service for the children of veterans. You might ask why that is being done. The answer is simple: this government is more concerned with saving money than with delivering services to veterans. I need to place that on the record. The other issue I wish to place on the record in talking about services and benefits to veterans is the failure of the government to reward the selfless care given to disabled veterans by their partners with the $1,000 bonus that was paid to people in receipt of the carers payment. Partners of veterans received the $600 payment, as did those in receipt of the carers allowance. But the partfor ners of veterans do not receive the carers payment, so they are ineligible for that $1,000. These people do the same work as other carers. In some cases they care for the most disabled and sickest people in our community-people with enormous problems-yet the government has chosen to ignore their needs. Whilst the introduction of this legislation and the extension of the utility payment is very important, many other issues need to be taken up. For instance, the government has not really dealt with the Clarke report. The Clarke report disappeared without a trace. issue We are wondering what has happened to the initiatives that were supposed to flow from that report. As I have already mentioned, the veterans that talk to me are concerned that we are having lots of celebrations but the nuts and bolts of the issues affecting their daily lives are not being dealt with. They do not want to see more savings in veterans affairs. They want to see a government that is 100 per cent committed to them. They appreciate the $200 that they will be given. Many of them have said to me that they thought that it was a case of the government trying to buy their vote, and they were very disappointed when they found out that they were not to receive that $200 immediately. There are many challenges for the government in veterans affairs. There is such a need within the veterans community. People are still having problems with the Veterans Home Care program. They are still not getting the number of hours of care that they believe that they should be receiving. They are very disappointed that the government have chosen to move away from their responsibility in this area. They are waiting see the outcome of the atomic-testing ies. They will accept the money that is being given to them by the government and we will support it. But we would implore the government to take this measure a step further, to reconsider their decision and to backdate this payment to bring these veterans into line with other self-funded retirees.

218,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Norman Hunter",161
219,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to pay my respects to one of my constituents, an elder of the GunungWillam-Balluk clan, Norman Hunter, who passed away on 16 May at the age of 61, after a long illness. Norm lived in Coolaroo in my electorate and, as an elder of the Gunung-Willam-Balluk clan of the Wurundjeri community, the traditional custodians of the land where my electorate office is essentially based, Norm was a very proud and respected role model. Whilst not large in number, the Indigenous community in my electorate remains culturally rich, and they are enormously proud of their heritage. Uncle Norm, as he was known in the community, was committed to his people, to guiding and teaching young and to recognising and correcting the past wrongs that the Indigenous community endured. Norm gave himself totally to the community, with his lifelong commitment to reconciliation and to Indigenous people and their culture. With his loss, our community has lost a very valuable supporter. In 2001, Norm's commitments were recognised with the honour of a Centenary Medal for his service as an advocate of reconciliation and as an elder of the Wurrinjeri community. It was with great pleasure that I to presented this Centenary award to Norm. He inquir- was a much deserving recipient who achieved far more in the community than he was recognised for. For many years Norm was involved in Hume City Council activities, including his valuable participation on the Indigenous Advisory Committee-which he continued, despite his long illness-and his contribution most recently to the Weaving Lands Basketry Project in 2004, where Norm was honoured with the naming of the final sculpture, The Galgignarrak Yirranboi Tree, which means ‘the Backbone of Tomorrow', representing the growth and strength of the local community. Norm also played a prominent role in setting up the Gunung-Willam-Balluk Indigenous Learning Centre at Kangan Batman TAFE in Broadmeadows. This is a state-of the-art centre where Indigenous students can learn about their culture while completing their TAFE studies. Norm was a part of this project literally from start to finish. At the sod-turning celebrations at commencement of construction in 2003 Norm performed a special fire ceremony to signify the ‘new beginning' represented by this facility and at the launch of the centre in 2004 Norm spoke and performed the welcome to country ceremony. Unfortunately I was unable to attend that launch, but I did visit the centre the shortly after and was thoroughly impressed-and continue to be impressed-by the centre, its facilities and the tremendous amount of work that it does locally for Indigenous young people. With over 400 people attending Norm's funeral service, the extent of our community's loss is very clear. In the eulogy given by Terry Kildea, the Koori programs manager at Kangan Batman TAFE, Norm's fighting spirit and commitment to the young were acknowledged. Terry spoke of Norm's passing and noted: You have left spiritual footprints for us to follow. This he has done. Norm has left an exemplary legacy for others to build on and to develop. He has provided an example for the continued promotion of respect for Indigenous cultural heritage and for reconciliation and social justice for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Norm's contribution to the community was commemorated at the Gunung-WillamBalluk Learning Centre as part of this year's Reconciliation Week events, with Norm's daughter, Tammy Hunter-Capocchi, telling the gathering the story of her people and their ties to the land. For the benefit of the House, I would like to quote Tammy. She said: The story of the Gunung-Willam-Balluk people is an epic tale of survival and adaptation. Strip away the present layer of buildings, freeways and suburbs and try to imagine the distant past. You will come across a distant land of meandering waterways and vibrant forests, lagoons and wild grasses, basalt plains and rivers. We have always been here. We have been here since the beginning of time. We come from the land. Our identity is bound up with the land. To understand our aspirations, the land needs to be recognised. Norm leaves behind Annette, his wife of 38 years, as well as his six children, his seven grandchildren and many members of his wider family and many friends. I express my sympathy to Norm's family and community. He will be remembered fondly and respected for his commitment and wisdom. Rose Bay Secondary College",161
220,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Rose Bay Secondary College is the only state high school in the electorate of Wentworth. Its achievements place it among the most accomplished high schools in New South Wales. The school is renowned for its strong creative and technological focus. Rose Bay Secondary College currently operates from two campuses-one in Dover Heights and another in Vaucluse. Four years ago the Carr Labor government in New South Wales decided to consolidate the two high school campuses into one at the Dover Heights campus. This had the advantage of freeing up the extremely valuable Vaucluse High School site for sale for development. An experienced local real estate agent has informed me that if the Vaucluse site of 1.2 hectares were zoned for medium densityand that is the character of its surrounding development-it would be worth more than $25 million. The deal offered to the community was straightforward: a new building would be erected at Dover Heights and the old building refurbished so that the whole campus would be a state-of-the-art high school for 1,200 students. The state Labor government has now announced in its budget that it will not spend the $7 million needed to refurbish the old premises and finish the capital works at Dover Heights. This is a breach of promise to the students, teachers and parents of Rose Bay Secondary College. It means that the state Labor government can potentially pocket tens of millions from the sale of the Vaucluse site and then short-change the school community by reneging on its promise to complete the development at Dover Heights. Last night a public meeting was held at the Dover Heights campus, demanding that the state government complete its long promised refurbishment of the Dover Heights premises before the whole school is moved in. Over 400 people attended, including students-past and present-parents and concerned residents. It was a powerful display unity, and I commend Julia Meare and her P&C for organising such a successful event. Premier Bob Carr, Treasurer Andrew Refshauge and the state Minister for Education and Training, Carmel Tebbutt, were invited but, predictably, did not show up or send a representative. On 19 May I wrote to Ms Tebbutt expressing my very grave concern at the state government's failure to fund the stage 2 building program of the Rose Bay Secondary College. I have had no response beyond a bare acknowledgment. The Labor Party complains bitterly about parents choosing non-government schools, especially in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. Yet when there was an opportunity to ensure that our area had a state high school with first-class facilities, the Labor government decided to take the money and run off with it. It claims that it is facing budgetary straints and cannot afford to complete the project. But the eastern suburbs contribute more state taxes than any other community in Sydney. High property values ensure that our community pays the most in stamp duty and land tax. The sale of the Vaucluse land will reap a multiple of the $7 million needed to complete the work at Dover Heights. Yet it is our community in the eastern suburbs, contributing so much to state revenues, that is being short-changed by Labor. By way of contrast, the federal government is providing substantial and growing levels of funding to New South Wales state schools. In 2005-06 the federal government will increase funding for New South Wales state schools and students to $998 million. This is an estimated increase of $73 million, nearly eight per cent, over the past year and $469 million, nearly 89 per cent, since 1996. I urge the Rose Bay Secondary College community to keep up the pressure on the Carr Labor state government. The government's neglect of public education in the of eastern suburbs is scandalous and must not be tolerated. I will continue to lobby the state government on behalf of the Rose Bay Secondary College community. The Labor government has shown itself to be either a fool or a knave. If it did not have the money to begin with, it was a fool. But if the truth is that the money was there, as it would appear, and this is just a case of another broken promise, ridicule is not the answer: those in the government are not fools and they deserve public condemnation. I urge the premier and his colleagues to keep their promise to the community and complete Rose Bay Secondary College. Asylum Seekers",162
221,Dr LAWRENCE,ADJOURNMENT,"The now notorious cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon have reawakened the general media and community interest in the contreatment of asylum seekers more generally in Australia. They have reawakened interest in the system that this parliament ratified. The mistreatment of vulnerable people now has to be squarely faced by all in this place and the wider community. What we know now demands a full judicial inquiry. We know, for example, that at least 13 people have died in detention; as many as fourprobably more-have been killed on return to their countries; and 353 people drowned en route to Australia on board the SIEVX. Perhaps as many as 200-according to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs-have been wrongfully detained and an unknown number of people have actually been wrongfully deported. These facts alone demand a full judicial inquiry. While a lot of people have been content to turn their backs and close their ears, a band of dedicated advocates and supporters-who I commend-have provided tangible support to people in detention and those who have been let out on various forms of visa without proper support from the government. They have worked assiduously to try to minimise the damage being done in the government's name-indeed, in the Australian people's name-to so many people. They have selflessly sought to wring concessions from successive ministers and to get them to change their minds about various detaineessometimes successfully, sometimes not. They have shone a light on the desperate circumstances of the thousands who have had the misfortune to pass through the detention system in Australia and on Manus Island and Nauru. There have, too, been a few determined journalists who have provided the vehicles to tell the stories and highlight the atrocities-because atrocities they are. This evening I want to present the outline of a petition which will be tabled in due course calling for a royal commission into the treatment of asylum seekers, refugees and immigration detainees. The petition has been compiled by one of the groups I mentioned, Project Safecom, and a dedicated advocate, Jack Smit. It is in the following terms. Already it has 5,278 signatures, and they are rolling in a couple of hundred at a time. It calls for a royal commission into the treatment of asylum seekers, refugees and immigration detainees, and specifically into: conditions, incidents and events, in Australian ‘Pacific Solution' detention centres & all other forms of immigration detention and prisons, police lock-ups, home detention, including how incidents were acted upon and followed up; engagement and administration of the contract between ACM and the Commonwealth of Australia from 1997-2004 incl., and Group 4Falck from 2003 onwards; and the conduct of ACM and GSL in their operation of IDCs; the sinking of SIEVX and the possible role of AFP, ASIS and agents recruited, equipped or tasked by either AFP or ASIS; whether the Howard government influenced ADF & other Commonwealth agencies to suppress information about interception procedures and measures regarding Australia's rescue obligations to refugee claimants attempting to reach Australia in SIEVs; into deaths of immigration detainees including the adequacy of any previous investigations and responses to their deaths, and unnatural deaths of TPV holders in the community; compliance of the TPV regime with international refugee law and its impact on the human rights of refugees on TPV's; whether a bias was present or created in refugee assessment and review; the effects of preventing due access by lawyers, media agents and the public in order to assess, assist, support and report; whether obstructions were caused to the unfettered access to all aspects of legal recourse during assessment, review and appeals; the effects of government policies on their physical and mental health and that of their families and dependantsand a number of other matters. In all of this, it is very important that we do not let the government off the hook. This is not just about the behaviour of DIMIA, DIMIA staff and contracted companies. It is about the systematic abuse of asylum seekers in this country and it deserves a full, open inquiry. Labor has called for it; members of and the community are now calling for it. It is time we opened up this hideous Pandora's box and examined it in all its grotesqueness. Autism",163
222,Mrs HULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Riverina) (7.44 pm)Tonight I would like to quote from the Autumn 2005 newsletter from the Kurrajong Early Intervention Service, of which I declare I am a patron. Something in this newsletter really struck me: 10 things that every child with autism wishes you would know about them. It starts by saying: Some days it seems the only predictable thing about it is the unpredictability. The only consistent attribute, is the inconsistency. There is little argument on any level but that autism is baffling, even to those who spend their lives around it. The child who lives with autism may look ‘normal' but his or her behaviour can be perplexing and downright difficult. Today, the citadel of autism, once thought an ‘incurable' disorder, is cracking around the foundation. Every day, individuals with autism show us they can overcome, compensate for, and otherwise manage many of the condition's most challenging aspects. Equipping those around our children with a simple understanding of autism's most basic elements has a tremendous effect on the children's journey towards productive, independent adulthood. Autism is an extremely complex disorder, but we can distill it to three critical components: sensory processing difficulties, speech/language delays and impairments, and whole child/social interaction issues. There are 10 things that every child with autism wishes that we would know about them. I will not be able to go through these 10 things this evening. But No. 1 is that a child says: I am a child with autism. I am not ‘autistic'. My autism is one aspect of my total character. It does not define me as a person. Are you a person with thoughts, feelings and many talents, or are you just fat (overweight), myopic (wear glasses) or klutyzy (uncoordinated, not good at sports)? The next thing that a child with autism might like us to know is: My sensory perceptions are disordered. This means that the ordinary sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touches of everyday life that you may not even notice can be downright painful for me. The very environment in which I have to live often seems hostile. I may appear withdrawn or belligerent to you, but I am really just trying to defend myself. A “simple” trip to the grocery store may be hell for me. My hearing may be hyperacute. Dozens of people are talking at once. The loudspeaker booms today's special. Music whines from the sound system. Cash registers beep and cough. A coffee grinder is chugging. The meat cutter screeches, babies wail, carts creak, the fluorescent lighting hums. My brain can't filter all the input, and I'm in overload! My sense of smell may be highly sensitive. The fish at the meat countermay not seemquite fresh, the guy standing next to usmay not haveshowered today, the deli is handing out sausage samples, the baby in line ahead of usmay have a dirtydiaper, they're mopping up pickles on Aisle 3 with ammonia.... I can't sort it all outbecauseI'm too nauseous. … … … It all comes down to three words: Patience. Patience. Patience. We need to: Work to view my autism as a different ability rather than a disability. Look past what you might see as limitations and see the gifts autism has given me. I may not be good at eye contact or conversation, but have you noticed I don't lie, cheat at games, tattle on my classmates, or pass judgment on other people? You are my foundation. Think through some of these societal rules, and if they don't make sense for me, let them go. Be my advocate, be my friend, and ... see just how far I can go. I probably won't be the next Michael Jordan, but with my attention to fine detail and capacity for extraordinary focus, I might be the next Einstein. Or Mozart. Or Van Gogh. BecauseThey had autism too. Nuclear Energy",164
223,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to address the emerging debate on uranium mining and nuclear energy. This is a debate of great importance in the context of Australian trade, our future economic growth and our industry competitiveness in an increasingly carbon constrained world. It is also an important debate for Australia in the context of responsible citizenship in the global community. Australia is already a major exporter of uranium, and therefore it is undeniably part of the global nuclear cycle. Thankfully and importantly, Australia is a responsible participant in that cycle. Responsibility in the context of its role in the global nuclear cycle means that Australia cannot withdraw from the international community in terms of the debate about uranium mining, nuclear power and its corollaries: nuclear non-proliferation and the safe and peaceful handling of nuclear waste materials. Today there are some 440 nuclear power reactors in 31 countries, with a combined capacity of 367 gigawatt equivalents. In 2003 these provided over 16 per cent of the world's electricity. Countries with existing nuclear programs have significantly increased their generating capacity, including the United States of America, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Finland. Rising gas prices and greenhouse constraints on coal have combined to put nuclear power back on the agenda for projected new capacity in both Europe and North America. We await the UK white paper with respect to its future energy capacity. But, interestingly and importantly for Australia, the fastest growth is on Australia's doorstep in Asia. About 30 power reactors are currently being constructed in 11 countries, most notably China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, of which we have agreements to export uranium to three, excluding China. Construction is well advanced on many of them. Beyond those under construction, at least eight countries existing nuclear programs have plans to build further new power stations. They are Finland, France, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Japan and South Korea. The International Atomic Energy Agency has significantly increased its projection of world nuclear generating capacity and now anticipates at least 60 new plants in the next 15 years. In addition, there is a program which, whilst currently stalled, will provide North Korea with two South Korean reactors, and Iran is well advanced with the construction of its first nuclear power reactor. It is of concern that a number of countries remain outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and equally of concern that some of those within it are not meeting their obligations. Yet there is no doubt that uranium will be supplied to plants in those countries from somewhere in the world, just as it will be supplied to plants in countries complying with non-proliferation obligations. I therefore believe that every Australian should surely conclude that the best sources of uranium for nuclear power plants are those countries that take nuclear non-proliferation requirements seriously and have strict chain of custody procedures for uranium sales and bilateral agreements that deal with safe, peaceful and proper use of uranium and the disposal of its waste products. The failure of the recent United Nations conference to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty highlights the danger we face in driving the nuclear cycle underground and removing control of the nuclear materials trade from responsible nations and responsible companies. That is why Australia has an obligation. It must participate in the global debate about uranium mining and nuclear energy; there is no alternative. The risks of not doing so are too great for Australia and the world at large. Australia is fortunate in having abundant and relatively cheap natural with gas, coal seam methane and high-quality clean coal resources to meet its domestic power needs today and for decades to come. Australia also has great potential to meet domestic needs from renewable sources including solar, wind, geothermal and wave technologies. Unfortunately, many countries are not as fortunate as Australia. This gives Australia an enormous competitive advantage and responsibility as a trading nation providing energy, energy technology and energy services to the global community. We are already a major exporter of clean coal and liq- held there. uefied natural gas to the world, and we are undeniably a major exporter of uranium. It is clear that, with likely growth in nuclear power capacity around the world, our uranium will be in greater demand as will world uranium. (Time expired) East Timor Tutorial Voucher System",165
224,Ms CORCORAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take the remaining time to talk about a young woman called Felicidade Gutterres-I will call her Dade, for shortwho stayed with me for 10 days some time ago. She comes from East Timor. Dade was active in East Timor in the period of unrest before the coming of independence. She came to Australia recently to learn about how we govern ourselves. The Friends of Manatuto, an organisation auspiced by the City of Kingston, is a small group of people in Kingston interested in East Timor which is developing a relationship with the village of Manatuto in East Timor. The Friends of Manatuto were approached for assistance for Dade and they were delighted to be able to help. Dade arrived in Melbourne from Canberra one Saturday evening in April this year and she stayed for about 10 days. She spent some time with officers of the City of Kingston, observing how they provide the services that they do. Chelsea Rotary took Dade out one evening for dinner at the state parliament, its where she met some of our local state MPs. Dade also spent some time in Geelong and two days with me, as I moved around my electorate and attended a women's health conference held in Melbourne. Dade is trying to find funds to get herself back to Australia to do some postgraduate studies in politics and policy development. Dade is very interested in getting herself involved in government in East Timor in the next elections to be It was very interesting to listen to Dade talk about her experiences before independence. She told me about hiding in the hills for weeks at a time, whilst Indonesian troops rampaged through the villages below. Dade talked about the day that she went to Dili to observe election proceedings. Her husband and her two sons were hiding. She handed her small daughter to the nuns at a nearby convent, with instructions that, should she not return, the nuns were to find her husband and hand her daughter over to him. I cannot imagine how that must feel when setting out for a day's work. Dade said over and over again that Timor L'Este needs resources in almost every area. She saw the resources around us here in Parliament House-our library facilities and everything else-as way beyond anything available in Timor L'Este. My contribution to Dade's stay in Melbourne was to provide her with accommodation in my home and this led us to spending quite some time together. I can only admire Dade's determination to learn and to take whatever skills and ideas she could back to Timor L'Este, her ongoing concern over many years for her own country and her determination and perseverance in what must be extremely difficult times. The stark differences that Dade described brought home to me, once again, just what a lucky country Australia is and how we all should be doing all we can, wherever we are, to assist our neighbours. It also brought home to me the benefit of talking to somebody on a first-hand basis. We can read books and reports and listen to radio programs, but talking to somebody who has been there and experienced things for themselves is truly the best way to learn-short of actually making a visit. On a somewhat sadder note, I would like to speak of a problem that was raised with me by a constituent about the tutorial voucher system that exists. This woman-I will call her Ms L-has a son who recently did not do particularly well in his grade 3 reading program and is now entitled to a $700 voucher, promised by the government. At the end of April this year, my constituent rang the 1800 number that was advertised, but her call was not answered. She rang the number again; her call was not answered. She tried many times and ended up emailing the agency. She finally made contact with somebody. By then she was very frustrated. At that point she was advised that the computer screens were down, but her details were taken and she was assured that a suitable match would be made in due course. There was silence. There was no response for a long time, despite further attempts to telephone and get hold of an officer. At the end of May, Ms L became very frustrated and approached me for some assistance. My office, again after lots of difficulty, finally got through and contacted the people running this program, and a gentleman there promised that he would put some priority on her request. But the point I want to make is that this is now two months later and we should not have to put a priority on this particular request. I do not understand why she was not processed properly and helped in the right way initially. Ms L is concerned about her son and his reading ability and wants to provide him with the best help she can. She is totally frustrated by this seemingly senseless delay. I wonder too what the delay is. Is the scheme not being administered properly, or are there simply not enough tutors in the system to cope with demand? (Time expired) Nuclear Energy",167
225,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In the remaining minute of the adjournment debate, I will conclude my earlier remarks. It is clear that, with the likely growth in nuclear power capacity around the world, uranium will be in greater and greater demand. This is reflected in the rising price of uranium in the market. Australia is one of the most responsible exporters of uranium in the world, requiring strict adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and bilateral agreements relating to the peaceful and safe use of uranium. Olympic Dam in South Australia is the largest uranium deposit in the world and can be expanded almost limitlessly. Australia will therefore take advantage of the growth in uranium demand, as is the desire of the South Australian Labor government, and do it in a responsible way. It is time for all Australians to engage properly in a constructive and significant debate about the strategic importance of Australia's uranium resources not only for our nation but for the global community.",168
