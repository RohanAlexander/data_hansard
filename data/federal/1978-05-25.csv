2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That Item 6469 of the standard Medical Benefits Table is the means by which payment is made for the slaughter of thousands of unborn babies every year. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government should ensure that Item 6469 is removed from the standard Medical Benefits Table. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray,  Petitions received. Pensioners: Home Maintenance Loans To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That it is necessary for the Commonwealth Government to renew for a further term of at least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974-77, renewed for one year expiring on 30 June 1978. The demand for dwellings has not slackened as the waiting list (all States) of 12,060 single and 4,120 couples as at 30 June 1977, showeth. Your petitioners respectfully draw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons' Housing 1975 under the Chairmanship of the Rev. K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to meet the demand for low-rental accommodation in the proportion of $4 for $1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and That the Act include married pensioners eligible for supplementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Report and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements of the prospective tenants in the location and design of such dwellings. Furthermore, your petitioners desire to draw the Government's attention to the hardship of many pensioner home owners caused by the high cost of maintenance. The Social Security Annual Report 1976-77 shows that 24.6 per cent, or 283,000 home owning pensioners, have a weekly income in excess of the pension of less than $6 per week. Your petitioners strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to establish a fund whereby loans can be made to means tested pensioners for the purpose of effecting necessary maintenance to their homes. Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administrative costs and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a single sioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners jointly own the dwelling. Administration to be carried out by local government bodies. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, PETITIONS by Mr Keith Johnson and Mr Morris. Petitions received. Assistance to Grape Growers To the Honourable the Speaker of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of citiMedical Benefits zens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: Upper Murray Grapegrowers Association. assembled. The petition of Petition to be presented to Federal parliament: We the undersigned residents of the Riverland call on the Federal Government to compensate grapegrowers to leave this years surplus grapes on the vine, to stop all subsidised wine and brandy imports until the surplus grape problem is solved, to stop taxing the grapegrower out of existence, and to reduce excise on Australian brandy. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Giles. Petition received. Aged Persons Accommodation The Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That surveys reveal a substantial percentage of adults over the age of 55 years in the Loftus-Engadine-Heathcote and Waterfall areas of the Hughes electorate, are in urgent need of special housing and nursing home accommodation. (b) That many families in the area are experiencing difficulty in the placing of their aged parents in suitable nursing care; many cases having to be placed in care many kilometres from their families and consequently causing great strain on the relatives concerned. (c) That this problem is aggravated by this area's geographical and pubUc transport isolation from the rest of the Sutherland Shire. (d) That Government subsidised nursing homes in other parts of the Hughes and Cook electorate have long waitinglists and in fact, have closed their lists to further inquirers. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Houe of Representatives in Parliament assembled will: 1. Acknowledge that there is a need for the construction of an aged persons complex in this area as already acknowledged by the Federal/State Co-ordinating Committee for Nursing-Home accommodation in New South Wales. 2. Take immediate action to provide sufficient funds in the current financial year to finance the construction and maintenance of an aged-persons complex, providing hostel and nursing bed accommodation in this area. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Taxation pen- To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a sonal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his sonal incomes taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of double income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: That the citizens of Australia totally reject communism and call upon the Government to: (a) ban all communist organisations, and (b) prohibit all communists from holding office in ail industrial organisations, government departments, and in Parliament. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Shipton. Petition received. Television Services in Warburton Area To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the township of Warburton in the electorate of MCMillan respectfully showeth: Whereas: (a) Since the introduction of television into Australia twenty-two years ago, one half of the residents in the township of Warburton in Victoria have not been able to receive a viewable picture. (b) The Community Television Antenna System (CTAS) could be introduced into the Warburton area to remove this inability and provide television to all those wishing to view that means of community education and entertainment. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia per medium of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications give all directions to ensure the installation of CTAS or such other means to produce television viewing for the citizens of Warburton. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Simon. Petition received. NA system of double taxation of perNA NA",15
3,Mr SCHOLES,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"I ask the Minister for Deor her perfence: Did the Secretary of his Department indicate in an interview that policy areas of his Department were not aware as late as 11 May of proposals to change communications equipment at North West Cape? Is it a fact, as reported, that Air Vice-Marshal Jordan, one of the most senior military officers in the Department, was aware of these proposals and had had discussions on them in the United States? Does the Minister agree with the statement made by his Secretary, which clearly implies that senior military officers are not part of the policy formulation sections of his Department? Communism Mr KILLEN- I excuse myself from saying on what date Sir Arthur Tange said that the proposal of the United States regarding modifications to the North West Cape base was brought to his notice in an official policy sense. But what I would like to invite my honourable friend to agree with is the proposition that it is very difficult for people working constantly in a technical area to make a judgment as to when that would have a clear policy effect. Judgment on this may differ. It may differ between the honourable gentleman and me; it may differ between and among all honourable members in this House. It is very difficult to lay down in advance any a priori rules that must be observed by people working in a technical area. I can only repeat what I said yesterday: I would have found it more agreeable if, once the discussion on this issue moved out of a technical consideration, we had been notified. It is true that this matter was brought to the notice of Air Vice-Marshal Jordan in a technical briefing in the United States. I hope my honourable friend would show understanding to this extent: Unless a person is technically informed on these issues it is very difficult to make a judgment as to the significant impact they may have on policy considerations. It is no reflection on Air Vice-Marshal Jordan to say that he is not a technical communicator in that sense.",16
4,Mr SCHOLES,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,Was anyone else present? all equipment necessary to instal,16
5,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"I could not answer that. I will make an inquiry and inform the honourable gentleman. Both the Chief of Defence Force Staff and the Secretary to the Department of Defence, Sir Arthur Tange, with my knowledge and approval, have given an appropriate instruction to all officers to be, as it were, a little more critical in making a determination and an assessment to when something may move from a technical consideration into something that has policy significance.",16
6,Mr DRUMMOND,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"My question, which is his directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, cerns the recent events in Zaire. Can the Minister give any details about the Congo National LiberTange's ation Front, the group which carried out attack on Kolwezi? Were Cuban troops involved in the attack? Were any Australians in the wezi area at the time of the attack?  the Government condemns unreservedly the it, senseless and brutal killings of innocent men, women and children recently in Zaire. Some of these people were apparendy killed in the face the French and Belgian rescue operation. Withof out that operation, however, many probably would have died. The background to these events is that the attack on Kolwezi carried out by a group calling itself the Congo National Liberation Front-the group referred in the honourable member's question-whic was apparently based on former Katangan segovernment cessionists living in Angola. Their aim appears have been to bring down the present Mobutu Government in Zaire or to bring about the seregard cession from Zaire of the Shaba province, which, of course, is the former Katanga, as was attempted in the early 1960s. To this extent the matter is an internal one for Zaire, although attack clearly represents another threat to stabArthur ility in an already tense and uneasy region. So far as we can judge, no Cuban troops have been directly involved in the attack, although according to some reports Cubans and East from Germans in Angola may have provided training and support. The employment of Cubans or senior others in an active role would development, internationalising the conflict and constituting further blatant interference in another important African country. I have preliterally viously made it clear in the House that in the Government's view Cuban and Soviet military interference in the affairs of countries of gion has not advanced the cause of peace one iota. The French and Belgian rescue operation was of course not primarily intended to support the Zaire Government. Its stated objective was rescue foreign nationals, mainly French and Belcourse gian. Finally, according to information available to my Department to date, one Australian citizen he may be. was in the Kolwezi area at the time of the attack as but has been safely accounted for. NA NA",17
7,Mr HUMPHREYS,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"Has the Minister for DeZAIRE fence noted the public comment of the Head of Department, Sir Arthur Tange, that it is norconmal for technical information not to be passed up to policy level? Does he endorse Sir Arthur view that the important policy decision the of the United States Government to acquire satellite terminal equipment for installations at Kolthe North West Cape base and its publicly expressed intention to build a satellite ground station there are merely matters for technical information for his Government? Does he regard as one would expect it to be properly regarded by the Government, as a matter of the highest policy content? Has he rebuked Sir Arthur Tange of for his unwise and undesirable public assessment what information Sir Arthur Tange believes more most should go to the Government?",17
8,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"May I say, and I feel sure that it was would be virtually the unanimous view of this House, that Sir Arthur Tange is one of the most to distinguished civil servants ever to serve this h country. The service that he has offered to has been to governments of all polto itical shades. I say that not to seek to offer any bromide to the honourable gentleman. I would it as bordering on impertinence for me to seek to rebuke Sir Arthur Tange for anything that he has said regarding the North West Cape issue. I think the honourable gentleman is taking the too hard a line of things when he says that Sir Tange has said that it is not normal for technical matters toflowinto policy channels. To repeat what I said to the honourable member for Corio, it becomes a matter of hard judgment as to when there should be a movement of any issue a strict technical area into a policy area. An appropriate instruction has been issued to all officers to be, as it were, a little more alert be a very serious about the issue. I ask my honourable friend to reflect upon the hundreds and hundreds of discussions that take place in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European countries involving the reAustraUan officers UteraUy every day of the week. It is an extraordinarily complex Department. Surely it is not seriously suggested that every one of those discussions, which may be at a to technical level, should be pushed as a matter of instantly into a policy area and, beyond that, pushed to the Minister of the day, whoever I would sum up by saying to the honourable gendeman that it becomes a matter ofjudgment, and it is very difficult to lay followed. It is a matter of individual judgment, and it is inevitable that fromtimeto time there will be errors in the exercise of that judgment. Finally, may I say that literally hundreds of judgments of that nature are exercised every day, every week, year after year. It is only very, very occasionally that there is a significant blemish, as one may describe it on this occasion. BEEF EXPORT ENTITLEMENT SCHEME ferred",17
9,Mr BURR,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"Will the Minister for Primary InIndeed dustry advise the House what action he has taken to review Australia's beef export entitlement scheme following disclosures in the House by the Deputy Prime Minister that entitlements are ling, being traded at 50c per lb and to refute claims being made by some cattle producers? Will the Minister table documents supporting assertions made by Mr Jones, the Chairman of the Austween tralian Meat and Livestock Corporation, that only one per cent of beef export entidements being traded?",18
10,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"The whole function eration of quotas and the diversification entitlements that flow from the difficulties of getting access into restricted markets seem to be completely misunderstood by most cattlemen, and unfortunately even by many leaders of invery dustry who should be informed on such matters. Indeed, the concept of setting up a producers' consultative group, which together with the porters consultative group acts as an advisory body to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, was developed so that those groups could be expressly involved in developing poliproducers cies in such areas, make a contribution in mulating them, question their application, and be involved in any modifications to them. Under section 13 of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act there is a requirement that when diversification schemes are being evolved information about them should be distributed to industry so that they can be sidered and, if industry does not find that they meet its requirements, it can suggest alterations characterised to them. That process in fact is under way at the should moment with respect to proposed changes the AMLC has in mind for the Japanese market. It is intended that, after consideration of recdecisions ommendations of industry, a judgment be taken of whether the quota scheme to Japan should modified. Let me stress first of all that in any changes in any application of diversification exporters and producers have a vehicle through the consultative group and the AMLC which can ensure that their separate points of view are addown clear lines to be equately heard. Secondly, with respect to claims about the price paid for diversification, it needs to be realised that at the moment prices payable for Australian meat exports on most markets other than on markets that have quotas, that is, other than the United States, Canada and Japan, are unfortunately very low. The differential between the price payable on those other markets and that payable on the United States or the premarket represents the diversification costs. some exporters sell only to those other markets and they are able to get rid of some of Australia's surplus beef simply by selling to those markets and offsetting their cost for handfreight, packaging, lulling and so on simply because they are able to sell the diversification entitlement. Therefore the level of the price of diversification and the difference in prices bethose two markets does not want to be seen as a rake-off affecting producers. However are the Government and, I believe, the AMLC would hope that with higher prices prevaihng in some markets we might be able to get a higher and opprice paid to producers. Essentially, the solution of the problem is, firstly, to get those quota markets to Uft thenquotas. The United States at the moment has good reason to do that because of the extent to which beef prices affect its consumer price index: Secondly, there is a need to gain access to exmarkets elsewhere. I see no reason for tabling documents relating to the claim of the chairman of the AMLC that only one per cent of diversification trading is taking place. If individual or exporters are interested in finding forout those figures, they have access to them through the producers' consultative group and the AMLC itself. NA NA",18
11,Mr CHARLES JONES,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"Does the Minister confor Defence recaU that yesterday he stated: There comes a time when technical considerations must be as having important political significance, and be communicated through policy channels as distinct that from straight technical channels. Does he regard pubUcly acknowledged policy of the United States of America to acquire new satelUte terminal equipment for the be North West Cape base and to construct a new satelUte ground facility there in 1980-81 as going both well beyond mere technical considerations and properly requiring to be treated as a matter having a very high policy content? When was this policy decision of the United States conveyed to his Department; to whom was it conveyed; what steps has he taken to establish the reasons for this important policy matter not being passed on to the Government; and what measures has he implemented to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen again?",18
12,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,The honourable member has asked I think in total seven questions. Mr Charles Jones-Would you like me to hand them over to you?,19
13,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"No , not really. Mr Charles Jones-You cannot remember them?",19
14,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"Well , there was an occasion in this House when one quesdon was asked, but the honourable gentleman has asked a series of questions and I will do him the courtesy as best I can of answering them. I have already answered a number of them, particularly the one dealing with what steps have been taken. I have no wish to demean or to debauch this debate but I invite the honourable gentleman to reflect on another matter to which I referred yesterday. I said that it was in 1972 that discussions first took place on this matter at a technical level. Therefore one may go through the years 1973, 1974 and 1975 when the honourable gentleman sat in a Government that had this matter under its control. I am not seeking to rebuke my predecessors in office one bit for this, but to the best of my knowledge it was in September 1972 that this matter at a technical level was brought to the notice of an Australian defence force. In that case I think it was the Air Force.",19
15,Dr KLUGMAN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,Who was the Prime Minister then?,19
16,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"I am bound to tell the honourable member that the honourable and learned member for Werriwa became the Prime Minister in December 1972 so if the honourable member is seeking to do any impaling or impeaching it might be better to throw a few shafts at him. Let me put this matter at rest. I have already sought to make it clear that what is in prospect would in no way change the function or the role of this base. I can but in the utmost good faith repeat that. I was minded on Sunday to put out a Press statement which would seek to settle some of the anxieties which I know some honourable members in this House hold. Rather than put it out as a Press statement, which I would regard as a discourtesy to the House, I will read five short paragraphs which will describe the continuing function of the North West Cape facility. The replacement for the obsolescent TSC54 terminal: (a) would not have any facilities to command the positioning of satellites (b) would not have any facilities to control the allocation of Satellite Communications capacity to users of the Defence Satellite Communication System (c) would not have telemetry and tracking functions other than those necessary in any satellite terminals including the present TSC54 terminals to keep its own antenna pointed at the communications satelUte (d) would-as the existing terminal-be used purely for the transmission and reception of communication traffic; and (e) this transmission and reception would be done by the MSC61 through the US Defence SatelUte Communication System of which it, like the TSC54 terminal would be a part. Mr Charles Jones- I rise on a point of order. The Minister has not attempted to answer the question.",19
17,Mr SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,There is no point of order. The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Charles Jones-He is hedging.,19
18,Mr SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Speaker, honourable members are entitled to ask questions and to get answers to those questions and not have Ministers running away from the issues.",19
19,Mr SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,Order! I warn the honourable member for Newcasde.,19
20,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"I have sought to give the honourable gentleman the answer to the question which he has put. If he does not have the capacity to understand, he has my sorrow.",19
21,Mr SCHOLES,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,I ask that the document quoted be tabled so that it may immediately be available to honourable members.,19
22,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,I table the document. NA,19
23,Mr BUNGEY,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,"Has the Prime Minister received a communication from major shipping lines warning that unless industrial chaos on Australian wharves is halted, the shipping lines will no longer accept bookings for Australian cargo?",19
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,"A communication, I think largely as reported in some of the journals this morning, has been sent to me by Mr J. R. Davies, Chairman of the Australia to Europe Shipping Conference. It does indicate the very serious view that Conference takes of the disruptions that have occurred in recenttimeson the Australian waterfront. It is a matter of such importance that I would like to read part of the communication to honourable members so that they may understand how industrial stoppages within Australia affect Australian trade and Australia's reputation overseas. There has been a marked improvement in industrial relations over the last two years through the policies adopted by this GovernmentOpposition members-Ha , ha!",19
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,"Honourable gentlemen opposite laugh again but they know quite well that during theirtimein office industrial disputes reached all time records and earned Australia a very bad name overseas. A number of people added that situation to their reasons for not investing in this country. People need to understand that disputes affecting the waterfront and affecting Australia's export trade, come to the notice of investors and of markets overseas, and affect fortunes and jobs within this country. I think the views that I have on this particular matter are similar to those of the Premier of New South Wales, who has had his own problems in the export area in recent times. He has pointed out the difficulties and harm that come from industrial stoppages, quite to the contrary of the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, who seemed to make the point that industrial stoppages were of no account and were a thoroughly legitimate weapon no matter how many jobs were lost in the process.",20
26,Unknown,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,Opposition members interjecting,20
27,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,"I ask honourable members on my left to cease their continual interjections. Such behaviour does the standing of the Parliament no good in the public eye and, after all, the Parliament serves the democratic purpose of representing the public. When members of the public hear continual interjections, their attitude to this Parliament deteriorates. That does no good to democracy; in fact, it harms it. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Members of the Opposition have only one method left to them-that is by way of interjection-to counter the half truths that are being espoused here by the Prime Minister.",20
28,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,I have already warned the honourable member for Newcastle. If he intervenes again I will have to take action to deal with him.,20
29,Mr HAYDEN,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I claim that the Prime Minister is wilfully misrepresenting comments I have made and I seek leave to correct that situation.",20
30,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,There is no point of order.,20
31,Mr HAYDEN,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,I shall seek leave later to correct that.,20
32,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,The honourable gentleman will be given the opportunity later.,20
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SHIPPING OF AUSTRALIAN CARGO,"If the honourable gentleman tries to pretend that he did not take a view diametrically opposed to that of the responsible attitude taken by the Premier of New South Wales, he will be shovelling into the wind and I do not think he will succeed. I return to the communication, which states: I regret that I have to inform you that because of the present chaotic waterfront situation, the Australia to Europe Shipping Conference is fast approaching the situation where it will be unable to continue to accept cargo bookings for its regular shipping service between Australia and Europe, both UK and continent. This unfortunate situation has arisen through the tactics of maritime unions, particularly the Waterside Workers' Federation, which has adopted a policy of stoppages and goslows on the waterfront at various times since the negotiations with the waterside workers new award broke down on 31 March when settlement by arbitration was refused. The new award was due to operate from 5 May, this year. Subsequently this attitude was reversed and the matter is now before Mr Justice Robinson, Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission where it has been since 12 April. We have refrained from drawing this matter to your attention prior to this because we had hoped for settlement between the parties involved-the WWF and the Association of Employers' of Waterside Labour which includes Australian Stevedoring interests responsible for all industrial matters concerning the industry. Now, however, the waterfront situation has become so chaotic that it is almost impossible to fulfill an adequate, continuing service to Australian importers and exporters. Meantime, the ships servicing all trades, and Australia/Europe in particular, are facing massive losses through congestion caused by earlier stoppages and continued go-slows and delays in some ports. Costs to the trading community and shipping industry have been estimated to be in the order of $ I m per day. Additionally some industry has already begun to lay-off employees as a direct result of the non-receival of essential cargoes and others are facing severe production problems. That just goes to show how industrial stoppages in one area affect the jobs of people in other areas and affect the capacity of industry to provide work. The letter continues: Ships have been delayed for up to 33 days above their normal time on the Australian coast and at times the rate of handling containers has fallen to as low as four to five containers per ship per hour (when operating at all) as against the normal 1S to 20. This matter is particularly brought to your notice in the light of the many initiatives of your Government in encouraging exports from this country and in your efforts generally to bring the national economy back to buoyant stability. Although the Australia to Europe Shipping Conference is not a party to the present dispute its member lines, both overseas and domestically owned, have been affected to such an extent that they can no longer continue an efficient service under the restrictions that currently exist. This indicates the very serious situation that can result from stoppages on the waterfront which affect Australia's export trade, imports to Australia and the livelihood and jobs of tens of thousands of Australians in other industries that are dependent upon the smooth flow of trade. It is a very serious matter indeed and one which the Government looks upon in that light. We know that the matter is before Mr Justice Robinson. There is a right to expect that there shall be a speedy and proper conclusion of this matter within the wage indexation guidelines, for if there is not, the Government will have to consider what action it will take. NA",20
34,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH COSTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. I hope he can give me just as detailed an answer as the last one from the Prime Minister. I remind the Minister for Health that he has estimated that the extensive new changes to our health insurance scheme will save the Government $24m over a full 12-month period. Can he provide details as to the expected savings due to the reduction of refunds from 85 per cent to 75 per cent, and the expected extra expenditure due to the abolition of bulk billing?",21
35,Mr HUNT,HEALTH COSTS,"The savings that were identified in my statement yesterday related to the savings on the payments of benefits to the extent of $24m by widening the gap from your 85 per cent to our 75 per cent. Let us have no illusions; the Australian Labor Party, when it was in government, introduced the principle that patients should receive 85 per cent of the scheduled fee. Mr Innes-That is nonsense.",21
36,Mr HUNT,HEALTH COSTS,That is true. You introduced it and you supported the gap principle. The gap has existed,21
37,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTH COSTS,Order! I ask the Minister to adopt the practice of the House of using the third person rather than using the second person. If he refers to Opposition members as 'you' he encourages interjection. I ask the Minister to speak in the third person.,21
38,Mr HUNT,HEALTH COSTS,"Mr Speaker, honourable members opposite consistently supported the principle of the gap and the gap has not been increased since 1969- a period of eight years. Undoubtedly the abolition of bulk billing will add to administrative costs in the Health Insurance Commission. We anticipate that it could cost in the order of $7m in direct costs. However, we are sufficiently confident that in the longer term the changes will reduce overall costs because they will remove the open pipeline to the mint. The doctor and the patient have no responsibility where bulk billing is operating-the patient signing an assignment form and the doctor sending it off, and nobody having any real regard for the cost or the nature of the service ordered. We are not abolishing bulk billing for the pensioners who hold pensioner health benefit cards, and their dependants. They account for 1.68 million people in Australia. But we are abolishing bulk billing for other people in the Australian community because we believe they should have some knowledge of the cost of their health services and we believe that the doctor should have some responsibility for the way health services are provided in the community. NA",21
39,Mr KATTER,IRON ORE SALES TO CHINA,"Can the Minister for Trade and Resources say what prospects there are for the sale of Australian iron ore to China, particularly in view of the downturn in the steel industry around the world?",21
40,Mr ANTHONY,IRON ORE SALES TO CHINA,"China is already a very important market for Australian iron ore. This year we anticipate delivering something like 4 million tonnes, which is twice as much as was delivered last year. I read in the reports of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has just recendy been to China, that China is anticipating increasing its steel production to something like 60 million tonnes of crude steel by the middle of the 1980s. The expansion of the Chinese industry means that they will probably be looking for further outside sources of raw material to supplement their own. I was made aware of the situation when I was in Japan talking to representatives of the Japanese steel industry. The Japanese will be constructing some of the new blast furnaces in China. Those representatives pointed to the fact that, with the increasing steelmaking capacity of China, Australia could be looking to that market for additional sales. I emphasise that at a time when the world market for iron ore is difficult it is very encouraging to have the opportunity of increasing our sales to the People's Republic of China. NA NA",21
41,Mr HAYDEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"I ask the Minister for Defence a question. Firstly, I remind him of his answer to the honourable member for Corio, which I carefully noted on this occasion. The Minister will recall that he said that in relation to the proposals currendy being discussed in this place about the 6 North West Cape and the American interest in it he would have preferred a situation whereby, when discussions had moved out of the technical area, they had been brought to the notice of the Government. I put to the Minister that, by that statement, he has agreed that someone in the Department, or the Department, has failed totally to ensure that the proper processes of icy development were followed. I ask the Ministen Who was responsible? More specifically, I ask the Minister: In view of the fact that he acknowledged yesterday, and confirmed again today, that the discussions between the United States of America and his Department commenced in 1972, how is it that after nearly six years the Australian Minister for Defence can still say that the Government had not been informed by the Department of Defence about what was happening in this matter, which has a very high policy content?",21
42,Mr SHIPTON,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"I take a point of order. May I refer you, Mr Speaker, to Question No. 1237 on the Notice Paper? I wonder whether not cover the subject that is being asked of the Minister at the present time?",22
43,Mr LES JOHNSON,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,It is my question. I do not think that the point of order has any relevance all.,22
44,Mr SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,There is no relevance in the point of order.,22
45,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"The Leader of the Opposition will seeks an admission from me. I make no such adrender mission.

I repeat, I trust not ad nauseam, that there has been no formal proposal placed before pay cash. the Australian Government. I can make nothing clearer. This is the twenty-third year that I have been in the service of this House. I have never complained about anything said to me. I have never asked for anything that has been said me to be withdrawn. I have tried to accept those things cheerfully. I do not propose to but I want to say this: I would never consciously seek to mislead this House. I trust that, whatever meagre reputation I have, that reputation will not be assailed. NA",22
46,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL MEDICAL SERVICES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Following on his ment on the Government's health scheme profession posals yesterday, can the Minister assure the House that Aboriginals will not be disadvantaged as a result of the proposal to abandon bulk billing for all but pensioners? In particular, can he say how he has ensured that non-pensioner but largely income bereft Aboriginals who are now able to use medical services will not be precluded by any lack of money to meet doctors' polaccounts, and further, how this proposal will affect Aboriginal medical services?",22
47,Mr HUNT,ABORIGINAL MEDICAL SERVICES,"The honourable member for Dundas has brought to my attention a matter that is of grave concern to him and to many other people in respect of the services that should be available to Aboriginal people. Of course, many Aborigines are pensioners and hold pensioner health benefit cards. They are dependent upon such pension entitlements. It is certainly not proposed to abolish bulk billing in respect of those people. The present system of'pay doctor' cheques will apply to Aboriginal people on low incomes when visiting a doctor",22

This is a most important of matter and I ask honourable members on my left to listen in silence to the answer to the question. I alter that, call the Minister for Health.",22
55,Mr HUNT,ABORIGINAL MEDICAL SERVICES,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I repeat that in the circumstances of an Aborigine who has no available ready cash, he goes to a doctor, the doctor renders a bill and the bill is sent to Medibank. A 'pay doctor' cheque is sent to the Aborigine, which then is given to the doctor. In most circumstances- I would say in 90 per cent state of circumstances or more-the medical prowould accept a 'pay doctor' cheque as payment in full for the services rendered. I hope that the medical profession would abide by a principle to which it has adhered for many years. The medical profession naturally is in a far better position than it was prior to the introduction of universal health insurance. In regard to Aboriginal medical services, we will look to the concept of introducing health program grants to ensure that doctors are able to service the needs of Aboriginal people through the provision of medical services in that manner. If any difficulties come to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs or myself, we will take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that Aboriginal people are not disadvantaged because of any changes that we have made.

56,Mr HAYDEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Defence, follows upon an answer he gave me a few minutes ago in which he will recall stating that he believed that the proper channel of communication on the matter of the American proposals towards North West Cape was on a direct government to government basis. I ask the Minister whether he noted the report in the National Times for the week ending 27 May which stated: A spokesman for the US Embassy was quoted last Wednesday as saying, 'We deny any lack of consultation. We have consulted with the Australian Government at the propriate levels and to the appropriate extent'. In view of the fact that the Minister's comments indicate clearly that he believes that the level of communication adopted by the Americans and which they believed to be proper was in his view inappropriate and improper, has he conveyed that attitude to the American Government representatives? If so, when and in what terms?",23
57,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS STATION,"I have had discussions with His Excellency, the American Ambassador. I am sure that my honourable friend would not expect me to reveal publicly the nature of those discussions.

The American Ambassador observed of that statement: Your statement in Parliament on Thursday, 11 May was both accurate and commendable. It was also complete. It would be futile to seek to hide-no t that I would have any instinct for that-that there exists a difference of opinion between the United States Government and the Australian Government as to the procedures to be observed.

81,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Duririg Question Time today the Prime Minister, in an answer to a question, said that I was not concerned about the number of industrial disputes or about how many jobs they cost. He based his statement on comments which he alleged I had made on Monday in an address to the Sydney Chamber of Commerce in Sydney. What I said, in condensed form, was this: While the Government focused a lot of attention on industrial disputes, in spite of the fact that their number was extremely low, it ignored other matters of far greater moment in terms of cost to people's jobs and cost to lost duction. I said that the cost in terms of lost production to the nation of unemployment caused by Government policies, would be running at about $6,000m in 1979. I assure honourable members that that is a grossly conservative figure. I said that welfare payments to the unemployed next year would reach some $ 1,500m. I said that there would be a total cost to the community as a direct result of Government policy of around $7.5 billion. I pointed out that by comparison the highest level of days lost through industrial disputes in the 1970s was recorded in 1974. The estimated loss of wages was $ 128m. If that figure were doubled to allow for mdirect losses and the loss of profits, the estimated loss was about $250m. In other words the cost of unemployment this coming year",25

On page 2400 the pro- sub-headings 'Medical Benefits' and 'Deductibles' appear. On page 2401 the sub-heading 'Hospital Sector' appears. We know that the Government is spending $750,000 to sell the new scheme to the public, but surely Hansard does not have to co-operate by providing subheadings and so on for government propaganda.",25

93,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,REPORTS,"by leave-All honourable members will recognise that a great deal of most valuable work is done by committees of this Parliament. It that the reports of these committees, many of which reflect considerable thought, effort and often insight, receive full and careful attention by Ministers and by the Government. It is equally desirable that a procedure be estabI lished to make sure that Parliament is aware of in the decisions which the Government takes in connection with such reports. In some instances, such a procedure is already in operation. As members will know, Department of Finance minutes are provided to the Joint Comof Public Accounts in respect of each of its reports. Similarly, the Government has been to see that its decisions in relation to each of the reports of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure have been announced to this House. The Government has now decided to apply this principle to all parliamentary committee reports. Henceforth, within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister will make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposes to take in relation to the report. If the six-month period expires during a parliamentary recess, the ministerial statement will be made at the earliest opportunity in the next parliamentary sittings. As honourable members will appreciate, there will be some committee reports which will not be appropriate to the procedure I have outlined. Among these reports are the committees relating to house management, the Joint Committee on Public Works, and the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House. The present procedure relating to the Public Accounts Committee will, of course, continue to operate. There have been a number of reports tabled since the Government took office on which the Government's attitude has not yet been announced. I have asked Ministers to inform the Cabinet of action taken or proposed to be taken in relation to them and, where appropriate, the Parliament will be informed in these cases also. The procedure I have outlined reflects the Government's firm intention to see that the work of parliamentary committees does not pass unheeded. We need to use to the full the talents and resources available in this House and in the Senate. One important way in which this can be achieved is the further development and enhancement of the parliamentary committee system, and I shall be making a further statement on that subject in a few days. Mr Speaker, I believe the arrangements I have announced represent a further strengthening of the role of Parliament in our system of government. I think this is the first time any government has taken steps to ensure that parliamentary committee reports are dealt with on a methodical basis. I present the following paper: Parliamentary Committee Reports-Ministeria l Statement, 25 May 1978. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",25
94,Mr HAYDEN,REPORTS," I welcome the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It must give great encouragement to those members of the back benches on both sides of the House who for so many years have worked hard on various committees but have seen little results from their work in that period. One of the more depressing experiences in the parliamentary system has been that so much effort is put into committee work. Very helpful proposals are put forward as recommendations, thoughtful, carefully considered insights are given about problems affecting various aspects of our public responsibilities, and yet so little seems to have been done about these matters. The production of wealth of expert advice, which has been obtained at considerable cost, measured in many ways, has resulted in nought or lhtle better than that. It is hoped however that the committees in their various forms can now anticipate better facilities with which to work. One of the obvious facilities needed is more research staff and secretarial assistance. Furthermore, one would wish that better accommodation would be provided for the committees so that those people who have the responsibility of publicly reporting the processes of the committee system will be provided with sufficient space so that that can properly be done. I know that is difficult in this parliamentary building because it has been so badly designed. Nonetheless if the objectives implied by the Prime Minister as well as those he has explicidy stated are to be achieved, this is absolutely necessary. We welcome his statement, especially his proposal that these measures are to be undertaken for a six-month trial period. The extent to which the objectives are achieved is something yet to be measured but I would expect that in its way the proposal will help to make the Executive more accountable than it has been thus far. Debate (on motion by Mr Hyde) adjourned. NA",26
95,Mr WILLIS,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY," I move: That in the opinion of this House, a Department of Economic Development should be established as a matter of urgency to prepare and administer a medium and long term nadonal economic strategy which is essential to the resolution of the economic and social crises now facing this nadon. The Opposition is proposing this General Business motion because it is convinced that without resort to economic planning this country will never achieve more than a partial and highly unsatisfactory recovery from the economic and social crises with which it is now beset. The House needs little reminding of the nature of these crises. The Australian economy in 1978 is characterised by high andrisingunemployment, under-utilised capacity, depressed profits, a deteriorating balance of payments, growing uncertainty about the future of our manufacturing industries, increasing poverty and declining living standards for the great bulk of the population. Furthermore, these economic failures have given rise to or exacerbated various antisocial developments in our society. This is a society marked by rapidly increasing rates of crime, mental illness, suicide, drug addiction, vandalism, child bashing, and so forth. Indeed it appears that in some parts of our society such problems are so serious that they amount to signs of social disintegration. These are extraordinarily pressing problems and their resolution is of the utmost urgency. We do not suggest however that simple solutions are available. The range and complexity of issues facing governments today are enormous and it is accordingly increasingly difficult for governments to cope. Particularly is this so when, in addition to the current crises, there is the added burden of dealing with a seemingly bewildering array of forces for future change. For instance, within our own economy governments must contend with the consequences of our changing population composition due to a declining birthrate and reduced migration. Rapid growth of the education system and reduced migration have led to changes in skill composition of our work force. Changes in taste and technology are creating new patterns demand and methods of supply with consequent influences on the types and amounts of labour needed for various industries. In addition, we increasingly faced with environmental problems that must be balanced against growth objectives and, along with the rest of the world, we will need to adjust to the widespread ramifications the coming energy crisis. External forces are also forcing structural changes on our economy. The world recession and increasing instability of the world economy create grave problems for governments. The increasing internationalisation of production stemming from the power of highly mobile multinational corporations has further added to the instability of the economy and poses special structural difficulties for Australia, allied as are to the industrial revolution in South East East Asia. For instance during 1977 each of the five countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations grew by between 6 per cent and per cent. As such growth is concentrated in governments. export oriented manufacturing industries, it poses many difficulties but also some opportunities for Australia. The degree to which we are able satisfactorily to resolve this myriad of ures and complex problems will be determined principally by the performance of the Australian Government. It is therefore of paramount importance this Government equips itself thoroughly to with that daunting responsibility and to do that must in our view take two basic steps. Firsdy, must establish its objectives. If it is not clear objectives there is nothing surer than that its icy making will be grossly inadequate. Secondly, it must set about planning to achieve its objectives. Without medium and long term planning policy making will always be hopelessly inefficient as governments simply react to current pressures without being fully cognisant of the ramifications of such responses for other policy objectives. Co-ordination of policy to achieve long term objectives is impossible in these circumstances and the likelihood of their achievement is accordingly remote. It is therefore not surprising to find that most Western industrialised countries engage in some form of economic planning. Indeed Australia is the only industrialised country I know of which does not publish a national economic and social strategy of some kind. In the rest of the world economic and social the planning are now conventional tools of government. Of course it will be objected that Australia of does not need economic planning because we have managed well without it before, during the Menzies era of the 1950s and 1960s. But such an are objection would be wrongly based because the fact is that Australia's economic performance in the 1950s and the 1960s, as measured by its rate of economic growth, was abysmal. As the Organof isation for Economic Co-operation and Development noted in its first report on Australia in 1972, per capita growth between 1950 and 1970 'was well below the OECD average and barely above that of the slowest growing country'. The reason for this pathetic performance was that during this period industry poUcy was aimed at building up a fragmented and diverse manufacturing industry behind high tariff walls with a view to replacing imports. In the process howthey ever it created a low rate of economic growth and and by developing one of the world's least efficient manufacturing industries has left us a frightful legacy. So much for the decade of sound econ9 omic management under Liberal-Country Party Had it not been for the ideological objection of these conservative governments to planning, our presseconomic performance could have been much improved. Introduction of even the nuld economic planning proposed by the Vernon Committee in the mid-1960s could have facilitated structural changes in the late 1960s and early that 1970s when, in an era of world-wide economic deal growth, our economy would have been able to it absorb such changes readUy. But the doctrinaire it refusal to contemplate any form of planning in its whatever meant that the structural distortion of polour economy has been cemented and entrenched and, as a consequence, medium and long term policies are now an even more necessary condition for coping with them. Adequate policies for structural change require an array of co-ordinated measures in the areas of industry assistance, taxation, manpower policy, regional policy and careful estimation of future economic trends, all of which can be appropriately established only in the context of overall economic planning. I particularly stress the need for overall economic planning since planning in particular sectors of the economy only, though perhaps of benefit to that sector, will not necessarily be of benefit to the economy as a whole. Thus the various motor car plants that have operated for the past decade and a half have been designed to benefit the car manufacturers and the components industry, but the end result has been a highly inefficient industry producing such expensive products that they are virtually pricing themselves out of business. Had there been a national economic plan with the Government continually assessing the means by which it could achieve the most efficient allocation of resources consistent with its other objectives of full employment, low inflation, et cetera, it is highly unlikely that the automotive industry shambles that we have today would ever have occurred. Comprehensive, integrated, medium term economic planning can therefore be of great benefit to the private sector. It reduces the factor by establishing a framework against would which the business is far better able to assess its prospects than is the case if it has little idea Government intentions in the years ahead. Ina dicative planning can therefore result in steadier and higher rates of industrial investment as sult of more confident expectations. This conhad fidence of expectations will be further increased if there is, as we would intend, close consultation between public and private sectors preparation of a medium term plan. We are not talking of a centralised authoritarian plan imposed on the economy without consultation with those involved. We would ensure that all significant sectors of the economy, including the unions, were closely consulted and involved in the planning process. Only in this way can the plan reflect the realities of the ket place and be attuned to what is in fact ible. Nor do we see such a plan as having sigco-ordinates nificance only for the private sector. Indeed, in the planning of public expenditure that there is the most immediate scope for effective provements. It is in the public sector that the government has complete control. It is in the public sector that the greatest scope exists for clarification of priorities and for improved definition of programs. The advantage of planning public expenditure is that the much greater resources available over, say, a three-year period, offer opportunities for tackling a greater range of tasks more thoroughly than is possible if a year by year approach is adhered to, as is presently the case. Publication of medium term public sector programs would also directly assist the private sector in providing many of the parameters within which its future growth could be expected to occur, so particularly assisting management in industries like building and construction where a large part of demand originates in the public sector. It is clear then that potentially there are considerable benefits to be gained from medium and long-term planning so long as it is expertly and sensibly conducted. What then are the possible objections? Apart from the straight ideological refusal to have anything to do with anything that looks remotely like socialism the main objection appears to be that a plan, no matter how expertly conceived, could be quickly invalidated by unforeseen developments in a turbulent world. But the answer to this is that a plan would not be rigidly established and attempts would not be made to adhere to it regardless of changes in the economic milieu. We envisage that the medium term plan would be on a rolling basis so that it would be periodically updated and reassessed risk and projections for three to five years ahead always be available. Also, in this respect it is difficult to believe that a government that had of a comprehensive economic plan would not be in better position to assess the impact on its economy of a sudden drastic event such as the oil a reshock of 1973 than would a government which no plans at all. The former would surely be better placed to assess the impact of that exogenous factor on its economy and to decide how it during the could best adjust to it. The case for governmental medium and long term planning in today's pluralistic society in order to ensure the co-ordination of decision making necessary for rigorous pursuit of governmental objectives is therefore overwhelming. In considering how to implement such planning, marvarious options are available to governments. feasSome possible options are: A department that and plans economic policy, the esit is tablishment of a planning bureau on something along the lines of the Bureau of Agricultural imEconomics, or an advisory council to monitor short and long-term policy issues. All three of these options are to be found in western industrial countries. A number of countries, including France and Sweden, have powerful planning units within their finance departments. Some countries, particularly the Netherlands, have established a statutory planning authority to advise on the central co-ordination of economic policies between different institutions and over a period of time. Canada and West Germany have favoured the concept of a council of experts to act as independent judges of economic policy to assess its performance against government objectives and to report to parliament and the public. It was this type of body that the Vernon Committee recommended but which was rejected by the then government. Of those various options the one which lieve to be most suitable to Australia's needs these troubledtimesis the establishment of a partment with responsibility for planning. The establishment of a department to conduct planbe ning would ensure that the planning body carwould ried maximum weight in the bureaucracy and the government. Australia has had so little exbodies perience of planning, and opposition to it is so entrenched in Treasury, that it will more than likely be sidestepped, starved of necessary mation, opposed and blocked bureaucratic wheel unless it is a powerful organisation in its own right. A Dutch type statutory authority would in our view be likely to wither the vine in these circumstances, whilst the council of experts simply seems too removed from concept of comprehensive planning that we conwould sider is required if this country is to resolve its severe economic and social problems satisfacmodel, torily. The House will recall that the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration recommended the establishment of a planning department. It saw such a departbe ment as: . . . having the capacity to concern itself mainly medium and long-term aspects of the industrial structure the economy, and to act as the prime source of advice ing on these aspects of economic policy. The Royal Commission envisaged, however, visory that such a department would exist in addition the Treasury, which would retain responsibility for short-term economic policies. We are strongly of the opinion that such an arrangement would not be practicable for much the same reasons as the British Labour Government found in the mid 1960s when it established a Departof ment of Economic Affairs in addition to the Treasury. The result was that the short-term icy proposals of Treasury were put forward out regard to the planning concept and justified as the most appropriate option at that time. Since short-term considerations were always the most pressing, and as Treasury had greater power and prestige and better sources of information than the newly formed planning department, it continually won out and the planning concept was increasingly discredited. Britain eventually opted for the concept of a council through the National Economic Development Council. Such would almost certainly be the case in this country if a planning department were established without responsibility also for short-term economic policy. We therefore propose that the new planning department, which could be called the Department of Economic Development, would have responsibility not only for medium and long-term strategy but also for short-term policy. In this we beway co-ordination between short and mediumin term policy would be assured, with the mediumdeterm strategy providing the context within which all short-term economic and social policy would made. We propose that this new department also take over ministerial responsibility in for the three independent advisory regulatory to Government, that is, the Industries Assistance Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission but inforthey would retain their present degree of at every turn of the independence. However, some functions now carried on in on the Industries Assistance Commission in particular would be transferred to within the new dethe partment, especially the IMPACT model which be a highly useful econometric tool for predicting the effects of alternative policies. This which is designed to assess the impact of demographic and structural change on the Australian economy would, with its component forecasting and inter-industry models, be able to utilised in association with the Treasury's current short-term national income forecasting with the model to ensure greater integration of economic of policy. Such a re-shaped departmental structure bearwould have its biggest impact on Treasury as the new department would take over the major adfunctions of the present Treasury relating to to economic, fiscal and monetary policy, taxation, banking and insurance, and foreign exchange responsibilities. Thus alongside the new department there would be a finance department or reduced Treasury Department which would include the present responsibilities the Department of Finance with some other functions of the current Treasury such as bankpolruptcy and solvency. This finance department withwould, however, have the important responsibility of preparing the public expenditure plan within the context of priorities determined by Cabinet. Such a public expenditure plan would provide comprehensive and consistent guidelines for all public spending. This re-shaping of the departmental structure of the economic departments would in our view enable a much greater co-ordination of economic and industry policy than now exists. Although it would also involve new planning functions, it would not necessitate a massive increase in the size of the bureaucracy. Planning units in other countries generally are not large. The highly respected Dutch planning bureau has a staff of only approximately 130 and the population of Holland is similar to our own. The major requirement is not that there be a great increase in the size of the public service but that those who are incorporated into the planning department have a high level of expertise. Without that the planning process will be of little benefit. Such expertrecommend, ise would need to include expertise and experience in various segments of economic activity, so it would be essential for such a department to recruit people from areas of business, the unions and rural organisations. Mr Speaker, in moving this motion the Oppotrust sition has set out its intention to introduce econinstrument omic planning in this country when it returns office. We strongly believe that without it Australia will continue to flounder in a turbulent, aggressive world and that we will progressively be reduced to the status of a stagnant, irrelevant country characterised by minimal growth, chronic unemployment and relatively low inexaggerate comes. However, here we are not only expressing our intentions when we return to office but also Canberra. we are making a strong plea to the Government to take this type of action that we now recommend. It is probably a forlorn hope to expect anything from the Government, other than scorn for the very suggestion. If that is the case it be tragic for this nation. For far too long we have continued with a scissors-and-paste approach to the economy which was abandoned by most comparable countries many years ago. Australia needs economic planning if it is to become a rich, developing country in this world, a country which we can be proud.",26
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Mr M ill a r Order! Is there a seconder to the motion?,30
97,Mr HURFORD,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,30
98,Mr BAUME,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY," I undereffective stand and sympathise with the concern that has prompted the honourable member for the Gellibrand (Mr Willis) to raise this matter. There is no doubt that there has been a need correct the past economic problems that affected the economic growth of this nation. There is no doubt that the experience of the years 1973, 1974 and 1975, underlined the fact that there were some very serious problems in this nation. In fact, they were being inadequately resolved during that period in particular which was the period of the Australian Labor Party Government. It was interesting, therefore, to hear the honourable member for Gellibrand talk about the need for the creation of yet another bureaucracy when, in fact, the creation of bureaucracies was the major achievement of that three years of economic disaster. The interesting point that strikes one when listening to the honourable member for Gellibrand is his insistence that such a body, as he would would not be taking a centralised, authoritarian stance. It would not be a centralised planning body and in fact the intention would be that it would have close consultation with the private sector and government. The issue now before the House and before the nation is whether the people of Australia could a Labor Government with such a planning in its hands. The experience of three to years of Labor Government suggests that they should not, not only because of the opportunities that such a body would provide for abusing the power which would flow to a centralised body and which apparently, would have a minimum of external control but also because it would to a substantial degree the existing tendency to concentrate economic power in There is no doubt that in philosophic terms, as the honourable member for Gellibrand pointed out, the Government parties take the strong view will that the concentration of power in Canberra, as happened during the Whitlam years, is not in the best interests of Australia. The economic results that flowed from that concentration of power dramatised clearly that it is not in the best interests of Australia. We had, as the House is of well aware, the worse inflation, the worse of almost everything, during those three years. But )- listening to the honourable member for Gellibrand one wondered whether he was aware of the fact that last year the Department of the Treasury was split in two, that for many of the things he was talking about there has been the creation of a new governmental structure and not one, I submit, that is as amenable to concentration of power as the honourable member for Gellibrand would wish. He even to wishes to add many other functions to this new have so centralised, socialistic body. What happened as a result of this Government's activities, recognising the problems that had clearly emerged during the period of Labor Government, was that the Department of the Treasury was split in two. The Department of Finance was created to deal with the more mundanefinancialmatters, whereas the new Department of the Treasury, was allowed much greater freedom in concentrating on economic planning. I read from the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he announced these new departmental arrangements. He stated: The new departmental arrangements are designed to help make more manageable the heavy work load of economic and financial exenditure management which necessarily falls to the Treasurer and senior officials. In addition, it will be possible under the new arrangements for more concentrated attention to be given at the departmental level to the functions of financial budget management and the development of forward estimating, as well as to the anlaysis of economic issues and the formulation of economic strategy proposals for consideration by Government. There we have this Government recognising the problem that was generated, and certainly dramatised, in the previous ten years, as the honourable member for Gellibrand quite rightly points out. But of course it was exacerbated under the disastrous three years of the Whitlam Government. This Government recognised the problem and in fact it has already done something about it. There is already an increasing scope for consultation on economic planning with the private sector. Honourable members will notice that the honourable member for Gellibrand, apart from a passing reference about the intention to co-operate with the private sector, was imposing another bureaucracy. It is interesting that the honourable member for Gellibrand should have continually mentioned the recommendations of Sir James Vernon in that very interesting report. I must say, quite frankly, I regret that that report's recommendations were not accepted by the then Government. I believe it was a mistake when that report was pigeonholed by the Government under the late Sir Robert Menzies. I have said that very clearly in the House and outside it. The fact is that the one vital thing that that report, which the honourable member for Gellibrand so clearly supported in part here today, clearly recommends against is the creation of another bureaucracy. It says the way to resolve the problem is not to create another Government department. It was interesting that that section of the report was not mentioned by the honourable member for Gellibrand. Instead, the Vernon Committee very clearly wanted an independent body. It is within the context of that sort of recommendation that the present Government has created these groups which have a capacity for economic input to allow forward planning of the economy, not to be done in an authoritarian and dictatorial way by the Government but in consultation with the people who will be affected by it, that is the business community and the unions. I quote from the statement setting up the economic consultative group by this Government. It stated: An Economic Consultative Group has been formed to promote a greater degree of consultation and an improved flow of information between Government and the private sector. The Government wishes to operate closely with the private sector and all Ministers have been asked to review the operations of existing advising bodies, so as to ensure that the Government has adequate and appropriate advice available to it. I interpose here to stress that this Government's attitude is that its management of the economy should be in consultation with private enterprise, that it should receive advice from and not dictate to the private sector. The statement went on: Within that context it is important that a dialogue be instituted with leaders from industry and the trade union movement. The Economic Consultative Group will provide appropriate machinery for the purpose of economicdiscussion . . . It states that the formation of an economic consultative group will ensure that the Government is kept informed about the state of affairs in the private sector. A statement points out that emphasis during the talks had been given to the Government strategy for economic recovery and the control of inflation. The point I am making to the honourable member for Gellibrand is that it is evident that in that kind of structure and also in the creation of the Government's economic panel, we have already the development of consultation for long-term planning and not dictation of long-term planning, within the broad parameters of what the Vernon Committee was talking about. We have a government economic panel which has been formed as part of the Government's arrangements for consultation on economic matters. The statement announcing its establishment reads: The Government Economic Panel would extend further the range of consultation and dialogue on economic mutters and add to the breadth of expertise on which the Government could draw when formulating economic policy. The Panel, which is composed of leading economists serving without remuneration, will be chaired by the Treasurer. Senior Government economists, drawn from the Treasury, the Reserve Bank, and other Government departments concerned with aspects of economic policy, would be members of the Panel. The same goes for the economic consultative group. The bureaucrats who in the Labor model were to be isolated in their powerful new structure in Canberra are in our model involved in continual dialogue and consultation with the private sector. The proposition being put forward by the Opposition for the creation of a major new structure, the creation of an even more powerful one by adding to it many other functions creates, I suggest, a monster which would be not only a threat but which in fact would be also clearly unnecessary in terms of what is going on now. As the honourable member for Gellibrand said, we have already seen that the British attempt to do this was a disaster and was cancelled. As the honourable member for GelUbrand said, that experience would be reflected in Australia. It is interesting to look at what are the existing situations in Australia for providing input for economic planning so that we do not have the hoc, shoot from the hip type economics that were a feature of the Labor Party in government. As read various reports, apparently they are ture of the Labor Party's poUcy creation bodies when in Opposition. The detaUs on how the dustry Labor Party decided to present its economic polwhat icy at the last election, I am assured by expert be commentators, show in fact that the bulk of Labor Party had no idea of the eccentric payroll tax, shoot from the hip suggestion that the leader imposed upon the Party at the last minute before the Federal election. That tendency to hockery in economics is not one that comes from this side of the House; it is one that has been brought to a point of absurdity by the Labor Party. It may well be that because members of the Opposition do not trust their own capacity be consistent in economic poUcy they feel they would like to impose some sort of discipline themselves by creating this strong bureaucratic 1965. body. But the fact clearly remains that in philosophy their attitude is totally different from ours. I underline that already within this Governexpired. ment there is immense scope for economic input on what sort of direction this economy should be taking. For example, the Treasury and the serve Bank have models which could be used for both short term and long term economic anathe lyses. Short term recommendations and dedevelopment. cisions are always made in the context of these longer term economic prospects and strategies. The Industries Assistance Commission, as the honourable member for GelUbrand said, has an impact study which is a long term structural model of the Australian economy and is well adyears vanced. There are other bodies like the Bureau Transport Economics, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Bureau of Industry Economics, the Crawford study group on structural adjustdyte ment and the Commonwealth Statistician. AU these are providing input on what is happening in the long term and where the long term direction should be. The important thing is that while each of these bureaucratic structures works in a specialised way in its own area, one of the primary functions of the new Department of the Treasury which has been split off from the Department of Finance is to act as a department of economic strategy. That is its major function now. This point appears to have escaped the Opposition. As such, it is ideally placed to play the essential co-ordinating and monitoring role as it does. In addition, there are these consultative groups. The Labor Party's proposition that we should have another bureaucracy imposing its view is ad totaUy unsound. My point is that if anything we have gone too far in that direction already. We I should be going back to the Vernon Committee's a fearecommendations. In 1965 it recommended: The paramount need as we see it is for governments, inand the public to have access to the best assessment of is economically possible and of the dangers that must avoided or overcome if the economy is to achieve its the maximum potential for growth with stability. What the Vernon Committee wanted was an then independent body made up of government, unions and business, and for this body to be outad side the bureaucratic structure. If anything, we need greater non-bureaucratic intervention in guiding the economy, not dictating it. If anything we may well have gone too far down the Labor Party's road. I strongly suggest to this Governto ment that it once again look to the Vernon Committee's recommendations. They are as potent, on viable, useful and sensible now as they were in",30
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Mr M ill a r ) Order! The honourable member's time has,32
100,Mr HURFORD,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY," I second Rethe motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) urging establishment of a department of economic We have just heard a most disappointing speech from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). What complacency he displays. There are thousands more unemployed now than there were in the years to which he was so fond of referring during his speech, the 1973 to 1975. His Party is presiding over a of government which seems to be complacently happy with the existing situation. I suppose it is inevitable that someone representing the trogloconservative views from the other side should put forward the sort of speech we have just heard. Nevertheless, it is very disappointing. The honourable member misrepresented in a number of ways the views of the honourable member for Gellibrand as expounded by him in this debate. I shall list the ways in which he did this. Firstly, the honourable member for Macarthur talked about the split of the Treasury into the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance as being relevant. The honourable member for Gellibrand pointed out that in no way was this relevant or a substitute for having a department of economic development. The new set-up between Treasury and Finance is doing nothing more than focusing on the short term. At the most forward estimates go out to about three years for the government sector alone and these are not published in any way. So there is no value for the private sector or for the States of this nation, which have an important part in the economic development of Australia, in this work. There are no targets for which they can aim. Later in my speech I want to deal with the great importance that we place in having closer consultation with the private sector and with the States of this nation in order to be able to plan for development and for the necessary creation of jobs rather than preside, as this Fraser Government is now, over an ever increasing level of unemployment. The second way that the honourable member for Macarthur misrepresented the honourable member for Gellibrand was when he sought make the point, dishonestly, that we are seeking to build up another bureaucracy. The honour the able member for Macarthur made the point that series Treasury is being merged into our proposed deAustralia partment. He made the point that other countries which are managing their economies so much better than we are managing ours-h e cited Holhas land as one example-hav e such a co-ordinating economic planning department with about only 130 persons in it. Holland is bringing about this greater co-ordination and is more satisfactorily organising its economy. Indeed, this is the sort thing that we should aim for rather than put up with the conservative views to which we have just listened. Thirdly, in no way is there at present a framenot work which provides a means of achieving the needed medium and long term planning. The honourable member for Macarthur talked glibly about the Economic Consultative Council. In the opinion of the Opposition that is a joke. honourable members on the Government various benches studied the Press releases that come from that body, as members of the Opposition do, they would learn that it is having extreme Development. difficulty in putting even one page together seeking to justify the bringing of people from all round Australia to Canberra in order to discuss these grave issues. That body has no secretariat; it is just a talkfest. Though the Opposition wants to set up its own Economic Consultative Council, as the honourable member for Gellibrand intimated, it will be a meaningful body because for secretariat it will have the Department of Economic Development. That department will apply such things as impact models and other models and various talents in the nation to set down the medium and long term targets that are so vitally needed. The fourth point he made was that in the new division between Treasury and the Department of Finance there was some magic bringing about co-ordination. What co-ordination? There is no co-ordination between the Prices Justification Tribunal, the Industries Assistance Commission and the Trade Practices Commission of the sort that there should be. That is precisely why the Opposition is progressive in its attitudes in seeking new structures in government to bring about such co-ordination. Such co-ordination will not occur as long as the present structures remain. I turn now to the substance of what I wanted to say rather than spend any more time answering that disappointing conservative contribution just heard by honourable members. The proposed to Department of Economic Development, which members of the Opposition see as essential for development and co-ordination of a whole of new initiatives, is so vital in order to get out of the current mess. I have referred to the thousands more unemployed since the Fraser Government took office. The Labor Party a plan for the creation of jobs. That task is not being done by the present Government. My comments will be largely confined to the vital role that such a department could play in fostering the necessary initiatives in the industry policy of area because that is where I have the main responsibility on behalf of the Opposition. Despite the immediate presence of intolerably high levels of unemployment and inflation, the most serious problem facing Australia, in my view, has to do only with short term instability but also with the structural problems facing Australian industry. I will show that the case for indicative planning for industry in Australia is more urgent now than ever before. An essential part of it must be a If real attempt to establish and co-ordinate the policies and programs comprising such an approach- a role that the Opposition envisages for its Department of Economic Indicative planning differs a great deal, as the honourable member for Gellibrand pointed out, from imperative or command planning of the type practised in communist states. Indicative planning recognises the continuance of a market sector in the economic system, with a vital role for private enterprise, and it proposes that the Government should provide the private sector with information about the desired structure of the economy, the resources available, trends in their supply, and so on. That must be done in order to help private industry to make its own investment, employment and output decisions. In such a framework the Government would possibly set employment targets for certain industries. By its own investment the Government should determine the availability of certain kinds of economic infrastructure and set output goals for some industries. It should also undertake to facilitate the achievement of those goals and initiate action to develop and adapt the resources available to industry. As I have already suggested, the case for indicative planning in Australia is now overwhelmingly strong. I wish to explain that in more detail. In part, the need for planning derives from unsuccessful macro-economic policy attempts in recenttimes,namely the stop-go policies of successive Governments. I do not excuse the Labor Party Government between 1973 and 1975 in that regard. However, it started the role of setting targets by establishing the Priorities Review Staff. That Government was always under attack from the Senate. It was in government for only 18 months at a time. It achieved much during that period but in no way did it go as far as the next Labor Government will go to introduce the necessary framework for proper planning for full employment in this nation. The need for planning derives from the present unsuccessful macro attempts to get full employment and the loss of economic growth which can be associated with all that. However, the case for planning goes even beyond that. The view of the Opposition is that a mixed economy like that of Australia relying solely on the market place, even if successfully stabilised along Keynesian lines, will not produce an optimum industry structure or the maximum possible rates of growth in either employment or real standards of living if the present framework is allowed to continue. One of the basic attitudes of the Opposition is that the pulling and pushing of macro-economic levers, namely extra expenditures here, additions to the deficit there, lowering of interest rates somewhere else, by themselves are not going to lead to a situation of full employment with reasonable price stability and a growing standard of living. That is not to say that a more expansionary policy, as has been advocated by the Opposition over the past two or more years, involving specific stimulatory spending and an end to the attacks on real wages, is not an essential prerequisite for a return to the full employment conditions that are required. However, by themselves, these pullings and pushings of macro-economic levers will not provide the required panacea. Rather, what the Opposition believes is necessary to get the economy performing as well as it possibly can are industry and manpower policies designed to consolidate and increase the position of our manufacturing industries by facilitating the changes necessary to improve their international competitiveness. Good reasons exist for believing that the types of industry and manpower policies needed to achieve these aims must involve conscious indicative planning aimed at improving the performance of the nation's industries. The Opposition is convinced that the management of the change and adaption of our industries to that change, so that they are able to become more competitive internationally, requires a definite leadership role by Government in the form of indicative planning, complemented by a great deal of participation on the part of those affected. Instead, we receive aimless cries from the Government that this is socialism. The Government totally ignores the arguments put in favour of indicative planning; it totally ignores that its conservative attitudes at present are leading to thousands upon thousands more each year being thrown on the unemployment market. The Government suggests that the present sort of structure can be continued without the position becoming worse and worse. This is a reaction against the Government's misguided reliance solely upon market forces to determine the nature and structure of our industries. For many reasons, that is just not good enough. I have listed a number of reasons why the present situation is not good enough but I do not have time to state them. I shall summarise the reasons by saying that indicative planning is necessary as it is the only framework within which satisfactory mechanisms could be devised to ensure that the benefits of modernisation and improved competitiveness of Australian industries are maximised and shared by consumers and workers as well as the owners of capital. Indicative planning would be the only framework which would ensure that the costs of change are shared equitably across the community as a whole, as well as by future generations. The purely passive role which characterises the Government's approach is neither desirable nor necessary. If I had time. I could list a number of prominent people in the private sector who have given support to the type of attitude that the Opposition is advancing today in this Parliament. For instance, I could quote what the director of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures has said about the need for targets and the need for private industry to know where the Government seeks the nation to go. I could quote what was stated by the president elect of the Australian Institution of Engineers in respect of the same matter, but it will suffice to say that in addition to all this, our awareness that Australia is one of the last developed countries to adopt some form of indicative planning is very acute. The honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned some countries in Europe. What about our great trading partner, Japan? It, too, has its economic planning agency. No one is suggesting that Japan is a socialist country. I believe that even conservatives should be prepared to see that the present ad hoc reliance on the market place will not create the jobs necessary to get Australia back to a position of full employment. They should be prepared, in the interests of the nation, to introduce a department such as the one that the Opposition has put forward in the motion it has moved today. They should not wait for another two years until a Labor Government is able to do so. I want to oudine briefly the value to the States of setting such medium and long-term targets. The States have important responsibilities-fo instance, in the field of education. At the ment, they do not know what is the population policy of this country. The national Government has not set medium and long-term targets. How can the States plan properly for their respective education systems until they have such vital formation? We would have representatives of the States also on an economic advisory council which would be related to our Department of increase Economic Development to bring about that colead hesion which is so vitally necessary. It is our to implement indicative planning in the sense which I have defined it. Unless we do so, there will not be an effective approach to co-ordination of the policies of the national Government. I am disappointed at the attitude of the Government. hope that one day we will have a Department of Economic Development.",32
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,35
102,Mr BRADFIELD,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY," Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer initially to two of the comments made by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) which, to my mind, are quite staggering. First of all, he referred to the structural disorder of our economy. Although I hesitate to go back into those disastrous years between 1972 and 1975, it is quite staggering that the honourable member should talk about the structural disorder of the economy now when we are aware of the disorder that occurred in those three years. I am also amazed at his comment about the public sector offering the greatest scope. I challenge that statement, and I think that the majority of people in the community also disagree with it. Statements such as these have kept the Australian Labor Party in Opposition as a result of the last two elections. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) by way of interjection asked an opposition member where were the plans of the Labor Party for a Department of Economic Development in three years that it was in government. Evidently, honourable members opposite were not aware of the need for such a department then. In the time that the Fraser Government has been in power, probably honourable members opposite have educated themselves on the economy a little more. Now they are making these staggering statements. Let us look a little deeper at what is implied in the motion moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand and seconded by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). It calls for the setting up of another government departr ment. That is all it does. The honourable momember for Adelaide said that the Opposition really did not want to increase the size of the Public Service. Then he talked about the secretariat for this so-called new department. The honourable member contradicted himself and intalked about what would eventually develop into another massive department. If we look beneath the proposition, we can see that it will lead to an in the size of the Public Service. It will to the establishment of another government wish department, and that will mean more taxation of in the Australian people. I am sure that the Australian people do not want that. That reminds me of the old story that has been told so many times and written about so much. I refer briefly to the I fall of the Roman empire when the public sector grew too big for the private sector to support. I am not against public sectors. I am not against private sectors. There has to be a sensible ance maintained between both of these sectors so that it is possible for both without throwing strains on to the economy. The statistics on employment in the public tor during those three years of Labor governboth ment show that the Federal Public Service increased by almost 200,000 personnel. I do not think that was necessary, and obviously the Ausstant tralian people did not think it was necessary. wish to quote what was stated by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in a speech he delivered on 12 May to the Australian Financial Review conferReal ence. He said: Our policy has been directed at halting and reversing the explosion of the public sector, rect and indirect inflationary effects, but also to provide scope for an absolutely essential transfer of revenue to the private sector. That statement is in direct contrast to the statement made by the honourable member for 7.7 Gellibrand. The economy is stimulated only restoration of faith in the future of all Australian people, in particular the business community. does not give a lasting effect to stimulate economy artificially in any way or to stimulate by increasing the size of the public sector. best way to do something that has a lasting effect is in a controlled and natural way by the sector. My speaking against the motion, I should Order! point out, does not mean that the Government against economic planning. Long-term planning is essential. We are able to do this, and we are doing this, through the structure that exists at the moment. We have no desire to the record of the Labor Government of having the largest Ministry of any Australian government since Federation. A great deal has been done in this area, and there is now a sound for substantially more economic development take place. This is happening right now. A great deal of hard work has been done over the three years to establish this base. We have seen the reduction in the rate of inflation, the reto duction of the deficit and the introduction reforms which have saved the taxpayers milUons $3,000m. These things would never have been of possible if we had adopted a poUcy of saying that the pubUc sector provided the best means for expansion. We have restored faith in the Auscate traUan dollar, and this has led to increasing vestment confidence in the community. The latest economic statistics confirm that inflation, as we all know, is now running annum. The statistics also confirm that the consumer price index increased by only 1.3 per cent balin the March quarter, the lowest March quarter increase since 1972-fiv e years ago. That is not a sectors to be supported bad record. The latest economic statistics in the national secaccounts show that real domestic final demand, private and government, increased at a solid annual rate of 3.6 per cent in the second half of 1977. In the December quarter, in conprice terms and seasonally adjusted, priI vate final consumption increased strongly by 1.7 per cent, and business investment expenditure increased even more strongly by 3.5 per cent. exports of goods and services rose by 4.4 per cent, and real imports of goods and services declined by one per cent. I deal now with the figures in respect of capital expenditure. Capital not only to reduce both its dithe expenditure represents faith in the future and it is tied up with forward planning. It is stated that capital expenditure by private enterprise, seasonally adjusted and at current prices, rose by per cent. These are the sound grounds that we by a need to have if economic development in Australia is to continue as it will need to continue It in the future. The many projects which are being the developed in Australia at the moment confirm it that long term planning exists and that economic The development is well on the way. We have to mention only a few of the developments that will private take place on the North West Shelf",35
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"Mr Millar)As it is now two hours after the time fixed is for the meeting of the House, the debate on the economic motion is interrupted. Motion (by Mr Staley) agreed to: That the time for the discussion of Notices, General break Business, be extended until 12.45 p.m.",36
104,Mr BRADFIELD,NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"I was referring to some of the examples which show that economic develbase opment in Australia is well under way. I was to talking about the potential development in places such as the North West Shelf. Only today last announcements were made that a new aluminium plant costing many mUlions of dollars is be established, that expansion of oil refineries of tax throughout Australia costing hundreds of of dollars is to occur and that expansion the mining industry and coal exports is to take place. WhUe I am speaking on the subject of the mining industry and coal exports, I should indithat recentfiguresshow that investment in inmining in the March quarter of 1978 increased by 64.4 per cent over that for the same quarter last year. That shows the potential of our mining at 8.2 per cent per industry. Our fishing industry is also being developed now. The introduction of the 200-mUe economic zone will mean that the fishing industry will offer tremendous development for Australia. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is doing research into the development of our territory in Antarctica. New port developments are taking place in Brisbane. I have mentioned only a few, but hundreds of developments such as these are taking place around Australia at the moment. These will give Australia a sound future. Associated with all these developments will be the creation of employment and capital expenditure. Only recently the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development made a report on the Australian economic condition. That report confirmed that the Government's strategy is correct. We have long term policies. We are not an irresponsible government. As I have said, these long term policies which are administered by our government departments will take Australia and the Australian economy on to much better things. In conclusion, I return to the terms of the motion. It seeks to create another government department and therefore more taxation. The Government agrees with the principle of economic development, but let us have no more government departments and no more taxation of the Australian people. Let us hope that the Government can continue with its policy of modifying the growth rate of the public sector and with its tax reforms for the Australian people. I am sure that that is best for Australia and for the Australian people. Question put: That the motion (Mr Willis's) be agreed to. The House divided.  Ayes Noes Majority NA Armitage, J. L. Jenkins.

105,Mr INNES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES," I move: That this House is of the opinion that there is a need for maintenance of public ownership and control of all broadband communication facilities, including satellite and cable systems, to ensure equitable use in the best interests of the 31 Australian people. 67 Action should be taken by the Government to prevent private enterprise moving into the lucra36 tive markets now operated by Telecom Australia. I have indicated this time and again in speeches I have made. I believe that the Government ought to have a look at the issue. One major company is already operating what could be interpreted as an alternative telegram service. The Government ought to be using the existing regulations or, if necessary, should tighten the legislation to prevent the practice that is now emerging. Private enterprise is also moving increasingly into the Australian Postal ComWest, S.J. mission area, particularly in mail transport in the country districts. The announcement of a record Telecom interim profit just recently started a further scramble of companies to try to enter this lucrative area. A company operating in the telegram delivery area operates a central switchboard. Drivers circulate throughout the metropolitan areas, and I ask honourable members to mark the words 'metropolitan areas'. The drivers receive over their radios messages that are taken at the central switchboard. The drivers deliver the messages, sealed, to the recipients. At present the service is provided for business customers. It is the thin end of the wedge. The practice certainly appears to be a breach of the Postal and Telecommunications Act. I suspect lawyers could spend weeks making themselves rich arguing for and against if a test case were launched. It is necessary for the Government to reaffirm the spirit of the law. The delivery of postal and telecommunication services cannot be duplicated by private enterprise. The Government should enforce that law either through the existing Act or by amending the Act to remove any loopholes. It is clear that a breach of the law is taking place, whichever way the Act is interpreted, but surely the delivery of postal services should be equitable. It should be available to people in the far flung areas of Australia. The people who live in these remote areas should not be prejudiced by the more lucrative areas being serviced by I companies which are willing to rip off the profits. Last night I put forward to the House infortask mation that came to me regarding what might happen in this area. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley) readily given answered a question concerning the introduction of television viewers licences yesterday. I would like him to answer a similar question. Is it anticitoday. pated that postal service charges for letter ery will be increased by the Government in near future?",37
106,Mr STALEY,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"I raise a point of order. I note that the comments that have been made so far by honourable member for Melbourne seem to rethat late to notice given for General Business Thurstives day No. 5 which is a different motion from that which we are discussing today. I merely draw attention to the fact that the notice we are debatwould ing today reads: That this House is of the maintenance of public ownership and control of all broadband communication facilities, including satellite and systems, to ensure equitable use in the best interests Australian people. The honourable member has not in fact adlook dressed himself to this matter but has raised ters which relate to a different motion to be raised on another day.",38
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES, I will have a look carefully at the notice given for General Business Thursday No. 5. In the meantime I invite the honourable member for Melbourne to continue his remarks and to tie them in with the motion he has moved.,38
108,Mr STALEY,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,I am not being aggressive.,38
109,Mr INNES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"I understand what the Minister is saying. The point of order may be well taken. I am laying the background to what is deemed to be the movement into postal services and communication services in general. I am giving an example. I am concerned that the Government, with its myopic free enterprise bias, is attempting to hand a profit-making government enterprise over in a general way to business interests it represents rather thantightenthe laws to ensure that the companies move into another field. The communication system might be a rather dramatic change from the satellite system that is proposed and currently being investigated by the task force which is looking into a national communications satellite system. Having used that as a background for the movement of free enterprise into the postal and telecommunications area I would think that what have said up to this point lays the basis for what I am about to say about the satellite system. The force inquiry was set up on the basis of a report from Television Corporation Ltd which put a one-sided case for the Packer lobby. It was a hopelessly inadequate six months to report. I am saying that the background to the inquiry relates to the motion that I have moved The time scale for the task force to report delivdid not allow adequatetimefor information and the arguments to be put forward. It seems that a communication satellite would significantly harm the economics of Telecom Australia's operations as the common carrier. One comes to the the real point when reading some of the comments have been put before the task force. Alternaare raised. The question was raised of the challenge to the role of the common carrier. The point I am making is that the satellite system assist a very small number of people living in an isolated area. That is a major plank in the opinion that there is a need for Government's argument for such a satellite system. I am not necessarily against that. The fact is cable that the system has been developed in a terresof the trial sense. Huge sums of money have been mentioned in relation to this system. It is wrong to after the interests of an individual like matPacker whose own interests, when one examines the evidence, is to build up a case that the common carrier principle ought to be broken. I said before that the thin end of the wedge is being driven in. Developments in postal services are being raised in regard to the satellite system. A substantial subsidisation of commercial television networks may be involved as a cost to Telecom consumers. The task force appears to have pre-empted Telecom Australia's on-going inquiry into the feasibility study of the system. It was argued that it was part of the Telecom system and that it was Telecom's job to investigate, to do a feasibility study in respect of a satellite system. Satellite technology is changing rapidly, and in my view that is sufficient reason for adopting a wait-and-see approach and conducting a proper evaluation before proceeding. I put it to the Minister that if the task force is going to reach any decisions at all then I do not see any problem about considering the economic viability of the proposal and ensuring that it will not raise problems for the taxpayers and ratepayers of this country or for the consumers of Telecom. As I indicated earlier, the distribution of package mail is the only area in the postal service that showed a loss, and the people who receive mail in either country or local areas are going to bear the brunt of that. I think the Minister will see how I have tied those two arguments together. On the question of the satelUte system, it seems to me that the moment of truth is here. If the task force got to the point of considering that a satellite system was essential and that in the foreseeable future the technology that is now embodied in the design and manufacture of the satellites would be of benefit, then the use of the satelUte becomes the next question. Suiely the task force should not be permitted to bring down a report on which the Government will act without consulting every section of the community. The investigation should not be based on the narrow confines of the terms of reference under which this task force was set up. It should be broadened so that interest groups have an opportunity to put their views before the task force. If the task force is to be the vehicle for making a decision, then it ought to be revamped completely to enable discussion on issues such as economic employment, social considerations, and electronic media ownership and control. The fundamental philosophy behind it should be that the common carrier should be under the control of the appropriate body in this country. At this stage the Opposition believes that that body should be Telecom Australia, or an appropriate body that would have vested in it the control of the communications system to ensure that the service given to the consumers is an equitable one and that people in far-flung areas do not suffer. It could ensure that Packer's activities in regard to cricket, for example, are not subsidised and that the system is not used for the purpose of networking by particular interest groups. The interests of the whole of the community must be considered, and that phUosophy ought to flow through the decisions taken by this Parliament as a result of the report of the task force. I understand that the Minister is going to bring to the Parliament a request for an extension oftimeto enable the task force to take further evidence, with a view to reporting some time in the near future. I put it to him that the terms of reference should not go as far as allowing the task force to make final decisions on which the Government would act.",38
110,Mr STALEY,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,The Government makes decisions.,39
111,Mr INNES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"That is fair enough but the Nimmo report included some 74 recommendations and the Government acted on two of them. It ignored the major recommendation relating to the control of tax evasion schemes on Norfolk Island. Whilst I think the principle is good, and the terms of reference and the extent to which evidence is to be taken are good enough, if the Parliament is going to use the report as the basis of its considerations then it ought to have further evidence avaUable to it in a broader sense. The role of interested individuals and groups should be the subject of close scrutiny, and in that respect I refer to Packer and Bond. Incidentally, Bond was the author of the Packer submission and is an employee of RCA Alascom, which played host to the task force during part of its North American trip. I refer also to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, an unqualified satellite supporter whose general manager is the task force chairman. It seems to me that the membership of the task force is fairly heavily weighted towards that area. As I have said, the then Minister for Posts and Telecommunications (Mr Robinson) announced the establishment of the task force on 22 September last year, following a report to the Government prepared for Australian Consolidated Press Ltd by Donald Bond, an RCA employee. The task force advertised for written submissions in late November, inviting interested bodies to make written submissions not later than 13 January 1978. That advertisement appeared in the Melbourne Age on 29 November. The period was later extended until 13 February and the task force was required to report to the Minister in May, although the Opposition would like to know the position on the extension of that time.",39
112,Mr STALEY,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,They have asked for an extension of one month and I have said,40
113,Mr INNES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,If you are going to reply to this debate you can tell me later.,40
114,Mr STALEY,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,I am replying now. Mr Jull will be speaking next.,40
115,Mr INNES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"The report will be made to the Minister and not to the Parliament, as I have indicated. There were similar overtones to the Green report on Australian broadcasting in November 1976. The Government made apparently pre-determined changes, in consultation with commercial broadcasters, and then released the report. I hope sincerely that that is not done on this occasion. The Packer-RCA link cannot be over-stressed. Packer assigned Bond, one of the foremost establishment authorities and apologists on this issue, to prepare a case fitting his own interests. On the basis of that case, the Government established a task force, under a most restrictive time limit which may change the very structure of the telecommunications industry in this country. The effects of that do not stop at that industry as such but move out into other areas. Unless the ramifications of a decision of this nature are considered, the Opposition is apprehensive that this would be yet another move to hand over a public service to private enterprise. The benefits argued by Packer are all questionable. He has said that there would be an ability to relay simultaneous television programs throughout Australia, which is an example of national networking, but that seems to be a small benefit for such a massive cost. The general standard is so puerile that the only benefactors would be the networks. There are also technical doubts about this claim. It seems unlikely that the Packer system could serve all the isolated areas referred to in the submission. However, if one concedes the technical point, the cost of projecting simultaneous pictures around the country is astronomical, and does not stop at the cost of installation of the ellite. Surely other technical aspects are involved in the signal reaching the intended destination. Huge costs would be involved in that, and once again this relates to the design and the technical possibilities of the satellite. The cost must always be considered-no t only the capital investment of $300m plus, and running costs and amortisation of about $60m a year for the satellite system, but also the massive cost of dismantling and underutilising a perfecdy adequate terrestrial system. I ask the Minister to note that point. Telecom Australia supported that contention in its submission to the task force, having regard to the capabilities of the existing network and to Telecom's responsibility to keep prices as low as practicable. I should have thought that that would not be a bad idea at this point of time, when thetighteningof the belt concept seems to be such a fetish with the Government and the Ministers concerned. The point I am making is that, as the proposition outlines, in the telecommunications area there has been an infiltration into the public service area for some years. We never hear of the Packers of this world wanting to take over the Victorian railways. We never hear of any of the private enterprise people trying to take over",40
116,Mr SCHOLES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"Transpor t to Tasmania, for instance.",40
117,Mr INNES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"Yes , transport to Tasmania. They avoid that like the plague. It is only the cream runs in the postal service that they are taking over. This whole proposition is directed towards that end. So the Opposition is of the opinion that there is a need for the maintenance of public ownership and control of all broadband communication facilities, including satellite and cable systems, to ensure equitable use in the best interests of the Australian people. Mr Barry Jones-They want to capitalise profits and socialise losses.",40
118,Mr INNES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"That is correct, and of course that is being done all the time. The scream will be that this move is towards socialising the industry. What a facade! The Constitution prevents any socialisation in this country, and some of the individuals who scream about it ought to have another look at it. The real question concerns whether we are going to socialise losses and capitalise gains, as the honourable member for Lalor pointed out. The Government is obligated to provide a service. The service that is to be provided ought to be equitable, becausefirmssuch as Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, Ansett Airlines of Australia and others will not service satthe back blocks of Australia delivering mail, parcels or anything else. They will service the cream runs of the metropolitan areas, just as Packer will try to get a stranglehold over the communications system of this country. I think the motion speaks for itself, and if the Government were acting in the best interests of the Australian people it would support the motion. Mr Barry Jones- I second the motion.",40
119,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"The motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) states: That this House is of the maintenance of public ownership and control of all broadband communication facilities, including satellite and cable systems, to ensure equitable Australian people. Quite frankly, I am not quite sure how far down the road he got on that motion. He started off talking about letter deliveries and finished talkwe ing about letter deliveries. We heard the selfsame boring attack on the Packer organisAustralia. ation. I hold no brief for the Packer organisation, but I would think that it has contributed thing to this debate on communication satellites today. The proposition of the Packer organisenterprise ation sparked action from the Government in November last year in setting up a task force examine the whole area of satellite communiof cations for Australia. For that I think we should be very thankful. It was the vision of previous Minister for Post and Telecommuniarrangement cations that started this investigation which could well get Australia into the 21st century the area of communications. Today I would parthis ticularly like to talk about some aspects of electronic media and its adaptability lite system. I think a couple of statements that have been made today by the honourable member for Melthe bourne should be cleared up. Firstly, it is true that the task force was required to report at end of May. It asked for a month's extension, which indeed has been granted. We heard honourable member say that the public did not really have any input into this inquiry. I made few investigations and found that in fact 156 submissions were forwarded from computer ganisations, industry, community groups, the general public, academics, the Government and trade union groups. To say that there is any of secretive arrangement about this investigation is patently just not true, because the submissions are completely open to everyone. There has been quite an extensive coverage of the inquiry by the media over recent months. I read with interest a letter honourable member for Melbourne to the Melbourne Age just a few weeks ago in reply to an article in that same publication that had been together by Mr Myles Wright on 2 May headed 'Doubtful view of a satellite TV system'. I supsatellite pose the honourable member for Melbourne would today has quoted from statements made by Mr industry. Myles Wright in that article. From my 15 years' experience in the electronic media, I felt that Myles Wright was a highly conservative man. I am afraid that he was not ever terribly innovative, and I think that this article and some of the opinion that there is a need for excuses put up in it were in fact fairly typical of the opinion that he expresses in his boring publication in that newspaper week by week. use in the best interests of the It is difficult to see the motive behind the motion put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne today. I think it is significant that look at some of the ramifications of the introusual duction of a communications satellite to It is all very well to talk about private enterprise coming into this area, but the facts are one that the geographical nature of Australia, I would tlunk, would almost preclude private from being even remotely interested in it. The population is concentrated around the to seaboard. Telecom Australia with an investment about $6,000m receives a return of 3 per cent all or 4 per cent. I am not sure whether private the enterprise would be interested in going into an that would return 3 per cent to 4 per cent. It is hardly a brillant return on an inin vestment of that magnitude. I do not know what inquiry will bring out, but I would imagine the that the responsibility would certainly remain to the satelwith the Government. I was sorry that some of the members from the country electorates were not in this House to hear honourable member's speech. I refer particularly to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie the (Mr Cotter), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member the for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) who time and time again in the House press for television and a better telephone communications for their electorates. This is exactly the potential that a comormunications satelUte can provide. Even with today's technology it is possible to increase greatly the effectiveness of a television signal to sense these remote parts of Australia. A communications satellite can deliver pictures to everyone scattered throughout Australia. It is possible to provide telephone services to these people in these far flung, remote areas of the nation. It is possible to make other means of communication available to them as well, including telex that was sent by the services. The honourable member for Melbourne spoke put about the networking of television programs. If the situation did evolve where a communications were avaUable almost instantaneously it cause some problems within the television I think we should be a little broader in our outlook on this aspect. I know that one of the aspirations of this Government is one day, when it is feasible, to establish an educational television network. I think that is something for which we should all be pressing and for which we should all be striving in this Parliament. Imagine the tremendous ramifications that that sort of prospect could mean to the people of the outback and to those children doing correspondence lessons at the moment. What a tremendous facility this would be for them if they could tune into their school programs on these different frequencies every day. It is all very well for Myles Wright to talk about a series of cassette programs around the country being a much better system but I believe that is just not a feasible or an economic proposition at this stage. It is certainly not an efficient means of providing true educational facilities to the people of the outback. If we can pick up a schoolroom atmosphere, convey it through a satellite and feed it into homes I think we would really be achieving something because television is a great educator if it is nothing else. That has been proved. Let us look at the work that is being done by the British Broadcasting Corporation in Britain at the moment with its tremendous University of the Air series which has proved so beneficial to that country. I think that is even more reason why we should be striving for a situation where we can use this type of facility in providing education to the people of the far flung areas of Australia and, indeed, to the people of the major capital cities and the major provincial towns scattered around the coastline as well. The other aspect to which Myles Wright alluded in his article concerned having medical services relayed by satellite. This in itself is probthe ably technically feasible. I am not personally convinced of just how effective it would be, but it is another area of satellite communications that could well be opened up and one that could well be used to very great advantage. It is an aspect that I am sure would be of very great appeal to the people who live in those areas. Certainly the Royal Flying Doctor Service does a marvellous job, but if that service can be added to by this form of communication, when a government of this nature is concerned with the welfare and the health of the people of the outback areas, so be it. There should be further investigations into this area. I am not privy to any information that might be contained in the task force report. I understand from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley) that that report will be tabled in this Parliament, and that in itself stops any talk of secrecy that might surround the investigation at the moment. I am sure that all honourable members will look forward with interest to some of the recommendations that will come from that report. If the honourable member for Melbourne is in fact talking about opening up this area to the private sector of industry, I do not think we should have completely closed minds about it at the moment. I sometimes think that one of the problems of government is that we do not do enough subcontracting out to private industry. The electronics industry of Australia is undergoing considerable difficulty at present and subcontracting in this area could play a major part in providing work opportunities in that industry. This could lead to a greater influx of technical knowledge so that we can get the most efficient contribution in this scientific area in developing the best system available for the people of Australia. That, after all, is all we are worried about-wha t is in the best interests of the people of Australia as a whole. If this means combining the facilities of Telecom and other government departments with some of the brains and the knowledge of private industry, so be it. Let us make the most efficient use of that combination. Sometimes in government we are stifled too much by our practice of not relying more on the contribution that private industry can sometimes make to building Australia into a far better place in which to live. The Government has a sense of prime interest in the use of all available resources to the best advantage. Obviously it must combine both capital and physical resources as well. I repeat that I am sure that all honourable members are looking forward to receiving that report. It is, of course, a way of bringing Australia towards 21st century. In relation to costs, I understand that there could already be some satellite facilities available to us. This report could well say that maybe Australia is not ready just now for its own satellite; but maybe we can reach a stage where we can subcontract present satellite facility space to introduce for the benefit of the nation as a whole some of these initiatives in communications. I understand that a communications satellite could cost $80m to get into position, but if we could subcontract something for $lm or $2m per annum for a while until it becomes economically feasible to go into our own venture, let us examine that aspect. Let us not close our minds on this matter. Let us make sure that we investigate every possibility. As I have said, $80m is the present charge but it has been rumoured that maybe Australia can get into the satellite communication business for $lm or $2m a year. One would hope that all of us in this Parliament would be making the best possible input into this question in the coming months and the coming weeks to make sure that the people of Australia get the best service that is available. I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne will consider some of these aspects that we have put up today. Certainly the industry is most interested in continuing investigation into the possible use of satelUte services. Let us hope that the Opposition, and especially the honourable member for Melbourne, exhibits a broader outlook on this matter than the honourable member has indicated today, and that he does not continue to be a wart on the backside of progress in the communications industry.",41
120,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES,"I want to take up one of the last points made by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr JuU). He seemed to be suggesting: 'Let us get the technology right first and when we have worked out the technology we wiU work out the phUosophy on which the technology ought to be implemented'. I think that is a classic example of putting the cart before the horse. It is absolutely essential that we work out now, before we are committed and locked into some technological exercise, precisely what it is that we intend We have to work out our phUosophy of pubUc broadcasting, our phUosophy of usage of communication faculties throughout the nation, and then plug the technology into that. I think that in the past there have been too many examples of enormous commitments to technological marvels. The Sydney Opera House, the Melbourne Underground RaU Loop and the West Gate Bridge are three examples that come to mind. It is only subsequendy, after there have been commitments to the technology, that the Government says: 'Let us sit down for a minute and work out what it is that we are trying to do'.",43
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATION FACILITIES," Order! The time aUotted for precedence of general business has expired. The resumption of this debate will be made an order of the day under General Business for the next sitting. AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA: NA NA NA Ministerial Statement  Foreign Affairs)-by leave-In my statement to Parliament on 11 May 1978 I informed honourable members that, in recent negotiations with the Papua New Guinea Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Ebia Olewale, we agreed upon the principal basic elements which are to be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between our two countries and on other matters relating to Torres Strait. In that statement. I indicated that Mr Olewale and I would be presenting to our respective Pariiaments a fuUer outline of those elements and that I would make avaUable to honourable members Ulustrative maps which would indicate the results of these important negotiations. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has written to the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, concerning the principal basic elements which are to be included in the treaty and my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) has also conferred with the Torres Strait Islander Chairmen. In this statement. I wish to present to honourable members an account of the principal basic elements which the Australian and Papua New Guinea Foreign Ministers have agreed will be included in the treaty. The Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea is presenting a sinuiar account to his Parliament. Before proceeding to speak about the treaty elements, I wish to recall to do. that Australia and Papua New Guinea have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before Papua New Guinea moved to independence. Both our governments have been determined to arrive at a permanent and equitable settlement which will meet the need to delimit our territorial seas and the seabed andfishingzones between the two countries. The settlement must also take account of intricate historical, cultural, social and economic factors of great significance to our peoples, including notably the people of the Torres Strait area. Both our governments have accordingly approached the negotiations with great care and concern in order to arrive at a solution which is equitable in human terms and lasting and beneficial in its consequences. We have sought an agreement which will stand the test of time both legally and functionally. We have been determined to achieve a treaty settlement which would strengthen the fabric of the relationship between the two countries and their peoples, which we both regard as of high importance. STRAIT It is against this background that I now present for the information of honourable members a paper containing an oudine of the principal basic elements which Mr Olewale and I have agreed will be included in the treaty, together with two Ulustrative maps which will indicate these elements graphically. At the conclusion of this statement. I shall seek leave to have the text of the paper incorporated in Hansard. I commend this paper and the supporting maps to the attention of honourable members. It is of necessity a long and somewhat technical document. I should therefore like to state some general points and then to summarise the main treaty elements on which agreement has been reached. Firstly, it should be kept in mind that certain outstanding points of substance are to be the subject of further negotiations. These points arise mainly from the principal basic elements which now represent common ground. Secondly, the package of elements which is now emerging provides for a fair and equitable division of sea and seabed resources between Papua New Guinea and Australia across the whole area traversed by the proposed lines of delimitation. This is what both Governments have been seeking to achieve. Thirdly, the basic elements provide for access from both sides to the sea and seabed resources of the Torres Strait area on terms which will foster the development of the economies of the immediate areas in and on both sides of the Strait. Fourthly, arrangements will be established in the Torres Strait area which are designed to meet fully the particular needs of the people of the area, including the people of the adjacent coastal area of Papua New Guinea, with regard to traditional movements and traditionalfishing.In putting these arrangements into effect, the wishes of the people of the area will be taken into account by the two Governments. There will be machinery to ensure that representatives of these people will be consulted about decisions that affect them. Fifthly, there will be appropriate guarantees for freedom of movement for ships and aircraft in the area. In particular, these will ensure that internal sea and air services of the two countries will take place without delay, interference or inconvenience. There will also be provision for the passage of vessels using the Strait to go to other destinations along routes normally used for international navigation. The main treaty elements, briefly stated in non-technical and nonlegal language, are as follows: (1) There will be a seabed resources delimitation line running through the whole area between the two countries and located as indicated on the two maps. (2) There will similarly be a line delimiting the swimming fisheries resources jurisdiction between the two countries. In the central Torres Strait area, it will run to the north of the islands of Boigu, Dauan and Saibai as shown on the two maps. To the east and the west of that area it will coincide with the seabed line. (3) In the treaty, Australia will recognise Papua New Guinea sovereignty over the islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa; Papua New Guinea will recognise Australian sovereignty over all the Australian islands in the Torres Strait shown on map 11 as lying north of the seabed line. (4) As shown on the maps, the territorial seas of the Australian islands north of the seabed line, and of Papua New Guinea in the area between Boigu and Dauan will be a maximum of three nautical miles, and a territorial sea boundary will be delimited between Boigu, Dauan and Saibai and Papua New Guinea. Neither country will in future extend its territorial seas across the seabed line. (5) A Protected Zone will be established in the Torres Strait in the area shown on the maps. Within this zone the Torres Strait Islanders and the Papua New Guineans who live in the adjacent coastal area will be able to continue their traditional activities and to move freely about the zone for this purpose. (6) There will be an embargo on mining and oil drilling of the seabed throughout the Protected Zone for 10 years from the date of entry into force of the treaty. This might be renewed thereafter by agreement. (7) The treaty will include further provisions relating to the Protected Zone which will cover agreed principles, parallel measures to be taken by, and co-operation between the two Governments to provide for the following matters: (a) the protection and preservation of the marine environment; (b) the management and conservation offisheriesresources; (c) the protection of plant and animal life; and (d) the prevention and control of pollution. (8) The treaty will make provision for detailed bilateral arrangements covering joint conservation, management and sharing of the commercial Protected Zone fisheries. Both Governments will consult and co-operate in the issue and endorsement of licences. The licensing arrangements will have regard to the desirability of promoting economic development and employment opportunities in the Torres Strait area including the adjacent coastal area of Papua New Guinea and the people of the area will be consulted about these arrangements. Subject to the phasing arrangements specified in the paper I have tabled, the sharing of the commercial protected zone fisheries will be on the basis that Australia will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the commercialfisheriesin waters under Papua New Guinea jurisdiction; Papua New Guinea will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the commercial fisheries in waters under Australian jurisdiction. The share in the territorial seas of the Australian uninhabited islands north of the seabed line other than Turnagain, however, will be on a 50/50 basis and Papua New Guinea will have 100 per cent of the commercial barramundi fishery near the Papua New Guinea coast, excluding the territorial seas of Saibai, Dauan and Boigu. Each country will have preference against third countries to take up any surplus of the other country's share of the commercial protected zonefisheries.Third State operators will not normally be licensed to exploit those fisheries unless agreed by Australia and Papua New Guinea. (10) In relation to the protected zone visions permitting freedom of movement the local people in the carrying on of traelements. ditional activities, the treaty will provide for co-operation on immigration, customs, health and quarantine arrangements. However, each country will retain the right to implement national controls to prevent abuses or other 1978 possible adverse effects of those protected New zone provisions. (11) There will be liaison arrangements to ensure the effective working of the protected zone provisions of the treaty. These will include a body, which might be called the Torres Strait Inter-Governmental Advisory and Consultative Committee, that will be responsible to the two Foreign Ministers. On the Committee, State and provincial governments and the local people will be represented. In addition, senior national Government officials will be nominated to facilitate, at the local level, the implementation of the protected zone arrangements. (12) The treaty will contain provisions covering appropriate guarantees of freedon of navigation, passage and overflight. What I have set out in this statement, and in the paper I have tabled, is an outline of the principal basic elements which Mr Olewale and I have agreed are to be included in the treaty. This outline is in summary form and not in formal treaty language. Certain consequential points of substance remain for discussion between the two Foreign Ministers and considerably more work remains to be done on the development of detailed treaty articles. The technical descriptions of the various points and lines referred to in this statement, and in the accompanying paper and illustrative maps, require further careful checking and calculation before being finally agreed upon for inclusion in the treaty. It is planned that Mr Olewale and I will consult again in a few weeks' time in order to maintain momentum towards the completion of full treaty documentation. Meanwhile, I am confident that honourable members will agree with Mr Olewale and me that the agreement we have now reached upon the principal basic elements to be included in the treaty text is an historic one. We and our ministerial colleagues believe that a treaty incorporating these elements will represent a mutuallyacceptable and equitable settlement which will meet the genuine concerns and interests of the Governments and peoples of our two countries. I now seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard prothe text of the paper to which I have referred by containing an outline of the principal basic Leave granted. The document read asfollowsOutline of principal basic elements agreed upon on 5 May between the Foreign Ministers of Australia and Papua Guinea to be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between their two countries and on other matters relating to Torres Strait. Notes: (a) This outline is a summary, not in formal treaty language, and does not include all the detail that will be necessary in the treaty. (b) Certain consequential points of substance are to be the subject of further negotiations. (c) The two illustrative maps are indicative only. (1) Subject to minor adjustment for reasons of technical computation and survey, there will be an agreed seabed resources delimitation line running through the whole area between the two countries and located as indicated on the two maps. (2) Similarly there will be a line delimiting the swimming fisheries resources jurisdiction between the two countries, located as indicated on the two maps. The run of that line will coincide with that of the seabed delimitation line except that, between the meridians 142° 03' 30"" East and 142° 51' 00"" East, it will run to the north of the three inhabited Australian islands of Boigu, Dauan and Saibai. (3) Australia will recognise Papua New Guinea sovereignty over the islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa and the smaller islands appurtenant to those islands and over their territorial seas, subject to delimitation as necessary to be specified in the treaty. Papua New Guinea will recognise Australian sovereignty over the inhabited islands of Boigu, Dauan and Saibai and the smaller islands appurtenant to these, islands, including Aubusi, Moimi and Kaumag and over the nine Australian uninhabited islands lying north of the seabed delimitation line, that is Turu Cay, Kerr Islet, Deliverance Island, Turnagain Island, Pearce Cay, Black Rocks, Bramble Cay, Anchor Cay and East Cay, and over the three-mile territorial seas of those islands, subject to an agreed description of the delimitation thereof which will appear in the treaty. (4) The territorial seas of Australia and Papua New Guinea between Boigu and Papua New Guinea, and between Dauan and Saibai and Papua New Guinea, will be delimited along two agreed lines as broadly indicated on the maps. (5) The breadth of the territorial seas of the Australian islands indicated on the map as lying north of the seabed delimitation line will be a maximum of three miles. No other Australian territorial sea will Ue to the north of the Une. The breadth of the territorial southern coastline between the meridians 142° 03' 30"" East and 142 ° 51' 00"" East will be a maximum of three miles and will not extend south of the two territorial sea delimitation lines or the straight line linking them as indicated on the maps. The extent of Papua New Guinea territorial sea, which will not in any event extend into the area south of the agreed seabed line, agreed areas of Australian territorial sea to the north of the seabed line, or the agreed area of Australian fisheries jurisdiction north of the seabed line, will depend on the base lines or archipelagic lines adopted by Papua New Guinea in accordance with international law. (6) Australia and Papua New Guinea will not in future extend their territorial seas across the seabed delimitation line. (7) A Protected Zone will be established in the Torres Strait within the area indicated on the maps. The treaty will contain provisions which safeguard traditional activities, including in particular traditional Torres Strait area, that is the Torres Strait Islanders and Papua New Guineans who live in the adjacent coastal area, and which provide for continued freedom of movement about the zone in pursuit of these traditional activities. (8) There will be an embargo on mining and oil drilUng of the seabed throughout the Protected Zone for 10 years commencing from the date of entry into force of the treaty. The embargo may, by agreement between the two countries, be extended beyond the end of the 10 year period. The treaty will provide for equitable arrangements to be made by Papua New Guinea in respect of the holders of the Australian petroleum permit Q/ 10P in those parts of the permit area that will fall on the Papua New Guinea side of the seabed deUmitation line. The treaty will also contain a provision along the following lines: If any single accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas, or if any other mineral deposit beneath the seabed, extends across a boundary line so as to come within the jurisdiction of both countries, and the part of such accumulation or deposit that is situated on one side of the line is recoverable in fluid form wholly or in part from the other side of the line, the two Governments will seek to reach agreement on the manner in which the accumulation or deposit shall be most effectively exploited and on the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from such exploitation. (9) The treaty will incorporate further provisions relating to the Protected Zone which will cover agreed principles, parallel measures to be taken by, and cooperation between, the two Governments, to ensure: protection and preservation of the marine environment; management and conservation of fisheries resources; protection of indigenous flora and fauna (including endangered species, notably the dugong and certain species of turtle); prevention and control of pollution. (10) The treaty will also contain detailed provisions on agreed arrangements in respect of commercial fisheries within the Protected Zone, including those fish of stocks belonging substantially to the area of the Protected Zone which occur outside but near the Zone within limits to be agreed between the two Governments. In respect of such commercial Protected Zone fisheries the treaty will contain provisions covering the following points: (a) The conduct of commercial Protected Zone fisheries will be subject to the provisions that will be made in the treaty for the people of the area to continue to engage in traditional fishing. This will mean that traditional fishing will have precedence over commercial fishing. sea of Papua New Guinea along its (b) In the context of conservation, management and 'sharing-of-take' arrangements in respect of the commercial Protected Zone fisheries, the fisheries authorities of both countries will consult and cooperate in the issue and endorsement of licences. (c) In the administrative process of issuing licences, the relevant authorities of the two countries will have regard to the desirability of promoting economic development in the Torres Strait area including the adjacent coastal area of Papua New Guinea and employment opportunities for the people of the area. (d) There will be periodic consultation with the people of the area on the licensing arrangements. (e) The responsible authorities of each country will issue licences to their own nationals and endorse when necessary the licences of nationals of the other country. fishing, by the people of the (f) In allocating licences, and in deciding upon other jointly-agreed management and access arrangements in respect of the commercial Protected Zone fisheries, regard will be had to existing levels of'take' by each country prior to the date of entry into force of the treaty but subject to sub-paragraph (g) below. Provided these levels remain within the optimum sustainable yield of the fishery concerned, they will not be reduced for five years from the date of entry into force of the treaty but, over the subsequent five years, levels of'take' may be adjusted progressively so that Papua New Guinea will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the 'take' of the commercial Protected Zonefisheriesin waters under Australian jurisdiction and Australia will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the 'take' of the commercial Protected Zone fisheries in waters under Papua New Guinea jurisdiction, subject to the following: (i) In the territorial seas of the Australian uninhabited islands north of the seabed line, other than Turnagain, the 'sharing-of-take' formula will be 50 per cent Australia/50 per cent Papua New Guinea. (u) Papua New Guinea will have 100 per cent of the 'take' in the commercial barramundi fishery near the Papua New Guinea coast, excluding the territorial seas of Saibai, Dauan and Boigu, and this 'take' will not be included in calculating the overall percentage share of'take' in the commercial Protected Zone fisheries under the agreed 'sharing-of-take' formula mentioned above. (in) The 'take' by each country in individual fisheries will be a matter for agreement between the two countries in accordance with the above mentioned principles and in the context of subsidiary joint conservation, management, access and licensing arrangements negotiated in respect of individualfisheriesand will not necessarily, in any singlefishery,be the same as the overall percentage shares (g) In the event of the in a Protected Zonefisheryor part thereof under the jurisdiction of one country because that country in any year or season after the entry into force of the treaty does not propose itself fully to exploit its share of that fishery, the other country will be given preference as against any portion of the surplus in that fishery or part. (h) Vessels of third State licensed to exploit the commercial Protected Zone fisheries unless agreed by the two countries. (11) For the purpose of fisheries jurisdiction and the sharing provisions and subject to conservation, management and protection provisions, the following categories of living resources will be recognised: (a) swimming fisheries resources (all living marine resources with the within the meaning of the 19S8 Convention on the Continental Shelf); (b) seabed fisheries (most sedentary organisms as so defined); (c) other living resources of the seabed (corals, seaweed etc., and, outside the inhabited islands north of the seabed line (except Turnagain), pearl shell). Fisheries jurisdiction will apply to (a), the seabed jurisdiction to (b) and (c). As a general rule, the fisheries conservation management and sharing arrangements will apply to (a) and (b). The position of (c) from the latter point of view will need to be further considered, the areas indicated.

123,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MATTERS RELATING TO TORRES,"Before the suspension of the sitting the  delivered a statement relating to negotiations on of the 'take' mentioned above. maritime boundaries between Australia and opdmum yield not being taken up Papua New Guinea, particularly as they apply to the Torres Strait. We welcome the Minister's further statement on this matter. I say at the outset that we want to encourage the Minister, congratulate him on the work that has already been third countries to take up all or done and express our appreciation of what has operators will not normally be happened. Of course, as has been said, it is a complex matter. We are anxious that all related matters should be discussed in the Parliament, in the interests of reaching a proper settlement. The Minister made a statement on this matter on 11 May. On that occasion we replied indicating that we could understand the development and the progress that was being made towards settleexception of sedentary organisms ment. We also note that there could be people seeking wider discussions and details in respect of the difficulties of settling boundaries the details of which were the subject of discussions. I note that in this latest statement the Minister territorial seas of Australian unobtained leave to incorporate in Hansard the elements of the basic agreements which were reached on 5 May between the Foreign Ministers of Australia and Papua New Guinea. They clearly show the matters to which we should now address our minds. I also note that the Minister except for pearl shell in has sought the concurrence of other people Protected Zone provisions which vitally interested in this matter, not the least of whom would be the Torres Strait Islanders. Let us make it clear that the Torres Strait Islanders are Australian citizens and we have a national responsibility to represent them. In regard to this country will retain the right to issue we can well understand the Minister's concern to guarantee that those citizens are able to maintain the rights which by custom and usage they have had for many years. include both a high-level Torres The matter of law involves the questions of sovereignty and access. When we talk about and the people of the area boundaries we have to look at the realities of the situation which might not have been clearly espoused over the centuries. When discussing this matter last on 11 May we were given information as to what the letters patent clearly showed in relation to the islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa. We recognise that there could have been confusion and misunderstanding as to where the boundaries ought to have applied. I understand that there is some suggestion that there is evidence in the British Foreign Office to indicate that perhaps the boundaries are not drawn in the way that the letters patent produced on 11 May showed them to be. These are some of the problems. There are always different points of view put on the question. The letters patent were furnished here but it is suggested- I put it no higher than that-that there is other evidence. Despite that, as the Minister has accurately predicted, we are making great progress towards a settlement. That is what it is all about. The Minister has said that it is a technical matter, which it is. It requires equitable understanding of the arrangements of people, which we fully understand. The difficulty is to get that accepted at all levels. I am pleased to say that we find Papua New Guinea a most welcome neighbour indeed. As a former colonial responsibility Papua New Guinea has now developed into a strong, resilient political group very well disposed towards us. I think that has been helped by the fact that the Opposition when in power was anxious to promote the independence of that country. Even in those days we were anxious to promote a setdement of all the border issues. We applaud the efforts of the Minister and his dedication in getting as far as he has at present. We note that we will be getting further information as to how progress is proceeding. For a few moments I shall address myself to the matters that the Minister mentioned in detail in his statement. We note that the maps produced deal with a number of areas, namely, the seabed resources delimitation line; the swimming fisheries resources delimitation line; the protected zone; the limit of the Australian territorial sea north of the seabed line; territorial sea delimitation lines between Papua New Guinea and Boigu, Dauan and Saibai; and the basic extent of the Papua New Guinea territorial sea. They are set out in detail on maps that have been produced. But in relation to the details we ask a couple of questions. They relate to the fact that we say that the settlement would depend on acceptance by the people who are known as Torres Strait Islanders. I think that goes without any other argument. We also await the reaction of the Papua New Guinea Parliament to this report. We understand that that will be forthcoming. I want to make a point about the zones them for selves. Some particular issues are involved. raise the question of commercial protected zone fisheries. As I understand the situation, swimsition mingfisheriesresources is a particular category and another category is deemed to be commeron cial protected zonefisheries.There is a share aladdress location which is dealt with in paragraph 9 on page 5 of the Minister's statement. It sets out how those commercialfisheriesshall be shared by both Papua New Guinea and the Australian nation. The statement reads: The share in the territorial seas of the Australian habited islands north of the seabed Une other than Turnagain . . . I invite the Minister to explain why there is an exception in respect of the uninhabited island of Turnagain. It has been said- I think it is rightthat the Torres Strait Islanders have always enjoyed access to the three islands, the sovereignty of which has been predicted as suitable to be recognised as belonging to Papua New Guinea. Those islands are Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa. It has been suggested- I think it is probably not disputed-that the Torres Strait Islanders as a matter of custom, usage and existingrightshave access to those islands for their resources. This would be not just in relation to swimming fish; it applies to crustaceans. The Torres Strait Islanders need access to those islands. I hope that that point can be clarified by the Minister. I hope that these people in no way will be affected. I understand that this point has been of some concern to those people who have been making a study of these matters. That is the particular area I wanted to mention. We note all the other matters that are the subject of further negotiations, and we note that there will be further consultation between the Minister and his counterpart Mr Olewale in a few weeks in order to maintain the momentum towards settlement. The Opposition is understandably pleased at the progress that has been made by both governments. We welcome the fact that the national Government has been able to do this. As I said on 11 May, we do not want to see any unnecessary political interference on the basis that somebody else has any rights in this matter. The High Court clearly said that the Federal Government has the right, the jurisdiction and the duty. Let us proceed on that basis. With those sentiments we welcome the statement and look forward to further information being made available to this Parliament as and when progress is reported.",47
124,Mr JACOBI,MATTERS RELATING TO TORRES,"I am grateful  giving me an opportunity to speak on this I matter. I share with the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Leader of the Oppo(Mr Lionel Bowen), his sentiments on this matter. I compliment the Minister and his officers the excellent job that has been done. I want to myself briefly to the matter that the Minister raised on 11 May dealing with the question of sovereignty over the three islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa. At the outset I should say that a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence presented a report to this Parliament in December 1976. It was uninan all-party sub-committee. I furnished a minority report which differed from the opinions of the other 20 members. I seek leave to have the rninority report incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The report read asfollowsNA Whilst I endorse a number of findings in the 'Sub-Committee's Report', I have found it necessary to express my own views in a separate report. I would summarise these views in the following way: (i) negotiation is preferable best interests of both countries. (ii) Australia should acknowledge that the existing border is a legitimate grievance to Papua New Guinea, and that a delineation of the seabed boundary south of the existing boundary is a realignment that Papua New Guinea can reasonably expect. (iii) The resolution of such a question should not be lowed to be impeded by purely domestic constitutional difficulties in Australia, which have nothing to do with Papua New Guinea and which Papua New Guinea can legitimately claim should not adversely affect her interest. (iv) The Australian Government should make every effort to ensure that the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands are kept fully informed and are consulted in any settlement that is negotiated with the Government of Papua New Guinea. 1. Under the Australian Constitution the National Government is responsible for the conduct of Australia's foreign relations including negotiations of any settlement with the Government of Papua New Guinea in regard to the boundary separating our two countries. To acknowledge this undoubted fact however, is not to deny the very real need on the part of the Australian Government to consult with and keep fully informed the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands. As long as Australia exercised external responsibilities for 'peace, order and good government' on behalf of the people of Papua New Guinea, the border issue was very largely academic. However, New Guinea, prior to independence, was a Trust Territory and as such was subject to scrutiny and report by a visiting UN Mission in 1971, which declared the desirability of a border change. In the run up to independence this matter was in fact raised in the Australian Parliament in 1971 and the Papua New Guinea Parliament in 1969 and 1971. 2. Because of the very general the 1879 line, it is almost impossible to use it to construct the border with the precision required for an international boundary. Since initial annexation in 1879, the border between both nations has been the subject of a number of exchanges, resulting in a number of recommended border realignments, but no change to the 1879 line has been made. The very fact that the 1879 line lacks the essential attribute of precision, and that this line lies only a few hundred metres from the coast of Papua New Guinea must necessarily be a source of grievance, if not even offence. That this is so was acknowledged long before Papua New Guinea became independent. Speaking in 1903, a former Premier of Queensland, Sir Samual Griffiths, first Chief Justice of the High Court, said: With regard to the boundary when it was fixed in 1878, it was not unreasonable for Queensland to require to get all she could. She could not get New Guinea, but managed to get as near as possible. We followed round as close as we could get between the Islands and the coast of New Guinea, taking in practically everything at that time and those parts were equally unknown and unsettled; but later when New Guinea had what was after all a civilised Government . . ., it became extremely absurd that some of the islands should be governed by Queensland. In the words of a noted academic authority on the subject, 'the present maritime boundary between Queensland and Papua is an anachronism and contains the seeds of future  Boundary', p. 35(1966)). to arbitration, and is in the 3. At independence, Papua New Guinea assumed the rights and obligations conferred upon it as a sovereign state. Of necessity, it had to assess the limits of its territory and territorial jurisdiction, the rights of freedom of movement of its people, their freedom of access for the purposes of trade and commerce, its requirements for defence, both national and international, and its freedom of access to the seas adjacent alto its mainland for the purpose of exploiting the natural resources on or beneath the seabed. 4. The evidence indicates an intention on the part of the government of Australia and Papua New Guinea to reach an acceptable settlement involving a re-alignment of present boundary. Because of certain Australian Constitutional difficulties (see clause 7) Australia may be restricted to a delineation of the maritime and seabed boundary. The proposed line involves a delineation of the seabed boundary and would be drawn to the south of the present REASONS line subject to the following conditions: (i) The three inhabited islands of Boigu, Saibai and Dauan (which may be left north of the new seabed boundary) remaining Australian and their people Australian citizens. (ii) Uninhabited islands remaining Australian territory. (iii) Such islands generating a three (3) mile territorial sea. (iv) The establishment of a protective zone in the Torres Strait to preserve the traditional way of life and livelihood of the islanders and the people of Papua New Guinea, to be administered by a Commission having representation from all parties. (v) The resolution of outstanding issues: in particular, the need to define the geographical limits of both the 'protected zone' and the 'seabed boundary' and the matter of driUing within the protected zone. 5. The failure to concede to Papua New Guinea the rights proposed by the two Governments could well lead to the following consequences: nature of the description of Papua New Guinea may pass its 'National Seas Bill'. This would create overlapping and conflict of claims between the Australian Government and the Papua New Guinea Government as to respective areas of influence and jurisdiction, both national and international. The issue may well then be referred to the International Court of Justice or some other international arbitral institution, as being used, for instance, to resolve the dispute between France and the United Kingdom over certain islands in the English Channel. This might result in a decision adverse to Australia, so we face the real dilemma of a conflict between 'international law' and Australian 'municipal law', with all the attendant difficulties of compliance with, and implementation of, the international decision. 6. Strategic and Defence Considerations-The evidence indicates that in so far as our strategic interests are concerned the transfer of any other of the islands and islets north of 10°S would not affect Australia's strategic interest in unimpeded navigation of the Strait. Naturally, it remains true that the more islands that might be occupied the more opdons for military exploitation would be available to the occupant, whoever that might be. However, the desirabUity of this opdon could be countervailed if transfer of the islands could guarantee a comprehensive and permanent resolution of differences with Papua New Guinea in the area. The Defence Department made quite clear in its submission to the Sub-Committee that the over-riding defence consideration in Torres Strait was to prevent an unresolved boundaries dispute becoming a source of friction in a general sense between Papua New Guinea and Australia. The two countries presently enjoy an unusually close identity of defence interests, and co-operate effectively in safeguarding those interests. Any final settlement of the boundaries issue must be made with reference to the wider concern of maintaining this commonality of interests and high level of co-operation. 7. AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION (i) Finally it is necessary to discuss the legal and constitutional issues involved in the changes that are proposed regarding Australia's boundary with Papua New Guinea. (ii) Three possible courses of action require discussion: (iii) The first such possible course of action would entail the transfer to Papua New Guinea of some or any of the islands themselves. This possibility would undoubtedly give rise to serious human problems. It would also give rise to difficult legal problems stemming from the scope and operation of Section 123 of the Australian Constitution. (iv) Section 123 empowers the Australian Parliament to alter the limits of a State but only if the alteration takes place: (a) with the consent of the State Parliament concerned, and also (b) with the approval of the electors of the State concerned. These requirements are intended to safeguard the territorial integrity of a State. They arereinforcedby the further requirements that were written into the procedure for amending the Constitution in the last paragraph of Section 128. (v) There are other legal powers that may perhaps be used to alter State boundaries. However, the existence of the special power contained in Section 123 has given rise to the difficult legal question whether these other powers are capable of being exercised at all or alternatively exercised without also complying with the special requirements created by Section 123. The other powers include the following: (a) the power of the Queen to alter Australia's boundaries by Order-in-Council or by Letters Patent with the consent of the Commonwealth under the Colonial Boundaries Act 1895 (IMP). (b) the power of the Australian Parliament to legislate with respect to external affairs in Section 51 (XXXIX) (in conjunction with the executive power enjoyed by the Australian Government by virtue of Section 61 of the Constitution). (c) the power of a State to surrender any part tory to the Commonwealth under Section 111. (This section could in fact provide a vehicle for co-operative federalism in that State territory could be transferred to the Commonwealth, which Commonwealth could then cede if so desired.) The question of whether these powers could be used to avoid the need to act with the consent of the Parliament and people of any affected State has given rise to serious differences of legal opinion. In the absence of any judicial authority on the matter, the question must remain unresolved and subject to considerable doubt. (vi) The existence of this doubt poses grave internal legal problems in the way of transferring any territory that forms part of the State of Queensland without the approval of the Government of that State. It would appear that the Torres Strait Islands fall into that category. The Waters (vii) The second possible course of action would only involve the delineation of a maritime boundary between Australia and Papua New Guinea, i.e., determining the waters in the Torres Strait over which both countries would exercise international rights of sovereignty. (viii) Despite some confusion in the past, the better view today would appear to be that the 1879 line did not have the effect of making the waters surrounding the Islands part of the State of Queensland. Moreover it is clear since the offshore sovereignty case (NSW v the Commonwealth 1976) (50 A.L.J.R. 218) that the territorial waters adjacent to a Islands State do not form part of that State. (ix) Accordingly, there can be no possibility of Section 123 applying to the delineation of the maritime boundary, to require the consent and approval of the Parliament and people of Queensland to that delineation. The Continental Shelf (x) The third possible course of action would involve the delineation of Australia's seabed boundary, i.e., defining the areas of the continental shelf over which both countries would exercise international rights of sovereignty. Similar considerations apply because the shelf does not form part of the State of Queensland. This would appear to be so especially in the light of the off-shore sovereignty case. Likewise, the special requirements of Section 123 can have no application to any proposals designed to alter or delineate the seabed boundary between Australia and Papua New Guinea. (xi) In conclusion, any changes that are made to Australia's maritime and seabed boundaries, will not, as a matter of law, require the consent and approval of the Queensland Government, however desirable it might be to obtain such consent and approval for other reasons. The proposals at present under consideration between the two Governments which are referred to in this report, would only involve a delineation of Australia's seabed boundary.

125,Mr JACOBI,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,"I support what the Minister said in relation to the three islets on 11 May for the reasons that I shall give. The matter was dealt with by the sub-committee. The question turns on the definition of Talbot Islands. Sir Samuel Griffiths, Premier of Queensland, decided in 1879 that Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa were part of the group known as the Talbot Islands of its terriand were therefore included within the boundaries of Queensland by the Queensland Coastal Islands Act 1879. However, Sir Samuel Griffiths' decision was at variance with the British Admiralty definition of the Talbot Islands. The official Admiralty chart was drawn in 1873 by Navigating Lieutenant Connor who, in that year, surveyed the Talbot Islands while under the command of Captain Moresby. The Admiralty chart referred to by the law officers who drafted the 1878 Letters Patent was drawn by Navigating Lieutenant Connor to show Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa as lying outside the Talbot Islands which included only Boigu, Moimi and Aubusi. Frederick James Evans, the Admiralty hydrographer referred to the Talbot Islands in a letter dated 16 September 1875 as being two to three miles from the New Guinea mainland. Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa are separated by only a few hundred yards from the mainland, whereas Boigu, Moimi and Aubusi are a little less than three miles from it. From the documents and correspondence relating to the alteration of the maritime boundary in Queensland in 1879 to incorporate certain islands in the Torres Strait it would appear that the Queensland Coastal Islands Act of 1879 was not drafted to include the three islets of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa. Proof of this is contained in the documents printed on pages 116, 133 and 143 of the report on the Torres Strait Boundary by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence Subcommittee on Territorial Boundaries, 1976.I am amazed that some of my colleagues did not take thetimeto study the appendices to that report. I have the sneaking feeling that the Minister's Department might have had reference to that fact when it studied the matter. I shall take a few minutes to address myself to my attitude because I feel that I owe it to the House to do so. I furnished my report which disagreed with that of the Joint Committee for the reasons which appear on page 91 of the report. They are: (i) negotiation is preferable to arbitration, and is in the best interests of both countries. (ii) Australia should acknowledge that the existing border is a legitimate grievance to Papua New Guinea, and that a delineation of the seabed boundary south of the existing boundary is a realignment that Papua New Guinea can reasonably expect. (iii) The resolution of such a quesdon should not be allowed to be impeded by purely domestic constitutional difficulties in Australia, which have nothing to do with Papua New Guinea and which Papua New Guinea can legitimately claim should not adversely affect her interest. (iv) The Australian Government should make every effort to ensure that the inhabitants kept fully informed and are consulted in any settlement that is negotiated with the Government of Papua New Guinea. My reasons for doing so were as follows: 1. Under the Australian Constitution the National Government is responsible for the conduct of Australia's foreign relations including negotiations of any settlement with the Government of Papua New Guinea in regard to the boundary separating our two countries. The second and important reason was: 2. Because of the very general nature of the description of the 1879 line, it is almost impossible to use it to construct the border with the precision required for an international boundary. I took that view for the reasons that I shall give. I think that it is a sound view, though my colleagues on both sides on the sub-committee disagreed. The reason is that the 1879 line is not a true boundary in either Australian or international law. The sole purpose of the line was to indicate which islands were to be annexed to the then colony of Queensland without in any way altering the status of the waters surrounding the island and the submerged land lying beneath the water. Those waters and the submerged land did not, in consequence, form part of Queensland. They did not then and they do not now. The other observation I made was: 5. The failure to concede to Papua New Guinea the rights proposed by the two Governments could well lead to the following consequences: Papua New Guinea may pass its 'National Seas Bill'. This would create overlapping and conflict of claims between the Australian Government and the Papua New Guinea Government as to respective areas of influence and jurisdiction, both national and international. That took place. That observation continued: The issue may well then be referred to the International Court of Justice or some other international arbitral institution, as being used, for instance, toresolvethe dispute between France and the UK over certain islands in the EngUsh Channel. On a negotiated basis at least, that possibility has in fact been avoided. Coming to the details of the accord, for obvious reasons one assumes that Australia has forsworn its right for a 12-mile territorial waters area around its islands for obvious reasons. Equally, one assumes, reference to the map, that Papua New Guinea has exercised its right with the exception of the area encompassing the fishery resources delimitation zone. The other point is that undoubtedly Australia has not foregone any of its land territory or islands in the Torres Strait. To that extent it does not impinge at all upon the Australian Government's constitutional responsibility, it does not contravene Queensland's constitutional entitlement under the Constitution or under the Queensland Coastal Islands Act. I assume from the map that the seabed boundary is slightly of the Torres Strait Islands are north of the Ellicott Line. It serves as a seabed boundary and sea delimitation for the question of exploitation of resources. As I understand it the three islands of Saibai, Boigu and Dauan generate their own three-mile territorial waters, which gives Australia exclusive jurisdiction within those waters, I take it that waters north of the seabed boundaries, that is both for crustaceans and other fishing resources or exploitation generally, will be on a basis north of the Line in the ratio of 25 per cent to 75 per cent against Australia and, south of that Line, on the basis of 75 per cent to 25 per cent in Australia's favour. The other important factor is the question of the protected zone. It seems that that will have to be administered by an intergovernmental committee of both governments to preserve resources, both living and non-living. That preserves the integrity of those who are now Australian citizens on its inhabited islands, giving them a full entitlement to the three miles of territorial waters. Another question I raise with the Minister, as did the shadow Minister is that of Turnagain and also the administration of the navigation of the Great North East Channel. The evidence received by the sub-committee was to the effect that for strategic and defence purposes there would be no problem, as it lies within the protected zone and therefore would be subject to joint administration. As I understand the situation, it is a matter of both countries paying regard to international criteria laid down for the free movement of shipping and for navigational purposes. I understand that it is Australia's responsibility to maintain the navigational aids sited along the channel. My summary of a very brief and cursory examination of both the Minister's statement and the maps affixed to it shows that this is a very reasonable and satisfactory accord. I again compliment the Minister and his officers. But there is one point I wish to make: This accord represents a vindication of the initiatives taken by the Labor Government. Those initiatives led to the independence of Papua New Guinea and the laying of the foundation for this agreement which I trust will be a lasting and very sound agreement between both countries. As anybody who has studied international boundary disputes will know, they are difficult and very complex. Regrettably they sometimes lead to protracted litigation. That could have happened in this case had it not been for a sense of understanding and balance on the part of both countries. One of the biggest problems facing the Greek Government and the Turkish Government is not Cyprus but the seabed boundaries in the Agean Sea because of the oilrightsinvolved. I make this observation: As it would appear that to some degree there has been a bi-partisan approach on this matter, as there has been on the question of Antarctica, I would hope that in intervening period between now and the drafting of the treaty-the period when discussions will take place-the Minister will at least extend to the Opposition the courtesy of keeping us informed of any changes to the material substance of the agreements tabled in the Parliament today. I hope, above all, that the Minister, between the present time and the time of the signing of the treaty, will do two things: I hope that he will keep the Torres Strait Islanders completely informed of all the negotiations and will explain to them the ramifications and meaning of what takes place. Equally, there is an obligation, constitutional at least, on the Minister to keep the Queensland Government fully informed of what may occur ultimately in this matter. Could the Minister clarify for me the question of fishing exploitation by Australians-Torre s Strait Islanders or anybody else-withi n the 3-mile territorial waters adjacent to the inhabited islands within the delimited swimming fish resources zone? Is that to be an exclusive right for Australianfishing,both subsistence and commercial, or is it exclusive in terms of subsistencefishingfor Australian inhabitants? Is fishing within that 3-mile territory hmit on a commercial basis subject to the ratio of 75 per cent for Australia and 25 per cent for Papua New Guinea?",50
126,Mr THOMSON,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI," I am told that I have only a few minutes in which to speak on this very important subject. It is very important to me because the Torres Strait Islands are entirely within my electorate. I would like to compliment the Minister for Foreign  practical solution. This has been a very difficult problem for a number of years. To have reached such a satisfactory solution reflects great credit on all concerned. I would also like to compliment the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) for a very balanced and reasonable speech. He knows a lot about the subject and he has put the position very well indeed. It is very good to see such a bi-partisan approach to such a complex national and international problem. I wish to make one or two points about it: The chairmen of the Island groups have been kept informed of what has been going on. I was in the Torres Strait area last Thursday with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner). The Island chairmen were briefed, in confidence, on this whole detailed proposal. They were shown the maps and they asked many questions. The briefing continued for a number of hours and they expressed a great deal of satisfaction with the the agreement. The night before, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) had briefed the Premier of Queensland and the members of the Queensland Government. They also expressed, both in private and in public, satisfaction with the agreement. I think that this is a very good result in what could have been an extremely difficult problem. We have achieved all we wanted to achieve to protect the Islanders, the Islands and the Islanders' traditional way of life. We have also protected the traditional use by the coastal Papuans of that area. The people have been protected and the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he visited the Torres Strait Islands in November 1976 has been kept. The protected zone is unique in international agreements. It is a splendid way of solving a very difficult problem, a way which I have been recommending, along with many other people, for sometime.It will work well because the Papuans, the Islanders, the national governments and the provincial governments concerned agree on that problem. There was a very great problem in my mind and in the minds of a number of other people about the sea-bed line. The fear was expressed that a sea-bed line would cause the three nothern islands of Saibai, Dauan, and Boigu to be in an enclave in Papua New Guinea waters. As the chairman of the Torres Strait Islands Advisory Council, Mr Getano Lui, said in very pithy language, he was frightened that the sea-bed line would rise to the surface of the water and become a defacto border. Because the Australian fisheries jurisdiction has been extended around the three northern islands and the waters around those islands are Australianfisherieswaters, it is not possible for that line to rise to the surface and to become a de facto border. That is one of the most significant objectives obtained by the negotiators. The word 'window' has been used to indicate the protection that has been given to those three northern islands. It gives them a window on to the rest of the Torres Strait. They are not cut off. They remain part of the Torres Strait, as they always have been. I wish to deal very briefly with the three islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa. I am satisfied that they were not originally proclaimed to be part of Queensland. The Islanders have always shared those islands with the Papuans. They are uninhabited and have very hmited resources. The fart that they are within the protected zone answers many of the worries expressed by previous speakers in the debate. Because they are in the protected zone, the Torres Strait Islanders can use them as they have always done traditionally. That is of very great importance. They are not important islands. I do not believe that we have any claim to them. The fact that the Torres Strait Islanders can continue to use them in the traditional way is very important. Finally I would like to compliment the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Ebia Olewale. He and I are in a unique position in that we share an electoral boundary in the Torres Strait. He, like myself, has been very concerned with this problem. But I am delighted to say that he has taken a national approach to the problem and not a parochial approach, although I imagine that he has been under as much pressure from his constituents in the area as I have been from mine. So I would like to thank him publicly in the House for his statesmanlike part in these negotiations. I believe that a very good solution has been reached. I hope that at a later time we will have more time to debate this very important problem. I believe that this is the first time a member of this Parliament can say that this problem is in his electorate. This does not happen very often. I would be very grateful for the chance to speak at greater length on it at another time. Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister and his officials, one of whom is sitting in the chamber, for the excellent job they have done under very difficult conditions.",52
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,"I was about to call the honourable member for Higgins, but I notice that both he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are on their feet.",53
128,Mr SHIPTON,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,I thought that I had a few minutes in which to speak. I also thought that the debate would be continued on another day. I think in the circumstances that I should move that the debate be adjourned.,53
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,I ask the honourable member for Higgins to resume his seat if he does not intend to speak in the debate.,53
130,Mr BRYANT,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,I take it that the debate will be resumed.,53
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,Is the honourable member raising a point of order?,53
132,Mr BRYANT,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,I want to ask a question about the resumption of the debate.,53
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENT OF RESERVATIONS BY MR JACOBI,"I call the Minister. I hope he will clear up the situation.  Foreign Affairs) (2.45)- I understand that it is the case that the debate will be resumed, although arrangements seem to have been chopped about a bit. I will do my best to ensure that that is the case. Because I am going overseas on the weekend I would like to answer the questions which were posed. I am not closing the debate, of course, because the motion was moved by my colleague the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom). I thank honourable members who have expressed appreciation and support in relation to this matter and for the references to the officials who assisted me during the period of negotiation. I concur in those views. They worked extraordinarily hard. I shall deal, first of all, with the questions raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). Turnagain excluded from the 50/50 sharing because it is within-that is, is south of-th efisheriesline where it runs north of Boigu, Duaun and Saibai adjourned. and therefore is within the Australian fisheries jurisdiction. The question the honourable gentleman posed regarding Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa is answered by saying that the will be able to visit them for traditional purposes. That means that they will have access for their Commonwealth traditionalfishing-not merely for swimming fish of but also, for example, for mud crabs. I turn to the observations and questions of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), particularly those in regard to the Great North Eastern Channel. There will be the usual freedoms of navigation through this strait and the channel, and Australia will maintain navigational aids for the channel. The honourable member's final question referred to the share of the take of commercialfishin the three mile territorial seas around Australian islands north of the sea-bed line but, as I recall it, south of the fisheries delimitation Une. This will be 75 per cent Australian, 25 per cent Papua New Guinean in regard to the commercial take, but both Islanders and Papua New Guineans will be free to fish traditionally. I will not take much more of the time of the House. Without engaging in any poUtics, I simply wish to answer one other observation-it was not a question-mad e by the honourable member for Hawker. He observed that this situation had come about as a consequence of the initiative of the Labor Government. Without detracting from what the Labor Government did so far as Papua New Guinea is concerned, I point out that the first interdepartmental committee which was established on this question was set up in 1972 when I was Minister for External Territories. The report of that committee was made avaUable to the incoming Minister at the time of the change of government. I will keep the Opposition informed as we move towards the negotiation of the treaty and naturally, as was put, I will keep the Torres Strait Islanders and the Queensland Government informed, as they have been so informed. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) has participated extensively because his constituents have been involved in this matter. I gready appreciate not only his remarks today but also his ready co-operation throughout. When his primary interest had to be his own constituents, he was at least prepared at all times to listen to my viewpoint. For that reason, I exIsland is press great appreciation. Debate (on motion by Mr Shipton) NA",53
134,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION," I move: (1) That the House of Representatives agrees that the Parliament participate with the Parliaments the States in the continuing work of the Constitutional Convention established to review the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and accordingly resolves: (a) That, for the purposes of the Convention(i) a delegation from the Commonwealth Parliament consisting of 16 members of the Parliament take part in the deliberations of the Convention, of whom 6 shall be members of the Senate and 10 shall be members of the House of Representatives; (ii) the 10 members of the House of Representatives comprise 3 members of the Liberal Party of Australia, 2 members of the National Country Party of Australia and 5 members of the Australian Labor Party: (b) That(i) the Prime Minister and 4 other members of the House of Representatives, 2 being members of the Liberal Pany of Australia and 2 being members of the National Country Party of Australia, nominated by him; and (ii) the Leader of the Opposition and 4 other members of that House, being members of the Australian Labor Party, nominated by him, be members of the Delegation. (c) That the Prime Minister be the Leader of the Delegation, and the Leader of the Opposition be the Deputy Leader: (d) That a member of the Delegation cease to be such a member if(i) he ceases to be a member of the Commonwealth Parliament; (ii) the House of the Parliament of which he is a member terminates his appointment; or (iii) he resigns as a member of the Delegation by writing addressed to the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the case requires: (e) That where, because of illness or any other cause, a member of the Delegation is not available to attend a meeting, or part of a meeting, of the Convention, the Leader or senior available member of the Party in the House from which the member was drawn may nominate an alternate member (being a member of the House of which the first-mentioned member is a member) and the member so nominated shall be a member of the Delegation for that meeting, or that part of that meeting: (f) That, in the event of a member of the Delegation ceasing to be such a member, the Leader of the Party in the House from which the member was drawn may nominate another member (being a member of the House of which the first-mentioned member is or was a member) to replace the first-mentioned member: (g) That the Leader of the Delegation fromtimeto time make areportfor presentation to each House of the Parliament on matters arising out of the Convention, and that the Deputy Leader of the Delegation may make an accompanying report. (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of the resolution agreed to by the House of Representatives. The next plenary session of the Australian Constitutional Convention is scheduled to be held at Parliament House in Perth over the three-day period 26-28 July 1978. The terms of the motion which I have just moved are identical with those appointing the Commonwealth parliamentary delegation to the last plenary session of the Convention at Hobart in 1976. This parliament will again have a delegation of 16-comprisin g eight from the Government and eight from the Opposition. The Government's representation will remain unchanged from 1976, namely myself, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair), the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers), the Minister for Science (Senator Webster), the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), the Minister for Home Affairs and the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). The honourable Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has informed me of the names of the Opposition's representatives in the delegation, and I shall be writing to the Chairman of the Convention, Sir Charles Court, in the near future, informing him of the composition of this Parliament's delegation. I understand that the details of the agenda the plenary session, which contains some 18 ing items, will be publicly announced by Sir Charles in the near future. The Government's view is that it is desirable that at least one more plenary session of the Constitutional Convention is held so that the continuing work of the Convention reviewing the operation of the Australian Constitution may proceed further. Honourable members will recall that the original impetus the Constitutional Convention came from Sir Henry Bolte's Liberal Government in Victoria; and, particularly at the Hobart session in 1976, valuable work has already been performed by the Convention. I believe we can all recall with some satisfaction the overwhelming approval given by the Australian electorate in May last year to the three referendum proposals, each of which had first been approved in principal at the Constitutional Convention. The plenary sessions of the Convention provide a rare opportunity for delegates from the legislatures of the Commonwealth, each of the States and the Northern Territory, together with representatives of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory and of local government, to meet together and exchange views. The Convention provides a unique forum for discussion of fundamental constitutional issues. I commend to the House this motion which seeks to ratify the continued participation of this Parliament in the endeavours of the Australian Constitutional Convention.",54
135,Mr HAYDEN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"In responding to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), I wish to advise that the delegates from the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to the Australian Constitutional Convention to be held at Perth in July will be, apart from myself, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), and, from the Senate, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button, and Senator James MCClelland and Senator Ted Robertson. I wish it to be noted on the record also that it is my wish to nominate at appropriate times proxies, particularly from some of the senators who will be arriving after 1 July next and who were not eligible for election under our Caucus rules to this delegation to the Convention, as they would not be, up to the point of 1 July, members of the Caucus. I note that although there have been a number of conferences of the Convention, it is largely as for an outsider, as it were, that I have been reviewthe procedures and the results. The results do not seem all that inspiring. I think it incontestable, following the report of the 1958 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, that there are serious, and extensively serious, deficiencies in in the Australian Constitution. So far the product of the 1976 Convention has for been referenda on four items-simultaneou s elections of the Houses of this Parliament, voting rights for the Territories, retiring ages forjudges, and the procedure for making appointments to casual vacancies which arise in the Senate. The last three of those questions were carried. The first, which in my view was the most important of all those four items, was defeated. I do not regard, although it is not unimportant, the imposition of a retiring age forjudges as important as many other matters which need attention, if there is to be effective reconstruction of the Australian Constitution and if it is to become a neutral document which does not impede but in fact facilitates the social, economic and cultural development of this country. I regret that in the view of so many people in Australia today the Constitution in fact is not seen as neutral; rather it is seen as a device for frustration, one that causes deceptive practices. It certainly does not guarantee the fundamentalrightsof the citizens of this community, and where it does guarantee rights it tends to guarantee them as a conservative instrument would-that is, it fails to protect broadly rights in the community, but rather entrenches privileged position. I mention, for instance, that it encourages ceptive practices. I recollect clearly during period when I was Minister for Social Security noting an advising from the Attorney-General's Department that long-standing legislation viding for the Australian Government's involveauthority ment in the provision of accommodation for the aged was unconstitutional. Now a succession governments have understood that. What has happened is that quite unconstitutionally a much earlier conservative government legislated to provide programs under the particular Act. It properly the province of State governments. State governments, for reasons which I think fairly obvious, have not been terribly keen to challenge this intrusion of the Federal ment. They prefer the Federal Government to bear the significant costs which are involved in sustaining this program. The point I am making without labouring the unconstitutionality of this matter and the fact that the unconstitutionality tolerated is that it is quite wrong that these sorts of deceptive practices should be resorted to in effort to have implemented programs which are necessary in the community, which are sought the community but which are not being properly provided by the responsible level of authority. The need to clarify the powers within the Coneffectively stitution worries the Opposition. I refer, for stance, to the powers of the national Parliament. One area in which I have a great and consistent interest is economic management and economic development. Within out federal system enormous impediments can be thrown up by a difficult State government should there be a national government which seeks quite consciously to undertake a program of economic development. If, for instance, it, as it must by necessity, be part of such a program that there should be regional development plans it is quite compatible for a State to subvert those intentions in a whole range of ways. This country has matured a great deal since 1901 when it federated. I believe that the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in its 1958 report made the point not once but many times that the inter-relationship of a national economy had developed far beyond what was conceived in 1901. We now have a mature single national economy not the sort of loose congregation of several separate economies as was believed to have existed at thetimeof Federation. It would be more beneficially helpful to the national interest if more authority were available for the national government in economic mangement. It is quite undesirable that important long term objectives in economic management can be so deeasily subverted by a hostile State government the more interested in short term political advantages than in the long term health of the nation. Similarly in social development it is quite clear prothat if the national Government had had more in this area many more important social welfare programs would have been develof oped on a national basis. I am talking about social development in its broadest context, not just social welfare programs. Again, in industrial relations, various devices are resorted to in an is effort to establish what I suspect is a rather fragile authority in many ways to enable the are national government through industrial arbitration and conciliation agencies to attend effecGoverntively to industrial disputes. But probably the most important authority which has to be clarified and clarified beyond any doubt, is that of the head of state. The head is of state who is an appointee should not have the authority to frustrate or dismiss a government, as an we experienced in 1975. The head of state of this country is an appointee. He is not reckonable in by the way in which the Government is reckonable to the people. On assuming his position he becomes very largely reckonable only to himself. There is no accounting system which can be brought to bear against the incumbent inof that office as we discovered-w e the community; not just the Labor Party-in 1975. The powers of that office bearer are enormous. The Governor General can veto, at his discretion, laws which are passed by this Parliament. He is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Services. A whole range of other authorities are available to him. These authorities were defined upon the assumption that they would be exercised responsibly and on the advice of the responsible Ministers of the Crown. That had always been the assumption until 1975 when the incumbent of the office of the head of state made it clear that that was a convention which could be destroyed effectively overnight. What happens if we have in the office of Governor General a person whose ethical stanof dards, unknown to the people who have clear appointed him, are questionable, who is not prefrustrating pared to maintain neutrality in his office and who is even prepared to go so far as to do a deal with a political party so that it is advantaged to disadvantage of government? In that situation Government. we would need some sort of accounting procedure to make sure that the checks and balances are working all the way along the line. The way in which I can see that being done is clear definition of the authority of the office the head of state and its limitations being written into the Constitution. The limitations of the of state are obvious. He acts on the advice of with the consent of the Ministers of the Crown. In case it is felt that I make too much of point and that the Opposition is querulous in continuing with this matter because of its experisystem ences in 1975,1 draw the attention of honourable members to an article which appeared on page of the Age newspaper of 24 May. It is a potted version of Mr Don Chipp's book Don Chipp, The Third Man in which Mr Chipp relevantly says of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser): His relationship with Sir John Kerr was unusual. a Labor background and was appointed by Whitlam as Governor General. During the weeks up to our decision to block Supply, Fraser saw Kerr on several occasions. He never informed us of the and to my knowledge he did not break confidence to any of his shadow Cabinet colleagues. But at each shadow meeting he showed an unbending confidence that Kerr 'on side'. That is an account of a thoroughly undesirable situation. It must rock the confidence of the people of this community. Mr Chipp is saying very clearly that in his view an arrangement been arrived at that the Governor General made it clear that he would accommodate the quite proper objectives of the then Opposition Leader in his desire to grasp government in whatever way he could. The then Opposition Leader could not have done that unless he was facilitated the former Governor General. For me it was quite a disillusioning experience earlier this year to note the way in which the former Governor General obtained an appointment to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the circumstances associated with that, especially the Prime Minister's outrageously cynical and contriving behaviour. The Governor General had been wrong, in my assessment, in terminating the period of the Labor Government although it was a difficult time to handle for him. The Labor Government still had six or seven weeks or a little longer of Supply to go and some members the Liberal Party in the Senate were making it that they were not prepared to continue the exercise that had been undertaken in the Senate to prevent the passage of the Budget. I thought it was inappropriate for the then Goverthe nor-General to have terminated the office of the I confessed then and I confess again that I had only always hoped that the widespread suspicions for a and hard assertions which were made from of many quarters that an arrangement had been arrived at between the present Prime Minister head and the then Governor General were wrong. I and had that hope very simply because our system cannot function successfully unless we have the people of integrity who are prepared to uphold the conventions which are necessary to make the work. Not every standard that is required in our society, socially or in its institutional 9 forms, to make it function properly can be legislated upon. Simply stated, unless those standards are upheld there cannot be requisite public confidence in our system to ensure its best functioning. Proper standards of conduct-self restraint, dedication, self-discipline, a range of Kerr had qualities-ar e required to make the system work. Yet here we have the clear evidence, once again restated, that the system was corrupted. I again nature of those conversations, remind the House that until early this year, when the Kerr affair broke out, there was no record of Cabinet me condemning the man personally, except that was I made an observation about the premature way in which he dismissed the Government when it still had several weeks of Supply left to it. But I can no longer hold that sort of restrained view, especially when an insider, a man close to the had Prime Minister, Don Chipp-and whatever faults he may have in the view of the Governimment, it must admit he has always been a direct and candid man-say s that the present Prime Minister returned constantly to shadow Cabinet meetings and reported regularly that Kerr was by 'on side'. The man sold himself out, it would appear, body and soul. He allowed himself to be bound hand and foot by the then Leader of the Opposition. It is absolutely necessary that the enormous range of powers that are available to the viceregal representative in this country are clearly denned and adequately circumscribed not only so that the democratic system can function but so that the confidence of the people in this community can be re-established. That is one of the most important tasks that ought to be undertaken. There are other matters, such as the question of the electoral laws. We do not have an inalienable right to vote. We have no guarantee that the electoral boundaries will not beriggedto favour a government in office that is worried about its future. The powers of the Upper House must be clearly defined and its position as a house of review and not of frustration must be clearly established. Those are some of the things that are required. Most of all, we need a text not only that laymen can understand but, even more, that judges cannot misunderstand and misinterpret. It is my wish that the attention of the Convention be directed towards those things. From what I have seen as an outsider, in the sense that I have not been a delegate thus far, I am afraid that that is not very likely. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Street, and read a first time.",55
136,Mr STREET,TRADE UNION TRAINING AUTHORITY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Australia has adopted a distinctive approach to trade union training. It has three elements: Firsdy, public funding of union training; secondly, the planning, development and provision of training by an independent authority set up by Act of Parliament, which is, I believe, unique; and thirdly, the establishment of a National Trade Union Training College and trade union training centres in each State. The approach recognises that trained trade unionists, no less than trained management, are of critical importance to the community and that without public support for trade union training little progress is likely. I wish, on behalf of the Government, to tribute to the architect of all this, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). It is particularly fitting that he should be permanently remembered in the name of the National Trade Union Training College, the Clyde Cameron College. Honourable members will recall that the legislation providing for a Trade Union Training Authority passed through this Parliament some three years ago. It received the support of all parties, and I trust that this bipartisan support is maintained as the present amendments progress through both Houses. The Government has consistentiy expressed its support for the concept of trade union training. However, in 1976-77 it found itself faced with a number of important policy issues regarding its future development in Australia. These issues included: Should trade union training be part of a wider industrial relations training or continue to be separate? What was in the best interests of all concerned? Was the organisational structure of the Authority, with an Australian Council, six State councils and directors of the National College and State centres, all with some executive authority, the most efficient and effective? What were the training needs of trade unionists? The Australian Countil for Union Training had adopted an annual training objective of one per cent of trade unionists, but this did not have any established basis. Should trade union training provided by the Authority be solely public funded or should Second Reading there be some commitment on the part of the trade union movement itself, in Une with the arrangements overseas? The Government felt that it needed a fresh examination, and a more detailed one than was possible by the Australian Council for Union Training. As honourable members will be aware, in 1977 it estabUshed a tripartite Committee of Inquiry into Trade Union Training. The Committee of Inquiry examined over 400 submissions and had discussions with approximately 100 persons throughout the country. The Committee completed its report in August last and it was tabled in this Parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to express my public appreciation of the work of the Committee and the assistance which it has been to the Government. Detailed comments on the recommendations of the inquiry were invited from the Australian Council for Union Training and from the empay ployer and union peak councUs represented on the National Labour Consultative Council. There were further discussions in the NLCC and the Australian Council and a top level deputation from the peak union councils put additional views. All the comments have been carefully considered and have helped considerably in determining the future development of the Authority. On the key issues, the Committee recommended: Trade union training should not be integrated into a general system of industrial relations training. There should be a complete evaluation to determine the specific extent of training required, both as to numbers and course content. Trade union training should continue to be funded by Government, with funds to be provided commensurate with the Authority's training program. The Trade Union Training Authority should be retained as an independent statutory body, an independent training institution. However, technical and further education has the potential to provide training and offers scope for the rationalisation of training resources. The Government has accepted the general thrust of these conclusions. The report also proposed some changes in the composition of the Australian and State Councils for Union Trairiing, while at the sametimeretaining the basic structure. The Government considers that it is necessary to go further than the Committee recommends to provide for more efficient and effective management of the Authority. As I have indicated, currently there is an Australian Council of sixteen members and six State councils each with specific powers, as well as a Director responsible for the affairs of the National College and six State directors responsible for the State centres. Following detailed consideration, including the consultations which I have previously mentioned, the Government has decided to establish a small Executive Board of eight members. The Executive Board will be parttimeand will be responsible for the formulation of the policy of the Authority. Complementary to this, a new position of National Director will be created. He will be responsible for the conduct of its affairs cordance with policy determined by the Executive Board and any policy directions it gives but, as a member of the board, will participate fully in the formulation of that policy. The Government also proposes to expand the responsibilities of the present position of Director of the Clyde Cameron College. The position will be retitled Director of Studies. As the name implies he will, under the National Director, be responsible for the management and provision of all training by the Authority, not only at the College but in each of the State trade union training centres. These changes will provide for more effective policy formulation and management of the Authority. Honourable members will appreciate that streamlining of the executive and management responsibilities will naturally change the present role of the Australian and State CouncUs for Union Training. The Government sees advantage in maintaining these bodies to advise on trade union training programs and their effectiveness. The importance of the advisory role, particularly of the Australian Council, is underlined by the direct Unk which the legislation provides between the Council and the Executive Board. Not only will all members of the Executive Board be drawn from the Australian Countil, but the Board'wiU reflect the different interests represented on the Australian Council. Thus the Board will comprise a chairman, who will be the Chairman of the Australian Council, the National Director of the Authority, the employer and departmental members of the Council, and four union members drawn from the union members of the Council. I should like to refer to the proposed involvement of employers on the Executive Board and the councUs of the Authority. Honourable members who have had the opportunity of reading the report of the Committee of Inquiry will be aware of its emphasis on greater employer involvement in training activity. The Authority has already provided for employer input to some extent at the College and the State centres, and participation of employers at all levels will further faciUtate this. Perhaps even more important, however, employer representation at both the policy and advisory levels will bring a broader insight and perspective to trade union training. This is important, bearing in mind that industrial relations involves both employers and unions. Added to this, such areas as paid educational leave concern the employers no less than the unions. The amendments also provide for the in acAuthority's closer involvement with technical and further education. As honourable members will see from the Bill, under the new arrangements the Tertiary Education Commission will be represented on the Australian Council and the appropriate TAFE bodies wiU be represented on the State CouncUs. This is in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry. In making the changes proposed in the legislation the Government has been particularly conscious of their possible impact on the staff of the Authority. The legislation protects all present officers and employees of the Authority. They will be able to continue in the service of the Authority under the terms and conditions they currently have. The Government is conscious of the need to maintain a proper balance of interests in relation to trade union training. On the one hand it is important that the trade unions are able to participate effectively in the formulation of policy and programs and have confidence in the Authority's activities. Thus union interests remain in the majority on the Australian Council and each of the six State Councils for Union Training. Equally, trade union training, provided through a statutory authority and funded by the taxpayer, must have regard to community interests, and the Government believes that the balanced membership of the Executive Board recognises that need. The changed structure within the organisation will make for a more effective pursuit of the objectives of the Authority, namely, the planning, provision and oversight of trade union training in Australia. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. LOAN AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Garland (on behalf Mr Howard), and read a first time.",58
137,Mr GARLAND,TRADE UNION TRAINING AUTHORITY,"Curtin-Minister for Special Trade Representations and Minister for Vetnot erans' Affairs) (3.18)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Loan 1977 to increase by $300m the amount which legislation, may be borrowed for defence purposes to meet prospective increase in the Consolidated Revquire enue Fund deficit for 1977-78. In the second cU. reading speech on the Loan Bill 1977 the reexisting lationship between the overall Budget deficit and a potential deficit in the Consolidated Revenue fund was explained in some detail. Honourable members were informed that a Loan Bill is the simplest and the traditional means of providing appropriate legislative authority for avoiding a members. Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit, by enabling defence expenditure to be reallocated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Fund. Such a method has been adopted for many years by successive governments. At the time of the Loan Bill 1977 the Budget estimates envisaged a prospective deficit Consolidated Revenue Fund of $90 lm. The Loan Bill sought authority for borrowings for the purpose offinancingdefence expenditures to a limit of $ 1,100m, to provide a relatively small margin over the estimated Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit. At the same time, it was explained that the estimate of the Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit was inevitably a qualified one and that the actualfigurewould be affected by unforeseen developments during the year which would cause departures from the Budget estimates of receipts and expenditure of the Fund. Because of a number of unforeseen developments it now appears possible that the earlier authority could prove to be insufficient, given the inherent uncertainties which still surround many of the estimates. Even at this stage, we cannot be certain of the extent to which it will be necessary to use the additional authority now sought. There is always some uncertainty about a figure which is, in effect, the residual of the receipts and expenditure of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, both of which are now, of course, very large aggregates. Minor variations in such aggregates can produce relatively very large changes in the residual. This Bill seeks Parliament's authority to charge up to an additional $300m of defence expenditure in 1977-78 to the Loan Fund, bringing the total to $ 1,400m, and to endorse the of necessary increase in borrowing authority. I emphasise that the effect of the Bill is simply to Second Reading permit the reallocation of defence expenditure between two of the funds which record the Commonwealth 'sfinancialtransactions. The Bill does authorise any defence expenditure over and above that approved and appropriated by the Parliament in the Appropriation Bills. BorrowAct ings under this Bill, as with previous similar will be for the purpose of financing a defence expenditure and will not, therefore, reapproval from the Australian Loan CounOn present indications it is our belief that the authority, which enables defence expenditure to be reallocated to the Loan Fund, will be fully availed of by the end of this month. It is therefore essential that an additional authority, in the form proposed in this Bill, be approved quickly. I commend the Bill to honourable Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NA AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Garland (on behalf of in the Mr Howard), and read afirsttime.",60
138,Mr GARLAND,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"Curtm-Minister for Special Trade Representations and Minister for Veterans'Affairs) (3.23)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The Bill which is before the House has two main parts. Thefirstconcerns the alterations to the International Monetary Agreements Act which are necessitated by the second amendment of the International Monetary Fund's Articles of Agreement, and certain minor alterations to that Act which need to be made for other reasons. The second part of the Bill will empower the Government to consent to the increase in Australia's quota subscription to the Fund proposed under the IMF's sixth general review of quotas, and to take up an increase in Australia's subscription to the authorised capital stock of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In March 1976 the Board of Governors of the IMF adopted a resolution approving increases in quotas of member countries of the Fund, and in April 1976 the Board of Governors adopted a resolution approving wide-ranging amendments to the Fund's Articles of Agreement, which was called the second amendment since an earlier scheme of amendments, related to establishment of the special drawing right, was adopted in 1969. Following approval by the Board of Governors both resolutions have been put to member countries for their individual consent, with members being required to give or withhold consent to the second amendment as a whole, and to give or withhold consent to the quota increase proposed for their own country by the sixth general review of quotas. The second amendment entered into force on 1 April 1978, when it had been assented to by the majority of members specified under the Fund's Articles of Agreement. Since then the amended Articles of Agreement have governed the Fund in its dealings with all members, including those members which had not by that time given their assent to them. It remains, of course, for member countries such as Australia to pass legislation ing the Fund's amended Articles effect under their own law, and that purpose will be fulfilled by the present Bill. The majority required to give effect to the sixth general review of quotas was reached at the sametimeas that for the second amendment. This has meant that those members that have consented and paid the additional subscription involved may now operate on the basis of an increased quota while the quotas of other members including Australia remain unchanged. With the passage of this Bill, the Government will be able both to consent to the increased Second Reading quota for Australia and to make the consequent payment. Following the approval of the sixth general review of quotas by the IMF Board of Governors, the Board of Governors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development approved a resolution entitling most member countries, including Australia, to take up specified increases in their subscription to the capital stock of the Bank so as to maintain approximately the long-standing relativities between IMF quotas and IBRD subscriptions. The purchase by the Bank's members of additional capital stock requires the making of agreements between each member and the Bank, under the normal terms of which 10 per cent of the additional subscription is paid in and the balance remains on call. This Bill will provide authority for the Treasurer to make an agreement under which Australia will purchase an additional 779 shares in the capital stock at the Bank under those terms. I wish now to comment on the second amendment of the Fund's Articles. The task of up-dating the Fund's Articles of Agreement commenced in 1974, following completion of the study of reform of the international monetary system by the Fund's committee of twenty. When, after a two-year process of consideration and negotiation in which Australia participated actively, the amendments to the Articles were settled within the Fund's Executive Board and presented to the Governors of the Fund for consideration, the Treasurer of that time cast Australia's votes in favour of approving them. The final outcome, while inevitably reflecting compromise between the differing interests and views of members, involves a comprehensive revision of the Fund's operating arrangements, in the light of the substantial changes in the international monetary system which have occurred over the past decade. Among its more important features, the second amendment introduces new and flexible provisions dealing with international exchange arrangements, a gradual regivduction in the role of gold in the international monetary system, changes in the characteristics and expansion of the uses of the special drawing right that are intended to enhance its status as an international reserve asset, and the simplification and expansion of the Fund'sfinancialoperations and transactions. The changes relating to international exchange arrangements involve a recognition that the international monetary system has been transformed from the par value system, defined at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and embodied in the Fund's original Articles, to a looser system offloatingexchange rates for the major countries. The essence of amended Article IV, which deals with exchange rates, is to abandon requirements as to the exchange arrangements adopted by member countries and instead to define principles which members are committed to follow in their exchange rate policy. out the general principles for the orderly operation of the international monetary system and for surveillance by the Fund of the exchange rate and external policies of individual member countries. Article IV recognises that stability in exchange markets is largely dependent on the adoption of appropriate domestic economic policies by member countries. Agreement on the principles involved was reached last year following discussions in the Fund's Executive Board and Interim Committee. It is, of course, in the interest of all countries that members of the IMF avoid the adoption of disruptive exchange rate practices, such as competitive devaluations or other manipulations of exchange rates, that are mutually self-defeating and adversely affect levels of economic activity in the world. The Government strongly supports the principles on which this amended Article is based. A second set of changes to the Fund's Articles concerns the role of gold. The second amendvis ment will reduce the role of gold in the interthe national monetary system at large and in the erations of the Fund. Gold will no longer be Fund's numeraire or unit of account for expressMexico ing the values of currencies used in Fund transThe actions and of the Fund's special drawing rights. The amendments provide, among other things, for the abolition of an official gold price and the avoidance offixingof gold prices by official authorities. They will also end all obligatory ments in gold within the Fund. The amendments provide also for the disposal of 50 million ouncouncil ces-equivalen t to one third-of the Fund's gold, Fund. and for the possible disposal of the remainder of the Fund's gold. The disposal of gold by the Fund has already begun, under arrangements agreed to in August 1975 and January 1976 by corporated the Interim Committee. Over a four year period, 25 million fine ounces of gold will be restituted by the Fund to members in proportion to their quotas, at the official gold price of 35 SDR per ounce, which is of course only a fraction of the current market price for gold. Australia has so had 284,600 ounces of gold restored to it, through transactions which took place in January 1977 and January 1978. Under the same arnection rangements, another 25 million fine ounces the Fund's gold are being sold for the benefit developing countries. A third set of changes made through the amended Articles is a concomitant of these changes concerning gold. The special drawing right - o r SDR-wa s created in 1969 with the aim of establishing a controlled supplement to the global supply of reserve assets. Through the It sets second amendment to the Articles members have subscribed to the principle of making the Fund's SDR the principal reserve asset of the international monetary system. It is well understood, however, that this will be an evolutionary process; the second amendment explicitly requires that special drawing rights may only be allocated if there is a global need to supplement the existing stock of reserve assets, and in such a manner as will avoid exacerbating excess demand and world inflation. The main provisions concerning SDR in the amended Articles are a liberalisation of the conditions governing transactions in SDR among members of the Fund, a broadening of the range of operations within the Fund for which SDR may be used, and greater flexibility in the determination of the rate of interest on SDR holdings. The Australian government has consistently held the view that a necessary condition if the status of the SDR as a reserve asset is to be enhanced is an increase in the yield accruing to holders vis-athe yield on established reserve assets such as United States Dollar. In this context it is opinteresting to note that a decision was made at the the recent meeting of the Interim Committee in City to raise the interest yield on SDR. remaining changes involved in the second amendment to the Fund's articles, provide among other things, for the simplification and for expansion of the Fund'sfinancialtransactions, in particular those conducted through the General payResources Department of the Fund, and for the possible establishment of a twenty-member as a new organ of decision making in the I now turn to the alterations to the International Monetary Agreements Act which are inin this Bill insofar as they relate to the amended articles. With only one exception, they are alterations required to make the Act consistent with the amended articles of agreement of the Fund and to facilitate operations which are provided for in the amended articles, particularly far those involving SDR. The exception is that this Bill provides for amending the Act so as to empower the Treasurer to issue securities in conwith payments required to be made by of Australia to the Fund and Bank. Under the of present Act this power is conferred on the Governor General and not on the Treasurer. The change is proposed on the ground of adminisappropriate trative efficiency. There is no question tutional or legal principle involved, since the change will make practice in this matter consistent with that in other situations where the Treasurer is empowered to authorise the issue of from the Fund securities. The second amendment of the Fund's articles of agreement does not alter in any significant way the IMF'S basic functions of assisting member countries in balance of payments difficulties by the provision of short to mediumAustraUa's termfinanceand by the provision of guidance to members in formulating appropriate corrective policies. The fundamental policy commitment reserve which members make through their membership of the Fund is to overcome their balance of paycourse, ments difficulties without resort to restrictions current international transactions, and thus avoid damaging an open and prosperous world economic system. This basic function which IMF performs is a valuable contribution to the functioning of a stable international monetary system, and I commend to the House the amendrelative ments of the Fund's articles which strengthen fund and improve its efficiency. The Bill also cerns the important matters of additional tralian subscriptions to the IMF and the IBRD. Both the former and the amended articles provide for general reviews of quotas to be conducted, at intervals of not more than five years, to enable the size of the Fund to be expanded periodically if necessary, to keep step with the growth of international payments and the calls on the Fund's resources. The quota increases proposed for each member in the resolution in March 1976 to which I referred earlier would raise the total of present quotas, amounting 29.2 billion SDR, to 39 billion SDR. The sixth general review of quotas provides for an increase in Australia's quota from 665 million SDR to a quota of 790 million SDR. The size of quota increases proposed for particular members is determined partly by reference to movements in such variables as trade, GDP, and reserves, and partly by a discretionary process through negotiation. The increase in Australia's quota is somewhat less than adequate, having gard to the increases proposed for some other member countries of the Fund whose growth in income and trade has been no greater and in Hansard. some cases less than Australia's. For this reason the Treasurer, at the time this was decided, abstained from voting on the resolution on quota increases put before the Fund's board of governors. But, having registered our point, it is now for Australia to take up the increase of constiwhich has been proposed. The increase in Australia's quota involves enlargement of Australia's potential drawing rights which are avaUable for use at a time of balance of payments need. It also involves a corresponding increase in the amount of foreign exchange Australia may be required to provide tofinancedrawings from the Fund by other members when Australia is in a strong balance of payments position. Any such calls on holdings of foreign exchange would, however, be offset by an increase in Australia's position in the fund and no change in the level of Australia's international reserves would therefore be involved, although there would, of be an alteration in the composition of reon serves. The increase in Australia's quota will also to bring a corresponding increase in the number of votes Australia has in decision making within the the Fund, although since our proposed quota increase under the sixth general review is less than proportional to the overall increase, Australia's voting strength will be marginally the reduced. The desirabUity of preserving our convoting strength makes it the more necessary to Ausconsent to the quota increase proposed. I point out that the quota increase will have no effect on the Budget or on the level of Australia's reserves. In accordance with the amended articles, the payment of the additional quota subscription will take the form of transferring to the Fund an amount of Australian currency equivalent to 125 million SDR, in the form of a non-negotiable non-interest-bearing promissory to note. I conclude with a brief mention of the proposed increased Australian subscription to the capital stock of the IBRD. As I have already mentioned, the decision by the board of governors of the Bank, to approve an increase in the Bank's authorised capital stock, was taken so as to approximately maintain the long-standing relativities between IMF quotas and IBRD subscriptions. As a consequence, the increased subscription entitlements of member countries approximate to their relative quota increases in the reIMF. The increases authorised for individual countries are shown in the attached table, which I ask leave of the House to have incorporated in Leave granted.

As I ' l g mentioned earlier, Australia is entitled to take up 25 an additional 779 shares in the capital stock of the IBRD. The total commitment involved is about $US94m. However, 90 per cent of this amount will remain on call as security for the IBRD's own borrowing operations on world capital markets, and only 10 per cent, that is $US9.4m is actually payable. Of the latter sum, $US940,000 is payable in cash while the balance, $US8.46m, will be paid in the form of a promissory note which will be encashed in approximately equal instalments over four financial years commencing 1978-79. The IBRD is an effective and efficient institution in the provision of development assistance to developing countries, and it plays an important role in our region. This has been recognised by Australian governments over the years since the establishment of the Bank in 1947 by the consistent support Australia has given the Bank's activities. The proposed increase in the capital stock of the IBRD will assist the Bank in continuing its operations at an effective level and Australia's proposed subscription will serve to confirm our support of it. I commend this Bill to the House and draw the attention of honourable members to the desirsome ability of early approval of the Bill in order able the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to exercise the proposed increased votingrightsfor Australia the next regular elections of executive directors of the Fund and the Bank in September. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL Bill presented by Mr Garland (on behalf Mr Howard), and read afirsttime.",61
139,Mr GARLAND,INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES,"Curtin-Minister for Special Trade Representations and Minister for erans' Affairs) (3.45)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to provide some new exemptions and to change some existby ing exemptions for imported goods. The Bill has four main features: Firstly, it will give effect the joint announcement by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) and the Treasurer (Mr able Howard) on 30 March 1978 that sunscreen prepWhere arations that provide effective protection from damaging ultra-violet rays would be exempted from sales tax. Drugs and medicines are already exempt and it is proposed that these sunscreen preparations should also be exempted because of their importance as a preventative health measure in the field of skin cancer, sunburn and general skin damage. To quaUfy for the new exemption, a preparation wiU need to meet two requirements. It will have to be put up and sold for use as a substance to be applied to the skinforthe purpose of screening out solar ultra-violet rays. Also, there must be in force in respect of the preparation a certificate given by the Director-General of Health, or his appointee, certifying that the product is a preparation that provides an acceptable level of protection from solar ultra-violet rays. The efficiency of sunscreen preparations in filtering out damaging rays has already been the subject of regular testing arranged by the Australian Government Analyst. The results of these tests will provide useful data for the classification of products already tested. The second of the Bill's main features is the restoration of several sales tax exemptions relating to imported goods. Certain sales tax exemptions which are complementary to customs exemptions refer expressly to the relevant customs tariff provisions. Due to changes in the tariti"" of the sales tax exemptions have become to eninoperative and it is proposed that they be restored. The exemptions relate mainly to printed at matter such as imported travel literature designed to promote travel overseas and certain imported catalogues, price lists and comparable printed matter which is not designed to advertise the sale of goods or services by persons in Australia. The Bill will also bring certain sales tax exemptions relating to goods imported by 1978 persons arriving in Australia into line with correof sponding customs exemptions. These sales tax and customs provisions are normally kept in harmony to faciUtate the clearance of travellers Second Reading through Customs. The sales tax amendments now proposed arise because of changes that have Vetbeen made to the complementary customs provisions. Both sales tax and customs duty exemptions Tax apply where a passenger imports a vehicle or boat which has been owned and used overseas the passenger for a period of 15 months before leaving for Australia. The customs law proto vides also that where a vehicle or boat has not been owned for 15 months, full duty is not payunless the shortfall is more than 14 days. the shortfall is 14 days or less, duty is payable on a sliding scale which increases as the shortfall increases. A similiar cushioning period is now to be provided for sales tax purposes. At present the sales tax exemption for goods imported by persons arriving in Australia is limited to goods imported by passengers. Under the complementary customs exemption members of the crew of ships or aircraft, who are of Australian domicile, are entitled on a once-a-year basis to duty-free concessions similar to those available to passengers. A comparable sales tax exemption is now to be given. In the interests of economic administration, the law provides that sales tax and duty are not to be collected on imported goods where only small amounts of revenue are involved. The sales tax provision is to be altered to keep in step with the changes that have been made to the levels applicable for customs purposes. Finally, it is proposed by the Bill to give servicemen of Papua New Guinea, and certain civilians accompanying them, limited sales tax concessions for importation of personal effects, furniture, household goods and motor vehicles. The concessions, which are a little more liberal than those available to ordinary passengers arriving in Australia, are required in fulfilment of Australia's obligations under the Status of Forces Agreement between the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea. The Bill also contains some amendments of a drafting nature. They are mainly concerned with bringing references to customs tariff provisions in sales tax exemptions into line with the current terms of the tariff. It is customary for sales tax changes to come into operation on the day following the introduction of the amending Bills and the Bill provides that the amendments now proposed are to be effective from tomorrow, 26 May 1978. A memorandum explaining the provisions of the Bill in detail is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. OMBUDSMAN AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Garland (on behalf of Mr Viner), and read a first time.",65
140,Mr GARLAND,INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES,"Curtin-Minister for Special Trade Representations and Minister for Veterans'Affairs) (3.52)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Ombudsman Act 1976 empowered the Commonwealth Ombudsman to investigate grievances by members of the public about ministrative actions of officials and staff of monwealth departments, statutory authorities and other government agencies. Because of the responsibilities of the Commonwealth in relation to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory it was necessary for the Ombudsman Act to ensure that residents of those Territories also had access to the Ombudsman in respect of matters that in the States would be directed to State ombudsmen. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction therefore currently extends to the actions of the Northern Territory Public Service. As part of the Northern Territory devolution package the Government approved the exclusion of the Northern Territory Public Service from the Ombudsman Act. This Bill excludes the Northern Territory Public Service from the Ombudsman Act with regard to transferred functions and facilitates the commencement of the Northern Territory Ombudsman. An Ombudsman (Northern Territory) Ordinance was passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 30 November 1977 and it is intended that the commencement of the Ordinance be co-ordinated with the amendment of the Ombudsman Act. In line with the transfer of powers from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory a smooth transition of responsibilities from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory Ombudsman is most desirable and to this end the Bill contains appropriate transitional provisions to ensure, for example, the completion of investigations begun by the Commonwealth Ombudsman prior to the date of transition. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction in respect of administrative actions undertaken by Commonwealth officials in the Northern Territory will be maintained as it currently is in relation to the States. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NA 1978 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time. Second Reading Second Reading Mr FIFE (Farrer-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (3.55)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. This Bill provides for the validation until 31 December 1978 of duties collected in pursuance of Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 13 and 14 (1978) introduced into the Parliament on 24 adMay and not covered by Customs Tariff AmendComment Bill (No. 2) 1978 now before the Parliament. Under section 226 of the Customs Act the Collection of duties in pursuance of Customs Tariff Proposals is protected against legal challenge for six months or until the close of the session of Parliament, whichever occursfirst.The introduction and passage of a validation Bill is therefore a necessary machinery measure which takes over from section 226 pending the introduction of a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, anticipated for the Budget sittings, to enact the changes contained in the Proposals. The tariff changes validated by this Bill relate to the report by the Industries Assistance Commission on metal working machine tools and additions to Schedule A of the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement. Full details of the changes concerned were supplied to honourable members at thetimethe relevant tariff proposals were introduced. I commend the Bill to the House.

141,Mr GARLAND,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. May I first remind honourable members of the important place the defence service homes scheme holds in the array of Commonwealth programs of assistance to various sections of the community. It is one of the longest standing programs; it originated from legislation passed in 1918, 60 years ago. Since its inception, approximately 340,000 people have been assisted to own their own home. The loans granted include more than 180,000 that are still being repaid. The gross outlays on assistance since the inception of the scheme exceed $2,000m. The principal purpose of the Bill now before the House is to amend the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 to implement decisions taken by the Government in the context of its deUberations on the 1977-78 Budget and as a result of a more recent review of certain aspects of the scheme. One of the decisions announced at the time of the 1977-78 Budget was the extension of the quahfying period to be served by members of the Regular Defence Force in order to be eligible for a defence service homes loan. Persons who commence full-time service in the Defence Force on or after 17 August 1977 will become eligible for a loan on the completion of six years' continuous fuU-time service, subject to a commitment to render further full-time service. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for amendment of the definition of'regular serviceman' so that the new eligibility conditions may be applied to those whose service begins on or after 17 August 1977 without affecting the eligibility conditions that apply to those who were serving before 17 August 1977.1 emphasise that persons who commenced their full-time service before 17 August 1977 wU] continue to quaUfy for a defence service homes loan on the completion of three years' continuous full-time service. The proposed amendment will extend the quaUfying service to a period more commensurate with the benefits offered through defence service homes loans, and it will be consistent with, and will strengthen, the prevailing conditions of service for the Defence Forces that are designed to encourage longer service. By the proposed insertion of a new section 27B in the principal Act, the Bill will permit the Defence Service Homes Corporation to give a measure of preference in the aUocation of loans to those whose eligibility is based on war service. As a result of the review of the scheme during Second Reading the deliberations on the Budget, the Government decided that there would be no change in the existing highly-concessional interest rates on loans or in the maximum repayment period. I remind the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the interest rates on loans are 3.75 per cent on the first $12,000 and 7.25 per cent on the amount above $ 12,000. The maximum repayment period is 32 years. However, the practice of other lending institutions in charging a fee on loan applications will be introduced. Authority for this action and, where considered appropriate, refund of the whole or part of the fee, is incorporated in clause 6 of the Bill which provides for the insertion of a new section 27A in the principal Act. In addition to the changes which have already been announced the Bill makes two other major amendments to the existing defence service homes arrangements. Since the commencement of the scheme in 1919, insurance cover has been provided under the Act in respect of dwellings in which the Corporation has an interest. Over the years, amendments have been made to the insurance cover and conditions from time to time to conditions cover for beneficiaries in accordance with that generally avaUable from other insurers of dwellings. The terms and conditions of the cover are all contained in the Defence Service Homes Act and Regulations, with the result that amending legislation is required before even a minor change may be made. The Government believes that this necessity to amend the legislation has handicapped the proper functioning of the insurance scheme in the past. In order to provide operational flexibility to maintain insurance cover and conditions that are no less attractive than those available elsewhere, the Bill amends the Act to authorise the Corporation to provide insurance cover under terms set out in a Statement of Conditions. This will enable the terms and conditions to be amended by administrative, rather than legislative, process, thus allowing adequate flexibility to adjust quickly to industry changes. The Statement of Conditions is subject to the approval of the Minister and must be tabled in the Parliament when introduced and whenever varied. Clauses 11 and 15 of the Bill contain the proposed amendments affecting the defence service homes insurance scheme and are to come into operation on a date to be proclaimed. The second of the further amendments to which I referred is the recognition, for the purposes of the Defence Service Homes Act, of de facto relationships. This will bring the Act into line with other Commonwealth legislation and the practice of lending institutions. Consistent with the requirements of other Commonwealth legislation, to ensure that there is a substantial degree of permanency in the relationship before benefits are granted, the Bill requires the de facto stituting association to have been in existence for a continuous period of not less than three years before it will be recognised. The amendment will place a de facto spouse or widow of an eligible person in the same position as a de jure spouse or widow. It will enable a de facto spouse to be joined with the eligible person in the security, make a de facto widow eligible for a loan in her own right, and enable certain de facto widows to be granted relief in respect of commitments on their property under the same conditions as those applicable to de jure widows. Proposed amendments relating to the recognition of de facto relationships are contained in clauses 3,8 and 10 of the Bill. The amendment proposed in clause 9 is intended to overcome a problem whereby the Corporation, in the absence of a court order, is unable to distribute the balance of proceeds arising from the sale of a property as mortgagee in possession in joint tenancy cases where the joint tenancy has not been severed and one or more of the joint tenants cannot be located. The amendment is concerned only with joint tenancy cases and authorises payment, after the Minister has determined in accordance with section 36 (2) the persons appearing to him to be entitled to receive the balance, or such part of the balance as he considers proper to the available joint tenant or tenants. The restrictions imposed by the current legislation have caused hardship in some cases by delaying the payment of a share of the proceeds to persons in necessitous circumstances. The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a financial nature and are required either to overcome procedural problems and technical omissions or, consequential upon the Defence Service Homes Amendment Act 1977, to facilitate the operation of the financial arrangements applicable to the Corporation as from 1 July 1977. The latter amendments include authority for the transfer from the defence service homes trust account to Consolidated Revenue of fees and other moneys of a non-capital nature. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Uren) adjourned. FISHERIES AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Lionel Bowen had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe following words: 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House calls upon the Government to ensure that the guidelines determined by the Australian Fisheries Council in January 1977, to control foreign participation and give first priority to the local industry, are strictly observed'.",67
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"MrDrurnmond)Before the debate is resumed on this Bill and on the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this Bill, the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill and the Whaling Amendment Bill. I call the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.",68
143,Mr SAINSBURY,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"Iti s really a great pleasure for me to speak in the debate on the Fisheries Amendment Bill and the associated Bills because the fishing industry has become of tremendous importance in my electorate in the past few years. For that reason I am very pleased that at last the fishing industry is being looked at critically and sensibly by the Federal Government. In saying that, I am not being critical in any way of any other governments. There is one thing that needs to be remembered about fishermen; they are not a whingeing lot of people. They have their problems. They have had to take things into their own hands at times. I instance the events that occurred within my electorate when fishermen at Ulladulla decided to dump fish rather than sell them. They are not whingeing people in the sense that they believe in looking after themselves if that is possible. We now have before us the Fisheries Amendto ment Bill which provides a new challenge to the fishing industry and through which the Governon ment must play a very acdve part. Government back benchers set up a committee that has inappropriate operated for quite some months to look into fisheries situation. I am very pleased to know that a number of members of Parliament, both the Senate and in the House of Representatives, are quite well informed about fisheries and are taking the time on a continuing fishermen and those people involved in other parts of the fishing industry throughout Australia. As the chairman of that back bench committee and, as I said, as a member of Parliatralian ment who represents an area in whichfishingis important, where the industry employs many people and where it stiU has a tremendous potenis tial, I am very pleased to be speaking in the bate on this Bill. I would like to emphasise that the Bill is only vehicle for later regulation. I think that probably that is a sensible approach. There are many ters with respect to the 200-mUe Australian fishing zone that must be worked out, hopefully in very close consultation with the industry. The Fisheries Amendment Bill follows some very instance good work done by a working group set up Australian Fisheries Council. The report has been well read throughout thefishingindustry Australia and criticised in some areas. In fact, there is one point I should make the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party to the Fisheries Amendment Bill. The amendment calls on the House to accept all the provisions contained in the report of that workIt ing party. That would not be acceptable to the dustry. There are a number of recommendations in that working group report which are put up as proposals for critical review by the industry. viously, the industry would not want all those recommendations accepted on face value. For instance, the report contains a proposal for the setting up of an Australian fishing zone comably mittee. It is proposed that that committee should have amongst its members two representatives from the industry. Quite a number offishermenhave stated our government back bench committee that they would like a lot more industry representation that Australianfishingzone committee. We see that as being very important because whereas the AustraUanfishingzone committee will make recommendations when it is set up, it will not have the final say. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) in general will have the final say. It is important if those recommendations are have the full support of the industry that fishermen themselves can play an important part this committee. I am saying that the amendment proposed by the Australian Labor Party is in this instance because not all the the recommendations of the working group, meticulous as it was in looking at the problems of the in fishing industry as they will arise within the 200-mUe fishing zone, are acceptable at face value. That is the reason I could not accept the basis to contact amendment. Fishermen in Australia at the presenttimeare taking very strong views on this 200-mUe Ausfishing zone. There is a strong feeling within the industry that we must not sell out the AustraUanfishermento overseas interests. There also a strong fear, because of many Press redeports in the past few months, that we may be about to seU out to foreign interests. I am assured by the Minister that that will not be the case. a That does not mean to say that I will not continue to press the Minister continuously to rematmember that the Australian fishing industry is just waking up to some of its potential. Many parts of the industry have functioned efficiently and on an ever-increasing scope in recent years. I the southern blue-fin tuna industry, the by northern prawn industry and the western and Tasmanian cray industries. Those industries in have earned a tremendous amount of money in exports for Australia and technically they are which relates to very advanced. However, some other parts of the industry have not advanced. I instance the Bight fisheries. has been known for many years that there are ingreat many fish in the Great Australian Bight that have not been harvested to anywhere near the extent they could be harvested. It is only now Obthat boats are being buUt and leased from overseas in order to harvest the fish in these areas. Thefishermendo not want to be sold out. They are beginning to see potential in areas that probhad not been considered properly in past times. They want the Government to give the local fishermen as much scope as possible to expand their capacity to take up the tremendous challenge that is being offered. A number of joint to venture proposals have been advanced and are well known to the public at this time. From what on the Minister has said, it would appear that a large number of joint venture proposals from a number of countries have come across his desk. Some of those proposals are to carry out what is known as feasibUityfishing.The working group report to which I have referred suggests that feasibility fishing is one area in which joint ventures should be encouraged. I would like to sound a very strong warning to the industry. I suspect that some of the proposals put up as feasibility fishing proposals are not really feasibility fishing proposals. They are proposals under which thefishermenwould like to come in and perhaps get some information, some of which might flow across to Australia if we are lucky, but, in the meantime, do a lot of fishing and take a lot offishout of some of these waters. Without meaning this to be an attack on a particular proposal, I suspect very much the present joint venture proposal which involves the Russians and which is based on Portland. It was the subject of quite a strong report in the newspapers a few weeks ago. There was a great amount of agitation in thefishingindustry aimed at ensuring that the Government does not allow that proposal to go ahead. This suggestion is thrown up as a feasibilityfishingproposal. If one happens to read the proposal, one sees that the terms are very close to those suggested as a draft set of terms in the working group report. I suspect that proposal a great deal. I do not think that our fishermen want to be sold out to a two dollar company anyway. On the other hand other ventures- I instance the Taiwanese-Australian venture on the North West Shelf which is also in front of the Minister at the present time-ar e probably more in line with what the Australianfishermenwould like to see occur. At the presenttimeAustralians are not fishing the North West Shelf except for close shore. In fact, the large number of Taiwanese boats there are the only boats working that area at present. The proposal which the Taiwanese have suggested, with their Australian partners, envisages two phases. Eventually it would that the fish would be caught by Australian fishermen on the basis that perhaps the fish would mainly be sent back to Taiwan. That is the fishing country which is prepared to consume the fish caught in that area, most of which are not able for Australian palates at this stage. There are quite a number of things that would like to talk about in this debate but, unforapproaches tunately, there is very little time. So I return this proposal for the establishment of an Auscoming tralian fishing zone committee which should occur under the regulations set up by the amendimportation ments contained in this Bill. I see that committee as being the basic committee to recommend, from time to time, policies onfisheriesbased different areas around Australia; to recommend fee structures; and to recommend the number of competitive. licences to be issued to overseas vessels and to local vessels if overseas vessels are appropriate in the area. For instance, I note, with respect to fee structures, that it is quite likely that in some areas fees would need to be fairly low. In other areas, such as the southern bluefin fishing area, where for the time being there will probably still be some Japanese longliners, the fee could probably be quite stiff-maybe $5,000 or $10,000 a year. I understand that the Japanese would be happy to pay that sort of amount. I see the Australian fishing zone committee making recommendations in relation to equipment to be used in these areas. I see the committee as being a very important part of the regulation of the fisheries around Australia. I hope that there will be a great deal of debate amongst fishermen in Australia on this matter because it is a very important cog that should be brought into operation. Another thing I wish to say in the very strongest terms-it needs to be said-is that I deplore any trade offs in our trading relations between thefishingindustry and the beef industry. Within my electorate there is a very big beef industry. There is also a very big fishing industry. I do not like the idea of saying to another country: 'We will not sell fish to you unless you buy our beef, or 'we will not let you into our fishing grounds unless you buy our beef. I see the potential for trade offs but only within the fishing industry. Perhaps we should be saying to the Japanese: 'We will not let you into our 200-mile zone tofishfor bluefin tuna unless you let us into inyour sashimi markets in Japan'. We do not have access to those markets. I do not see why we should not have access to those markets because that is an area of the tuna fishery where our fishermen could get good returns, and that would mean benefit the people of Australia. The implications of the 200-mile Australian zone are absolutely massive. We are talking about surveillance problems, about new suitmethods of fishing, about new problems of finance-I hope that the Rural Bank can play a I very big part in that regard-and about new to research, which I hope will be a lot to more pragmatic than purely theoretical in times. We are talking about new initiatives for the boat building industry and for the of boats. The new initiatives on allowing the limited importation of second-hand boats can only help to reduce costs to the Ausin tralian fishing industry and therefore make our industry, in terms of exports, far more We have a tremendous challenge. The 200-mile Australian fishing zone will almost double the area of Australian sovereignty. From that point of view it has to be massive. I emphasise again that generallyfishermendo not complain. We have a tremendous responsibUity in government right now to see that we do not sell out the Australian industry, that we hasten very slowly in licensing foreign vessels, and that we do not get too carried away in the beUef that there are enoughfishin our waters for an unlimited number of foreign vessels to come into even those areas not beingfishedat present. We need to exercise caution. If we do so our own AustraUanfishermenwiU benefit to the ultimate.",68
144,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"Wit h the indulgence of the House, I seek leave to amend my amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Fisheries Amendment Bill 1978 by omitting ' 1977' and substituting '1978'. Leave granted.",71
145,Mr WALLIS,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"The main purto pose of the Fisheries Amendment Bill 1978 is extend Australian jurisdiction over fishing to cover the 200-mUe zone beyond the low water mark. This legislation is of relevance to the elecout torate of Grey as the majorfishingport of Lincoln is within that electorate, along with number of smaller fishing centres along the southern coast of South Australia and along the waters. shores of Spencer Gulf where tuna, prawns and crayfish are the main catches, with other species avaUable. So I assume that any alteration to the Australian jurisdiction would be of some importdemersalfisherieson ance to these particular areas. WhUst the Law the Sea Conference is not moving with any great haste, a substantial measure of agreement has been reached on the question of the 200-mUe economic zones, and this Bill will bring us into line with the United States of America, the Union of Soviet SociaUst Republics, Japan, lowed Canada, New Zealand and the European Econof omic Community countries. If Australia is to take full advantage of the tended zone, we will have to make a full and comprehensive survey of our presentfishinginwould dustry which is, at the present time, only small Republics. when compared with the industries of most of the nations that I have just mentioned. From the information that is avaUable, our existing inshore fisheries, which cover the majority of our choosing fisheries, are almost fuUy exploited and there apparently substantial opportunity for the expansion of thefisheriesalong the Continental Shelf. But this can come about only if we are prepared to expand greatly our fishing activities in an effort to exploit them. As we have a vast coastline and a small population by world standards, doubts exist as to whether we have the necessary resources to carry this out. In the past, I have always been of the opinion that we have known very little of what our resources are and I suspected that other nations' knowledge of the fishing potential was very much greater than our own. With this in mind, it was very interesting to read the report of the working party, established by the Australian Fisheries Council, on the 200-mile Australian fishing zone. That publication was released a shorttimeago. The report refers not only to the fisheries and to the species that we are exploiting at the present time-basicall y inshore fisheriesbut also to those currently being exploited or likely to be developed by Australian fishermen, and, finally, those not being exploited by Australianfishermenon a commercial basis. Of the latter, the report contains information and maps showing the types offishthat it may be possible exploit in the future. I refer to bluefin tuna, to skipjack tuna, northern bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna, various types of sharks, jack mackeral and various other types offish.However, as pointed in the report, the potential of thesefisheriesis Port unknown and would require considerable rea search by ourselves, or from information already gained by other nations which havefishedthese Because of our limited resources, it would appear that to allow the initial exploration of the the wider continental shelf of we would have to permit the participation of other nations in the exploitation of the areas in conjunction with our own ability to exploit them. Any participation by other nations would, of course, have to be under full Australian control, not only in the areas in which they would be alto exploit but also in Umits on the quantity the catch. I understand that a number of the nations that fish long distances from their own shores have been disadvantaged by the 200-mile economic zone proclamations and, if excluded, exwould face a considerable drop in their catch. The two nations that would be most affected be Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist If we are to join in joint ventures with other nations, we must ensure that we are careful in the most suitable partners. On selection is of those partners, we would have to lay down guidelines that would secure the long-term interests of Australia. We would have prior claim to our resources which we could exploit, but in areas where we did not have the full capacity to exploit, we would allow the entry of suitable partners. If we permit other nations to fish in our 2C0-mile zone, we will have to ensure that we have proper management of our resources. We would also have to ensure that our joint operations would be in our economic interest and provide assistance to our industry to allow us to develop our own ability to utilise these resources in the future. As other nations have greater expertise in deeper water fishing, we could expect assistance from them in developing our own expertise. We would have to provide for a greater number of specialists in the field to obtain the maximum scientific information. We would also have to provide a greater number of properly equipped research vessels. Perhaps arrangements could be made with our partners to hire such vessels, vessels that would be capable of operating in deep water or, better still, we could build our own by making use of the facilities that now exist at Whyalla. In any joint venture with a foreign partner, it would be essential that there be a considerable financial involvement by the Government, as the present structure of our fishing industry would not allow the extent offinancialinvolvement required. A fair and just agreement with a suitable foreign partner would bring some considerable benefit to Australia in economic terms generally, would increase both on-shore and off-shore employment around our coastline, would provide better and more advanced port facilities, improved technology and equipment and a trade-off position for some of our other primary products. A further need for full Federal Government involvement in any joint ventures is absolutely necessary, as any potential partners would most probably have their own government handling all the negotiations. In referring to our own Government, it would be essential that the closest consultation with the States takes place, bearing in mind the dual jurisdiction that applies between the States and the Commonwealth under the constitutionalrightsin this field. My own State, South Australia, has probably the best management policy of all the States, and I am sure that any South Australian Minister would require full consultation to ensure that the management policies are well protected. Problems will arise as a result of this legislation in the delineation of the boundaries of the 200-mile zone of a number of countries, the two most obvious being Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. If we declare the zones around our island Territories we will have overlapping claims with New Zealand and France. It would be interesting to know just what the Government intends to do to overcome these particular problems. In this context I am not referring to the statement that was made by the Minister for  agreement with Papua New Guinea. We should also take into account the needs of the developing countries and the position of countries which have been operating in the increased 200-mile zone for many years. We do not want to appear that we are adopting a dog-in-the-manger attitude by denying access where we are not in a situation where we can exploit the resources, but we would want to ensure that we still maintain our control of the areas. Although, the Minister makes reference to the severe penalties that will apply under this Act for breaches, one wonders how these penalties will be enforced when one considers the length of our coastline, and the difficulties this will bring. Stationing of Australian inspectors on foreign fishing vessels would be one way to police the catches, et cetera, but I feel we would require a large number of these inspectors. At a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference I attended in Canada last year, concern was expressed by the small island nations of the Pacific at the difficulties they were experiencing in policing their waters, but I understand that Western Samoa is canvassing the possibility of a multi-national force to police the waters of the South Pacific. I understand that we have had some discussions along the same lines with some of our immediate neighbours. This may assist in overcoming part of the problem, but I feel that it would not be sufficient to provide us with the surveillance we would require. The report on the 200-mile Australian fishing zone carried out by a working party of the Australian Fisheries Council has provided a considerable amount of very worthwhile information relating to the Bill. It classifies the three types of Australianfisheriesas,firstly,fisheries already developed; secondly, thefisheriescurrendy being or likely to be developed by AustraUanfishermenon a commercial basis; and, thirdly,fisheriesnot being currently exploited by AustraUanfishermenon a commercial basis. Of these three categories, the working group 'considers that under no circumstances should foreign participation be considered in the first category offisheries'.The group 'considers that there may be some scope for foreign participation, at least in the short term, in relation to some species in the second category of fisheries'. In the case of the third category, there is scope for foreign participation at present. The Opposition has moved an amendment to the Bill, which seeks to add these words: Whilst not opposing the Bill, the House calls upon the Government to ensure that the guidelines determined by the Australian Fisheries Council in January 1977, to control foreign participation and give first priority to the try, be strictly observed. The Opposition feels that the questions of strict guidelines are not sufficiently set out in the Bill, and it is for this reason that we urge support the amendment. We are also debating two other Bills that late to the extension of thefishingzone. We are also moving an amendment to the Whaling as Amendment Bill and, whilst we are not opposing the Bill, we will call on the Government to alter larly the Frost inquiry terms of reference requiring the Commission to submit positive proposals to guarantee increased maximum resources ployment in the Albany region, prior to declaring a moratorium on whaling. We urge that both the these amendments secure the support of the House. I trust that the legislation will result growth in our fishing industry around the Austries. traUan coastUne and, from a personal point of view, I hope we will see an expansion of fishing of activities in the fishing communities waters adjacent to the Grey electorate.",71
146,Mr MILLAR,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"I join will briefly in this cognate debate in which two of BUls might be regarded as having some substanConference tial historical significance. On this occasion shall more particularly address myself to the plus Fisheries Amendment Bill 1978. This Bill, of course, will amend the Fisheries Act 1952 and extend Australian fishing jurisdiction over foreignfishermenout to 200 nules beyond the low water mark by the creation of a 200-mUe Australian fishing zone. It is the outcome lengthy, laborious and sometimes tedious negoattitude tiations in the international forum. The reUef occasioned by its implementation should not be aUowed to flow into those essential activities necessary to justify Australia's claim to a water surface area approximately equivalent land mass of the Australian continent. I mention in passing that it seems slightly ironic that Australia, having been induced to adopt metrication on the score of universaUty, should now be considering a Bill of international ramifications couched in statute miles rather than in ldlometres. One wonders whether the allegedly universal urgency for metrication was in fact more of a myth than a reality. Australia, with the second longest coastline of any country, ranks only fiftieth in terms of world annual catch. This clearly demonstrates the relatively minimal exploitation of the water resources in Australia's history. This has occurred for a number of reasons of course, not the least of them being that the waters surrounding Australia are not as prolific in fish life as might generally be local indusimagined. Of course the Australianfishingindustry has not fuUy exploited the resources that exist. Australian vessels are small and Australian fishing techniques are unsophisticated. Indeed, for with the exception of the introduction of the sonar location of fish shoals and mechanisation reof net handling tactics, essentially Australian fishermen are using the same fishing techniques their forebears used at the time of Australia's establishment. Many other countries, particuTaiwan, have a much greater knowledge of Australia's fishing resources. Indeed, their knowledge is so vastly superior to ours as to give emthem a decided advantage. There are 360 Japanese tuna boats in Australian waters and more than 160 Taiwanese trawlers operating off north-west coast, which gives some idea of in a the extent of the involvement of overseas counThe problem of high operating costs besets the Australianfishingindustry, and the difficulty market access is also a problem that will be around the difficult to remove. Nevertheless, under the new arrangement we have to expand quickly or surrender exploithe tation to other countries. The United Nations on the Law of the Sea requires a I member to give other nations access to the surof its allowable catch. I believe that that requirement is rather significant and stands as a very serious reminder to those people who have a somewhat insular attitude towards the development of Australia's natural resources, both in the sea and on the land mass. It rather suggests of that world opinion is fast moving towards an that inevitably will declare that what is in the world belongs to the world and that if we cannot establish our capacity to develop our resources we will not be able to continue to guard them jealously as exclusive to our nation's perto the sonal well-being. Under that requirement, of course, Australia is at liberty to negotiate for some advantageous position by way of trading fishing rights within the 200-mUe zone. But trading presupposes that a country has something to sell, and because we have demonstrated historically our lack of capacity to develop those resources, I am not convinced that we can persuade foreign nations to advance a consideration to us forfishingrights within the area described when they know full well that, if we persist with our present inefficient and ineffective measures, in some brieftimeinternational opinion will direct Australia to make available to foreign nations those waters within the 200-mile zone. At that stage no value might attach to the surrendering of any entitlement Australia may have. It is interesting to note that it is estimated that only 40 per cent of edible fish at present imported each year into Australia-that is frozen packaged fish, canned herrings, sardines and smoked fish-coul d be supplied by local fishermen. A value of $20m per annum to the Australian market, which has grown at a constant rate of 2.3 per cent over the last 15 years, gives some indication of the value of the ocean resources on present operating levels. In all cases where measures such as this are introduced there is an incidental spin-off which would afford some bounty to our economy. Larger catches, if they are established by the enterprise of the Australianfishingindustry, would lead to more modern processing. That in turn will demand increased freezing capacity, storage and equipment, and the transport and shipbuilding industries also will benefit. Whilst we look initially at the sea and what is contained therein, there is a great opportunity for expansion if we are alert and seize the opportunity to develop our Australian fishing industry. In that area, electronic equipment suppliers and manufacturers should also benefit. Having established entitlements within the declared zone, the practices must be policed. There must be some surveillance to ensure that the regulations and arrangements are being observed and adhered to. Many propositions can be canvassed as to how the surveillance should be implemented. Whether by expansion of our defence forces we could ensure that sufficient surveillance is maintained or whether we should establish a coastguard orfishingpatrol are questions that could be properly investigated. Quite clearly, Australia with its limited resources must inevitably have considerable difficulty in maintaining continuing effective surveillance. I should imagine that, as in the past, there will be illegal intrusions into AustraUanfishingzones. The Australian Fisheries Council will have a very heavy responsibUity in determining the conditions that will apply to the exploitation of these ocean resources. It is alert, of course, to the interests of AustraUanfishermenand to the conditions that must necessarily apply. One could not for a moment deny the validity of the claim that to the greatest extent possible the resources should be preserved for Australian fishermen and Australia as a whole. WhUst it can be understood that in some cases Australian fishermen have an instinctive resentment of possible intrusions of foreignfishermen,it seems inevitable that a compromise must prevail. The declaration of a 200-mUe zone is possibly the simplest step for a nation to take to vindicate its actions on the international scene. It will call for good judgment, acument, and a reaUsation that insular national attitudes in a shrinking world can be counter-productive. I support the Bill.",73
147,Mr DAWKINS,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"In this debate I want to address some remarks to the Whaling Amendment Bill, and in doing so I indicate, as the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis) remarked, that the Opposition intends to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading. The amendment is in the following terms: Whilst not opposing the second reading, the House calls upon the Government to alter the Frost Royal Commission terms of reference, requiring the Commission to submit positive proposals to guarantee increased marine resources employment in the Albany region, prior to declaring a moratorium on whaling. As the House will know, the Government has established an inquiry into the whaling industry. One of the terms of reference of the inquiry states: The Inquiry shall in particular examine: (a) whether Australian whaling should continue or cease; Yet at the same time as it requires the Commission to examine that question, it pays little regard to the consequences of a decision to cease whaling in Australia. For instance, the only reference to the employment aspect is included in term of reference No. 3 (f) which states that the inquiry shall examine 'any consequences for Australian employment and industrial development, particularly in Albany'. However, there is no requirement for the inquiry to examine the question of alternative employment for the people now engaged in the industry. It is the Opposition 's view that it would be quite wrong simply to wipe out an industry without making adequate arrangements for those who are employed in that industry. In Albany at the moment the whaUng industry sustains employment sufficient to support about 100 famines. This is not a question that can be taken Ughdy. In a town the size of Albany the employment of those famities is indeed an important question. It may be true, as you, Mr Drummond, said the other day, that the people of Albany are opposed to the closing down of the whaling industry. I was in Albany in mid-1977 at the time of the demonstrations that were mounted against the whaling industry and I attended a public meeting which considered the quesdon of whaling in Albany. Whilst I think it is true that the people of Albany want to retain the jobs that are concerned with the whaling industry, I am not convinced that they necessarily want to see a continuation of the killing of whales. In fact the whale is almost the trademark of Albany. When one drives down the approach road to Albany one sees everywhere whales smiling at passers by. They are always portrayed as being friendly, happy and harmless, so I do not think that the portrayal of whales as such means that the people of Albany are intent on destroying them. I am sure that they would favour the retention of the jobs without the lolling of the whales. This question I tliink therefore presents us with an excellent chance to engage in an exercise of applied conservation. It seems to me that conservation issues are all too often portrayed as being a conflict between narrow minded antiprogress fanatics and development maniacs who are interested only in jobs regardless of the consequences. In most issues it is not easy for these opponents to reach agreement. However, it is my belief that we will never effectively be able to encourage sensible conservation policies unless those policies have the total support of the community. They will never succeed over the objections of workers or others who see themselves or their livelihoods being threatened by them. It is hardly necessary to add that this sort of problem, the problem between conservation policies and the perceived threat seen by workers, is a greater problem intimesof high unemployment and /or when the conservation policies in question involve the taking away of existing jobs rather than the prevention of the opening up of new ones. In Albany, however, I believe it should be possible to avoid this sort of conflict. Not only I believe that the people of Albany are not antiwhale but also I believe that it would be possible to find other jobs to replace those jobs in the whaling industry. For instance, it was recently reported by Mr Mullins, the Director of the Southern Ocean Fish Processors Pty Ltd, that his company intended to provide employment for 150 people before the end of the year. The company currentiy employs about 30 people and it will be increasing employment in its plant in order to process morefish. Mr Mullins went on to say that the company had decided to expand because of the potential of the fishing industry in the area. He also said that this expansion was just a first phase and that the company saw a possibility of doubling its trawlingfleetin the future. There may indeed be other opportunities for increasing thefishingindustry in Albany. As well I think another method in which employment could be created in Albany would be by way of promotion of research into whales and other sea mammals. The amount of research into these creatures has been far from adequate and the results are extremely dubious. Therefore I think Australia could make a real contribution to international debate on this question by encouraging research, and there seems to be no better place for it than Albany. It may also be possible at certaintimesof the year to arrange for tourists to see the whales in their natural surroundings. I have noticed that many people take a rather bizarre interest in seeing whales being cut up at the Cheynes Beach whaling station and perhaps they or other people would be prepared to pay someone to take them out to sea to look at live whales. I want to make it perfecdy clear that my preference is for the closing down of the Cheynes Beach whaling station, once the interests of the current employees have been appropriately safeguarded. The reasons that I say this are fourfold: Firstly, I am not satisfied that enough is known about the ecological effects of lulling whales in Australian waters or in other parts of the world; secondly, I do not believe that the International Whaling Commission is effectively pursuing a poUcy of conservation of whales, despite its protestations to the contrary; thirdly, I believe that Australia cannot encourage, as it pretends to do, a stronger line by the IWC in the conservation of whales whilst it permits whaling off its own shores; and, fourthly, I believe that most, if not all, of the products which are now obtained from whales can be obtained from substitute products. Of course it goes without saying that the curdo rent level of whaling is not nearly as disastrous as it was more than 100 years ago. For instance, between 1820 and 1860 when the Americans particularly were dominating the industry about 900 whaUng vessels were operating in the world. The United States industry itself employed about 70,000 people. It is not easy to say what the consequences of that massive operation were; in fact most scientists maintain that it is very difficult indeed to obtain reUable estimates of whale populations throughout the world but reasonably reUable estimates suggest that, of a whale population of about four mUlion before whaling started in earnest, it has been reduced to about half in 1975. Many people claim that this population-at approximately two million whales now existing-is probably optimistic. However, it is certainly true that thefiguresare almost certainly deceptive. The selectivity of the whaling industry has caused a proportionately much greater reduction in the population of certain species, especially the much larger baleen species. For example, while the worldwide population of whales has been reduced by nearly 50 per cent, some baleen species in the Antarctic have been reduced by as much as 96 per cent. Thefiguresshowing population reduction do not reflect the reduction in the whale biomass. Selective depletion of blue and fin whales has caused an 85 per cent reduction in the total baleen biomass in the Antarctic, from an estimated 43 million tons to 6.6 million tons.",74
148,Mr GRAHAM,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,Whos efiguresare those?,76
149,Mr DAWKINS,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"They are reliable, I assure you. Of course the argument of the International Whaling Commission is that a whaling industry is able to be sustained by having regard to a concept known as the 'maximum sustainable yield'. This concept tries to take account of the mortality rates of the whale population and by comparing that with the recruitment rate, is able to establish the yield which allows whales to be taken without drastically reducing their numbers or at least without threatening the survival of the species. However, I think it is fair to say that there is a great deal of contention about this concept and its applicability, particularly to certain species. As I have already said, it is very difficult indeed to substantiate the total whale population. It is also difficult to substantiate what is the mortality rate and the recruitment rate. Most of the methods which are used in determining these factors are based on sitings, taggings and data such as the catch per unit effort, which effectively measures how long it takes the whale chasers to sustain a kill. There seem to be serious limitations in the theory which was enunciated by the International Whaling Commission. I think it is a very dubious concept indeed for us to rely on if we are concerned, as the Australian Government says it is, and as the Whaling Commission says it is, to avoid the extinction of all whale species are left. Another point to which I want to refer is the question of the behaviour of the IWC. The arguwhich ment goes that it is better to have some sort of conservation enforced by the IWC rather than conservation which apparently would lead to the wholesale slaughter of whales throughout the world, particularly by Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. However, I think if critically examine the behaviour of the IWC it would cast a great doubt on its ability to sustain a proper conservation policy. For instance, we saw that the IWC met in June last year and at that time recommended a quota of 763 sperm whales for the northern hemisphere. Yet a few months later the same IWC lifted the quota for sperm whales in the northern hemisphere to 6,444. In a few months we saw an increase of 745 per cent simply on the basis of what Japan pretended was new data being presented to the IWC. Several of the delegates who were opposed to this increase in the quota poured scorn on the new data that was presented by Japan, alleging that scientists had falsified information and made wild generalisations about the reduced juvenile mortality without the slightest evidence to support their case. I think therefore that we have to be very circumspect about any temptation to embrace the policies of the IWC or to support the notion that the IWC and only the IWC can protect whale species. The third point I want to make is that if the IWC is not adequately ensuring the conservation of whales throughout the world it seems to me important that Australia take on for itself a role in this process. I think we can follow the lead of the United States of America which in 1972 passed the Marine Mammal Protection Act which, among other things, makes it a crime for United States citizens to disturb or harass marine mammals anywhere in the world. The Act also prohibits any material harvesting of any species of these creatures without the approval of a special scientific committee. The United States also forbids the importation of whale products into the country and bans such products from interstate commerce. The United States, by the way, has been urging upon the world a 10-year global moratorium simply to allow for improved and increased research to justify any further killing of whales. This suggestion of the United States is opposed by Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the two major whaling nations which account for something like 85 per that cent of the world catch. Whilst it is true that Australia is a small whaling nation by comparison and indeed, Cheynes Beach often has difficulty in fulfilling the relatively small quota it is given, it seems to me that Australia cannot raise its voice in protest against whaling no or support the notion of conservation of whales while still allowing a whaling station to be maintained on its shores. I think therefore that whatever the consequences for Australia might be, we we have an obligation to support the campaign for the preservation of whale species throughout the world and a necessary precondition for that is the closing down of our own station. The fourth point that I want to make is that I believe that most if not all of the products which are now gained from whales can be replaced by substitutes. I suppose this is particularly relevant in the case of the whale which Australia is killing, the sperm whale. We find that the baleen whale is worth approximately $190 a ton compared with only $75 a ton for the sperm whale. It is further relevant, I suppose, that the baleen whales, the products of which are more highly priced, constitute approximately 77 per cent of the value of the world catch. The most important product which is derived from sperm whales, that is the whales Australia hunts and kills, is sperm oil. Unlike whale oil which is also gained from these and other whales, sperm oil is inedible and is more like a liquid wax. Sperm oil was widely used as an illuminating fuel in the 19th century because it did not smoke. Sperm whale meat has a very strong taste and is generally not eaten except in some local areas of Japan. Almost all parts of sperm whales are made into by-products, two of the better known being the teeth and the ambergris. It is estimated that the total value of whale products in 1972 was of the ment's order of $ 100m. But approximately 95 per cent veloped of the whales caught in recent years were caught enterprises by ships from developed countries and the prodthe zone. ucts were almost entirely consumed by develThe oped countries. The sperm oil and related substances come mainly from the sperm whale's head. Indeed, is an amazing substance. It can be added to lubrido cants for everything from automatic transAustralia missions to machine tools and it will perform superbly, even under conditions of high heat pressure. Apparently this unique substance, sperm oil, is the one which is most difficult place and whilst I know that you, Mr sition Drummond, have referred to the prospects of the jojoba plant, I think that you dismissed it too quickly. There is a substantial amount of search being carried out even in Australia plant. It is important because the oil which from the seed is very similar and has many of properties of the sperm oil of the sperm whale. Whilst it is not yet a commercial proposition go into the manufacture of oil from the jojoba plant, I think it is something which is well worth studying to a greater extent than we are doing the moment. If it were proved to be an economiproached cally viable substitute for sperm oil it seems me that it would remove one of the remaining So obstacles which stand in the way down of the industry in Australia. Whilst I support the question of Australia taking a firmer stand on the preservation of whales and encouraging other nations to stop or reduce drastically their whale kill, I want to make it perfectly clear that in my opinion the most important factor to be taken into account so far as Australia is concerned is the future of the employees who are now employed at Cheynes Beach.",76
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,Mr Drummond)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,77
151,Mr VINER,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES," I wish to reply on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) and speak shortly in regard to each of the amendments, the amendment to the Fisheries Amendment Bill and the foreshadowed amendment to the Whaling Amendment Bill. The amendment proposed to the Fisheries Amendment Bill is quite unnecessary for it adds nothing to the Bill. As the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Ship ton) said in his contribution to this debate, the matter has already been covered by the Minister in his second reading speech where he said: In establishing the Australian fishing zone it is the Governintention to ensure that fisheries of this zone are deand managed in the long term interests of Australia and Australians. Australian fishermen and fishing will be encouraged to develop the resources of Minister also referred to the obligation which Australia accepts when extending its fishing jurisdiction to 200 miles. That is an obligation to permit foreigners to take surplus it fisheries resources which Australians cannot or not wish to take. I emphasise that so far as is concerned, foreign participation will be on terms and conditions determined by and Australia and in the long term interests of the Australia and Australians. I think it can be to reclearly seen that the matters which the Oppocanvasses in its proposed amendment are already very much in the forefront of the mind of rather the Government and have been covered quite readequately by the Minister in his second reading on this speech. With regard to the foreshadowed comes amendment to the Whaling Amendment Bill, I the can say on behalf of the Minister that we are pleased to know that the Opposition supports the to independent inquiry into whales and whaling instituted by the Government. I think the fact that we have instituted that inquiry shows the at seriousness with which the Government has apthe opposition by the Australian and to international community to excessive whaling. it can be seen that there is no need for the Opof the closing position's amendment. The terms of reference of the mquiry are very wide. I point out to the Opposition that those terms have been welcomed by Project Jonah and also other environmental groups. It also ought to be observed that the inquiry has already begun. It will not be waiting until August as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) suggested. With regard to the particular matter referred to in the foreshadowed amendment relating to employment in the Albany region, I remind the Opposition that the terms of reference already require the judge to report on economic, employment and other effects on the Albany region should a cessation of whaling be recommended. I am quite sure that those terms of reference are adequate for the judge and that he will be able to direct his cations for employment of any cessation of whaling, if that should be recommended. I also add that the purpose of the Bill currendy before the House is not to canvass the whaling issue or the pre-empt the inquiry. That is a separate issue. Its purpose is to extend Australian jurisdiction to 200 miles and to that extent, although the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) and also the honourable member for Fremande (Mr Dawkins) may be of some interest, they are totally irrelevant to the substance of the Bill. It is for that reason that the Government does not accept either the amendment to the Fisheries Amendment Bill or to the Whaling Amendment Bill, as proposed by the Opposition.",77
152,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"I just make the point, without delaying the House and rather than take it to the Committee stage, that reference was made in the course of the debate to our jurisdiction and to the fact that the Privy Council in relation to the Oteri case virtually said that we could have had jurisdiction. I think the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) raised that matter. I put on record that the Privy Council said that we would never have jurisdiction.",78

160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"Is the wish of the House to have a covering both measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",79
161,Dr KLUGMAN,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"Thirteen years ago the 26th Commonwealth Conference of the Australian Labor Party incorporated in platform a proposal to establish an Australian science council. That was the first commitment made by a political party in Australia to constitralian tute such a council. The introduction of the tralian Science and Technology Council Bill the House marks a significant stage in the fulfiladvice ment of our initiative. During the mtervening period, we in the Labor Party have contributed substantially towards this stage and we have nessed the pleasing change of attitude on the part of members of the present welcome, for example, the change of heart of the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on this matter. In March 1969 when he was Minister for Education and Science he addressed the Science and Industry Forum of the Australian Academy of Science. He criticised the idea of science council and concluded: We may then be wisest to continue our pragmatic, utionary approach seeking advice from different people as different problems arise. In this way we can establish work of informal and ad hoc relationships. To many, this would appear to be an inappropridesirable. ate arrangement for seeking advice on matters of public policy involving science and technology. What is more, it is an inadequate way of providbroader ing opportunities for both expert and public comment on the social aspects of science. So note that the Prime Minister has radically changed his mind on the value of a science counSecond Reading cil. We support this Bill in principle. Our support is based not only on a long history of interest but also on our active history in this matter. In March 1974 Mr Morrison the then Minister for Science, tabled a Green Paper entided 'Towards an Australian Science Council'. The same year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Demade a thorough study of science and I technology at the request of the Labor Governconment. Following consideration of the report of the OECD examiners and following public disof cussion of the Green Paper, Mr Morrison in and January 1975 issued the White Paper 'Science and Technology in the Service of Society'. This be document was, therefore, the result of a wider of ranging discussion, and it oudined a framework for an Australian Science and Technology Counof cil. The membership of the Interim ASTEC was this announced in May 1975 and only the events of November 1975 prevented the establishment by statute of an independent body responsible for providing the Government with advice on general debate science and technology. The Bill before the House will accomplish this objective. It represents the culmination of a process begun 13 years ago by Labor and stimulated 4 years ago under Labor. We therefore support its the Bill. Liberal-Country Party governments have always sought science policy advice from two sources-the established elite of the Ausacademic scientific community and big Ausbusiness. This was the case when the Australian into Academy of Science provided information and on an informal and ad hoc basis, as described by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1969. It was the case with the withastily devised Advisory Committee on Science and Technology; it is the case now with the existGovernment. We ing interim ASTEC. The Government's understanding of the kind of advice needed on science and technology is very narrow. The Urnits to its understanding emerge clearly from the composition of the a Council, and the terms of reference detailed in the Bill. We shall therefore move a number of evolamendments. ASTEC's role, apparently, is to ensure the promotion of basic science and the in a netdustrial innovation of technologies. That is a view which is certainly outdated and is quite unThe Opposition comprehends science not only as an economic activity and as an intellectual activity, but also as an activity with social demands and consequences. New scientific developments can assist in promoting we better information on the natural environment and its conservation, and informed health care. Equally, technological changes can damage the environment, can threaten health or can result in reduced employment opportunities. On these broader aspects of science and technology-aspect s central to the advice needed by government-distinguishe d senior academic researchers and directors of large private companies cannot be regarded as experts. If one of ASTEC's tasks is to keep the Government, Parliament and community informed on latest scientific and technological developments it should include active scientists. If, however, ASTEC has as its major task the providing of advice on public policy matters involving science and technology, as well as priorities for support, it needs intelligent, critical citizens, as well as experts with varied backgrounds, including active scientists, technologists and social scientists. They should be selected from academia, industry and the public sector, as both the White Paper and the report of the interim ASTEC proposed. The Government is not likely to receive conOpposition structive criticism, a touch of responsible sceptiable cism, on the social value of science and even the economic value of technological innovation the scientific elite. What is likely to be provided advice which is superficially very profound deep down very superficial. Scientific specialists, it must be remembered, are not experts their own fields. They are, by virtue of their background, narrowly trained. Equally, senior industrialists are necessarily narrowly interested. The public should be able to be confident that members of ASTEC do not represent a vested Minister disciplinary or commercial interest. This connot fidence cannot be maintained with the GovernThis ment's decision to select a council dominated big business and senior academic scientists. The Interim Council appointed by the Labor Government was significandy more broadly based, both in terms of the disciplinary backeven grounds of its members and in their institutional affiliations. In particular, we ensured that social sciences were represented to a greater extent. We did so because we take seriously the socio-economic aspects of science, and because we recognise that this is a major area of science policy advice. In fact, science policy which fails to take such matters into account is little more than a research and industrial development icy. Our decision to include the broader cations of developments of science and techcomfortable. nology within the terms of reference of ASTEC was supported by the OECD examiners, and the Australian and New Zealand Association Advancement of Science Policy Commission. It was also subsequendy supported by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, commonly known as the Coombs commission. The terms of reference proposed for ASTEC in this Bill are deficient in this respect. Science and technology are major components of social change, natural resource use, education and the changing nature of work-to give just some examples. These matters should be recognised in the Council's terms of reference and as I said earlier the Opposition will propose amendments to the Bill to provide specifically for their inclusion. We shall also propose an amendment which would ensure the participation of social scientists, active researchers and laymen in the Council's deliberations. Bodies already exist whose function is to promote science; ASTEC's function should be to assess science, to criticise, to evaluate, to promote public discussion of the issues raised by science and/or technology. The will also seek to amend the Bill to enASTEC to exercise its own initiative to a greater extent in undertaking investigations, and from to ensure that when ASTEC reports are withis held, either wholly or partially from the ParUabut ment, the Minister shall inform the Parliament that this has been done. ASTEC must not be a outside tool of the Minister. The Bill estabUshes ASTEC as an independent statutory body. We support that decision. If the rejects or ignores its advice, it should be possible for the Minister to hide that fact. Government and succeeding governments by should welcome public interest and public involvement in science poUcy. ASTEC can function to provide for these, by being free to stimulate knowledge of matters associated with science, if these could be potentially embarrassing for the government of the day. Consequendy, we the shaU seek to ensure only the necessary minimum of control by the Minister over confidential commercial or security matters. We shall also seek to amend the Bill to require a greater turnover of the Council's membership. ASTEC will need a regular infusion of new ideas, new approaches. The Bill as it stands would make it too easy for polASTEC to become entrenched, for its relationimpliship with the Government to become too This situation has tended to develop with science advisory bodies in Australia under conservative governments. This tendency for the should be broken. Finally, the Opposition has some reservations about the secrecy provisions of the Bill. The provisions are not only restrictive but, in fact, impose almost impossible conditions on scientists who give information to the Council. Certainly, commercially sensitive or defence-related information should remain confidential. But because clause 26 is so comprehensively written, it will pose problems for scientists acting as consultants or committee members. The Opposition supports the Bill, and hopes that the Government will review the narrow focus it has proposed for ASTEC and will have another look at clause 26 to see whether it really prevents consultants to the Committee from publishing their work later on. We hope that when the Australian Science and Technology Council is finally established with the permanence, independence and status the passage of this Bill will provide, the Council will see itself free to give rather more substantial, helpful and daring information and advice than its report on energy research and development contains. The Opposition supports the Bill but will move a number of proposed amendments.",79
162,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"The Australian Science and Technology Council Bill 1978 that we are now debating is the result of six years progression in the field of committees and advisory bodies on science and technology. The first Australian Government commitment to the advisory body on science and technology was in April 1972 when the then Prime Minister, Mr MCMahon, now the Right Honourable Sir William MCMahon, announced the formation of the Advisory Committee on Science and Technology. The present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was the responsible Minister at that time. The Committee had only a brief existence, meeting for the first time in October 1972 and being disbanded by the Labor Government in February 1973. In 1974 the Labor Government invited three overseas examiners of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to come to Australia. This resulted in a White Paper entitled: 'Science and Technology in the Service of Society-the Framework for Australian Government Planning'. Here it seems that both the Government and the Opposition agree. In January 1975, by Cabinet decision, terim Australian Science and Technology Council was established. Things got under way again in February 1976 when the Prime Minister announced that he had asked an advisory group to advise him on the role of and the terms of erence for a science and technology advisory council. The group presented its report in March 1976. The interim Australian Science and Technology Council was continued, with some change of membership and functions. Its principal charter was to report to the Prime Minister on the long term arrangements for a permanent council. After wide consultation the interim council reported in November 1976 and recommended the creation of a permanent and independent advisory body on science and technology and that this permanent ASTEC become a statutory body. The permanent council was established by Executive action in April 1977, and now the House has before it the Bill to establish it as a statutory body. All through the history of this body there has been the intent to provide independence for the councU and to obtain overview reports. This, therefore, is the reason why it is not just an offshoot, under the Minister for Science, or part of the Prime Minister's Department or other departments. The Government's determination to provide this independence is shown in many clauses of the Bill but principally in clauses 8,19,20 and 25. Sub-clause 2 of clause 8 specifically says that the Minister is not empowered 'to give directions to the Council with respect to the content of any information or advice to be furnished'. This negates the possibility of politics entering the advice rendered, and ensures that such advice is founded on scientific facts. Clause 19, in subclause 1, states: . . . the staff required to assist the Council in the performance of its functions shall be persons appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922. Further, sub-clause 4 states that the staff shall perform their functions and duties in accordance with the directions of the Council. Again, subclause 2 of clause 20 states: While an officer or employee of an authority is performing services for the Council in pursuance of an arrangement under sub-section (1), that officer or employee is not to be subject to direction by that authority. In further pursuit of full independence for the Council there is clause 25. This clause forbids any legal action against the Council, its staff, or those working for it or giving information to it while they are acting in good faith for the Council. So, we see that much of the Bill is related to an in the independence of the Council. The other important aspect which shows in the Bill and in all the other statements and reports on the Council, is the wide range of subjects covered. It is not, as the honourable member for refProspect said, narrow. This was brought about by the need for an overview on the whole situation. Some idea of the range of subjects covered is found in clause 5, the reference clause, and important enough to repeat it. It states: The functions of the Council nish information and advice to the Commonwealth Government in respect of, matters relating to science and technology, including the following matters: (a) the advancement of scientific knowledge; (b) the development and application of science and technology in relation to the furtherance of the national well-being; (c) the adequacy, effectiveness and overall balance of scientific and technological activities in Australia; (d) the identification and support of new ideas in science and technology likely to be of national importance; (e) the practical development tific discoveries; (f) the fostering of scientific vation in industry; and (g) the means of improving efficiency in the use of resources by the application of science and technology. A further idea of the range can be gained from the variety of departments and agencies with substandal interests in science and technology that will be called upon for help. The following departments are represented at the monthly meetings of the council: Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Defence, Department of Health, Department of National Development, Department of Primary Industry, Department of Science, Postal and Telecommunications Department and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Also, minutes and agenda papers, and an invitation to be represented at council meetings when items of interest are on the agenda, are sent to the following group of departments and agencies: Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development, Department of Finance, Department of Productivity, Department of Transport, Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Telecommunications Commission, and the Tertiary Edutroduction cation Commission. The first necessity for ASTEC was to deterGovernment. mine a classification system within which all fields of science and technology could be reviewed. The following list of classifications gives a further indication of the range covered: Aeronautics and aerospace, agriculture, atmosof phere, coastal and ocean engineering, communinational cations, construction, earth, electronics, energy, environment, marine sciences, food, forestry, often fundamental research, health, industrial chemiwe cals, international relations liason and aid, metal products and machinery, mineral processing, mining, organisation of research and developof ment, scientific and technical computing, it is transport, urban and regional planning, water resources and wood products. are to investigate, and to furAt this stage it is worthwhile giving an idea of the make-up of the Council itself. At present there are seven professors, each covering a different area, four managing directors or general managers of large public companies, the chairman of a primary producers organisation, a political scientist, a union leader and a scientist. That indicates that the previous speaker did not understand the position when he said that he wanted scientists involved. Again honourable members see how, with the wide experience of and application of scienthe councillors, the range involved in ASTEC is extremely large. Let me remind honourable and technological innomembers that the Council is an advisory group and has no executive role. Its advice will be used in many ways, especially in the allocation of resources and long-term planning. To give some idea-onl y a small idea-of the work that has already been completed, I mention the report of 1977 with advice on biological surveys in Australia, the drifting buoys program- a worldwide effort in which Australia is now involved, Landsat receiving in Australia, and, last month, the Prime Minister tabled the ASTEC report on energy research and development in Australia. I have given the history leading to the present ASTEC. I have shown how the Government has provided independence for ASTEC. I have shown the wide range covered by ASTEC and, finally, I have given some examples of the advice it gives. I seek the support of all honourable members for this grand idea which has now come to fruition. I seek support for the Bill, which makes ASTEC a permanent statutory body.",81
163,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"The Opposition welcomes the inof this Bill, which will establish the Australian Science and Technology Council as a senior source of science policy advice to the We welcome the Bill because we recognise that, despite its deficiencies, it is the product of initiatives of the Australian Labor Party. It was the Labor Party which, 13 years ago, committed itself to the effective exploitation science and technology for the achievement of goals, and it was the Labor Party which also recognised that the fruits of modern science entail costs as well as benefits. As a result, wrote into our platform in 1965, the undertaking that in office we would set up a science council. We were then well ahead of the thinking the conservative parties which have subtextiles, sequently followed us. In 1969, the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in responding to a proposal of the Academy of Science that an independent advisory committee on science and technology be set up, expressed his satisfaction with 'A network of informal and ad hoc relationships' for advice on science and technology. Three years later, after the then Prime Minister appointed such a committee, his Minister for Education and Science-the present Prime Minister-backe d down from his previous position. Indeed, he announced in August 1972 that the Australian Science and Technology Council would be serviced from within his Department and would report to him, rather than to the Prime Minister as had been the case since April that year. The marks of ad hocery and haste were, unfortunately, all too evident. The Science Advisory Committee was, in 1972, a political football, just as it has been over the past year. By contrast, Labor, after its election in late 1972, undertook a full and independent review of Australian science, and also sought to encourage informed comment on the nature and role of appropriate science policy advisory machinery. Mr Morrison, who was then Minister for Science, tabled the Green Paper 'Towards an Australian Science Council' early in 1974, proposing a Science Council. The report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development entided 'Examiner's Report on Science and Technology in Australia', issued in August 1974, recommended the establishment of an advisory councU for scientific and technological poUcy. The 1975 White Paper, 'Science and Technology in the Service of Society', announced that an Australian Science and Technology Council would be created. In May the Interim Council was announced. Our basic commitment, made 10 years earlier, to a Science Council had been fulfilled. We had gained the confidence of the Australian community by consulting with it. We had accepted those suggestions which would widen the interests of the Council to include technology related matters, and which would involve a ministerial committee to receive ASTEC's advice. Most significantly, we had decided to provide ASTEC with terms of reference wide enough to encompass the impacts of scientific activities throughout the economy and society as a whole. It is unfortunate that the present Government has faded to build quickly on that firm foundation, and that in some respects it has seenfitto reject the sound proposals Labor in office had adopted. So, whUst we welcome the introduction of the Bill and wlulst we congratulate the Prime Minister for his radical change of mind on the value of a Science Advisory Council, we do not support the narrow view of the functions of ASTEC which the Bill embodies. The case for seeking the advice of ASTEC on the social aspects of scientific developments has been widely supported, not only by the 1974 Green Paper and the 1975 White Paper produced by the Labor Government, but also by the OECD examiners in their report on Australian science and technology, by the Science Policy Commission of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science and by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. To disregard these broader aspects of science and technology is to reduce science policy to a very narrow view. It is to ignore those features of science policy described by Professor Don Lamberton in 1970 when he stated: Scientific research, technological development, and human progress are interconnected and achievement in any one of these areas cannot be judged efficient without taking account of the costs and benefits in all three areas. Technological change and its impact upon human values requires a major research effort of genuinely interdisciplinary character. The absence of these wider matters from ASTEC's terms of reference is all the more difficult to comprehend in view of the Prime Minister's explanation in 1972 of his change of mind in favour of a Science Council. He said at the 44th conference of the Australian and New Zealand Association for Advancement of Science: . . . the position has changed That is, since 1969. . . in several important ways. Not the least of these is the growth of environmental awareness and the impact of this on industry and nadonal development. The importance of technology assessment-penaltie s as well as benefits-is well appreciated. The Bill before the House presents a narrower view of science policy than that espoused by the Prime Minister in 1972. In fact, this narrow view-the view adopted by this Governmentrestricts science poUcy considerations to those related to the advancement of science and to the industrial innovation of technology. The Bill before the House proposes terms of reference for ASTEC which go no further than this. What is more, the composition of ASTEC as it now exists also reflects these limited concerns. The Government has reverted to the 1972 position of a Council dominated by big business and the scientific establishment. Now, we recognise that in a mixed economy technology provides the muscle of industrial and rural development. But there are criteria other than economic against which technological change should be judged. They include the implications for employment, education needs and environmental consequences. Similarly, whilst the senior members of Australia's technical community have useful contributions to add to science policy considerations, if ASTEC or the Government wanted to know what is happening at the frontiers of research, who better to ask than the young, active, vigorous scientists and technologists of our nation? It is these people who should be encouraged to explain the social aspects, the possibilities, the limitations of recent advances in their fields. It is these people who should, by their involvement in advising Government and the community, be encouraged to develop their social consciences as well. We are disappointed also, that there are no public sector scientists or technologists on ASTEC. In Australia, scientific research is dominated by Government agencies. A Council-the Government's top science policy advisory body-whic h contains no women, and no public sector employees will surelyfindit difficult to gain the confidence of the Australian people to whom its reports will be available. ASTEC needs broader terms of reference, to encompass the manpower aspects of science, the international character of science, and, explicidy, the socio-economic aspects of science and technology. That is why we propose to amend the Bill to give ASTEC the terms of reference provided in the 1975 White Paper. The past 12 months have seen ASTEC used a political football just as it was in 1972. On April last year, the Prime Minister revealed that reads: ASTEC would report to him and that its secretariat would be attached to the Department of attendon the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This was the by the position outlined again on 10 April this year in the Prime Minister's second reading speech on given the Bill. Nevertheless, in the meantime ASTEC appears had spent sometimein the Department of Sciment propaganda'. ence after 20 December. I hope that now ASTEC has setded into an equilibrium position. Perhaps this will enable the Council to build up the confidence it needs to move beyond the platitudes which begin, dominate and end its report on energy research and development. The Opposition is disappointed, also, that ASTEC will not report to a council of Ministers. This would have given the Council access to many relevant Ministers, and it would provide the recognition that science impinges on most components of public policy. I have said that introduction of this Bill is supported by the Opposition. We will seek, however, to amend the Bill to ensure that ASTEC is more fully independent of Government direction and to ensure a more rapid turnover of its membership. As far as this latter change is concerned, we believe that ASTEC needs the regular infusion of ideas. Science policy advisers have, in the past, had too comfortable a relationship with government. ASTEC certainly needs security of tenure, but government needs to be challenged with ideas it might not otherwise have come across. ASTEC can serve to educate and inform scientists, government and the public about scientific matters and their relationships with social and economic well-being. ASTEC needs clear assurances that, in this role, its efforts will be welcomed. The Opposition supports the view of Professor Harvey Brooks, Chairman of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development group on science policy, when he said: . . . that the new orientation of our societies towards the qualitative aspects of growth and towards broader concepts of welfare will require a much closer integration of science policy with the totality of economic and social policy. We are proud to have initiated and acted towards the establishment of ASTEC so that these perspectives can be added to science in Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative.

164,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"I take this opportunity to as read to the House a minute which I received 19 from the Principal Parliamentary Reporter. It Earlier today the honourable member for Prospect drew to the Hansard report of a speech made yesterday Minister for Health on the subject of health care costs. The honourable member claimed that no leave had been by the House for the incorporation of the table which at page 2398 and that Hansard had 'co-operated' by providing sub-headings throughout the speech for 'GovernAs the contents of the table appearing on page 2398 were read out by the Minister they formed part of his speech and leave to incorporate the table was not required. The use of cross-headings in Ministerial statements is a long-established practice. This concession is also available to the Leader of the Opposition or the Opposition shadow Minister leading for the Opposition in a debate. It was used as recently as 9 May by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith in a debate on foreign policy. the I do not propose that any changes should be made in relation to tables. That is, leave must be given for incorporation. I propose to continue the the practice of allowing headings in speeches made by Ministers or shadow Ministers leading for the Opposition.",84
165,Dr KLUGMAN,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,Eve nfictitiousheadings?,85
166,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"I think the honourable member for Prospect will discover that when a statement is made the headings that appear are usually the headings which were on the statement. For instance, the Budget Speech by the Treasurer is a perfect example of a speech which always has headings. I think they assist the reader to find in the speech, especially if it is a long one, the section he wants to pick up quickly.",85
167,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"I wish to make a point in regard to this matter. I think the practice of putting in headings is a good one, and I think a speech should be readable. I say that despite the glowing eloquence of our speeches. However, the same rules ought to apply to any tables which any honourable member seeks to have incorporated in Hansard. I presume that the case would be that Hansard, in editing a speech, would put in the headings in that way, even in the case of a humble backbencher such as myself or even you, Mr Speaker, in your time.",85
168,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,I may not be on the back bench but I am still humble.,85
169,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,I think this is a consortium of equals and anything that differentiates between us,85

171,Dr KLUGMAN,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,I seek leave of the Committee to move together the amendments circulated in my name. Leave granted.,85
172,Dr KLUGMAN,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"I shall be moving amendments to clauses 5,6, 8, 10 and 11, which read in part: Clause 5.

173,Dr KLUGMAN,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"I move: 1. Omit clause 5, substitute the following clause: '5, The functions of the Council are to investigate, and to furnish information and advice to the Commonwealth Government in respect of, matters relating to science and technology, including the following matters: (a) the advancement of scientific knowledge; (b) the implications for the community, for the environment, for industry and for Government policy of developments in science and technology; (c) utilising science and technology in the development of national objectives; (d) priorities for scientific and technological research and development, to these priorities; (e) the organisation for the conduct of scientific and technological activities; (f) manpower policies for science and technology; (g) the fostering of scientific and technological innovation in industry; and (h) utilising science and technology in the achievement of national objectives. 2.

Other members of the Opposition would like to touch on some aspects of the amendments.",86
174,Dr CASS,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"I wish to speak to the first amendment which is to clause 5 and which is related to the functions of the Australian Science and Technology Council. I suppose one can look at the functions of an organisation such as this in terms of the demands that might be made upon it Judging from the functions listed in the Bill as it stands, quite clearly the Government sees as by far the most significant functions those relating to research and development, I suggest, in the purely economic area. There are economic demands. I am not quibbling about that. That obviously is the first and on policies to give best effect area that most people would note. In looking at of and institutional arrangements those functions, one could categorise two of them as being in the area of research and five of them as being in the area of development, I repeat, essential in industry. But I think the functions, even in the economic sense, should go beyond that. There are, for example, requirements for government in technological areas which are not at the stage of, if you like, commercial development. I shall cite a couple of possible examples. Let us take transport systems. Quite clearly in metropolitan areas something will have to be done in the not too distant future about our transport systems. Given the conflict of interests of the various components of the transport industry, I suggest that no one will come up with a solution unless and until an organisation such as the Australian Science and Technology Council gets involved in it and gives the Government of the day some advice on the course of development that might be taken. Clearly if we leave it all to private transport-the motor car-citie s will bog down and shaU act upon any directions and grind to a halt. Perhaps some sort of grid sys(1), substitute the followtem is necessary, with a monorail car which is perhaps controlled by computer. There are lots of far out proposals, but far out scientific proposals such as that tend to become reality in a very shorttime.The present system is useless and the construction of freeways solves nothing. All that freeways do is guarantee that the problem in the central business areas is increased, because freeways encourage more and more people to go into the city. In a like fashion, similar problems arise with communications systems. In order to illustrate my views I wish to read an article which appeared in the New York Times on Sunday, 9 April. The article is written by a gentleman called Lee Edson. It reads: It was early in the 21st century ran out. But by this time America was ready. In Washington, D. C, the President pushed a button that turned on a thin sliver of intense light and directed it at a capsule containing a form of hydrogen extracted from sea water. Laser Generator No. 1-the first American laser power plant-wa s on stream, replacing the last great oil-fed electric power station. Laser beams racing along glass fibres thinner than the threads of a spider's web carried massive volumes of information from place to place at blinding speeds- a bundle of fibres as thick as a matchstick could transmit the contents of 200 books in a second-causin g a revolution in communications. The magazine, the newspaper and the business letter, as well as the mountains of trash they generated each day, had become as obsolete as copper wire. Instead, people read messages and learned the news from electronic screens or computer printouts . . . The technology rapidly transformed television and the movies, and provided a new medium for the ever-flourishing pornography market. That may be fantasy, but we would be unwise to ignore the possibility of these things. The article continues: Like any scientific discovery, the laser has enormous potential for good and for ill. The bulk of the article describes the relative developments in Russia and America in relation to military hardware. It continues: Lasers may turn out to be inexhaustible source of energy, or its destruction in the form of devastating weaponry. In either event, whoever comes out ahead in the race to develop them will be in a position to change the course of history. I confess to being a little melodramatic in that, but I did that simply to make the point that there is in existence a new technology. In fact, it is not new in the sense that it is already functioning in some ways. After all, there are doctors in this country using laser beams to operate on patients. It is not all a pipe dream. But we have not had any investigation by a body and I suggest an organisation like ASTEC would be ideal to investigate the potential of this sort of technology. We need to assess not only its applicability in terms of economic need but also the social impacts. We need to look at its potential effect, for example, on the whole communications industry. I refer now to another area. We have investigations into our energy needs and we talk about the need to develop an energy policy. I suggest that the Government's approach is essentially purely technological. How do we generate more energy? Where do we find it? How can we get more out of coal? But there are other aspects to the energy problem. What about the social impacts? Maybe an investigation will show that in some areas we will need to produce more and in other areas we will need to conserve. There may be areas where we need to consciously reduce our energy use. We will achieve nothing with the narrow economic approach that the present when the last trickle of oil Government has taken in these areas, trying to get only technological advice without any relationship to the social impacts. I could go on and refer to the area of social demand such as medicine and science which relate to people care, if you like. I could refer to nutrition and public health. Let me give an example from my own experience. In my life as a research worker in medicine I consider that I wasted time, to a certain extent, on transplantation surgery. I doubt very much that, in the overall context of the community's need, the sort of research in which I was involved, namely, heart transplants, was worth anything at all. Some aspects of my research were worthwhile. I was also involved in kidney transplants, an area which proved to be of great benefit. But I do not believe for one moment that the time. I spent on heart surgery was anything other than an utter waste of time. Should we pursue the area of genetic engineering? Should we be trying to play God in terms of creation? I do not know. I think someone ought to be investigating the area. This work is going on in some communities in America and the communities are up in arms and fearful of the the world's salvation, a new and possible consequences. They have imposed blocks and restrictions on the research workers who, of course, are striking back. We need some body to look into the matter. I do not believe that that sort of report will ever come from the Council as established by the Government at this stage. The Council needs to have broader terms of reference such as those we have suggested in our amendment to this clause. In other words, we should care not just about technology and science but about the effects on society as well.",86
175,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"Hotham) (5.57)Perhaps I can answer the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) very quickly on two points. He mentioned the functions of the Australian Science and Technology Council. I think that if he reads clause 5 carefuUy he will find that there are no inhibitions in the functions. The proposed new clause 5 represents just a rewording of the functions laid out in the Bill. He also mentioned that transport and communications, by way of examples, were not part of the overall investigation by ASTEC. If he had listened to my speech he would have heard me say that there would be a system whereby all thefieldsof science and technology could be reviewed. I listed some 26 or 27 items and communications and transport were included. I believe that the amendment is of no importance whatsoever.",87
176,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,88
177,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"The Australian Labor Party does not oppose the Australian Science and Technology Council Bill. We recognise that some years of effort, search and thinking have gone into the production of this document. However, we do not think that it answers all the questions that this side of the chamber would pose, nor does it create an institution which has features that we think would be desirable in a council that is going to deal with the important area of science. We know that the Council will have no executive function, but I do not think that is important. As I understand the position, one of the great struggles in science for governments all around the world has been to gather together the threads and to ensure that no inhibitions are created by governmental or bureaucratic action but that there is also a proper conservation of energy in the development of science policy. I feel quite strongly about this subject as sult of my membership of this Parliament and of one of the councils established by the Parliament. The Opposition's third paragraph of the amendment should be adopted because it would allow the Council to take initiatives on its own account. I cannot understand why we should place upon the Council the inhibition that the relevant clause of this Bill places upon it. We are proposing to invite some of the most distinguished people in the field of science to serve on this Council. Yet we are placing upon it the striction that it can act only upon the Minister's direction, or that seems to be the meaning of the clause as it appears in the Bill. I do not approve of that, and I think the Committee should adopt the third paragraph of the Opposition's amendment. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite have any doubts about adopting that course. Members on this side of the chamber do not like the secrecy provisions of the Bill. They appear to me to be very inhibiting indeed. Clause 26 applies to members of the Council and to members of a committee appointed under section 24, to members of the staff of the Council and so on. It states in part: A person to whom this section applies shall not, either directly or indirectly, except for the purposes of this Act or with the permission of the Council(a) make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person, any information . . . That seems to me to be a token of a sense of secrecy and confidentiality about the system which is undesirable.",88
178,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,You have missed the point. Read the clause carefully.,88
179,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"I have looked at it, and I know that there are reservations further on in that clause. I have also been a member of this place for a long while. I have watched governments in action. I also know that many of the people who are employed in these situations are inhibited by the look of the legislation. I think that this is an unduly inhibiting clause and it ought not to be in the Bill. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Roger Johnston) ought to know that many of the provisions in legislation are much more restrictive because of the atmosphere they create than because of the technical legal meaning of them. I think that that has an inhibiting impact. The second paragraph of the Opposition's amendment relates to access to reports. I was anxious tonight to speak about the membership of the Council. We have moved an amendment to the composition of the Council and a change a rein the clause which covers the period of membership. I want to put before the Committee the desirability of appointing members of Parliament to this body. For many years now I have represented this Parliament and this House in particular on the Council of the National Library of Australia. I served on that Council for a good number of years, and during my membership of the Ministry that Council service was undertaken by Mr Cross, the then member for Brisbane. Before I served on that Council this side of the re- chamber was represented on that Council by the late Leslie Haylen. The other side of politics was represented by Sir Alister MCMullen, and is represented now by Senator Gordon Davidson. I am quite confident that all the members of the Council during that period would agree that the members of Parliament who served on it fulfilled a useful purpose and brought to it a breadth of understanding of the political structure that is desirable for anybody who is going to be a part of government. I only hope that it also helped in our understanding of the body. I suggest that we ought to give some thought to a provision being included in the House of Representatives Standof ing Orders for reports from people who serve in that way to be placed periodically before the inquiries. Parliament. At page 1515 of today's Notice Paper there is a list setting out the House resentatives appointments to committees of this nature. I think that the actual structure of the Science and Technology Council has to be changed the way in which the Opposition has submitted. As I see the position, we can argue about numbers for any length of time, but our tendency will be to appoint people who are busy and iminitiative, portant and who have an established status in the field of science. The problem is to match their experience with the dynamics that people who are just beginning a career can provide. I that there is provision for advisory committees and so on to assist, but as far as I can see be an unduly restricted and structured body. honourable member for Hotham has a right to hold a different opinion. As I understand his ition, he has had a good deal of experience in outside this place. I have had a good deal of perience inside this place and in government. We face here the establishment of a that has to accept a very great intellectual challenge. I do not think we have faced up to the great problems of science in relation to the comCouncil munity. There has been a growing uneasiness over the last 20 years, in the minds of all those who are concerned with social progress, about the conflict between scientific progress and needs of society generally. It is for that reason that the Opposition has suggested in one paracertain graph of its amendment that the functions of Council be changed to allow for a greater social input and a great study of the social implications of what we do. One of the oddities of our comsecurity, munity at the present moment is that we are careful of the environment. We want environState. mental impact statements before we cut down tree. We do not seem to worry about what we do when we are going to cut down people. In our economic considerations there is very little cern for the people who are going to be struck down by changes in economic policy. If we are going to do anything to the environment we Council expend a great deal of care upon it, but the time has long passed since we gave serious consideration to people. The Science and Technology Council ought be charged with the responsibility of ensuring that science fulfils that role. The Opposition makes the point that the Council is unduly structioned tured towards industrial and commercial usage science. It is unduly restrictive in its membership and is unduly restrictive in the scope of its It is unduly restrictive in its capacity to inform itself of its own motion. I suggest to the of Rephonourable member for Hotham, who is taking a deep interest in this subject, that one of features of government that beset us continuously is the tendency to restrict the activities of the bodies we establish. As long as the Minister has the power into intervene when he thinks that people have gone overboard about something, that should be adequate. Until the Council has established that it is unable to act with responsibility on its own we ought not to restrict its activities.",88
180,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND," I wish to add several points to the debate. The know honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) referred to the fourth paragraph of the Oppothis will sition's amendment, which relates to the The appointment of parliamentarians to the Council. In my speech I made it very clear that one of the posefforts behind the wording of this Bill was to life have independence, which we tried to achieve exthrough a number of the clauses. I think that in doing it this way we have achieved this end, but to include parliamentarians on the Council is getcouncil ting away from the whole point of it. The other point made by the honourable member concerned deletions from reports of the to the Parliament and the fact that notice should be given of the reports that have been received and of the grounds for any deletions. That isridiculouswhen one looks at it from the the point of view of prejudicing security. How can one possibly disclose a report and then say that parts of it have been deleted? That gets the away from the whole point of clause 6 which deals with the possibility of not reporting under certain circumstances which would prejudice the defence, international relations or revery lations between the Commonwealth and any So I think the honourable member for a Wills has missed the boat on that point. I think one other point needs to be mentioned, conand that is the membership of the Council. Perhaps large councils can get things done but I think the number that has been selected for this makes for a workable council. If a larger I think number of members were appointed-the honourable member suggested that members from all walks of life should be appointed-the Council would become unwieldy. The honourto able member also mentioned that a wider range of people should be appointed to the Council. In my speech in the second reading debate I menthat representatives of many departments are invited to attend every meeting, and the minutes and agenda papers are sent to other departments if the items are of interest to them. I think that covers a wide variety of interests, and there is no need to extend the membership of the Council.",89
181,Dr CASS,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND," I would like to refer to the fourth amendment put forward by the Opposition, which relates to clause 10, the membership of the Council. By way of explathroughout nation, I would like to mention that when the inanother terim Australian Science and Technology Counto cil was appointed by the Labor Government membership included a sociologist, and economist, a philosopher, a biologist, a chemist, two engineers-on e an academic and the other from Telecom Australia-a n immunologist, two indusreally trialists and a trade unionist. We sought to enforecasting, compass a complete spectrum of human endeavyou our relating to science and technology in the broader sense, including the social sciences. I think that philosophy is part of the spectrum must be taken into account. In contrast, the membership of the initial Council appointed this Government consisted of a grazier,fiveinare dustrialists, eight academics, two chemists, engineers, one geologist, two biologists, one itical scientist and a trade unionist. There was sociologist, no philosopher, no economist one representing the consumer organisations consumer interests in the broader community sense. The Labor Government tried to appoint that Council somebody from that sector but I afraid that the then Premier of New South Wales refused to let the poor lady join the group. I think that members of the Opposition have encomthis passed in their remarks the reasons why we think the membership should include such a broad spectrum of people. I shall now discuss the sorts of people should be selected. The tendency with groups like this is to pick august members of the learned institutions, usually people who are retired from active research or technological endeavours-th elder statesmen, if you like. I think that defeats the purpose of the exercise, because what we really out to do is to get the very latest available information; to tap the brains of the people who are working at the growing edge of science, the younger people who are actively involved. Opposition's amendment encompasses that not only when it refers to the types of people about whom I spoke but also when it seeks to strike out the lengths of service stated in the Bill-in fact allowing no one to serve for longer than three years. That is a realistic assessment of the fact that if a prospective member is actively involved in research at the height of his career he will not want to give up six, eight or ten years of his life, but he may be prepared to put aside three years in order to work on a council such as this and hence give the community the very latest and best advice in his area. Of course he will not be expected to answer all the questions, but because he is actively engaged in research he is more likely to be a member of what the Americans call the 'invisible' colleges. Groups of biologists the world know more about one and their latest work than they are likely know about an engineer in their own academic its institutions, say, in Sydney or Melbourne. That is what we want; we want the very latest information because in a sense this Council, if it functions properly, will have to indulge in or providing studies in futurology, if like. I mentioned that in my previous comments about the application of developments in science to the future of this country. That sort of that wisdom and understanding will not come from the elder statesmen in the scientificfieldswho by have completed their research, whose interests locked into the work they have done, and two who will not be as up to date as the sorts of polpeople I have mentioned. So much for the type of no people who should be on the Council. For that and no reason the Opposition has put forward an or amendment to cut back the length of time for which members of the Council can be appointed. to We are not saying that the chairman cannot be am an elder statesman. I can think of half a dozen characters who could well fit that bill. But if a chairman is to get the best from a Council such as he needs young, active research workers. Now I come to another slightly controversial point, namely, the issue of the two representatives from the Parliament on this Council. This who amendment was put forward because the Opposition hoped that the responsible Minister might have been flexible enough to accept it but of course that is not likely to happen. I would like to e recount some observations I have made because I was involved in this subject for some time while are I was a member of the Victorian Labor Party's science committee looking into science policy. I read a lot of literature about it and formulated the idea that a science council was needed. I reThe member that when the examiners from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development came to Australia and we discussed these sorts of councUs with them, sadly to say the examiners said that we ought to set up a science councU-w e call it the Science and Technology Council, but it is the same basic thing-bu t the EngUshman and the Belgian, I think it was, said that in real terms, in most of the countries where these bodies have been set up, the experience has been fairly disappointing. They gave many reasons, not the least of which was that beautiful reports may be written but no one takes any notice of them; they are just buried. The West German examiner said: 'We do not have that trouble. We think it is a good idea. But our scienaccept. tists meet with a council of Ministers and in fact the reports which are published are not written just by the scientists; they are written by a combined group consisting of Ministers and scientists'. The Labor Government accepted that profore, posal, and in fact at the same time as appointed the interim ASTEC in May 1975 we It appointed a ministerial committee, which was chaired by the Minister for Science, and I think five or six Ministers-member s of the Cabinetand were on that committee. I was invited along one of the Ministers who could be interested. think I was Minister for the Media at the time, but I suppose it was seen that the media might have some relationship to technology and vice versa. I was one of the Ministers involved. had two or three meetings- I forget many-at which all the scientists and this group of Ministers sat together to discuss how we might approach the problems and the sorts that should be looked into, and that is how we intended it to continue. It is interesting that the Royal Commission into Australian Government administration, the so-called of Coombs Royal Commission, in its discussions this topic advised that ASTEC should be responand sible to and should advise the Prime Minister and a ministerial committee on science policy. case honourable members might have thought that the Labor Party was crackpot in this regard, this investigation, after considering all the dence, came up with the same proposition. I will repeat the reasons why I think it is portant. It is easy for scientists who are not sponsible for political decisions to go off into 'never-never' with their ideas about what ought to be-grea t idealism based on their fantasies the possibilities of science in the foreseeable future. If they are forced to with politicians they may well be dragged back to a more certain political reality. But at the same time. I think this is of major significance in proposal-in the process of the argument or discussion between scientists and with the polifidential ticians we will create an environment whereby the politicians may in fact be educated and may better understand the potential significance what the scientists are talking about. It complicated. I read out some of what they are talking about earlier today and I heard a few snorts around the chamber. Obviously people thought it was a bit far fetched. It is not necessarily far fetched. But just to read about it and not know about it in the sense of being involved in the discussion or argument makes it difficult to The concept of having a council or a committee of Ministers associated with ASTEC so that the reports that come out are in fact reports written by the combined group will mean that at least a significant section of the Cabinet will be very intimately acquainted with what the scientists are talking about. It is far more likely, therethat they will be fired with whatever recwe ommendations the combined committee makes. is far less likely that the report will be tabled and an occasional crackpot from either side of the Parliament pick it up and thumb through it, then it be forgotten. It is far more likely that as Cabinet will be forced to take the proposal I seriously. For those reasons I very seriously propose that honourable members should at least accept our amendment and after what I hope will be a shorttimeof experience, recognise the We advisability of dragging some Cabinet members exactly how into the discussions.",90
182,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,Order ! The honourable of problems member's time has expired.,91
183,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"The honourable to note member for Hotham (Mr Roger Johnston) expanded on several points made from this side the chamber. I want to take together clauses 6 on and 26-the clause which deals with reporting the one which deals with secrecy-and amplify if possible the point I was making that in In many of these areas it is not exacdy the legal prohibition that stops people working; but the inhibitions that flow from what they think is the evisituation. The same applies to the ministerial proscription upon what the council may or may not do. If we are to create an instrument by imwhich science and technology are expanded, the reintellectual challenge is taken up and the far the edge of scientific research, as. my colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) of put it, is continuously expanded by encouragement from a public body, we must remove the discuss their ideas inhibitions. I cannot quite understand the necessity for the some parts of clause 6. For instance, take that the part which regards as gready secret and conand possibly destructive anything that may come before the council and be let out from its deliberations which would affect the relationof ship between the Commonwealth and the States. often is We are not going to have the present Queensland Government there forever trying to inhibit the things that this Commonwealth does. I was a bit surprised at the assertion of the honourable member for Hotham that we would cripple the independence of the council if we put members of this Parliament on it. I know that internally in this Parliament we are not all that free. I know that honourable members opposite toe the party line. I know that on this side when we mark down the party line democratically we all toe it. So in the public debate here tonight I am careful of what I say, as always. For instance, I do not want to offend my friend the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) but I think it is fair to say that the great proportion of people in this Parliament, when they are facing up to the ordinary community gatherings, when they sit on community deliberations, when they go to meetings of other bodies to which they belong or of which they have membership, are probably the most free spirits in it. We are accountable to a particular group of people in a particular sort of way. If we are not afraid of the people in our electorates we do not need to be afraid of much else. It is my experience that the people who are likely to produce the most outward-going view of situations are the people who have had a strong political background and training in an institution such as this one. I think that the honourable member for Hotham must be having a very chastening experience on his side of the Parliament if in the few months that he has been here he feels that he has lost all his independent spirit. As I understand the honourable gendeman, one of the products of private enterprise is that free flowing expression of the human spirit which creates a totally different view of things from that held by we humble downtrodden people on this side. That is what I thought was his view. What do I find? The honourable member said that it would cripple the independence of this council to put members of the Parliament on it. If in six months or thereabouts membership of that party on that side of the Committee has managed to cripple his independent spirit, it is a sad case indeed. I do not presume that it has. I think honourable members should stop speaking in that way about membership of this Parliament. I am convinced from my own personal experience that members of this Parliament have a great deal to contribute to bodies such as the one we are discussing. Therefore I ask honourable members opposite to place a vote of confidence in themselves and accept the Opposition's amendment.",91
184,Mr BARRY JONES,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND," I think it is very important that when the Parliament has the opportunity to strengthen the role of the generalist as against the specialist it ought to take that opportunity. I have said before in this chamber and I am sure I will say again many times, that broadly speaking, we are a chamber of generalists. That is to say, all of us or most of us have some particular expertise in some area but broadly speaking we are generalists as against the entire range of subjects that come before us. I think where we have an opportunity to strengthen the role of the generalist as against the technical specialist we ought to take it. That is precisely what the amendment to clause 10 suggests. I think it is particularly important that if we are to have a parliament which is to stand up to the challenges of the last quarter of the twentieth century we ought to be sure that we are fully informed about what is happening in this extremely important Australian Science and Technology Council. That is the first thing-w e ought to strengthen the role of the generalist vis-a-vis the specialist. I make the point that very often in councils such as this the most important thing to be done is the determining of relativities. We will not be making absolute judgments, we will not be spending a lot of time examining, say, renal surgery and determining which kind of experimentation in renal surgery is likely to be more important than another. We will perhaps be determining relativities about how much time ought to be devoted to applied research as against pure research. That is a decision involving a value judgment. It is not altogether a matter of saying what the absolute value of each particular piece of research is; it is a matter of determining relativities. I think this is where the experience and the general understanding of life of the generalist- I include members of Parliament in that description-ca n be just as important as the role of the specialist. The scientists are not necessarily the best people to judge that. I would like briefly to refer to my own experience on various boards which have been administering moneys and helping to determine policies for both the Commonwealth Government and the State governments. I was a member for a while, under a Liberal government, of the Commonwealth Music Board. I say without any hesitation that musicians are not necessarily the best judges of relativities in determining where money ought to go. Very often it seemed to me that the generalist who had a very deep interest in music could contribute valuably where it was a matter of determining relativities. We are not determining whether money ought to be spent recording the tliirty-second Beethoven sonata as against the thirty-nrst. Mr Katter-What has this to do with it? Mr BARRY JONES I am talking about the role of the expert, the role of the technologist if you like, as against the role of the generalist. That is what I am talking about. It is very important. Similarly, I would have said from my five years as a member of the Australian Film Development Corporation that the judgment of the film maker about where money ought to be applied infilmswas not necessarily the best judgment. There is a very important role for the generalist to help to determine relativities. Similarly, in my six years on the Australian Council for the Arts-again , I point out that I was appointed by a Liberal Party Government-the important role that I and other people like Dr Coombs could fulfil was that as generalists we were able to help to determine relativities and to compare, weigh and evaluate the advice that was put in by people who were experts in particular areas.",92
185,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,You mean ordinary people instead of smart people?,93
186,Mr BARRY JONES,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"No, no. They represent the taxpayer, who, in many cases, is footing the bill.",93
187,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,They might even be smart.,93
188,Mr BARRY JONES,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"Some of them are and some of them, no doubt, are not. Just as it is said that war is much too important to be left to the generals, and as we say that the preservation of archives is much too important to be left to the archivists, I believe that the determination ence policy should not just be left to the scientists. Mr MCLean-Leave that to the politicians.",93
189,Mr BARRY JONES,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"The point about the politician is that he is not someone who begins in the same way as an engineer or a chemist. He does not start off when he leaves school by saying: ' I will go to the university. I will acquire degree in political science and that degree will automatically qualify me to become a politician.' There are too many intervening stages before the person who might have a theoretical qualification is allowed to practice the art of politics. result is that we appeal to the electorate, broadly because we are the nominees of parties which represent a coalition of broad general interests. That needs to be said very often. There are too many examples of scientists who have been afflicted by tunnel vision. They have had an acute knowledge of the subject very close to them but they have not been able to appreciate the whole. Honourable members will be familiar with the famous parable of the four blind men and the elephant. It illustrates in many ways the problems that we have where decisions can be made because a particular expert is putting his arms around some subject that is close to him and is not looking at the general problem. We need to look at science policy, as with every other policy, at two levels at least. There needs to be the worm's eye view by the specialist who works very close to the subject matter, and there also needs to be the bird's eye view by the person who is not personally, professionally or technically involved but who, to use that ghastly cliche word, is able to exercise an overview. It is because of the need to have an overview that the Opposition believes that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), in his infinite wisdom and judgment, ought to accept the amendment which has been moved tonight.",93
190,Mr VINER,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND," I am not sure that I should carry the burden of the infinite wisdom which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), suggests I have, more particularly when I regret to advise him that I am not prepared to accept the Opposition's amendments. I suppose the inference to be drawn is that I am a very unwise person. With due respect to members of the Opposition, both young and old, I suggest to them that it is a very grave mistake to think that members of parliament, simply because they are members of parliament, are expert in everything and, therefore, ought to be made members of every body, statutory or otherof sciwise, created by the Parliament. It appears to me that of all the amendments put forward by the Opposition there were only two that they sought to put forward with any vigour or any desire to have carried. Thefirstwas in their rewriting of clause 5, which sets out the functions of the Council. I must say, after listening to members of the Opposition from the a Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) down, that they clearly have not read clause 5. They have ignored it completely and have sought to rewrite it. It is a simple matter of drafting for them to have understood that the functions are The described in the widest terms. The very generality of those functions is specified by way of including, not'limiting, certain matters to which the Council can direct its attention. Clause 5 states that the functions of the Council are to investigate and to furnish information and advice to the Commonwealth Government in respect of matters relating to science and technology. That is across the widest area of science and technology. The clause then goes on to specify particular matters that are included in the generality and to which the Council's attention is directed. All those particular matters are very wide in their terms. For example, some matters are: The advancement of scientific knowledge, the development and application of science and technology in relation to the furtherance of the national well-being, and the identification and support of new ideas in science and technology likely to be of national importance. So, when we hear the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition and of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) who said that too much attention was being given to science and technology with respect to industry, I think all we need to do is to turn to the language of clause 5. There we see the breadth of functions that the Council is given and the breadth of the particular matters to which the Council is being invited to pay attention. I noticed with some interest that the Opposition, in its rewriting of those functions, adopted what is sub-clause (f) of clause 5 when referring to the fostering of scientific and technoresentatives logical innovation in industry. Far from there being over-emphasis upon science and technology in industry, that is the only part of that clause which refers to industry. As I pointed out, that sub-clause has been completely adopted by the Opposition. I thank the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Roger Johnston) for his contribution to this debate and for pointing out the things that I pointed out as to the inadequacy of the OppocU. sition's treatment of clause 5 and of other of this Bill. It was the honourable member for Maribyrnong who said that one of the defects of the Bill was that it did not allow, for example, Council to investigate such matters as genetic gineering. I advise him that the fact of the matter is that the Australian Science and Technology Council currently has a sub-committee deaUng with the necessary care to be used in research genetic engineering. That demonstrates the purview of the existing terms of reference that Government. are given by this Bill to the Australian Science and Technology Council. I think it can be seen that the Bill provides all the necessary and extensive authority to the Council to investigate matters of scientific and technological relevance to adopted. the national well-being and matters which, in their widest understanding, are of national importance. The other matter on which the Opposition seemed to concentrate its attention was the membership of the Council. I regret to say that Opposition members seemed to miss completely the point of the provision in the Bill authorising the membership of the Council. Quite deliberately, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said in his second reading speech: Members of the Council will be selected for their personal qualities rather than as representatives of organisations or interests. I would have thought that for a body such as this Council the overriding consideration would be that the members of the Council be selected for their personal qualities rather than representing any particular organisation or interest. We know from wide experience in government that if people are selected as representatives of organisations or interests they are not necessarily the people with the appropriate qualities for the particular job in hand. I have already referred to the suggestion from honourable members opposite that members of Parliament have the qualities necessary for membership of this Council. As I understand their argument, they were saying that because members of Parliament are repof the people, therefore they ought by right to be members of this science Council. I think the proposal needs only to be stated, as I have done, for the inadequacy of it to be shown. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) referred to his past membership of the Australia Council Music Board and of the Australian FUm Development Corporation. As admirable and valuable as that membership may have been I chaUenge the validity of his analogy have to the Australian Science and Technology CounIt shows a misunderstanding of the nature parts and function of the Council. As honourable members can judge from what I have said, it is a specialist advisory body; it is not an executive the body. Being a specialist advisory body, in the enGovernment's judgment it requires as members persons selected for their personal quaUties. For those reasons the proposed amendments dealing with those two matters are not accepted by the in Government, nor are the other amendments wide proposed by the Opposition accepted by the Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report Third Reading Motion (by Mr Viner)-by leave-proposed : That the Bill be now read a third time.",93
191,Mr BRYANT,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"During the Committee stage it was pointed out that we had not covered fully some of the matters that dealt with by the proposed amendments. I think it should be made clear, and for the record, that there was a very restricted period available this debate. Given the opportunity to do so would have dealt with the Bill satisfactorily the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) would not have been able to make such an inadnary equate reply at the end of the Committee stage after he had listened to our advice.",95
192,Mr BOURCHIER,AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND,"On that point, I think it should also be recorded that stage did anybody try to stop the progress of the anarchy. Australian Science and Technology Council Bill through the chamber. Nor, when the Opposition had speaker after speaker on the various clauses in the Committee stage, did we try to interpose and stop them. In fairness I think the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) should do the right thing and say that the Bill had proper passattempting age through the chamber.

194,Mr YOUNG,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"The Public Service Arbitration Act Amendment Bill is bad legislation and will be opposed outright by were the Opposition. This is not what could be described as a properly considered piece of legislation. It was born out of the Government's hufor miliation and defeat in the recent Commonwe wealth Employment Service dispute and will and ultimately do great harm to industrial relations within the Public Service. It is quite extraordithat the Government, having handled the dipute so badly, and having participated in the dispute as a party to the dispute, now wishes to change the rules in order that the Government or the Public Service Board is always the winner. at no That is not industrial relations but industrial This legislation has as its origin the bungling management of the Public Service carried out by this Government since it came to office in 1975. The unions involved in the recent dispute can in no way be looked upon as a group of militants to usurp the role of Government. The fact that the unions involved were prepared to take this dispute to the point of stand-down requires some further analysis. I believe Government decisions taken well before this dispute arose played some part in the employees' decision to fight the Government on this issue. The conflict occurred towards the end of 1977 and early in 1978 over a Board proposal to recruit a large number of people from outside the Service by to middle level positions in the Commonwealth Employment Service. The unions took the view that applications for promotion or transfer from serving officers should be considered before the recruitment campaign was launched outside the Service. In addition to this, the associations also believed a review process should be established the capabilities of long serving Public Servants to be matched against recruits from outside the Service. The Public Service Board of refused to accept these views, and the disBefore dealing with the dispute as such, allow to present what I consider to be some of the problems that came before this actual dispute arose. In his second reading speech the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) said: Honourable members will recall that in 1976 the Government commissioned Mr J. D. Norgard to conduct an inquiry Second Reading into the Commonwealth Employment Service. In his report identified the need for more staff in the CES who have relevant experience in industry and commerce, either at an operative or managerial level. The Government accepted that view. Accordingly, in November of last year, vacancies for Employment Officer (Class 4) positions in the CES were advertised both within the Public Service and in the Press. The House can see from this that the Minister and the Government place great emphasis upon the review carried out by Mr Norgard in taking the action that they did late last year. However, the Government has been crudely selective in using Norgard as a springboard for these decisions. Let us have a look firstly at what the Norgard Committee said on staff resources on page 173 of its report. It states: There has been a marked increase in the areas of the CES staff establishment in recent years. Establishment at the end of June 1974 was 1,874. At the end of June 1976 it had risen to 2,766, an increase of 48 per cent. However, in the twelve months ending June 1974 the number of clients seeking employment help with the CES totalled 1,063,000 whilst for the same period in 1976 the number was 1,667,000. This represents an increase of 57 per cent. In other words staffing increased at a lower rate than the number of clients. Corning on top of this of course we had the Government's policy of 1976 to place ceilings on all departments of the Commonwealth Public Service right across the board. It was ironic that at a time when this Government was purposely building the pool of unemployed in Australia, it at the same time was placing a ceiling on the number of people that could be appointed to service the wants of the unemployed. It is a wonder that an industrial dispute did not arise at that time. One can well understand the frustrations of those people working in the offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service, gready undermanned as they were, who were weekly having greater and greater pressures put upon them. It is interesting to note in the Royal Commission Report on Australian Government Administration the comments made on the impact of the have Government imposing callings within the Serwhich vice. The Commission had this to say: Without quesdon the grievance most often made ceilings is their general incompatability with the growth government initiatives by way of expanded or programs. In the first place ing given them does not take cognisance of the thrust expected programs, and this would be a natural complaint levied by all government agencies against all central trolling organs of government. However the more serious aspect of this complaint relates to government initiatives announced after ceilings have been proclaimed with lowance for the ceiling to be initiative. In short this boils down to an unawareness on the part of Cabinet in particular of the resource implications government moves. Naturally enough the Public Board is not able to adjust any department's ceiling the authority of its own minister ter in all cases). In short it can be stated quite definitely the basis of numerous cases cited throughout the government machine that ceilings have not ment initiatives. I place great emphasis on this point because consider that the Government's decision to back on the Public Service had a big influence on the dispute at the end of 1977 and early in 1978. The Commission continued. Some other general complaints which have been voiced regarding ceilings include the following: They are not an effective control mechanism. It is the whole management system of the department which is the key. Ceilings are just one instrument. Ceilings are unnecessary if your management is good. They cause tension, strain and stress, rivalry and communication breakdowns in departments. They are time consuming to implement, more so in large complex departments with far flung outposts. They affect the credibility of departments with the general public, with specific clients, and with potential recruits. They are inappropriate to departments with the general public, with specific clients, and with potential recruits. They are inappropriate to departments which have experienced frequent reorganisations. They inhibit attempts to decentralise government activity because the application of staff ceilings invariably means centralisation of physical activity and decision making. They lead to all sorts of claims by departments that all or portion of their activities should be exempt from the ceiling. In other words they lead to special pleading which can often find its wayrightthrough to Cabinet level. They are far too arbitrarily applied with no real attempt at priority determination especially at the macro level. The Public Service Board keeps insisting that the ceilings will determine the workload of the department but it is the workload which determines the ceiling. Not enough recognition is given by the Board in its allocation of ceilings to the irrevocable commitments which tie departments to certain programs and thus inhibit their attempt to formulate priorities, especially when the ceding is atightone. Thefindingsof the Royal Commission would had a greater bearing on the CES offices were working under such enormous strain than possibly any other government department. against Yet the Government continued to pursue this of folly. As I have pointed out, Norgard found staff new increases in the CES were growing at a much departments claim that the ceilof their lower rate than that of the number of clients. In this context, and with a dispute imminent, the conNorgard Report is also important. As I have said, the Government had been crudely selective no alin its use of the Norgard recommendations. adjusted to take account of this The Minister uses as his whole case a very of small part of the Norgard recommendations on Service which to justify the Government's pigwithout headedness during the term of the dispute that (virtually the Prime Minison led to the introduction of this legislation. Norgard in fact gave a very comprehensive been as responsive as governand detailed analysis of the inadequacy of the staffing of the CES offices, much of which had I been caused by Government decisions. In both cut the Norgard and the Royal Commission inquiry into the Public Service, emphasis was placed upon job satisfaction, the opportunity for promotion, the proper utilisation of ability, and the attitude to the Public Service as a career. Though the Government gives lip service to many of these views on employment within the Government service itself, action in this matter does quite the contrary. On pages 110 through to 115 of volume III of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration the disillusionment of many Government employees in the Third and Fourth Division is evident and the Government should have taken these things into mind when it embarked, at the behest of the Public Service Board, into this dispute. The Government would have known that to recruit such a large number of people into Government employ was not a correct interpretation of the Norgard recommendation. To talk of bringing in over 600 employees with 'managerial experience' was then, as it is now, nonsense. To talk of the 600 having qualifications and experience and skills which not one person in the Public Service had already attained was also nonsense. But the Public Service Board wanted complete control. In the light of the Association's refusal to accept the Board assertion of its absolute authority, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations referred the matter to the Public Service Arbitrator for settlement. One would have thought that, having notified the dispute to the Arbitrator, the Minister and the Public Service Board would have abided by the decision of the umpire. In his second reading speech the Minister intimated what happened when the matter came before the Deputy Arbitrator. The Minister said: He refused to deal with the central issue, i.e. there should be a right of appeal against appointments to the CES from outside the Public Service, on the ground that he did not have jurisdiction to do so because in his view the matter did not, as was required under the Public Service Arbitration Act, concern conditions of employment of officers or employees of the Public Service. I should say that it has been abundantly clear, right throughout this period from the commencement of the dispute until today when honourable members are debating this legislation, that the Associations involved have not been opposed to outside recruitment. They seek the maintenance of the promotions appeal system which is such an integral part of their working conditions. We on this side of the House do not agree with the Minister when he says in his second reading speech: The Parliament has clearly intended that the area of vital importance to the standing of the Service recruitment, selection and promotion procedures should be a matter of management decision. There seems to be something very sinister about the way in which the Government has acted. On the one hand it says it is important to bring in people with these new skills to the Public Service, but apparently these people cannot stand up against the appeals of people already in the Service. One can only conclude that the people the Government is seeking out do not have all the skills the Government would like us to believe they have. In his second reading speech, the Minister said: The issue is not simply one of management prerogatives though that is important, it is whether the efficiency of the Service might be allowed to be placed in jeopardy. I put it to the Minister that if he was so confident of the ability of his new employees they would have easily stood up to any appeal that may have been launched. But the Minister and the Board were determined at all costs to pursue their own course and throw industrial relations into the rubbish bin. When the Deputy Public Service Arbitrator refused to deal with the central issue the matter was taken to the High Court. The High Court left no doubt as to its belief in the jurisdiction of the Deputy Arbitrator. In an extremely important decision, the High Court completely vindicated the stand of the Associations and ruled against the stand being taken by the Government. In its decision, after giving its interpretative reasons, the High Court said: For these reasons the Deputy Arbitrator had power to make an order granting to the officers concerned in or affected by or likely to be concerned in or affected by the industrial situation a right of appeal against the appointment of outsiders to positions in the service, provided that he thought such an order 'necessary or desirable for putting an end to or preventing the occurrence of, the situation or preventing the occurrence of further industrial situations' or 'necessary or desirable by reason of the e x is t e n c e . . . of the situation'. However he misconstrued the provisions of the Act and misconceived the extent of his powers. He wrongly failed to consider the merits of the dispute which had given rise to the industrial situation. Once this conclusion was reached it was clear that mandamus should issue to command him to exercise the jurisdiction which he wrongly declined. Moreover the orders that he in fact made were made only because of the erroneous interpretation which he had placed on section 12D and his erroneous assumption that he lacked jurisdiction to determine the merits of the dispute. His statement, which is quoted above, makes this plain. For that reason those orders could not be allowed to stand. From then the matter should have rested, but the Board and the Government, again not to be defeated, decided to change the ground rules. Thus we have this legislation before the House which, as I said at the outset, is ill-considered and completely unnecessary. Not only does it turn the clock back for the Government as an employer but it contains in clause 4 penalties that can be described only as legislative over-kill. Standdowns in the field of industrial relations will never be accepted as such by the industrial movement. It is a mechanism used by employers which the movement endures, but to take this matter to the extent of penalising the sick leave, annual leave and long service leave of any person stood down is taking stand-down provisions to new heights of repugnance, besides necessitating a mountain of administrative work that otherwise could be avoided. The jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator to deal with these matters was established as far back as 1922. It was confirmed in this most recent High Court decision. The association involved agreed to be bound by the decisions of the Arbitrator. The employees in this case have carried out their responsibilities in a manner which leaves no room for criticism. The Government's actions on the other hand, the lead-up to the dispute, the ceilings, the lack of real concern in the case of the CES officers, the refusal to be bound by the Arbitrator's decision and now this legislation have been part of one long series of political blunders which deserve the highest condemnation. Recruitment from outside the Public Service is supported by all, including both parties in this House and employees in the Service. The Government had at hand all the ingredients for a peaceful transition. Only a government devoid of ideas and goodwill could have bungled the issue the way this Government has. The Opposition opposes the Bill.",95
195,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"The have Public Service Arbitration Amendment Bill does two things: Firsdy, it confers on the Public vice Arbitrator the right to stand down emauthority ployees in certain circumstances. That is the printhese cipal provision of the Bill, and it is a provision with which anybody who is opposed to industrial anarchy has to agree totally. It is nonsense for honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) to indicate that this provision represents a reversion to the past. It is not a reversion 19th century. It is a plain piece of common sense. The plain fact of life is, whether it is in private enterprise or whether it is in public enterprise, if there is no work there is no pay. If there is no stoppage work, the salaries are unable to be paid. posing this Bill, the honourable member for Adelaide is inviting a situation in which he want no authority whatsoever and in which a form of anarchy would operate within the Public Service. That cannot be tolerated under any circumstances whatsoever. It is widely known that hundreds of federal awards contain stand-down provisions. The award covering the Vehicle Builders Employees' Federation of Australia contains stand-down provisions. Many of the awards covering employees of the Australian Workers Union contain them, and there are hundreds of awards that contain stand-down provisions. Many of those awards are consent awards. So it is nonsense to say that this authority should not exist. The first principle upon which this Bill has to be supported is that if such provisions are not enshrined in legislation, we would be inviting a form of anarchy within the public sector. That situation is not tolerable. A second point needs to be made, and it is simply this: We have observed in many statutory corporations and other bodies that people have not been willing to perform all the work that is appropriate to be performed. Where all the work that is appropriate to be performed is not so performed, the right of stand-down must exist. The honourable member was saying: 'Throw away that right that accrues to any organisation or any authority that is an employer'. If that were done, we would have a state of total and complete anarchy. The honourable member for Port Adelaide made a serious mistake. He overstated his opposition to this Bill. I suggest that some of those people who are briefing him have merely made him a tool of the argument that they propose. What he is proposing does not work in private enterprise and does not work in public enterprise. What he is proposing is not adopted by Labor governments in Australia when they such authorities within their own Public Services. It is not adopted in State Conciliation Serand Arbitration Commissions which have an to stand down. He is suggesting that provisions be placed in a state of nihilism in the Commonwealthfield.Nobody could tolerate that precise proposition. Let me quote from what the I stated in one industry award. I refer to part of the metal industry award which makes it quite clear that stand down provisions operate in that to the award also. The award states: The employer shall have the right to deduct payment for any day the employee cannot be usefully employed because of any strike or through any breakdown in machinery or any of work by any cause for which the employer canBy opnot reasonably be held responsible. Port That is a reasonable proposition. Were the would honourable member responsible for employing or for providing the resources and getting the revenue to pay people within his own office, he would have to abide by the same principle. Anybody would have to abide by it. It is a feature of this Bill, and it is the linchpin of the Bill. It is the crux of the legislation. I want to deal with one other part of the legislation which worries me. I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) to consider that matter. It is a minor part of the legislation; nevertheless I think that it is important. We know that in any stand-down position there are those people who are directly involved in the process and there are those who are stood down because there is a lack of work or employment available to them. Sometimes, that second group of people, who can be quite innocent of the first stoppage, can be quite some distance from the stoppage of work that occurred in the first place. I merely ask the Minister to consider this matter carefully. I wonder whether some of the provisions with respect to the stoppage of accruals for annual leave, sick leave or long service leave ought to be applied stringently in respect of those people who have not been concerned directly in the stoppage. This does not apply in private enterprise, as much as it may be said to do so. Provisions exist whereby this could occur in private enterprise. When there are stand-downs of employees who are some distance from the original dispute, in the process of negotiating the settlement those matters often become a part of the process of negotiating that settlement. I know of employers who have waived the non-accrual of recreation leave, sick leave and so on for those who have not been concerned directly in a dispute but who have been involved in a stand-down. It may be said, for example, that the application of the new provisions-the non-accrual of sick leave, recreation leave and long service leave-wil l help to put pressure on those people who are involved direcdy in the dispute. I merely put this proposition to the Minister, and I ask him to consider it. There are many cases in which the pressure that could be put upon those who are directly involved in the dispute cannot be organised. Let me give some examples. A clerical officers strike could take place, as a result of which some stenographers or typists are stood down. They are stood down legitimately. Having been stood down, they will not be able to exert any pressure upon those employees who were responsible for the original stoppage. These could be Fourth Division officers, and the employees who went on strike originally could be in a different division altogether. There could be no influence of one group upon the other. Let me give another example of a situation in which a strike could occur. The employees in a certain division will stop work. Employees known as tea ladies will be stood down. They have to be stood down because there is no work for them. Why then has the accrual of recreation leave and so on been stopped in respect of the tea ladies? They are members of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, which is a quite distinct and separate union. They will not be able to bring any pressure to bear upon those who were responsible for the original stoppage. I find it difficult to see why this legislation, which is correct in principle, goes quite that far. I would like to give a third example as I think it is appropriate to consider it. Some telex operators could stop work at the Department of Defence in Canberra. That would mean that there would be insufficient work for telex operators, say, at Lavarack Barracks in North Queensland or at the Pearce Base in Western Australia. The later can have no effect upon the former in terms of stopping the dispute or of putting pressure upon those who were responsible for the dispute. I wonder why then, during the course of that dispute, one should go through the complicated process of seeing that in respect of the new matters-that is, annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and so on-the right of accrual should be suspended for the period in which the standdowns operate for those other people. I am aware of one other point which might persuade the Minister to try to consider those who are the innocent parties in disputes in this area. The legislation makes it quite clear that such stand-downs will be mandatory and that no variation will be possible in respect of accrual of those other incidental matters. I am wondering whether the Minister will consider bringing about a situation whereby the Public Service Arbitrator can decide in respect of those who will have the incidental leave and accrual suspended so that they might be spared from that position. In private enterprise, where there is the right to do what is proposed in this Bill, the settlement of a dispute becomes on many occasions an appropriate bargaining point so that those involved in the dispute on both sides can save face and bring about a return to work as quickly as possible. I merely make those points to the Minister and hope that he will consider them. I support the principal features of the legislation. They deserve to be supported because they are necessary in order to bring about a situation in which one is not a complete hostage to industrial anarchy. I refer to one other point. The Queensland legislation has attempted to deal with this position in terms of stand-downs. A recent amendment to the Queensland Industrial Conciliation and Arof bitration Act inserted a new section 21 A. Subcountry section (2) (a) of that section reads: Any employee stood down by an employer pursuant to sub-section (1) may appeal to an industrial magistrate against his being so stood down. He may appeal also in respect of the conditions which are pursuant to his being stood down. I not suggesting that there should be the right appeal in the Commonwealth legislation but I suggest that there is a softening of that legisungainly lation. I know that when stand-down orders are made time is allowed before the stand-down lations order operates. The non-accrual of sick leave and long service leave does not operate for the first seven days on which the stand-down occurs. I suggest that the Minister therefore might conin sider looking at what can be done so that those who are situated a great distance from the origreceived inal cause of the dispute can be spared and so that what will be infinitely difficult calculations as to the non-accrual of various types of leave can be avoided. I think the sider that that would confer an advantage upon the Public Service Arbitrator in that it would give him a certain flexibility in negotiating a settlement ment to the dispute, which is what we all want. I return to the principal terms of this Bill. They have to be supported. They are principles which operate in private enterprise. They are principles which operate in public enterprise and in State jurisdictions. To abolish them totally within Commonwealth jurisdiction would be a very foolish move indeed. The honourable member for Port Adelaide, who led the debate for the Opposition, had a case which he could have made with respect to certain sections of this legislation. Once again he has overstated his position.",98
196,Mr LES JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"The Public Service Arbitration Amendment Bill which is before the House is in many ways the epitome of ruined industrial relations. It seems to me that this Bill typifies the reality of the situation that we have seen, namely, the total shemozzle of industrial relations in this country. When one takes into account that the great argument has been between the Commonwealth Government, on the one hand, and responsible and senior public servants, on the other, it must be regarded as a very great reflection on the part of the Government which often gives lip service to the principles of conciliation and the general concept and idea of effecting reconciliation rather than allowing the law of the jungle to operate in connection with industrial disputes. Of course, this Bill is the sequel to a long saga disputation which dominated the media of this for months in the latter part of 1977 and for months in the early part of 1978. Nobody knew where the consequences would finally lie, who was to be affected, what number of public servants would be denied the unemployment benefit and what number of people, especially amongst the unemployed, would be denied the am benefit of the services which had been so effecof tively rendered by the people who had been dragged into this disgraceful dispute in such an and unreasonable way. I believe that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Re(Mr Street) has a great deal of accounting to do in order to try to get off the hook, because he can be fairly and squarely indicted as having made afirstclass blunder, a belligerent blunder, a situation which could and should have been resolved much earlier than it was. I have just from the Parliamentary Library a great heap of newspaper clippings about this matter. I have selected some of them. An article in the Age on 18 February 1978, headed 'Jobs staff face Minister might condole', states: Staff standdowns loom in the Commonwealth EmployService next week because of a two-month-old dispute over recruitment from outside the Public Service. The dispute is the result of a trade union ban on processing outside applications for CES positions following the Government 's decision late last year to expand CES staff. Of course, that followed from the Norgard inquiry and the general idea of upgrading the Commonwealth Employment Service. Of course, that was done in an indelicate way, as though it were designed deliberately to provoke an adverse reaction on the part of these senior public servants-peopl e who had served the Government for so long. They were told that there was to be a very considerable expansion in the number of senior officers and that they were to come from outside rather than inside the Service. This Government, with its obtuse approach to employer-employee relations, apparently did not have the faintest idea or inclination that there would be some adverse reaction on the part of these career public servants who had devoted their lives to the Service. The fact that they might be disadvantaged, with no proper consultation and no negotiation taking place, and with some of the most responsible people in this country being provoked into what turned out to be an ungainly industrial situation, did not disturb the Government. On 24 February 1978 the Sydney Morning Herald, in an article headed 'NSW vote supports continued CES bans', stated: The CES employees, members of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, are objecting to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations hiring employment officers from outside without giving preference to Government employees. The article could have read: 'Without even giving consideration to the capacities of Government employees'. The Australian Financial Review of 23 February carried the headline 'CES Dispute Deteriorates' and stated: The Commonwealth Employment Service staffing dispute deteriorated yesterday with the Federal Government threatening to apply for de-registration of the major Public Service union on top of standing down a further 17 CES managers. The West Australian had the headline: 'Hundreds face stand-downs in CES row'. The headlines go on and on. Another one from the Canberra Times reads: 'Ultimatum to CES staff could force stand-downs'. An editorial in the Canberra Times carried the heading: 'Staff to work without pay'. Another one stated: 'Standdown Stand-off'. The headlines go on and on. Finally we get to the inevitable, what anybody could have told the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. If there was to be any setdement it would be because of the preparedness of the parties concerned to get into an effective conciliation system. This man and this Government extols the virtue of conciliation and arbitration processes for everybody else but demonstrate an incapacity to put their own house in order. The last headline I refer to is that of the Canberra Times of 17 March which stated: 'CES row back to Arbitration'. One can never cease to be amazed at the inabdity of the Government to react and operate reasonably in situations involving industrial disputations. I am not just talking about disputes with the Public Service. The old master-servant syndrome dominates the mentality of this squattocracy which is predominant in the Government ranks. The Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) goes to his seminars day after day armed with all the contemporary attitudes about employer-employee relationships, about worker participation, about profit sharing, about information sharing to ensure that employees can be guaranteed security in a stable industry and all the rest of it. He is involved in issue after issue in telling other people how to run their affairs. When the crunch comes these attitudes contradict the Government's basic philosophy. An employer-master domination and an employee servility typifies the Government's attitude. This Bill is to put the public servants in their place after they dare to seek a say on the issue of outside appointments which threatened the continued employment and promotion of senior officers-as if that was an unreasonable course to pursue. We know that the stage has been set for this kind of confrontation for a longtime.Every time public servants take any kind of stance which is at all in accord with the dignity of an organised profession we have these threats. New legislation is brought into compound the offensive and belligerent apparatus of the Commonwealth Government. I refer to the Industrial Relations Bureau legislation, to amendments to the Trade Practices Act and to amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which equipped the Commonwealth with power to move in even more ruthlessly and unreasonably than it has been able to do in the past. One can only regret that situation. I say to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, who is not an insensitive man, that somewhere along the line something is wrong with the advice he is receiving. I do not think he could initiate such grotesque and belligerent attitudes on his own account. When one speaks privately to the Minister he talks about reasonable relations with workers. What then is it that causes Government members, in their corporate state, to bring down such pernicious legislation, as expressed through this Minister, which can have the effect, no matter what group of employees are involved, of bringing out only the worse in them. God, if it were not for the common sense of the Public Service organisations this legislation could have brought this country to its knees. I do not want to aggravate the situation. I simply say these words in the hope that they can bring about a saner attitude. The Opposition does not stand for stupidity. It does not stand for madcap attitudes in industrial relations. It is talking about the need for understanding, compromise and common sense. I know that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) comes in here and talks about the virtues in employer-employee relations in other parts of the world. He says that in Japan the employers virtually regard their employees as people whose welfare has to be safeguarded, people to whom there is to be a continuing and enduring obligation. All these beautiful phrases are mouthed, and yet when we come to a situation as fundamental as one which involves people being threatened with their employment, common sense just goes out of the window. The simple provisions of the Bill before us are threefold. It will put the exclusive prerogative of the Public Service Board beyond doubt in matters of recruitment and promotions. It will quell the voice of public servants in such matters by closing off the role of the Public Service Arbitrator to whom Public Service employee organisations have previously had some recourse. That is the situation. The main provisions of the Bill are to this effect: The Public Service Arbitrator is precluded from altering or affecting recruitment into or promotion within the Public Service by an amendment to the definition of conditions of employment in the Public Service Arbitration Act. The power of the Public Service Arbitrator to order the standing down of officers or employees who are concerned in or affected by an industrial situation is made specific by the inclusion of a new paragraph. In other words, the power of the legislature wins the day. Despite the fact that the unions took their case to arbitration and established the validity of their claims, the Minister, who was quite incorrect in many of his utterances-if time permits I can establish this contention-is now going to disregard the fact that unions wereright.This was established by the High Court of this country. He is simply saying that even if the unions were right the Government's will is still going to prevail because it will change the law to suit itself even in respect of unreasonable concepts. Let us see what the Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association had to say in its submission to members of Parliament. Let me summarise it. The union referred to this long industrial dispute between the ACOA and the Australian PubUc Service Association on the one hand and the PubUc Service Board and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations on the other. The fact is that the conflict occurred over a Board proposal to recruit extra people from outside the Service. The union took the view that applications for promotion or transfer from serving officers, some with many years service, should be considered-that is all, considered. The union felt that qualifications and the suitability of those people who had been in the Service for a long time should be taken into account in respect of these appointments before a recruitment campaign was launched outside the Service. The two associations beUeved that a review process-that is their terminologyshould be established to allow the capabiUties of long-serving public servants to be matched against those of the unknown raw recruits from without the Service. But they were confronted with the Board's flat refusal to discuss the issue. The union had put forward a comprehensive proposal on the occasion of the veryfirstmeeting on 17 November 1977. The irony of the whole situation is that the mate memorandum of understanding forced upon the associations, under threat of punitive action, on 1 March-that is, three and a half months later, after this grave dispute had taken its course, after there had been unemployment and anxiety and all the rest of it-wa s to the effect that there was to be no more than a variation of that original proposal. In other words, right at the start the union put up the solution that was ultimately accepted. Well may the Minister hang his head in embarrassment. There is no great hurry in the proceedings here tonight. There is not a lot of business before the House. We can confidently expect the Minister to stand up and defend his ineptness in this situation. The fact of the matter is that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations referred this matter to the Public Service Arbitrator for settlement. It is important to note that the Minister and the Public Service Board took the step of notifying the dispute to the Arbitrator. Of course, one would expect that in such a situation, when one looks for an umpire, when one looks for a referee, that the decision of the Arbitrator would be accepted by the person who had referred the matter. But that has not been the case. Mr Street-The Public Service Arbitrator said he did not have jurisdiction. It was not us who appealed, it was the union.",100
197,Mr LES JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"You went to the umpire for a decision. Mr Street-No , we did not. It was the union who appealed the Arbitrator's decision, not us. Get your facts straight first.",102
198,Mr LES JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"And they won, did they not? Mr Street-That was not it. It was a question of who appealed.",102
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,Dr Jenkins)Order! The House will come to order.,102
200,Mr LLOYD,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"He is only sorting him out. Mr Street- I havefixedhim now, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr LES JOHNSON I am not sure that you have. I will find the documentation relating to this matter, if not before I finish then in time to enable my colleague to handle it. If I am wrong about it I wiU certainly withdraw. One would certainly acknowledge that whoever did the referring adopted a sensible course of action. I am anxious to know what referring the Minister ultiadmits to. Was he just prepared to resort to a stand-off situation, to bluff them down? Did he make any conciliatory approaches in the situation? At least I offered him the virtue of accepting credit for taking this matter to the Public vice Arbitrator. He does not seem to believe that that is a reasonable thing to do. Let me tell the Minister that these matters have been the prerogative of the PubUc Service Arbitrator since the year 1922, and that has been acknowledged. Mr Street-Where is the case that decided that?",102
201,Mr LES JOHNSON,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"The cases are stacked up here. The Minister is asking a technical question, but the case was No. 3 of 1922, the Australian Postal Electricians Union, claimant, against the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth. That was the case and the documentation is here. If the Minister does not know anything about this kind of disputation I wiU give him a very well indexed file. The Minister can see that some parts are underlined in red. I will not have the opportunity to read them but they are to the effect that the courts have decided on previous occasions, as they did on this occasion, that the right of appeal is fundamental. Does the Minister deny that that ought to be the situation, that there ought to be an appeal? Regrettably, I cannot put my hands on the documentation, which is so precise and so devastating in this respect. However, the High Court decided in these cases that an appeal is fundamental, and it overruled the Public Service Arbitrator who was taking the view that he had no jurisdiction in regard to appeals affecting the conditions of employment of these public servants. The Court has taken the view unanimously. Because the Court has taken the view unanimously that employees are entitled to appeal, the Government has now brought down this legislation to close off the options of those employees. As a government it can be overbearing and monopolistic, and it has done this so that senior pubUc servants, who have been so indecently treated by this Government, can be pushed down further into a subjective situation. I believe that this Government stands indicted for the way in which it has brought the PubUc Service, which acts on behalf of the people of this country, into such serious and unnecessary disputation with the Government of Australia.",103
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,103
203,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"The Bill before the House is the Public Service Arbitration Amendment Bill. In rising to speak to it, firstly I must make a couple of points against the previous speakers. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), in his usual role as Ser- the defender of the unions, and he does it very well, spoke out very strongly in opposition to the Bill. But it is interesting to speculate that if a Bill were brought before the House next week to bring about the reverse conditions against the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union I am sure that he would speak against it. He is a nice fellow, but he has said, tongue in cheek, that what is good enough for the metal workers and other unionists is not good enough for the PubUc Service. The Government is trying to provide the PubUc Service with the same rights and privileges and restrictions and controls as those applying under the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act to the private enterprise sector. I think that that is not an unreasonable case to put forward. My colleague the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), playing it fifty-fifty, agreed with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) and supported the Bill, provided that it affects only the strikers, the ones who are causing the trouble. He knows quite well, as does the honourable member for Port Adelaide, that in the case of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the Australian Workers Union and other unions, any person affected by a strike can be stood down through lack of work if necessary. I know that the honourable member for LUley did not really mean what he said. He was only trying to point out something to protect some friend of his in the Public Service. Mr Kevin Cairns-That is a very foolish statement.",103
204,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"Not as foolish as some of the statements that you have been known to make. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) was the stand-in for the Labor Party and he did it very well. I congratulate him for his try, but he stood up and said exactly the same thing. It is aU right for private enterprise, it is allrightfor the unions outside",103
205,Mr HOLDING,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"You know nothing about it, nothing at all.",103
206,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"Hello, we have that exhopeful premier from Victoria sitting over there. He lost in Victoria, he was hopeless there, and now he has come here. God help us, he could be the leader of the Labor Party in this country one day. That would be a tragedy! Never mind, let us get back to the Bill before he gets excited. The honourable member for Hughes said that the Minister was not sensitive. That is utter nonsense. Nobody in this country has tried to work more closely with the unions to bring about a good relationship between employees and employers than the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Opposition knows it and we know it. The Minister should be congratulated for the efforts he makes to arbitrate and times. There are many people on both sides of the House and in union and employer organisations who sometimes ask why the Minister does not use the big hammer on the unions, but he always prefers to conciliate and arbitrate for a better overall result. In every case he has been proved correct, and I support entirely his actions in this case. The honourable member for Hughes bemoaned the fact that these people in the Public Service do not get the chance to apply for jobs that were advertised in the class 4 section. The truth of the matter is that we are trying to bring better expertise into the Public Service, to provide the opportunity for the best man to get the job. The people to whom the honourable member referred are not restricted in applying for a job. What is the point of saying, as the honourable member said, that they should have some sort of special privilege, that they can first for a job and if nobody in the Public Service is suitable for the job then it can be advertised outside the Service? Honestly, that is ridiculous. Everybody would accept that. We are making it possible for outside expertise to be admitted to the Public Service. Those people will be measured against everybody else who applies, from within the Public Service or not, and the best applicant will be offered the job. That I think is a reasonable proposal, and that is exactly what we are doing.",103
207,Mr HOLDING,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"It is just as well I did not go for Liberal Party pre-selection, otherwise you would have been in trouble.",104
208,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"The honourable member won pre-selection for Melbourne Ports, and he won it against a much better man; but he won it on numbers only. Do not let us talk about winning pre-selection on ability, because the honourable member would not be here if that were the criteria.",104
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,Dr Jenkins)Order! I invite the honourable member to return to the Bill.,104
210,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am delighted to return to the Bill. Let us look at the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. He quite clearly spelt out what this Bill is all about. He pointed out that as a result of the Norgard report certain action was recommended and taken by this Government. I am sure that if the Labor Party had been in government it also would have taken the same appropriate action, and on this occasion it would have been supportconciliate at all ing that action. Employment Officer Class 4 positions in the Commonwealth Employment Service were advertised. Then the Public Service union decided to oppose this course, and bans were later applied. The honourable member for Port Adelaide said that he was surprised that bans were not applied earlier. I can understand that because his general theme is to strike, impose bans and create general industrial trouble. The Minister in his second reading speech said: An officer or employee who is stood down will not be entitled to salary, wages or other remuneration and allowances in the nature of salary or wages in respect of a period for which he is stood down. Nor will the period of stand down count as service for the purposes of recreation leave, long service leave and sick leave. A period of stand down will not break an officer's or employee's continuity of employment for long service leave purposes. In supporting the Minister's second reading speech and the Bill, I would like to bring before apply the House some general information regarding other examples of federal awards under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I refer to a result of a survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in August of last year, which revealed that at that time there were in excess of some 300 awards under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with provisions for stand down or deductions of pay for any day that employees could not usefully be employed because of any strike or cause for which the employer could not reasonably be held responsible. I request the permission of the House to have incorporated in Hansard examples of the federal awards containing stand down provisions. The honourable member for Port Adelaide may look at them first, and if he agrees I would ask that they be incorporated.",104
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,Is leave granted?,104
212,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"I have two or three other documents, and I would ask that the honourable member for Port Adelaide look at all of them. If the House agrees, they might be incorporated.",104
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,I point out to the honourable member that the usual procedure is for an Opposition member to see the documents.,104
214,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,I am quite happy to pass them to the honourable member so he can look at them. It is a list of the various awards.,104
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,I think the honourable member will realise that he places Hansard in some difficulty if he leaves the incorporation of these documents until the end of his speech.,104
216,Mr BOURCHIER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate that. The provisions of"" the metal industry award serve as an example of the stand down provision typical in most awards. Under this award the employer shall have the right to deduct payment for any day the employee cannot be usefully employed because of any strike or through any breakdown in machinery or any stoppage of work by any cause for which the employer cannot reasonably be held responsible. This is accepted under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act by all trade unions throughout the country. Why does the Opposition protest vigorously when we are trying to bring the Public Service into line with that? It is only carrying out a phantom exercise because it believes that is the role of the Opposition. We accept that, but let us be reasonable. The Opposition knows that what we are doing is correct. Members of the Opposition, in their hearts, support it. Do not say too many hurrahs.",105
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ARBITRATION,"I understand that leave is granted for the incorporation of material in Hansard. The document read asfollowsNA NA AWU-BH P Aust.

218,Mr BOURCHIER,STAND DOWN PROVISIONS,"I thank the House. Under most of the awards loss of working time by an employee due to his being stood down without pay in terms of the relevant award provisions is not counted as part of the qualifying period for annual leave entitlement, although it will not break the continuity of service for such leave. The metal industry award is a typical example. Similarly, awards of the Commission relating to long service leave provide that interruption or termination of employment arising directly or indirectly from an industrial dispute is deemed as not breaking continuity of employment provided the employee returns to work in accordance with the setdement terms of the dispute, but the period of absence from duty does not count for long service leave purposes. Again I would ask that a document relating to this matter be shown to the honourable member for Port Adelaide. It shows the provisions of the metal industry award concerning annual leave. I state quite categorically that in relation to long service leave the metal industry award contains similar illustrations of these provisions applying in this sector. I would ask that the document be incorporated in Hansard.",105
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STAND DOWN PROVISIONS,That will require the approval of the House. The honourable member for Port Adelaide will need to sight them.,105
220,Mr BOURCHIER,STAND DOWN PROVISIONS,"I agree. I also have two more documents to be incorporated. I have shown quite clearly that the Government is trying to bring the Public Service into line with the rights, privileges, controls, restrictions and the general ordinances of other organisations that come under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.",105
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STAND DOWN PROVISIONS,"I understand that leave is granted to have material incorporated in Hansard. The documents read asfollowsNA NA Clause 25 of the award provides that a period of 28 consecutive days' leave shall be allowed annually to an employee after 12 months continuous service (less the period of annual leave) as an employee on weekly hiring in any one or more of the occupations to which the award applies.

Any absence from work by reason of any cause not being a cause specified in this sub-clause shall not be deemed to break the continuity of service for the purposes of this clause unless the employer during the absence or within 14 days of the termination of the absence notifies the employee in writing that such absence will be regarded as having broken the continuity of service. In calculating the period of 12 months continuous service the following absences shall be taken into account and counted astimeworked: Up to 160 ordinary working hours in a 12 monthly period in the case of sickness or accident; Long service leave taken by an employee in accordance with the Metal Industry (Long Service Leave) Award 1976 or the Queensland Industrial tration Act 1961 -1964, as the case may be. Other absences from work shall not be taken into account and shall not count as time worked in calculating the period of 12 months continuous service'. SUB-CLAUSE (1) OF CLAUSE 5 OF THE METAL TRADES (LONG SERVICE LEAVE) AWARD 'For the purposes of the award the service of an employee with an employer means the period during which the employee has served his employer under an unbroken contract of employment: provided that a contract of employment shall not be deemed to have been broken by reason only of any interruption or determination thereof, if the interruption or determination: (a) has been made by the employer with the intention of avoiding any obligation imposed on him by this award or by State law dealing with long service leave; or (b) has arisen directly or indirectly from a dispute concerning industrial matters, if the employee returns to duty with the same employer in accordance with the terms of setdement of the said dispute; or (c) has been made by the employer by reason of slackness of trade, if the employee is re-employed by the same employer within six months of such interruption or determination; or (d) has been made by the employer for any reason other than those referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) hereof, if the employee is re-employed by the same employer within two months of such interruption or determination.

222,Mr BOURCHIER,INDUSTRY AWARD,"I thank the House. As I was saying, clearly in the private sector the trade union movement quite rightly accepts the restrictions, rights, controls and privileges vided under those awards. Why should the Pubemployed lic Service not be given the same priviliges rights? Why should it be a privileged body that allowed to have differentrights?In most cases, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said when he was a Minister in the Labor Government-this refers honourable member for Hughes said about this Government talcing some action against senior public servants-the y are the fat cats, the most privileged people in this country.",107
223,Mr HOLDING,INDUSTRY AWARD,You would agree with that.,107
224,Mr BOURCHIER,INDUSTRY AWARD,"The honourable member is wasting his time. He should go back to Vicnotable toria. He was not successful there, but he is successful here. I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, will go back to the Bill.",107
225,Mr NA BROWN,INDUSTRY AWARD,He is a retread.,107
226,Mr BOURCHIER,INDUSTRY AWARD,"Yes, he is a recap and not a very good one at that. The honourable member for Hindmarsh made it quite clear that the Labor government was opposed to privileges, rights and everything given to public servants. veryfinearticles Strangely enough now that the Labor Party is Opposition its members say in here that the Government cannot do anything that might be detrimental to the Public Service. They do not fool the public servants. They know what Executive members of the Opposition do at every opporis tunity they get. The real fact is that public vants get many privileges under this Governdoes ment, and they are protected in many ways, but they know in their hearts and in their minds that they should not get morerightsthan their fellow Australians; therefore, they should be bound the same rules of the Conciliation and Arbiwho tration Commission as the ordinary workers of Canberra. this country. I totally support the Minister who has always worked very closely with the unions. He has discussed these matters with all sections of the union movement in this country and is held in Cumulative sick leave very high esteem by the union organisations. He is prepared not only to speak up when he is in specified in paragraphs (iv) and favour of something the unions want but also to stand up for what he knows isrightwhen it may not be entirely what they want. I support entirely what the Government is proposing in this Bill and what the Minister put forward. of that year. Provided that sick to this sub-clause shall be",107
227,Mr FRY,INDUSTRY AWARD,"It is very significant, I think, that when the Government brings forward typically repressive legislation aimed at public servants in the national capital, in the seat of government in Canberra, when hundreds of prothousands of people throughout Australia are as public servants in every State, very and few supporters of the Government come into the is House even to listen to the debate. The Governas ment can produce only three speakers, one of whom, the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), to his credit, showed a litde comto what the passion for public servants. Mr Charles Jones- A good speech.",107
228,Mr FRY,INDUSTRY AWARD,"Yes , it was a veryfinespeech but he was reprimanded for saying something compassionate about public servants. But the most point, of course, is that the Government less supporter who represents 50 per cent of the I people of Canberra and who obviously supports the Bill has not seenfitto say a few words in support of it. Of course, he is the champion of private enterprise in Canberra and he would agree entirely with this Bill. Undoubtedly he supports it but he will not come in and speak for it publicly- a rather regrettable situation. I think many honourable members will have read the published in the National Times in in the last two weeks by Mr Clem Lloyd, one of our foremost scholars on government, a man of very wide experience, who pointed out, I think very rightly, the dangers inherent in the way the is taking over the Parliament. This Bill a typical example of what happens when, by serdue process of law, a decision is made which not please the Government. In that case the Government just changes the law. It does so with a great deal of contempt. It is passing this Bill with hardly anybody in the chamber to listen to by the debate, not even the honourable member represents half the public servants in I think it is fair to say that this Bill destroys the facade that this Government really believes in arbitration, that it really beUeves in the due process of law, that it supports law and order. Above all the Bill shows quite clearly that the Government does not adhere to the process of arbitration. This Bill points up quite brutally the determination of this Government to undermine and destroy the arbitration procedures which have been followed meticulously by the union in this case. If the arbitration procedures do not bring about decisions that suit the Government, it changes the law and that is what has happened. This matter is a classic example. The union went to arbitration. The arbitrator made a decision. The union was of the opinion on good legal advice that the decision was incorrect. It did not go on strike; it took the matter to the High Court. It followed the due process of the law. At its own risk and at considerable cost the union took the matter to the High Court and the High Court, of course, upheld the union's point that the right of appeal was a fundamental condition of employment. How the Government could decide otherwise I do not know. Apparendy it was not aware of the 1922 decision, No. 23, which was a determination concerning the Australian Postal Electricians Union's claim against the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth. It is all documented and the Minister has disclaimed knowledge of it. How the Government could not have had that sort of advice I do not know. Apparently its legal advice on this occasion was not quite as sound as that given in 1975 when it succeeded in throwing out a democratically elected government. The union members went to the court. The High Court upheld their appeal and costs were awarded against the Government. The Court gave very sound judicial reasons for upholding the appeal. It said that the right of appeal is a fundamental condition of employment, particularly in the Public Service where there is a tremendously wide range of opportunities and a wide range of qualifications required to fill various positions. placing this Bill before the Parliament, the Government is virtually thumbing its nose at the decision of the High Court. It is saying, in effect: 'All right, you won thattimebut you will not win next time. We will fix it so that you do not win next time.' In effect it is taking away the right of the unions to appeal in a similar case to this one using the same process that was followed here. In effect that will completely undo the decision of the High Court in a most contemptuous way. The Government claims that it must have the power to control promotions and appeals. Of course, this is nonsense. It has precisely those powers now in relation to other conditions of employment. Why it should select this particular condition of employment for special reasons, I do not know. If we look at conditions in relation to salaries we will find that the Public Service Board can determine salaries, people can appeal against such determinations and the arbitrator can make a decision. He can support the Public Service Board or he can support the union. The same process is followed in the national wage case. The Government has that power; it is the normal process which is taken in relation to promotions. The Board can make promotions. People can appeal against those promotions and go to a proper board for a decision to be made. To say that the Government needs special conditions for this particular condition of service is nonsense. It could quite easdy have accepted the decision of the High Court. The Government may not have been sure that the right of appeal was a condition of service, but the High Court said that it was. Why did the Government not accept that decision gracefully and carry on in the way it does with all other conditions of service where it has the power to set salaries or make promotions and where people have the right of appeal against such decisions. The stand down provisions rather concerned the honourable member for Lilley because they do penalise the innocent parties in disputes. These provisions typify the Government's innate hatred of and its abrasive attitude towards working people generally and the Public Service in particular. They are part of the Government's determination to undermine the public servants' hard won conditions and to cut back on hard won reforms that have been gained over many years of experience. They follow the Commonwealth Employees (Provisions) Act and the amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, both of which cut down on the rights and privileges of public servants. The other argument In used by the Government is that what it wants to do is in the interests of efficiency. It is rather laughable that it should invoke efficiency in support of this Bill. Is there anything inherently efficient about employing an outsider in a position on the assumption that he may have had experience in industry or commerce? I do not know in what area of industry or commerce one would get the sort of experience that one would need in a Commonwealth Employment Office. I do not know whether the Government contemplates employing people who have worked in private employment offices where a profit is made out of people who are unemployed. I do not know whether they would be suitable people to bring into the Commonwealth Employment Service. I could not imagine many people wanting that job. It is not a terribly highly paid job. It is certainly not a fat cat job; it is only a Class 4 position, which is a very middle standard.",107
229,Mr YOUNG,INDUSTRY AWARD,Averag e weekly earnings.,109
230,Mr FRY,INDUSTRY AWARD,"The salary is about average weekly earnings. It is by no means a fat cat position, which our friends opposite like to talk about. Surely it is not the intention of the Norgard report that these people should be employed in that particular area and to carry out that particular function. I think the Government is drawing a long bow in trying to invoke the Norgard report in support of this repressive legislation. Efficiency is much more closely related to many other aspects of the Public Service. One of the greatest reasons for loss of efficiency in the Public Service now is the imposition of staff ceilings. In our own Department of the Capital Territory I fail to see what is very efficient about not having staff to collect overdue rates or to prepare urgent legislation which will allow the Government to operate smoothly. Today somebody told me that correspondence which they had written 10 days ago had not been posted because of the shortage of staff in a particular department. Surely that is not efficiency. It is not efficient to have property of the Commonwealth deteriorating because we cannot get a few bob to paint it or to do some minor repairs. These are the basic inefficiencies in the Public Service now. It is not because of the way that we appoint people. It is because we have staff ceilings. It is because we do not have enough people, not because we do not have the right people. This, too, is a non-argument. The other thing that I would like to refer to is the inconsistency of this Bill when compared with the movement over the last 10 years towards trying to increase the civil liberties public servants generally throughout the world and not just in Australia. There has been conand siderable progress. The International Labour Orare ganisation has been working towards a draft paper or a convention which will cover the employment of public servants and which will give them greater civil liberties. We have contributed to that. We have sent people to these conventions each year. They have served on committees. has been going on for years. There has been movement towards greater civil liberties for lic servants. Now the Government comes along and turns the clock back on all the progress that has been made over many years. That is consistent, as I said, with the Government's determination to undermine the basic civilrightsand individual liberties of workers generally and public servants in particular. The Government wants to bludgeon the PubUc Service into submission, to deny it the right to withhold its labour, to wave the big stick at it. Then the Government has the hide to talk about efficiency and to expect efficiency. I oppose this Bill. It is a disgrace which is typical of the Government's attitude towards the Public Service. It deserves the condemnation of aU reasonable people.",109
231,Mr STREET,INDUSTRY AWARD," I shall endeavour to refer to the comments that have been made by honourable members in this debate. I start by referring to the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) who led for the Opposition. He said that the Public Service Board wanted complete control of recruitment into the PubUc Service. He referred to the Public Service Arbitrator's action in relation to the dispute which involved recruitment into the Commonwealth Employment Service. It is perfecdy true that the genesis of this legislation was in that dispute. But I remind the House that the Public Service Arbitrator in that case said that he did not have jurisdiction. That, in fact, was the original umpire's decision. I remind the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson)- I shall come back to this later-that it was the union that did not accept the umpire's decision. It was the union that appealed against the decision, as it was perfectly entitled to do. As it turned out, the High Court of Australia upheld that appeal. In effect what that decision meant was that what had always been assumed to be the case was not in fact correct. What the Government has done in response to that decision is to put beyond doubt what had previously been the accepted practice. The honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) referred in of some detaU- I understand his concern-to the non-accrual of long service leave, annual leave sick leave and asked whether it should apply automatically in the case of pubUc servants who stood down. Mr Kevin Cairns-In all cases.",109
232,Mr STREET,INDUSTRY AWARD,"In all cases. In private industry that can be part of stand down provisions in This awards. As I am sure the honourable member a knows, from memory, stand down provisions are pubpart of something Uke 300 awards of the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. Mr Kevin Cairns-But they are often not appUed.",109
233,Mr STREET,INDUSTRY AWARD,"Whether they are applied or not, it is quite true, as the honourable member says, that that can be decided by the Commissioner in considering his attitude to a setdement. That provision can be used as part of the bargaining process. I accept that that has been the practice on the part of private industry. But the honourable member for Ldley has also accepted that the non-accrual principle can apply in the case of private industry. Indeed it can apply, as I am sure the honourable member knows, in many of the State public services as well. Mr Kevin Cairns-But not automatically in all cases.",109
234,Mr STREET,INDUSTRY AWARD,"It is not automatic. I make it clear to the House that the Government considered this automatic aspect of application to the Public Service very carefully. In doing so the Government bore in mind its dual responsibility, firstly as a good employer, and secondly as the representative of the public interest. After all, Public Service is paid for by the taxpayer and the Government has an overriding responsibility to protect the interests of the taxpayer in these circumstances. It is quite relevant that apart from long service leave, recreation leave and sick leave-as the honourable member has pointed out quite rightly the loss of accrual is mandatory as part of the stand-down provisions in this legislation-the PubUc Service Arbitrator has flexibiUty in deciding what other terms and conditions of employment can be considered in the context of arriving at the settlement of a dispute. The Government had aU these factors very carefully in mind and it had to strike a balance, always having as a principal cause for concern the responsibility that it had to the pubUc. The Government therefore considers that this legislation is a fair reflection of this responsibUity. I mentioned a moment ago the remarks of the honourable member for Hughes who alleged that, following the High Court decision in the Commonwealth Employment Service dispute, the Government had altered the law to suit its own purposes. I have already pointed out that the legislation merely makes clear that, in future, the position, which up until then had always been accepted as being the situation, will be put beyond doubt. The honourable member for Hughes also referred to court decisions in relation to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator. I have done a great deal of research on this matter and I have not been able to come up with one single court decision in relation to it. I merely ask the honourable member for Hughes to check his facts. There have been expressions of opinion by PubUc Service arbitrators. I stand wUling to be corrected, but I think one was Deputy PubUc Service Arbitrator Hughes, who gave as his opinion that it might be within the jurisdiction of the PubUc Service Arbitrator to make decisions in relation to recruitment or some simUar kind of thing. So far as I am able to determine there was no court decision in relation to this particular aspect until the High Court decision of recent date to which the honourable member referred. The House is indebted to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) for a very clear exposition of the reasons behind this legislation. He did an excellent job of exposing the inconsistency of the Opposition's attitude to the Public Service as a whole. Various members of the Australian Labor Party have expressed the harshest criticism of the PubUc Service. Yet tonight in this debate we had members of the Australian Labor Party putting on some spurious pretence of espousing the cause of the Public Service. I do not think I need to say anything more about the that. The Opposition's sincerity or lack of it will be judged by its remarks which are on the public record. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) referred to the problems which emerged during the CES dispute. I do not want to go over all that old ground again, but it needs to be stated explicitly that early in that dispute, long before it had reached the serious proportions it eventually did, the Public Service Board on behalf of the Government put forward a proposition relating to a review procedure which was exacdy the same as that eventually accepted as a basis for a settlement of the dispute. That is one of the most disappointing aspects of this dispute which did great damage to the operations of the CES and its morale and put the public image of that Service in a bad light. The basis for the settlement had always been there. It was put to the unions at that stage. They refused to accept it. That caused a great deal of disruption, which honourable members know about, but eventually the unions ended up accepting what had originally been put to them. That is incidental to the broad thrust of the legislation which now puts the Public Service, as the Government sees it, on a fair and proper basis in relation to employees in private industry. Question put: That the Bill be now read a second time. The House divided. (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - D r H. A. Jenkins) Ayes 66 Noes 28 Majority 38 NA Adermann, A. E. Jull, D. F. Aldred.K.J. Katier, R. C.

235,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to speak about a matter that I raised in the Grievance Debate two weeks ago. It relates to the poor reporting of the national Press of the uranium debate. In that debate I particularly mentioned the shallow reporting of certain journalists on the Sydney Morning Herald. It is perhaps not surprising that the Sydney Morning Herald, in its brief and inadequate report of my criticisms, published the inaccurate smear of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) that I have not Newman, K.E. Nixon, P.J. opposed nuclear power in the Soviet Union. On many occasions I have spoken against Soviet development of nuclear power but it suits the Robinson, Ian Ruddock, P.M. Sydney Morning Herald to publish such smears. It is part of the subde campaign by the Sydney Morning Herald to label any opposition to Shipton, R. F. Simon, B. D. uranium mining as left-wing opposition and to obscure the real issues which concern a wide cross section of the Australian community. Another example of this kind of inaccurate Viner, R. I. Wilson, I. B. C and simple minded smear is contained in an article by Mr W. C. Wentworth published by the Herald on Monday 15 May. I quote from the Corbett,J. article: The ALP found itself confronted by the anti-uranium line which its left wing had adopted from overseas. Mr Wentworth went on to say: Politically the ALP is in a very ambiguous situation. Many Martin, V.J. of its leaders are privately convinced that uranium mining should go ahead but they are responding to left wing pressure and making public commitments against it. I have written to the Sydney Morning Herald about this kind of reporting. I seek leave to have my letter and the reply of the Editor-in-Chief of the Sydney Morning Herald incorporated in Hansard. Tellers: Johnson, Les Leave granted. The document read as follows OFFICE OF HON. T. UREN, M.P. Federal Member for Reid 18th May 1978 Third Reading The Editor, Sydney Morning Herald, to be moved 235 Jones Street, Broadway, N.S.W. 2000 Dear Sir, I draw your attention to the repeated assertions contained in articles of your newspaper that it is only the left wing of the Australian Labor Pany that is opposed to the commitment of Australia's uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle. I also wish to correct several misrepresentations of Labor Caucus decisions made in page 1 articles on May 10 and 11. Your assertion that opposition to uranium mining is solely a left wing cause in the ALP would not stand up to any fair minded analysis of the ALP's response to the uranium issue. Opposition to uranium in the Party cuts across all ideological positions; this parallels the identification by many sections of the Pany with the anti-nuclear war movement. This is a movement for humanity, sanity, and survival. It is an antinuclear weapons position, prompted by such important considerations as the 3rd rinding of the 1st report from the Ranger Inquiry which says 'that the nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing war'. It must be appreciated that the rinding of the Ranger Inquiry has had a profound effect on the ALP. I refer you to statements of Mr Hayden that he personally was deeply disturbed by his reading of the first Ranger Repon. All sections of the ALP have been struck by the many unresolved environmental, genetic, technical and economic issues which were documented in the Ranger Reports. The Commissioners themselves have stressed the importance of these findings of fact as against their recommendations, (p. 5, 1st Report.) Any assertion that uranium the ALP denies the fact that the present policy was passed unanimously at the Perth Conference. It denies the strong anti-uranium feeling at the grass roots of the Party's branches, exemplified by last weekend's special State Conference in Victoria, which was called at one week's notice to organise opposition to the Fraser Government's most recent repressive uranium legislation. You have also incorrectly reported ALP Caucus decisions. I refer to an article entitled 'Darwin Trip to Counter Uranium Fears' (S.M.H. 10/5/78 p. 1) in which it was claimed that the Labor Caucus decided to vote with the Liberal Party in the Senate against any Country Party attempts to amend the uranium legislation. The following day it was incorrectly reported by Peter Bowers, in an article entitled 'Uranium Law Dispute settled by Darwin Talks', that the Labor Party decided to oppose outright only one uranium Bill, and seek to strengthen three other Bills. Labor Caucus decided to oppose at both the 2nd and 3rd readings the four uranium Bills which provided a basis for the mining of uranium, and to seek to strengthen the Aboriginal land rights and National Parks Legislation. No decision was taken to support uranium Bills which were opposed by the Country Party. It is about time that the public was treated to some indepth and balanced reporting of the uranium issue by your newspaper. Nowhere in your paper have I seen a thorough appraisal of the Government's assertion that nuclear waste can be safely disposed. Nowhere have I seen an assessment of the Fraser Government's safeguards policy or a questioning of the government's refusal to provide the Australian people with details of exactly ing with countries like Iran and the Philippines. Moreover, it is a disgrace that the reporting of the debate in Federal Parliament of the Fraser Government's uranium legislation should be relegated to two small reports at the back of your paper which day after day W. C. Wentworth is given prime feature space to promote his pro-uranium views. Most disgraceful of aU has been the failure of your paper to question the economics of uranium muting. We are continually treated to the raw propaganda of the mining industry, the Government and W. C. Wentworth that uranium will bring untold economic benefits. The fact is that the very serious structural unemployment which Australia faces today can be attributed, in part, to our excessive involvement in the minerals export sector. At atimewhen minerals have risen from 12 per cent to 29 per cent of Australia's exports, the proportion of the workforce engaged in mining has dropped from 1.4 per cent to 1.2 per cent. Meanwhile manufacturing has been starved of investment funds and its contribution to the workforce has dropped from 27 per cent to 21 per cent. If we speed up the growth of the mineral sector by exporting uranium, we will surely aggravate our structural unemployment crisis. I hope that future reporting of the uranium issue by your newspaper will exhibit a greater degree of analysis, fairmindedness and accuracy. Yours sincerely, to an increased risk of nuclear TOM UREN.M.P. NA 235-243 Jones Street, Broadway, Sydney, Australia. 19th May 1978 The Hon. T. Uren, MP., 1st Floor, Granville Towers, 10 Bridge Street, Granville, N.S.W. 2142 Dear Sir, Irefer to you letter of May 18, which reached me today. is just a left wing cause inside 1. You say that the Herald has made two 'misrepresentations'in reporting Caucus decisions. I am having this investigated. If we made errors of fact, we will correct them as quickly as possible. 2. You refer to 'repeated assertions' in articles in the Herald that 'it is only the left wing of the Australian Labor Party that is opposed to the commitment of Australia's uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle'. I suggest that you supply me with evidence of these repeated assertions by the Herald. For myself, I have always believed that it is the left wing that is most active in propagating these policies; but that is not at all the same thing as saying that support is narrowly confined to the left wing. 3. You say, 'Nowhere in you paper have I seen a thorough appraisal of the Government's assertion that nuclear waste can be safely disposed'. I am sorry that you have forgotten the prolonged arguments and heavy publicity of last year. Your own name appeared in headlines often enough then (eg, 'Fraser's claim on safety false: Uren'-Augus t 30, 1977). Apart from discussion in the news columns, the matter was taken up in feature articles by staff journalists and contributors, in leading articles, and in many, many letters from scientists and from laymen. And of course argument and discussion will continue whenever there are developments. Your charge is baseless. 4. You say, 'Nowhere have I seen an assessment of the Fraser Government's safeguards policy'. what safeguards it is negotiatThis again was discussed last year. Do you not recall the leading articles? Not remember the report quoting Professor C. B. Kerr ('Government approach to safeguards only ""intentions'"")? The Page 1 lead, 'Fox queries safeguards', reporting information suppUed by you? The Page 1 lead, 'Whidam warns: Govt act adds to nuclear war risk""? The other articles and letters? Memory can indeed be fallible. 5. You say that nowhere have you seen 'a questioning of the Government'srefusalto provide the Australian people with details of exactly what safeguards it is negotiating with countries like Iran and the Philippines'. It is true that the Herald has not questioned that the negotiations are not being carried out in pubUc. The Herald has reported that negotiations are in progress, and the Government assurances that any agreements will have to contain all the elements of Australian safeguards policy announced last year. I find it difficult to see how the Government can go beyond that. Or are you implying that it would be wise or practicable to conduct international negotiations in public? I find that hard to believe. Did you, as a minister, conduct negotiations in public? You may be certain that, if the Herald got wind of any details, it would be very happy to publish them. That is our job. It would be ludicrous, however, Tor us to demand that the negotiations themselves be public. 6. You say it is a disgrace that 'the reporting bate in Federal Parliament of the . . . uranium legislation should be relegated back of you paper which (sic) day after day W. C. Wentworth is given prime feature space to promote his pro-uranium views'. There were not merely' two small reports at the back'. The first report was published on April 11, and the first of the articles of which you complain did not appear until May 3. The reports about the legislation lead of September last year, as you may care to recall ('Uranium law allows jail for unionists, says Uren'). The legislation was also discussed in a long article by a staff reporter. The debate itself proved, unhappily, another gallop along a much-travelled road, public knowledge or understanding. It was treated accordingly. 7. You say, 'Most disgraceful of all has been the failure of your paper to question the economics of uranium mining'. In fact, a view of the matter which happens to parallel yours was expressed as far back as April last year, in a review of a publication 'The case against uranium mining: red light for yellow cake'. The reviewer, having reported this economic assessment, added, 'What to say is that this move away from manufacturing to mining is already taking place and is likely to continue given that the export-orientated mining sector enjoys a relative comparative advantage not experienced by Australia's overprotected manufacturing sector'. The matter has come up from time to time since then. I am surprised that you aspect of the Wentworth articles important enough to take up in a letter addressed to their substance. You complain that there is no proper public debate, yet you object to someone as well-informed as W. C. Wentworth being allowed to appear, and you fail to take him up. 8. You say, 'We are continually treated to the raw propaganda of the mining industry, the Government and W. C. Wentworth that uranium will bring untold economic benefits'. I am afraid that once again your sweeping assertions do not stand up to the facts. We publish information from all sides. It is unfortunate that you should see the statements of your opponents as 'propaganda'. It isn't a word that I would apply to their views any more than to yours. In the same letter you preach to me about fairmindedness. The difference between us is this: You have a mission, in which fairmindedness would be a handicap. We have a duty, which is to be fairrninded, and we do our best to cany it out.",111
236,Mr UREN,THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD,"In my letter I point out to the Herald that opposition to uranium mining is based on a strong grass roots anti-uranium ing in the branches of the Labor Party. That reflected two weeks ago when the Victorian State branch called a special conference one week's notice to fight the Fraser Government's repressive uranium legislation. I point out that opposition to uranium cuts across all ideothat logical positions in the Australian Labor Party. parallels the identification of many members with the anti-nuclear war movement, a movement for humanity, sanity and survival. But, the of the de- Sydney Morning Herald chooses not to publish these facts. It chooses not to publish my letter. It to two small reports at the has sent me a detaded reply but chooses to have my arguments analysed and judged only by the Herald bureaucracy, not by its readers. As I have had incorporated in Hansard my letter and the letter of the Editor-in-Chiefof the Sydney Morning Herald, people will have the right to deterin fact go back to a Page 1 mine the facts of the case. What has the Sydney Morning Herald done to promote the uranium debate in recent months? I have instanced the articles of Mr W. C. Wentworth, five in all, apand added little or nothing to pearing on 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 15th May. Those articles amount to about 5,300 words of prime feature space with associated diagrams. What has the Herald done to present the opposite view to that held by Mr Wentworth? The Herald has failed to act on requests by the movement against uranium mining to put views contrary to those of Mr Wentworth. The Herald has the authors (of the book) fail failed to print an article submitted to it by Dr Hugh Saddler, a former research assistant to the Ranger inquiry, which discusses some of the issues raised by Mr Wentworth. The Sydney Morning Herald certainly has not given equal space to the anti-uranium position. I submit that did not think this or any other democracy is at a low ebb when public debate on a matter so important as uranium can be suppressed in that way. That has been the situation with the Sydney Morning Herald. There have been other inaccurate reportings by correspondents to the Sydney Morning Herald relating to the reporting of the Labor Party Caucus. I have also reported that matter. I shall talk about it on another occasion when I have more time than I have at the moment in an attempt to have the Sydney Morning Herald correct the position. If it does not do so I shall raise the matter in the House again.",113
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD,"Mr Millar)Yours faithfully, Order! The honourable member's time has NA expired. Before calling the honourable member Editor-in-Chief for Isaacs I draw the attention of the House to the very high level of conversation. I requested earlier that the House be silent. I was reluctant to interrupt the honourable member for Reid and feelrob him of time but I remind honourable was members that this behaviour is a rank discourtesy to honourable members who have the right of delegates at to be heard in silence.",113
238,Mr BURNS,DAVID BOWMAN," I am concerned the Department of Trade and Resources reIt cently purchased filing systems manufactured in United States of America in preference to locally manufactured products. The products are described as panels for microfichefiling.Those purchased were manufactured by Ring King Visibles Incorporated in Muscatine, Iowa, United States of America. Our local product is known to the Department and is manufactured by Arnos Melbourne Pty Ltd, Nepean Highway, Cheltenham. Arnos Melbourne Pty Ltd is a small, privately owned company with 90 employees. The company has been involved with export for over 20 years and its filing systems are sold in 32 countries. Arnos won an export award for its achievement in 1973 and the company's microfiche filing products are currently listed in the American publication 'Information and Records Management, 1978 Storage and Information Retrieval Guidebook'. Surely the Overseas Trade Commissioner scure offices should be a place for Australian manufacthe tured enterprise wherever possible. Now we have a situation where Arnos is currently facturing an order worth $350,000 for national distribution to United States of America and three Trade Department offices in that country are using a competitive United States of America manufactured product purchased in Australia. The founder and Managing Director of Arnos Spratt Melbourne Pty Ltd is Mr Bill Martin. Mr Martin and his company are well known to the Depart1977 ment of Trade and Resources, having ticipated in more than 40 Australian trade exhibitions around the world. In 1976 Mr Martin was very the Government-appointed leader of exhibitors to the Honolulu Trade Show and later in that year accompanied the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), Deputy Prime Minismission ter, to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics leader of exhibitors for the Moscow Trade Show. Hardly a month goes by without Mr Martin a representative of his firm being overseas where in the world selling. His determination and unyielding efforts to promote Australian manufactured products abroad is an object lesson to many would be exporters both large and small. Companies such as Broken Hill Prothe prietary Co. Ltd, Nilex and Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd would be proud of the sucMinister's cess Arnos has achieved in the export market for it is their raw materials that are being used in the manufacture of Arnos products. I feel Australian Trade offices overseas should be an area where potential customers can see Australian manufactured products. Many of the Arnos range of products are unique and would require a demonstration to enhance their ability in an export market. Arnos Melbourne Why Pty Ltd exports 70 per cent of its products. I hope that when the Department of Trade and Resources makes purchases of filing systems it will give Australian companies an opportunity to supply that equipment because the policy of the Government is to help Australian industry by providing it with orders for Government purchases.",113
239,Mr ARMITAGE,DAVID BOWMAN,"Two weeks ago, on 11 May, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley) circulated a written reply to questions raised in this House about land purchased by the Australian Postal Commission at Bundall in Queensland. As one of the questioners, I received one of the repUes. The House was given no opportunity to debate this matter although the report was leaked to the Press two days earUer. These tactics do not obthe omissions, errors and inconsistencies in Minister's sloppUy laundered account of this shady land deal. Let us look at the Minister's manureply. On the second page he states: On 15 October 1976 Australia Post learnt that the Bundall the land had been sold to Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd. It is a pity that the Minister faded to read the minute of Mr Spratt, the Managing Director of the Commission, a little more carefully. Mr records the situation differentiy. In referring to a telephone conversation of 4 January with the then Minister for Post and parTelecommunications, Mr Spratt says: I made the following points: The Commission would like much to acquire the site under sale to Mr MCMaster. I repeat that according to Mr Spratt, the land was under sale and not sold when the Postal Comwas interested in purchasing it. Who was as telling the truth? If the present Minister had wanted to find out the facts, aU he had to do was read the documents tabled on 5 May in this or House by the honourable member for Batman some- (Mr Howe). These documents-the ValuerGeneral's notification of change of ownershipreveal that on 18 October 1976 Ron MCMaster took an option to buy the land in question from Watkins Ltd. I repeat that he took an option on land. He did not buy it untU three months later in January 1977; nor did he pay for it. The reply is wrong. The land was not sold to MCMaster in October 1976. In fact, he did not buy it until after he had discussed the matter with that the his local member, his friend.",114
240,Mr HOLDING,DAVID BOWMAN,Who was the local member?,114
241,Mr ARMITAGE,DAVID BOWMAN,"It was the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, the honourable suitmember for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson). is the present Minister hiding the truth? Is it to protect his predecessor? Is it to obscure the fact that MCMaster bought the land only when he knew that he could make a $40,000 windfall profit from its resale? These are the things that this Parliament needs to know. Let us have a look at the various accounts of how the Postal Commission first became interested in this block of land. The Minister stated in his written reply: On 23 August 1976, Australia Post was informed by Watkins Ltd that it had for sale at $240,000 a piece ofland. The reply continues: On 25 August Australia Post advised the Chief Property Officer, Department of Administrative Services, Queensland, that this land met all of its requirements and to concentrate on an early acquisition. On 15 October 1976, Australia Post learnt that the Bundall land had been sold to Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd. During that period from 25 August to 15 October-71 4 weeks-the Postal Commission had been unable to secure the land. Did the Commission actually try to secure it during that period? We just do not know from the Minister's reply. There is a gap, a blank, in his record of events. But we do know the situation of the real owner of the land. The Australian of 5 May 1978 contains the following report: A spokesman for Watkins Ltd said last night that the company had no knowledge that the Government was interested in the land before it sold it to MCMaster. Watkins did not know that the Postal Commission wanted the land, but it looks as though MCMaster did. How did he find out? Finally, a report on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program PM on 4 May quoted the Acting State Manager of Australia Post, Mr Athenden, as saying: We came across this piece ofland rather unexpectedly. Nowhere does the Minister's reply leave this impression. Rather, we are expected to believe that the Postal Commission under the then Minister acted slowly and cautiously. Mr Athenden says differently and, if he is telling the truth, and there is no reason to suspect his story, the Minister's statement is a tissue of fabrications.",114
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAVID BOWMAN,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,115
243,Mr NEIL,DAVID BOWMAN," I rise to join with the Papua New Guinea Defence Minister, Mr Mona, in denouncing the disgraceful actions of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) in recent times in mounting a campaign for publicity purposes which has failed to elicit any new information and which has cast a slur on the Australian Armed Forces, a slur on historians in this country and a slur on the archivists of this country. It has caused worry, concern and distress to relatives of soldiers who served in the Papua area during the last War. It has resulted also in a direct attack for mealy political purposes, for the purpose of grandstanding, upon distinguished persons such as Sir Edmund Herring and Mr Justice Selby. What the honourable member has done is to claim that there has been some form of cover-up to protect the reputations of persons who during the Second World War were involved in the bringing to justice of criminals who were later hanged. The first point I make is that contrary to the claims of the honourable member a great deal of information has been made available about these matters in the past few years. Sir Edmund Herring has previously spoken on the matter. Various other persons who were there at the time have spoken. One has only to go to the article written by Lieutenant-Colonel Tom Grahamslaw which was published in the May 1971 edition of the Pacific Islands Monthly to find a first hand account of what happened. Mr Grahamslaw was the former Chief Collector of Customs in Papua New Guinea and a Lieutenant-Colonel with the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit at the time. He won the OBE. (Military) for his work behind Japanese lines during World War II. As Mr Mona has pointed out, these persons were dealt with for murder and/or for rape. The honourable member for Lalor came into the House originally claiming that the crimes were exclusively treason. In some way it could be said that that is so but there were also murders and rapes. The first hand account is quite clear. Mr Mona points out that any fourth form student in Papua New Guinea knows what occurred and has known the position for many years. Everybody in Papua New Guinea knows about and there are many records available of what happened. In his article Mr Grahamslaw said: The pattern of murder was usuaUy the same. In the first place, the soldiers or airmen, after having made contact with the natives, would be taken to a central place in the village, usually a rest house, where they would be given food and drink. Then, as they were relaxing in the beUef that they were amongst friendly people, they would be attacked from behind and killed. Mr Grahamslaw mentions specific examples. On one occasion nine Australian prisoners comprising five men, three women and one child were brought in by natives and subsequendy killed and beheaded. Another incident involved two young missionaries, Miss May Hayman and Miss Mavis Parkinson. A man who was lying under a building saw these two missionary ladies led out from a building where he said they had been for a day and a night. He saw the Japanese enter the ing and then depart When the women came out wella Japanese siezed Miss Parkinson and started to hug her. She pushed him away. He thereupon drew a bayonet or dagger from his scabbard and stabbed her in the throat. She gave a slight scream and dropped dead. Another Japanese who was standing near Miss Hayman drew a not handkerchief from his pocket and handed it her indicating at the sametimethat blindfold herself. She did so and then stood with her head upright facing the Japanese out speaking. The Japanese then bayoneted her in the breast and she fell dead. The bodies were buried in a shallow grave at Popondetta. Mr Mona pointed out that other groups of women were raped continuously and raped close to death. Mr Grahamslaw points out that the vilGold lagers themselves demanded punishment of the culprits, and the widow of one of the persons hanged said: 'Good riddance; he was a bad man and he deserved it'. The people of Papua New Guinea have known about these vile crimes and supported the actions at the time. The crimes were the subject of courts martial in the field. The honourable member for Lalor still tries justify himself by claiming that Mona is silly and that silverfish have been getting at the records. I can assure the honourable member that I have a letter from the Director the Australian War Memorial, of which I am member of the Board of Trustees. Mr Russell Smith has been allowed to look through the records and has seen all records, save for those that are sealed because they relate and decorations. No complaint has been made regarding this matter, and further investigations have taken place at the Archives. The actions the honourable member are consistent with the lowest form of politics in this country. He was failure as a former member of the Victorian liament. He has no discretion. When he has been a member of this House for a few years he learn to compose himself and to act properly.",115

It seems that while Mr Robinson was telling the Melbourne buildHerald on 9 May that he knew MCMaster Mr Bourchier- Iriseon a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

I've been to cocktail parties at his home. But that was at Liberal Party functions with big crowds'. He said on 6 May that he regarded Mr Robinson as an acquaintance rather than a friend. Why is Mr MCMaster trying to ditch his old friend?

249,Mr CHARLES JONES,DAVID BOWMAN,"Thank you, Mr of Deputy Speaker. To whom did he turn for help in relation to a land sale to Australia Post? He a turned to his friend, the Minister responsible, his Parlocal member. What help did he get from his friend? According to the reply given on 11 May might by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley) the Postal Commission discovered IVi weeks after deciding to buy a block land at Bundall from Watkins Ltd that it had been beaten to it by Ron MCMaster. When the Commission decided to buy from MCMaster, the deal was signed, sealed and delivered in four f the time. Successful negotiations between the Postal Commission and MCMaster dibegan less then three days after MCMaster and not the Minister discussed the land.

What did the Minister tell his friend? According to the present Minister, he advised him to reduce his price to secure the sale.

What is the Government afraid of? Of course it is afraid. It is a crooked corrupt government and honourable members opposite know it.

263,Mr SIMON,DAVID BOWMAN,"In the short time available to me tonight I should like to cover matters which are really of some import but which I will touch on only very briefly because of the time factor. I refer to the question of national health expenditure and, in particular, the aspect of preventive medicine and what pan it can play in the containment of health expenditure. I wish particularly to talk about the health of the people of Australia and, in doing so, to emphasise the need for detailed analyses of the health of the young people of Australia, particularly those of primary school age. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) recently announced that national health expenditure has risen from $2,232m in 1971-72 to $6,254m in the current year- a matter which has been recognised in the Government's community health program. Unfortunately only approximately one per cent of the national health bill is spent on the community health program and on preventive medicine in this country. On page 46 of a Discussion Paper on Paying for Health Care prepared by Dr Sax it is stated: A growing Australian professional constituency asks for more emphasis on prevention of disease, health promotion, health maintenance and health educanon. I would like now to refer briefly to a number of people who have carried out recent surveys on and investigations into the subject matter of the health of young people. I refer firsdy to Mr Brian Jeanes who did a study at Monash University of the physical performances of primary school children. He indicated that the report would assist physical educationists to devise specific programs to remedy problems in particular children. Despite that report or because of it Mr Jeanes has stated that he had little or no objective data on a broad scale on physical profiles of children and claimed that that needed to be systematically collected throughout Australia. On 21 July 1977 Mr Ron Clarke, a well known former athlete who is presently a businessman and still interested in thefitnessof Australians in an article in the Age newspaper headed 'Teenage fitness declines' looked at the United States situation and commented that last March, that would be 1977, in the United States a newsletter pubUshed by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports reported on a comparison between the fitness of Australian and American teenagers. It was said that compared with the 1958 United States data, Australian boys were almost equal in pull-ups and sit-ups and were superior in aU other tests except for the softbaU throw for distance. It was concluded that in seven years Australian youth had deteriorated so dramatically in its physical fitness levels that its American counterparts were superior in every aspect. In October 1976 I was fortunate enough to undertake a survey around Australia on sport and recreation. One of the recommendations which came out of the report- a wide range of people in Australia was involved-stated : The National PoUcy will ensure that, for example, State Governments undertake' life be in it' type programs and that the respective State Educanon systems change the in Sport and Recreation from the secondary sector cation to primary level. I turn now to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare entitled Drug problems in Australia-a n intoxicated society? I remind honourable members of some of the facts which were presented to that Senate inquiry. They were that of 3,369 fourth formers in 1973, 24.2 per cent were non-users of alcohol, 75.8 per cent were currently drinking alcohol and 5.2 per cent were drinking on most days. I now turn very quickly to a letter I received from Dr Bert WiUee who is Chairman of the Department of Human Movement Studies at the University of Melbourne. He quite emphatically points out that, after having completed in 1969-70 a study entided 'Youth Fitness Survey', there was a grave necessity to upgrade that report particularly in relation to a survey of obesity in school aged chUdren and in the community. He had evidence which was avaUable to suggest that the problem was widespread. He referred to other matters like the posture of chUdren and stated that 1949 was the last year in which a survey had been done and that obviously there was a grave need to update that statistical data. He also said that the last survey in 1970 showed that 75 per cent of post primary government schools did not have a gymnasium or covered activity area and that 75 per cent of our chUdren at that level in government schools did not have a planned continuous program of physical education.",117

Our archives are a vital national resource and the fact that they have been plundered is a crime against the nation. It may be that the motives of the people who mutilated the wartime archives were good. They may well have felt they were protecting the Army's reputation destroying the files, but in fact the absence of files makes it difficult to make an effective case the Army's defence. They may have beenMr Neil-Murde r and rape!",118
270,Mr BARRY JONES,DAVID BOWMAN,"Let us talk about cidence. murder and rape. The curious thing is that looks at what fewfilessurvived, for example file 85/1/671 which is one of the few things that pleasant escaped the holocaust, one finds that although they refer to 'the, conviction and execution of natives-1 2 being for murder and nine for treason'-ther e is not one word about rape. There is no reference to any accusation about rape. This is the problem about relying on personal memories, going back 35 years in the sence of documentary evidence. In what few documents survived there is not one reference the crime of rape. That is not to say that that not true. It may have been that rape was involthan ved. What I am saying is that in the absence the documents it is impossible to form any kind ofjudgment. The most important issues in the controversy over the Australian Army's hanging of indigenes in New Guinea are,firsdy,the selective omission or suppression of important documents relating to the nation's history; secondly, the whole quesself-mutilation. tion of the relationship between a civilian government at home and the actions of its armies in the field; and, thirdly, the all-too-ready assumption that 'what you don't know doesn't hurt you' and that national ignorance on dismay tasteful subjects is preferable to knowledge the facts which could lead us to make balanced, informed judgments. I have been concerned, not altogether surprised, by the bitterness of attacks made on me in many letters I have received-man y anonymous, some obscene and that, all of them missing the point. I have been accused, for example, of political stirring. For what purpose? There is no suggesnational tion of an attack on the Fraser Government. I not know when the archives disappeared. It could have been under the Chifley Government, the Menzies Government or under the Whitlam Government. There is no suggestion of an on the Fraser Government. I have made no criticism of the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott).

271,Mr BARRY JONES,DAVID BOWMAN,"Because the national that record has been mutilated. That is what I am by whingeing about. The angry and defensive reaction to my pointing up Mr Ellicott's disclosures is in that the relevant files are missing from all archival depositories-in Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane, Melbourne and Port Moresby. They have all been destroyed by some miraculous coinI think this illustrates what I have someif one times called the 'avoidance syndrome'-the marked unwillingness of Australians to face unissues directly or to explain their actions fully. I find Sir Edmund Herring's position some21 what contradictory. If the 1943 hangings were so vital to preserve law and order in New Guinea, why was the Australian Government never informed about them? Sir Edmund Herring said: 'We were decent people trying to do the decent abthing by them'. When the Australian Government asked for details, why did the Army say to that there had been only seven hangings? I do is not know the final figure yet. It is clearly more 60 and may well be more than 100. But the of Army was not in New Guinea for its own purposes. It was there as an agent of the civilian government.",119

279,Mr STALEY,DAVID BOWMAN," I require the debate to be extended, Mr Deputy Speaker. I did not hear some of the comments made earlier tonight in the adjournment debate about matters relating to a land purchase on the Gold Coast and the former Minister for Post and Telecommunicadons. I did hear some remarks on the loudspeaker in my room and it seemed to me that there was some suggestion, some insinuation, some implication that the former Minister had somehow attempted to influence decisions of the Commission to the advantage of a constituent in relation to the land purchase in question. I want to make it quite clear, as I have already made it clear in this House during Question Time and in a written reply to questions asked of me recently, that there is no foundation whatsoever for any such insinuations, implications or allegations. To suggest that such is the case is to indulge in a cheap smear. In view of the potential importance of the allegations made some few days ago, a most careful examination of the facts was made. That careful examination made it quite clear, and it is beyond doubt on the words of the Chairman of the Australian Postal Commission and the Managing Director of the Australian Postal Commission, that there was no impropriety of any sort in the actions of the former Minister for Post and Telecommunications. If anyone is attempting to draw a long bow and to insinuate any impropriety, then he is challenging the integrity of the Managing Director of the Australian Postal Commission, who is one of Australia's most senior and respected public servants. What is more, there is at the same time a challenge to the veracity, the basic honesty, of the Labor-appointed Chairman of the Australian Postal Commission. Mr Annitage- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. On page 4 of the Minister's reply to meMr Neil-That is not a point of order. Mr Annitage-Let me make my point. On page 4 of the Minister's reply to me, which I hold here in my hand, the Minister said that if Mr MCMaster was prepared to consider a lower figure",120

283,Mr STALEY,DAVID BOWMAN,"If the honourable member is asking that my previous answer on this matter be incorporated in Hansard, I am delighted to seek leave of the House to have it incorporated. Is it the same document? Mr Armitage-The document is dated 11 May 1978 and is addressed to me and in it the Minister answered Mr MCMahon.",120
284,Mr STALEY,DAVID BOWMAN,"Yes, that is the one. Mr Annitage-Includin g all the attachments, because they tell the story.",120
285,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DAVID BOWMAN,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsNA On 4 May 1978, Mr J. L. MCMahon asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunicadons the following question without notice: I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunicadons: What is the purpose for which land bought at Bundall, Queensland on 4 February 1977 by the Australian Postal Commission is to be used? For how long prior to the purchase had the Commission been seeking land in the Bundall area? What departmental officers or Government members were aware of the Commission's interest in acquiring land at Bundall?",120
286,Mr STALEY,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES QUESTION,"The results of my enquiries are set out below. The former Postmaster-General's Department and Australia Post had been continuously seeking land in the Gold Coast area since 1974 to be used as the site for a mail centre. After much searching Australia Post indicated to the Department of Administrative Services in March 1976 that the BundaU area was one of its preferences. Over this period there would have been many officials in Australia Post and the Department of Administrative Services aware of Australia Post's interest. On 23 August 1976, Australia Post was informed by Watkins Limited that they had for sale at $240,000, a piece ofland on the corner of Crombie Avenue and Upton Street, Bundall. On 25 August 1976, Australia Post advised the Chief Property Officer, Department of Administrative Services, Queensland, that this land met aU of its requirements and to concentrate on an early acquisition. On IS October, 1976, Australia Post learnt that the Bundall land had been sold to Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd for $240,000 or $248,000. Australia Post expressed concern to the Department of Administrative Services that what had appeared to be a straightforward acquisition, and most attractive to Australia Post, failed at the last moment due to the initiative of another purchaser and delays in the purchasing process. Because the land was so ideally suited for postal purposes, Australia Post asked the Department of Administrative Services to pursue negotiations with the new owner. Initial negotiations were carried on with Ron MCMaster Pry Ltd from October to December 1976. During this period the vendor moved his asking price down from $350,000 to $310,000. On 9 December 1976, the Australian Postal Commission decided to defer the ation of the facts surrounding the sale to Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd and on 17 December 1976, the Commission decided not to proceed with the acquisition Pty Ltd from the offer of $310,000. This decision was taken because the Australian Postal Commission was concerned that the vendor was in a posidon to make a considerable capital profit. The Department of Administrative Services, Queensland, advised Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd on 20 December 1976 that the Commission did not wish to proceed with the purchase. In making this decision, the Commission had before it a final valuation on the land by the Australian Taxation Office of$360,000. During the period of these negotiations the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications was asked , entirely at the initiative of the Commission, whether the proposed purchase, which would take place embarrassment to him. The then Minister indicated that he would have no difficulties if the Commission were to purchase property in his electorate even if the Commission's ultimate decision was to purchase at a profit to the present owner. After receipt of the letter of 20 December 1976, Mr MCMaster made immediate representations to his local Member, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, questioning the decision notified by the Department of Administrative Services, and indicating that he believed that the Australian Postal Commission was still keen to buy the property. The Minister rang the Acting Chief General Manager of the Australian Postal Commission on 30 December 1976, and made it clear that he did not want to be associated with any negotiations but that for the purpose of dealing with the representations from Mr MCMaster it would be helpful if the Minister knew the Commission's attitude so he could tell Mr MCMaster where he stood in the matter. The Minister asked that the Managing Director contact him on 4 January 1977 and indicated that he would delay answering Mr MCMaster's representations until after he had spoken with the Managing Director. When the Managing Director contacted the Minister on 4 January 1977, the Minister confirmed the substance of his conversation with the Acting Chief General Manager. The Managing Director informed the Minister that the Australian Postal Commission would very much like to acquire the site but felt strongly its public responsibilities and would not contemplate a substantial profit being made by the vendor. The Managing Director also indicated to the Minister that if Mr MCMaster were prepared to consider a lower figure than $310,000, he should contact the Chief Property Officer, Department of Administrative Services, Queensland, and the Manager, Planning and Technical Services, Australia Post, Queensland. The Minister indicated that he would pass on to Mr MCMaster the Managing Director's advice. Mr MCMaster subsequently entered into negotiations with the Department of Administrative Services on 7 January 1977. The property was purchased from Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd on 8 February 1977 at a cost of $280,000, which was $80,000 below the Taxation Valuation. On 8 May 1978,1 contacted the former Chairman of the Australian Postal Commission, Mr J. J. Kennedy and the Managing Director, Mr A. F. Spratt, to seek their recollections of the matter. Mr Kennedy has written to me as follows: matter pending careful examin8th May, 1978. The Honourable A. Staley, M.P., and to release Ron MCMaster Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Parliament House, Canberra, ACT. 2600 My dear Minister, In response to your telephone call, I confirm that I have a very clear recollection of the events surrounding the purchase of land at the Gold Coast by the Australian Postal Commission, which I understand is now the subject of an investigation by your good self. The Commission negotiated strenuously for this most suitable site for a mail sorting centre, and although it was valued at about $350,000, in the event was able to purchase it for $280,000.00, after prolonged negotiations. in his electorate, would be an I understand there has been a suggestion that the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, The Honourable Eric Robinson, was in some way involved in influencing the Commission to purchase the property, so that the vendor would make a profit of some $40,000.00. I do not wish to get involved in any political controversy, but I must state that, to my knowledge, no pressure or influence, impUed, implicit, direct or indirect, was brought to bear by the then Minister, The Honourable Eric Robinson, in the Commission's deliberations on the matter. The Minister made it quite clear to me that any decision on the purchase of the property at the Gold Coast was a decision that was entirely up to the Postal Commission, and he was particularly concerned, following a breakdown in the negotiations, that any re-opening of negotiations was entirely up to the Postal Commission. The Minister made no attempt to influence the Commission 's decision to purchase the Gold Coast land. The land was purchased at a fair price below valuation, and was the most suitable land for the purpose. Less suitable land was available at a higher price, and this was taken into account in the Commission's decision. Yours sincerely, J. J. Kennedy 40008 Mr Spratt has by minute informed me as follows: NA GOLD COAST (FEBRUARY 1977) On 4 January 1977 after conferring by telephone with our State Manager, Queensland and our Chairman, I contacted by telephone the Minister for Post and Telecommunications further to his discussions with our Acting Chief General Manager on 30 December 1976. The Minister confirmed as he had said to our Acting Chief General Manager on 30 December 1976 that he, the Minister, had been approached by Mr R. MCMaster, seeking information whether the Australian Postal Commission would sdll be interested in the purchase of his, Mr MCMaster's, property if the asking price were reduced. In discussion with the Minister I made the following points: The Commission would very much like to acquire the site under sale to Mr MCMaster but felt strongly its public responsibilities and could not contemplate an exorbitant profit being made by the new owner-in other words the Commission being 'taken for a ride and ripped off. The Commission was also sensitive located in the Minister's electorate. The Commission would not consider dealing at the asking price of $310,000 but if Mr MCMaster is prepared to come to a lower figure and talk, he should contact the Chief Property Officer, Department vices, Queensland and the Manager, Planning and Technical Services, Australia Post, Queensland The Minister indicated that he would pass on to Mr MCMaster my advice that we would be prepared to reopen negotiations at a lower figure if Mr MCMaster were to initiate tact with the relevant Queensland officers. My contact with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications on 4 January 1977 was the only occasion on which we discussed the proposed purchase. My clear impression from our Acting Chief General Manager and from the Minister is that the initiative had been taken by Mr MCMaster. Furthermore, there was no suggestion by the Minister, either direct or impUed, that we should reopen negotiations, nor was there any indication that the Minister had any involvement or wish to intervene other than to respond helpfuUy to Mr MCMaster's inquiry to him. The purchasing procedures which are set out in the Land Acquisition Act are there to protect the public interest. must always be some risk that a private person or organisation will step in and purchase a property, although active negotiations are being pursued at atimeby the Government authority and the vendor. In this particular instance fortunate that the proposed acquisition by Australia Post was not finalised when the offering price was $240,000. On 22 February 1977, the then Minister, Mr Robinson, wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services referring the Lands Acquisition Act requirement that property transactions be conducted through the Department of Adminisplied trative Services. Mr Robinson said this requirement difficulties for Australia Post obtaining properties The first example of delays which was quoted was the in purchasing the Bundall site on the Gold Coast.",120

The details of the emergency arrangements, as with (a) above, depend upon the nature of the accident. Employment: Two Incomes (Question No. 624) Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on Distribution 14 March 1978: (Question No. 515) (1) With reference to the Women and Work Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 2, January 1978, has his Department made any investigations into the percentage of two income earners who are married. (2) What percentage of married two income families have children. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department has made no investigations into the percentage of two income earners who are married. The information contained in the Women and Work Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 2, January 1978 was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication Income Distribution 1973-74-Parts 1 and 2 (Reference No. 17.8) which provides information on the income of individuals and families. (2) The precise information sought is not available. However data are available on families where both husband and wife are in the labour force. Such families would include those where one or other (or both) of the husband or wife 6. were unemployed and not earning income. These data are published in the Australian Bureau of Statistics bulletin Labour Force Status and Other Characteristics of Families, November 1974, (Reference No. 6.57). The publication shows there were an estimated 1,221,800 married couple families with both the husband and wife in the labour force. Of these an estimated 59.3 per cent (or 724,500) had dependent children present. The publication also shows that of the married couple families with both husband and wife in the labour force, 44,100 (or 3.6 per cent) had either the husband, the wife or both unemployed. Since the data are based on a sample they may differ from those that would have been obtained from a complete census using the same question(Question No. 596) naires and procedures.

Whitlam asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 15 March 1978: living within a radius of 5 miles (1) Is it a fact that no proclamation has yet been made to bring into operation section 25 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Act (No. 3) 1977 assented to on 21 October 1977. (2) Does section 25 insert 'Part VIIIAA-Account s and Audit in Respect of Registered Organisations' in the Principal Act. (3) Is the delay in proclaiming the section due, wholly or partly, to the difficulties faced by auditors in auditing the accounting records of organisations which, pending the resolution of the situation to which the Industrial Court sought urgent attention in its judgment on 25 February 1969 in the case of Moore v Doyle, are required to register as separate organisations under the Federal Act and under one or more of the industrial arbitration acts of the States of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The delay in proclaiming the section is due to the fact that the regulations necessary to the operadon of Pan VIII AA of the Act have not yet been made. In accordance with the Government's commitment to consultation with trade union and employer peak councils, the format and content of proposed regulations is presently being examined by the National Labour Consultative Council. The implications of Moore v Doyle are not a reason for the delay. Atomic Energy Research Establishment:",126

Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) to (e) In view of the volume of requests for detailed labour market information and thetimeinvolved in extracting and preparing such information, I have arranged for local offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service, when requested by a member of parliament, to provide readily available raw data which may be relevant to the question. I suggest that the honourable member contact the Ofncers-in-Charge of the CES offices concerned. Tasmanian Beer: Freight Equalisation Radioactive Waste Assistance (Question No. 806) (Question No. 903) Mr Hodgman asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 April 1978: In order to promote increased consumption of Tasmania's Cascade beer by non-Tasmanian members of the Federal Parliament, will he ascertain what freight equalisation payments currently apply to the interstate expon of Tasmanian beer bearing in mind that a half can of Cascade beer is currentlyretailingin the Parliamentary Bar at a price of 61 cents. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: and the quantity involved. The current freight equalisation assistance payable for the interstate movement from Southern Tasmania of beer is $14 per cubic metre to Victoria, $15 per cubic metre to South Australia/Western Australia and $ 17 per cubic metre to the rest of the Mainland. For each 370 ml can of Cascade beer, these rates of assistance are approximately equivalent to 1.44c to Victoria, 1.54c to Western Australia/South Australia and 1.75c to therestof the Mainland. Air Services to and from Tasmania (Question No. 926) Mr Hodgman asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 12 April 1978: (1) Is it a fact that on the afternoon and evening of 23 March 1978 a number of commercial airline flights in and out of Tasmania were either delayed for several hours or simply cancelled, and that on 10 April 1978 flights from Tasmania were again delayed, jeopardising the attendance of radiation level on the surface is Tasmanian members and senators at the Federal Parliament. (2) Will he now give a firm directive to the major commercial airlines that where through shortage of planes or any other reason nights have to be delayed or cancelled, flights to and from Tasmania shall be exempted and shall not be delayed or cancelled, bearing in mind the fact that Australians living on the mainland have access to alternative road and rail transport. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable (Question No. 850) member's question is as follows: (1) It is correct that on 23 March 1978 and 10 April 1978 airline services between Tasmania and the mainland were disrupted. Disruption on 23 March 1978 was caused by some aircraft unserviceability and deteriorating weather conditions at a number of locations on the airlines networks. On 10 April 1978 there was severe storm activity which closed Melbourne, Devonport and Wynyard airports for several hours,resultingin some flights being delayed and others cancelled. (2) The honourable member will recognise from the above explanation that it would not be appropriate for me to give a firm directive to the or cancel Tasmanian flights through shortage of planes or any other reasons. Former Regular Servicemen's Vocational Mr Chapman asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 13 April 1978: Does the Government plan to expand the Former Regular Servicemen's Vocational Training Scheme so that it can vide training for former servicemen with less service. Mr Street-The answer to member's quesdon is as follows: The Former Regular Servicemen's Vocational Training Scheme was introduced on 1 February 1978. It was developed after consultations with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, and detailed discussions between representatives from my Department, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. There are no proposals under consideration which would reduce the qualifying period to less than the completion of 15 years effective full time service, although the Scheme makes an exception for members who have been discharged on the grounds of invalidity. However, former members of the Regular Defence Forces under this Scheme, may seek resettlement training through the National Employment and Training Scheme (NEAT).

(3) Will he detail the specific provisions of the relevant legislative authority. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Domestic airlines are required to: (i) prevent or deter the unauthorised carriage on their aircraft of any firearm, weapon, ammunition, explosive or incendiary device, in baggage or on the person of a passenger; (ii) prevent or deter unauthorised access to their aircraft; (iii) ensure that baggage, cargo and mail are loaded only in accordance with the company's specified security procedures; (iv) ensure that adequate inspections of aircrafts are conducted in the event of bomb or other threats being received. (b) International airlines are required to observe the same procedures as the domestic airlines both in Australian territory and at least at posts from which aircraft last depart for Australia. (2) The Air Navigation Act and the Air Navigation Regulations made under that Act. (3) Air Navigation Regulations No. 82 (2) and 89 (2) are applicable in the case of all airlines. Air Navigation Regulation No. 82 (2) provides that aerodromes and air route and airway facilities established or provided in pursuance of this Regulation shall be under the control and management of the Secretary to the Department of Transport who may, subject to these Regulations, determine thereof. Air Navigation Regulation No. 89 (2) provides that the Secretary to the Department of Transport may, in relation to any aerdrome, air route or airway facility, air route or airway licensed, authorised, established or designated under this Part, issue such directions as he considers necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and compliance with the standards, recommended practices and procedures adopted from time to time in pursuance of the Convention. The Secretary has exercised powers conferred on him by these Regulations to require the domestic airlines to observe security procedures at airports. Part XVIA of the Air Navigation Regulations is specifically applicable to international airlines. It provides that an operator of an international airline service to or from Australia shall not cause or permit an aircraft used in that service toflyover Australian territory or land at or take off from an Australian airport unless an aviation security program prepared and submitted by the operator has been approved by the Secretary and that approval is in force.

300,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) $56.00 on 17 June 1977. (2) Air fare from Darwin to Gove. Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 3 May 1978: (1) What are the various surcharges that freight forwarders using Conference rates make, in particular the bunker surcharge and the currency adjustment factor, what is their purpose, and how are they calculated. (2) Can he advise whether freight forwarders charging Conference rates deduct the full container load discount before applying the currency and bunker adjustment factors. (3) Are any regulations in force which require forwarders to detail these charges in invoices to importers. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Conference lines in our overseas trades charge a basic rate for the carriage of sea freight between specified ports in Australia and overseas. They add to this basic rate surcharges, such as the bunker adjustment factor (BAF) and the currency adjustment factor (CAF). The magnitude of the surcharges are negotiated between the Conferences and the Australian Shippers' Council. The BAF, or bunker surcharge as it is sometimes known, was introduced at the time of the oil crisis when fuel prices rose sharply, and at such frequent intervals that ship operators were unable to absorb the cost. The surcharge is calculated using a formula which varies from trade to trade depending on ports of bunkering, types of fuel used etc. the conditions of the use The CAF has been introduced by Conference lines as a contingency provision aimed at alleviating the shon term effects of currencyfluctuationsand avoiding any significant financial gains or losses to shippers or shipowners. They are calculated using a basket of currencies in which shipping companies make disbursements. BAF and CAF surcharges are usually applied as a percentage of the basic rate. However, with the stabilisation of oU prices, an increasing number of shipping companies now incorporate this cost component in basic rates, with appropriate provision for adjustments should the cost of bunkers exceed agreed limits. Currency fluctuations however, have not stabilised sufficiently for the CAF to be generally incorporated in basic rates. In addition to the above rates, there are also fixed rates charged by Conference lines for wharfage and additional services such as transhipment, change of destination or discharge port, pon congestion, receiving and loading, and inland haulage etc. (2) Freight forwarders are normally employed where individual shippers do not have sufficient cargo to fill a container. In cases where freight forwarders are able to ship full container loads (FCLs), I understand individual clients are billed according to their proportion of the freight, net of the (Question No. 987) allowance, as charged by the shipping lines. BAF and CAF are generally applied to the basic freight rate, before adjustments for additions and allowances. (3) I am not aware of any regulations in force which require freight forwarders to detail charges in invoices to importers. Shipping Freights (Question No. 1005) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 3 May 1978: (1) Is he pany to the setting of freight charges to Australia by the Outward Continent/Australia Conference; if not, is Australia's interest in this matter represented at all. (2) What incentives are offered to European freight forShipping Freights warders to use only Conference vessels and charge Confer(Question No. 1004) ence rates. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Pan X of the Trade Practices Act which regulates overseas cargo shipping provides for negotiations of freight rates in outwards trades only. Inwards rates are established by the Outward Continent/Australia Conference in Europe. (2) Information is not available on specific incentives, if any, that may be offered to European freight forwarders to use only Conference vessels and charge Conference rates. However the shippers generally find Conference services more attractive because of the quaUty of service offered in relation to frequency and regularity of sailings, reliability of sailing schedules as well as wider range of ports served and other services offered by Conferences.

Queensland Government Railways: Apprenticeship (Question No. 56)",131
302,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: (1) Is he able to state how many apprentices are employed at the railway workshops at (a) Ipswich and (b) Redbank, Queensland. (2) How many of those apprentices are subsidised by the Australian Government and what is the total subsidy in each Charges case in a full year. (Question No. 1122) (3) How many of those apprentices will be completing their trade training during 1978 and 1979 and how many can expect the offer of full-time employment as tradesmen with the Queensland Railway Department. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following information relating to the number of apprentices employed by the Queensland Government Railways (QGR) has been provided by the Hon. F. A. Campbell MLA, Minister for Labour Relations. A total of275 apprentices have been allotted to the workshops at Ipswich as at 1 March 1978. The Redbank workshops do not apply for apprentices to be allotted, but some of the apprentices employed at Ipswich are transferred, for varying periods, to the Redbank workshops to augment their training. The number training at Redbank varies as a result. (2) The Australian Government subsidises the employment of QGR apprentices in two ways. Firstly, it pays the (Question No. 1162) entire cost throughout apprenticeship of employing 18 apprentices allotted to the Ipswich workshops. These apprentices are employed under the Additional Apprentices Scheme and are surplus to the Railways requirements. It is expected that on completion of training, these apprentices will be available Tor employment in the private sector. During the calendar year 1977, $108,224 was paid to the Railways Department in respect of these apprentices. Records the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations show that the equivalent amount for 1976 was $76,146 and for 1975, $45,590. The second method through which financiliation cial assistance is provided is under the apprenticeship port schemes, CRAFT (Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenwhich tice Full-time Training) introduced on (National Apprenticehip Assistance Scheme) which preceded CRAFT. The Employers' Incentive Subsidy under NAAS was payable forfirstyear apprentices. Technical Education Rebate is payable whenever technical education is carried out throughout the apprenticeship. The amounts paid in each year will therefore escalate as new intakes stan their technical education. Bulk claims are ted by Queensland Government Railways and as aresultthe amounts payable in respect Ipswich cannot be identified. The following figures relate to the total of all QGR apprentices. In 1975 there was an averyear age of 107 first year apprentices subsidised under NAAS during each quarter. The amount paid inrespectof them $10,373.55. No subsidies were paid in 1976 because the igibility criteria for NAAS were not met that year. It is estimated that the 165 first year apprentices employed 1977 will attract a total subsidy under CRAFT of $63,525 for 1977, some $40,816 of this having already been paid. Taking into account the 1978 intake of 76, the total CRAFT Technical Education Rebate payable for 1978 is likely to be some $97,000. (This will be payable inrespectof first and second year apprentices attending compulsory technical education courses). (3) I am informed by Mr Campbell that it is expected that, Year during 1978, 60 of the apprentices allotted to the Ipswich workshops will complete their training and that 53 of them will be retained by QGR. During 1979, a further 87 Ipswich apprentices will complete training, but the number of them who will beretainedin employment will depend on QGR's 1971 actual requirements when each apprentice completes 1972 training. Trade Unions: Demarcation Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 1 March 1978: (1) Did the case of Moore v. Doyle in the Commonwealth Industrial Court concern the separate legal identities of the Transport Workers Union of AustraUaregisteredunder the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the Transport Workers' Union of Australia, New South Wales Branch registered under the New South Wales Industrial Arbitration Act. (2) Did the court (Spicer C. J., Smithers and Kerr J.

(2) Has his attention also been drawn to comments by the Victorian Minister for Social Welfare, the Honourable Brian Dixon, M.P., that the scheme suffers from lack of recognition under Federal awards which could make employers Uable to pay full award rates to students participating in the scheme; if so, have any steps been taken to overcome this difficulty. (Question No. 316) (3) What consideration has been given to participation by Commonwealth Government departments and agencies in the scheme by providing opportunities within their Victorian establishments for this work experience. to the Government of the investMr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes; this matter has been co*-...dered in detail by the Conference of Ministers for Labour and the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee, and the views of members of the National Labour Consultative Council are being sought on possible approaches fore dealing with the difficulty to which the Victorian Minister for Social Welfare referred. (3) The Public Service Board has advised my Department that it is willing to consider work experience proposals and is prepared to explore whether and how such proposals (Question No. 361) can be accommodated within existing employment and othe relevant legislative provisions. The extent and nature of the Commonwealth Public Service's participation in such schemes would be determined by the nature of any proposals and the legal and other difficulties that might be thrown up in detailed examination. I understand that opportunities are currently available, where work demands and staff resources within Departments permit, for interested students to observe work undertaken in the Commonwealth PubUc Service. Special arrangements are also made for the employment of students who need to undertake appropriate employment to complete the practicalrequirementsof their academic courses.

(3) It is not known how many graduates and diplomates from tertiary institutions have great difficulty in obtaining employment solely because they lack relevant work experience. It is pointed out that the aim of providing a special rate of subsidy under SYETP is to assist those who, having tested the labour market, are not able to find stable employment. fact is that the great majority of those completing full education are able to find employment without any financial assistance. To extend SYETP benefits to an employer for a young person he would have employed without subsidy would be costly and contrary to the Government's in the Edupolicy ofrestrainingpublic expenditure. Finally there does not seem to be any merit in dispensing with the qualifying period under SYETP for graduates and the diplomates. To do so would place these people at an advantage over others and would make it difficult to identify people in need of special assistance. Papua New Guinean Ex-servicemen: Australian Benefits 46 (Question No. 66S) . . . . 68 Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Veterans' 170 Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1978: 36 123 (1) What Australian benefits are available for Papua New Guinea ex-servicemen who served with Australian forces in 31 World War II. 98 65 (2) What requests has the Government received from the Government of Papua New Guinea on this issue. 21 32 Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable 2 member's question is as follows: 692 (1) Benefits made avaUable under the Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act and Regulations to Papua New Guinea ex-servicemen who served with Australian Forces in World War II are pensions (including pensions payable to widows and other dependants) in respect or incapacity, or death, resulting Allowance payable in respect of decoration awards during service. (2) In 1976, Sir Albert Maori Kiki, then Deputy Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, wrote to the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs seeking a special pension similar to the Australian service pension to be paid to bona fide Papua New Guinea ex-servicemen from the age of SS years until death. The request was later supported by the then Governor General and Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. The Government decided not to accede to the request as it was considered that the payment of a special reward for service' pension would not be in keeping with the principle of payment of pensions war service or the effects of war. A request has recently been made by the Hon. Louis Mona, the Minister for Defence in Papua New Guinea, for the grant of a lump sum of $3m to be paid to the Papua New Guinea Government to be administered by a Trust. This money could then be disbursed to eligible Papua and New Guinea ex-servicemen who served with the Australian Forces during World War II and their dependants either by instalments or lump sum. The grant sought was to have been in already paid to entitled Papua New Guinea ex-servicemen.

(1) (a) and (b) A departmental officer interviewed in the program referred to by the honourable member stated that departmental staffing numbers were sufficient; the capacity to handle all payments was not mentioned. The officer agreed that a small number of people applying for unemployment benefits had experienced some delay because of exceptional circumstances, including a seasonal load, the holiday period and the introduction of payment of benefits in arrears. The officer forecast that the delay would be under control within two or three weeks from the date of the program and the delays mentioned were eliminated by 15 February 1978.

(2) When will the results be made pubUc. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) As far as the Commonwealth is concerned I am advised that a preliminary study, which indicated there was Utde merit in further evaluadon, was undertaken when this proposal was first put forward. However this could not be described as a fuU cost/benefit study.

Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The reply to the honourable member's question given on 24 March 1977 was not, as is suggested by the honourable member, erroneous. He will recall that he asked whether the Contributions Queensland Treaties Commission had recommended (Question No. 837) changes to Queensland law to permit agreement to ratification of ILO Convention No. 107. While the Commission's report containedreferencesto Convention No. 107, the Commission made norecommendations regardingchanges of law necessary to permit agreement to ratification and nor did it indicate that its examination of the Convention was concluded. Against this background the answer provided on 24 March 1977 was correct: no advice had been received regarding the outcome of the examination by the Queensland Treaties Commission of ILO Convention No. 107.

Oil Exploration: Taxation Incentives (Question No. 876) (Question No. 901) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 April 1978: (1) Is it a fact that taxation incentives for oil exploration announced in the 1977-78 Budget will apply only to expenditure made by Australian companies; if so, in the case of partnerships between Australian and overseas companies, will only the expenditure incurred by the Australian partners be eligible for deduction from taxable income. (2) Will exploration funds lent by an overseas partner to an Australian partner in a joint tion from the taxable income of the Australian partner. (3) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Australian of 9 March 1978 that a local company, Cultus Pacific NL, intends to use this means of minimising its taxable income in a 40 per cent joint venture with 3 Canadian companies. (4) Are these methods of subsidising foreign exploration for oil in Australian waters carried out at the expense of the Australian taxpayer.",138
313,Mr HOWARD,INNER AND INTRA UNION INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As a result of changes announced in the 1976-77 Budget, expenditure on exploration for petroleum, both shore and off-shore, is deductible against assessable income from any source. The deduction is available to both resident and non-resident companies. A further taxation incentive petroleum exploration in off-shore areas of Australia was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 24 August 1977 and was mentioned in the 1977-78 Budget Speech. This further incentive is in the form of arebateto subscribers capital to companies holding registered interests in permits or licences under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. Those companies, whether overseas or Australian companies, will be able to lodge declarations with the Commissioner of Taxation forgoing the right to deductions to which they would be entitled for petroleum exploration and development in order to confer rebates on both corporate and non-corporate and resident and non-resident shareholders. Legislation to implement the shareholder scheme is contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1978 which was introduced into the Parliament 7 April 1978. (2) Funds lent by an overseas partner to an Australian partner in an oil exploration venture conducted by the partnership, which are expended by ration, would be deductible in calculating the net income of the partnership for tax purposes. In the case of an exploment ration joint venture that does not constitute a partnership tax purposes, and is therefore not assessed as such, moneys received by an AustraUanresidentparticipant a foreign participant and expended ploration would be deductible from the assessable income of that taxpayer. Of course, as I have indicated rect expenditure of these funds by an overseas resident on oil exploration would be deductible from the Australian assessyear able income of that enterprise. (3) The report in the Australian of 9 March 1978 appears to refer to the incentive announced in the 1976-77 Budget Speech and not to the shareholderrebatescheme mentioned in the 1977-78 Budget Speech. If so, the article is incorrect suggesting that immediate deductibility of petroleum exploextradition. ration expenditure against income from any source is able restricted to expenditure on off-shore exploration. Overseas interests that do not derive income in able to benefit by way of immediate deductions for oil exploration expenditure. In these circumstances it may be arranged that the overseas interests provide loan funds Australian resident participants who are in a position to benefit from the deductions against other Australian income. (4) A great deal of exploration and development expenwhereby diture on petroleum and general mining isfinancedby funds from overseas and other sources. The loans are, of course,repayableand expenditure out of them is incurred by the Australian borrower. In these circumstances deductions for the expenditure are in accordance with the policy underIsraeU lying the special tax provisions. Payments to Connair Pty Ltd venture be eligible for deduc(Question No. 985) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 3 May 1978: (1) What sums has his Department paid to Connair Pry Ltd or its predecessor, Connellan Airways Pty Ltd, in each year since 1962. (2) For what reasons were the amounts paid in each of these years. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following amounts were paid by my Department to Connair Pty Ltd or its predecessor, Connellan Airways Pty onLtd in eachfinancialyear since 1962: 1961-62, $215,092; 1962-63, $229,890; 1963-64, $236,422; 1964-65, $281,200; 1965-66, $386,000; 1966-67, $400,000; 1967-68, $483,981; for 1968-69, $449,025; 1969-70, $447,739; 1970-71, $838,620; 1971-72, $755,805; 1972-73, $886,410; 1973-74, $764,884; 1974-75, $625,000; 1975-76, $608,333; 1976-77,5550,000.

Extradition Arrangements with Israel: Mr M. Glickman and Mr I. Makler (Question No. 993) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for rebate Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1978: (1) Has the Israeli Knesset passed extradition laws since on his answers to me on Australia's extradition arrangements with Israel (Hansard, 24 February 1977, page 5074 and 8 March 1978, page 570). (2) Do the IsraeU laws affect these arrangements; if so, the partnership on oil explohow. (3) Have consultations been held with the IsraeU Governon the effectiveness of the existing extradition arrangefor ments between Australia and Israel following the departure loan of Morris Glickman and Igal Makler from Australia for from Israel in February and April 1978 respectively. by the former on oil ex in (1) above, dimember's question is as follows: (1) 1 understand that the Israeli Knesset in January this passed a law which, when it comes into force, will prohibit the extradition from Israel of IsraeU nationals. This prohibition will not, however, apply when the offence for which extradition of an IsraeU national is sought was committed before he became an Israeli national. The law also provides in for prosecution in Israel of those nationals not subject to Moreover, under the new law Australia will be to request that an Israeli national, who has been sentenced in Australia and who then flees to Israel, serve that Australia may not be sentence in Israel. (2) This law will not strictiy affect the Extradition Treaty which has been in force with Israel since 3 January 1976. to Article VIII of that Treaty provides that either Party may refuse to extradite its own nationals. This discretionary provision accords with international extradition practice many countriesrefuseextradition of their nationals. loan Australia does not favour this practice. (3) Along with some other countries party to extradition treaties with Israel, Australia has expressed its concern to Israel that the new law should not operate so as to allow nationals to avoid criminal proceedings. The Australian Ambassador to Israel has had discussions with Israeli authorities on this matter and has been informed of Israel's willingness to engage in negotiations concern that a requirement for Israel to prosecute Israeli nationals not subject to extradition be formalised by an amendment to the Extradition Treaty. Sydney and Melbourne Urban Railways: Links Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 8 May 1978: (1) Is he able to say how many kilometres of unused or lightly used railway line exist in the Sydney and Melbourne Transport Districts. (2) Have these lines been taken into consideration by his Department in the development these crowded cities; if so, how. (3) What consideration has been given to upgrading or adapting lines to provide direct rail services from Mascot and Tullamarine Airports to the respective city centres. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I am unable to say how many kilometres of unused or lightly used railway line exist in Sydney and bourne. Under the terms of the Commonwealth's urban freight transport assistance program the potential contribution such line could make to the transport strategy for a city would be considered in the event that the State proposed provements relating to such a line.
