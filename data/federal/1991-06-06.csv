2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Electoral Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we call upon Honourable Members to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise electoral material on radio and television, believing such bans amount to a denial of free speech, an unfair advantage to an incumbent government, and denial of information to printhandicapped and other Australians. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Bailey (from five citizens) and Mr Reith (from 81 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: I. (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgment by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children (b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements. 2. creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmospherc of happiness, love and understanding mcntioncd as valuable in the preamble. 3. will produce closer monitoring by Govcrnment agencies of relationships bctween parcnts and children. Your Petitioners therefore pray that: I. By Act, Parliament ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament. 2. The Parliament takc action to have the Convention amended in ordcr to pay the highest regard to the importance of the family unit, and to the rights and responsibilities of parents. by Mr Cadman (from 361 citizens) and Mr Mack (from 182 citizens). Christian Commonwealth To the Honourable the Speaker and Membcrs of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we, the undersigned, call for the full and total recognition by l-cderal Parliament and the High Court and all govcrnment agencies that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth according to law and its heritage traditions and customs. That as Australia prepares for the Centenary of Federation on 1st January, 2001 AD, we celebrate our Centenary as a Christian Commonwealth as dcscribed by the Founders of Federation such as Sir John Downer, who said ""The Commonwealth will be from its first stage a Christian Commonwcalth"" and as stated in our Federal Constitution-""humbly relying upon the Blessings of Almighty God . . . "" That our Federal Parliament therefore implement the following policies before 1st Januar.y, 2001 AD. 1. The Adoption of a Christian National Anthem-""God Bless Australia"" to the tune of ""Waltzing Matilda"". 2. The Adoption of a Christian National Motto""One Nation Under God"", for use on our coins, banknotes, etc. 3. The appointment of practising Christians as Vice Regal Representatives of our Christian Queen, Elizabeth II. 4. The retcntion of our Christian Prayers at the daily opening of Parliament in the standing respectful presence of all Members of Parliament. 5. The retention of ""God Save the Queen"" for Vice Regal Functions as our Royal Anthem and as our National Hymn for all other civic functions. 6. The retention of Christian Christmas Carols in our State Schools and other civic functions during the Christmas Season. 7. Officially inform the United Nations and all the other nations of the world that Australia is a Christian Commonwealth. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will reaffirm our Christian Heritage as a Christian Commonwealth. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 24 citizens) and Mr Tickner (from 27 citizens), Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. - That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights. - That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life. - That in 1989/90 alone Medicare provided medical benefits for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of unborn Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Newell (from 44 citizens) and Mr Webster (from 21 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights. That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life. That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect. That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million. That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies ing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. . And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Dobie (from 75 citizens) and Mr Webster (from 84 citizens), Health Insurance: Hospital Rebate To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House that under the current arrangements within the health care delivery system, severely handicapped and profoundly developmentally disabled babies, infants and children and other certain classes of patients, suffer discrimination against them due to Section 3B of the Health Insurance Act t 973, thus denying them appropriate intensive and extensive care in suitably specialised hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore, request the House to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973, or exempt these and other certain classes of patients from the provisions of Section 3B of the Act so that these patients needing professional care treatmcnt and attention, and intensive mcdical management in suitably specialised hospitals receive the hospital rebate from their health insurance fund, reflecting the high cost of the intensive and extensive care these patients need, and should have a right to expect. by Mr Rohert Brown (from 1, lO7 citizens), Baltic States To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Soviet troops have been killing innocent civilians in the Baltic States and, more generally, that the continuing unprovoked use of force in the Baltic States by the Soviet Union is contrary to the human rights of individuals as well as to the rights of self-determination of the Baltic peoples and therefore requests that you condemn this action and urge the Australian Government to implement trade sanctions and to suspend relief action to the USSR. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Connolly (from one citizen), Firearms To the Honourable the Speaker and members of by ceasthe House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:' The petition of certain residents of the Federal electorate of Riverina draws to the attention of the house that we are of the opinion that the clauses appertaining to firearms in the so called ""Generic Statement"" are nothing short of a deceitful attempt by the Federal Government to take the control of firearms laws away from the States and into the Federal sphere of control. We believe this is contrary to our State's rights as guaranteed in our constitution. Your petitioners therefore pray that the house reject all aspects of the Generic Statement as being contrary to the State's rights of control, and private ownership of, the firearms discriminated against in the above mentioned ""Generic Statement"". by Mr Hicks (from 18 citizens). Brisbane Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors in electorates adjacent to the Brisbane Airport, draw to the attention of the Parliament, the increase in noise pollution and subsequent effects on the quality of life of residents in certain southern and northern suburbs of Brisbane, caused by the opening of the new Brisbane Airport. Your petitioners therefore request that the Parliament take immediate steps to make the necessary finance available to extend the existing cross runway 14/32 to allow planes of all sizes to use it as a major runway. The 50,000 to 60,000 people affected request equal favourable financial treatment to that granted to the aviation industry during the airlines dispute and that the cross runway be upgraded as a matter of urgency by the new Parliament and not stalled into the next century. We urgently request that no runway parallel to the existing main runway be built as it would compound noise, safety and health problems for the northern and southern suburbs of Brisbane. by Mr Jull (from 286 citizens). Repatriation Hospital System To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble pctition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showcth that whereas: 1. They are completely satisfied with the existing Repatriation Hospital system. 2. They are aware that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs have guaranteed on a number of occasions: (a) no Repatriation General Hospital will be transferred to a State until a satisfactory agreement has been reached on matters, such as priority of access and quality of health care for Vctcrans and War Widows, and unless the intcrests of hospital staff have been adequately safeguarded; and (b) no final decision will be taken if the RSL has reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangements. 3. They have reasonable cause for concern that integration of Repatriation Hospitals into State systems will represent a serious erosion of their rights and privileges. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Repatriation Hospital system be retained under the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to ensure Repatriation General Hospitals remain centres of excellence for the health needs of the Community."" And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Jull (from 14 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn baby. That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights. That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life. That in 1989/90 alone Medicare subsidised 69,587 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of unborn Australian babies by ceasing to subsidise abortions through Medicare by passing the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990 and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Kerr (from 317 citizens). Prescriptions: Pensioners To the Honourable Members in the House of Representatives assembled. Your humble petitioners respectfully showeth that to introduce a charge for pensioners prescriptions would cause great hardship in particular to those people on more than one medication and also to those with chronic illnesses. We strongly urge thai no charge on pensioners prescriptions be introduced. And in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr l,angmore (from 11 citizens), Ownership of Press To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia wish to draw the attention of the House that we are deeply concerned at (I) Concentration of ownership of the Press which is unprecedented in Australia's history and unparalleled in any Western Democracy (2) The unacceptable concentration of power, the restrictions on the diversity of information and ideas, the barriers to entry and other aspects of market failure, the diminished localism of content and accountability, the debilitating impact on journalistic culture and the conflicts of interest which this concentration of ownership involves. Your pctitioners respectfully urge the House to support the establishment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the Press ineluding: (a) The extent of concentration in the ownership and control and the effects of that (i) The provision of accurate, fair and comprchensive news; (ii) the diversity of opinions and the opportunities for expression; and (iii) the practice of journalism; and (b) the regulatory framework in Australia. by Mr Langmore (from 9 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the central role played by the arms trade in creating an environment in which wars such as the Gulf War can occur. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: (i) call on the Federal Government to outlaw sales of armaments and arms-related technology to overseas organisations, government and private. (ii) call on the Federal Government to lobby internationally, including at the United Nations, for the banning of sales of armaments and arms-related technology. by Mr Mack (from 696 citizens). Arms Trade To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the central role played by the arms trade in creating an environment in which wars such as the Gulf War can occur. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: (i) call on the Federal Government to outlaw sales of armaments and arms-related technology to overseas organisations, government and private. (ii) call on the Federal Government to lobby internationally, including at the United Nations, for the banning of sales of armaments and arms-related technology to unstable regions and to countries with dictatorships. by Mr Sinclair (from 34 citizens). National Estate Forests To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to attention of this House that we are concerned at the lack of protection of National on: Estates Forests. Your petitioners therefore request the House to direct the Prime Minister and his Government to enact to (1) Immediate and full protection of all National Estate Forests. (2) Suspension of all forestry activity in those areas while under investigation. (3) Immediate restructuring of total forest industry, to maximise employment opportunities whilst moving to ecologically sustainable, Arms Trade plantation based industry. (4) Funding to be made available to Federal Government for Identification of Wilderness areas in Australia. (5) Separate Legislation to Protect National Estates Forest. by Mr Mack (from 513 citizens), Otway Forest, Victoria To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows that the Otway Rainforests are being exploited inappropriately. We pray that the export woodchip licence supplied for Midway Wood Products be rescinded immediately and the Otway Rainforests be managed in the best interests of the people of Australia. by Mr Macki (from 55 citizens), Constitution Referendum To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that citizens are concerned that many have little or no say in the general formulation of policy. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will hold a referendum to test the will of the people of Australia, to ascertain whether they are willing to have the Constitution altered to allow (citizens initiated referendum and recall) to be introduced as the form of Government in Australia. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 22 citizens). Political Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we call upon Honourable Members to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise political material on radio and television, believing such a ban to be arbitrary and discriminatory, a denial of freedom of speech and a curtailment of criticism (or support) of political parties and/or their policies. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Reith (from 254 citizens). Latrobe Valley Hospital To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain Citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Public Patient waiting lists for elective surgery tinue to be exacerbated whilst both Federal and State Governments place unrealistic tlnancial targets on the Latrobe Valley Hospital. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: Ensures the provision of adequate funding to maintain a consistent standard of medical service to the public. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Riggall (from 622 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: We are gravely concerned that the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is being threatened (i.e. Senator Ray's threat to withdraw funding from Radio Australia). We feel that the A.B.e. must remain wholly and fearlessly independent of the Government of the day and further that its managers and program makers must be absolutely free from any hint or suggested interference in the editorial judgement that they may make. We further petition that sufficient funding he made available to ensure that the democratic independence of the A.B.e. can be maintained· by Government funding alone. We fear that the independence of the A.B.e. would be seriously compromised by sponsorship and advertising and this must not be allowed to happen. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That you consider the above petition and do whatever is necessary to preserve the democratic independence of the A.B.e. by Mr Rocher (from 532 citizens).

3,Mr BARRY JONES,LONG TERM STRATEGIES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, I present the Committee's report entitled Australia as an Information Society: Grasping New Paradigms, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",16
4,Mr BARRY JONES,LONG TERM STRATEGIES,"The House of will con- Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies was formed on 31 May 1990 with unusually wide terms of reference giving the Committee power to determine its own subjects for inquiry. After considering 10 different subject areas, the Committee chose to begin with Australia as an information society, dividing the topic into three parts. Our first report, Grasping New Paradigms, deals with the longest, most complex and pervasive issue: the nature of the information revolution and its impact on Australian society, the economy and government, the need for a national information policy to link together disparate policy issues which arc currently uncoordinated, and a draft policy. The Committee will bring down two more information reports in the spring session. The second report will be on the role and capacity of libraries as community information providers in a time of financial stringency compounded by sharply increased public usage. The Committee will be following up some issues raised in the 1976 report of the Horton Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries which were not adequately addressed at any level of government. The third report will analyse the problems faced by members of parliament in coming to grips with technical issues. At a time when legislation is increasingly complex, Parliament sits for shorter periods and power is inevitably slippingYes, Minister-towards the bureaucracy, a tendency which is absolutely bipartisan. The Committee advertised for submissions in September 1990 and received 121, many of which were very substantial. They came from Commonwealth departments, State governments, some local government bodies, the Australian Academy of Science and the Australian Academy of Technological Science and Engineering, Telecom Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australian National Library and State libraries, the Australian Consumers Association and a number of community-based organisations. The Committee held public hearings in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide and it also held several vate hearings. It inspected various ties, including the National Library of Australia and CSIRO's Division of Information Technology. The Committee had discussions with 87 witnesses. The Committee was greatly assisted by the Centre for International Research in Communications and Information Technology, CIRCIT, in Melbourne. Especially helpful were its Director, Professor Bill Melody, and Deputy Director, Professor Don Lamberton. Mr Clem Doherty, Principal, MCKinsey & Co. gave a valuable seminar to the Committee on the economic potential of information-related industries. Other expcrt witnesses included the Hon. Justice Michael Kirby and the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor. Mr Phil Ruthven of IBIS consulting group was also generous in providing advice and research materials. I takc this opportunity to thank the Committee's expert and diligent staff, Mr Ian Dundas, Ms Margaret Swieringa, Ms Kelly Fitzsimmons and Jillian Menham for their efforts in producing this first report. We have called the first report Australia as an Information Society: Grasping New Paradigms. The word paradigm meaning 'pattern' or 'framcwork' is used in Thomas S. Kuhn's sense of a comprehensive set of explanations [or how society, a system, or a scientific process works. Revolutions occur, Kuhn argued, not by incremental change, but by radical shift from one paradigm to another. Mr Downer-It has become a terrible buzz word. Every pseudo-expert in Australia uses it.",16
5,Mr BARRY JONES,LONG TERM STRATEGIES,"If the honourable member for Mayo can think of a better word, as I am sure he can, he might propose it. On the report's cover M.C. Escher's lvIetamorphosis III illustrates that, while we are used to continuity in our experience, there come points at which we recognise that fundamental transitions have occurred. Australia should now be recognised as an information society in which more than 40 per cent of the labour force is employed in the collection, procpri- essing and dissemination of data or faciliknowledge-more than manufacturing, construction, agriculture and mining combined. This phenomenon has also occurred since the 197 Os in Japan, the United States, Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada, Italy and Sweden. Japan's current economic strength is based, at least in part, on the fact that it was the first nation to grasp the political and economic significance of information as a factor in society and production. Australia's comparative weakness in a time of tran-ition is partly due to our failure to recognise the extent to which knowledge and skill have replaced raw materials and muscle power in determining what an economy is capable of. Australia is, regrcttably, a passive information society which needs the shock of recognition to enable it to fulfil its productive capacity. Of course, it could be argued with some justice that all societies in history have been based on information, which is central to home life, education and every economic and social relationship. Information has always been integral to agriculture, mining, manufacturing and retailing. So what is new about the prcsent? Essentially, it is the speed and intensity of change and the penalties for failure when nations ignore the print-out on the wall. As paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5 state: With the development of communications and computer technology, information has become a decisive factor in the global economy which transcends national boundaries and increasingly operates in 'real time', and in which transactions are affected by rapid changes in currency values, speed of delivery and the quality of advice for decision making. Information is increasingly important in all areas of employment and production-agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services gencrally. However, information policy has generally evolved in an uncoordinated fashion, often responding to a new technological or commercial form, for example the development of commercial television, or reacting to a real or perceived crisis for example privacy legislation, but without developing or applying an agreed set of principles which could apply to 'information' issues generally. Australia, with its relatively strong education and research base, ought to be in a strong position to use information effectively. However, because of our national failure to grasp the dimension of the information revolution, we have lost many opportunities. Australia has failed to understand how to use information effectively or synergistically, by not coordinating effort, by not using material alrcady existing in databases, and by the problem of territoriality where major stakeholders are reluctant to share their assets. Often institutions spend heavily to buy equipment and undertake research, then file it away without ever having exploited it to the national advantage. We produce very few high value added brain-based goods and services of internationally tradable quality. We are encouraged to become the clever country, but notoriously lack clever exports; Our cities, despite their sophisticated information infrastructure, make a minor contribution to exports. Australia is a very heavy importer of computers, sophisticated office equipment and scientific instruments, but fails to use this information equipment efficiently. Computing, far from eliminating paperwork and reducing white collar employment, seems to increase both. The three great lies of popular folklore should be increased by one more: using information equipment saves work and cost and eliminates duplication. There has been no coherent national approach to policy formulation in information issues, but a reliance on improvisation or response to crises. There is a high degree of fragmentation. Information means different things to different departments: to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce information is equated with information technology, both hardware and software; to the Department of Transport and Communications it means the provision or licensing of communication systems; to the Attorney-General's Department it means intellectual property rights; to the Department of Employment, Education and Training it means teaching, training and research; to the Treasury it means collecting statistics and providing economic forecasts; and to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories it means the National Library of Australia--singular-the arts and meteorology. A similar fragmentation exists in the States. The situation is compounded by the lack of a common definition of information. The frequent confusion of information and information technology treats content and delivery systems as synonymous. The Committee was concerned about the national failure to link information policy, such as it is, with industry or economics policy. I draw attention to paragraphs 1.64 to 1.68 inclusive, particularly 1.64 and 1.65. Paragraph 1.64 states: A National Information Policv and a national industry (or economic) policy' are inextricably linked. In a global economy, with traditional riers becoming obsolete, industrial strategy will be increasingly dependent on access to information about the size and location of markets, assessing consumer feedback, scientific discoveries and technological innovation, changes in style, fashion and design skills, the implication ious factors (economic, social cnvironmental, political, cultural) determining consumer demand and preference . . . But we point out that the recent industry statement, Building a Competitive Australia, simply failed to connect industry and information. We are also concerned about the related problems of access, equity and privacy in information delivery with the danger of a widening gap between the information rich and the information poor. We also discussed the controversial issue about whether information should be regarded as a free good or not. When the debate is resumed, I will take the House through the central elements of the proposed national information policy. The report is long overdue. The issues raised are now commonplace in most overseas Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. In Australia it has a disturbing novelty and there have been many defensive reactions in the recent past. The report is a useful exercise in consciousness raising and I look forward to some debate. I move: That the House take notc of the report.",17
6,Mr SPEAKER,LONG TERM STRATEGIES,"In accordance with sessional order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE",19
7,Mr MACKELLAR,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence And Trade, I present the Committee's report on a visit to Papua New Guinea in February-March 1991. Ordered that the report be printed. Mr MACKELLARThis is, and I underline this, not in any sense a final report on Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. It is merely an interim rebar- port dealing with a visit that a number of the Committee members made to Papua New Guinea (PNG) in February and March of this year. Contrary to some reports or views that of var- others may have had, the welcome that the Committee received in Papua New Guinea was really magnificent. No matter where we went within PNG-and we travelled very widely in a very short period of time-the people of Papua New Guinea were obviously pleased to see us. They obviously wanted to speak to us in great detail and took every opportunity so to do. There was, I believe, great goodwill exhibited by all those with whom we came into contact. I think it is important to state at the outset that this great goodwill cannot be taken for granted. In the Committee's later report, which I hope will come before the Parliament later this year, we will be outlining ways in which that goodwill can be maintained and extended. It was a very useful opportunity to get a broad overview of the situation in PNG. Despite the fact that only a few days were involved, it was essential that we had the opportunity to travel in an Australian aircraft, because that enabled us to travel very widely. We simply would not have had the opportunity of getting to the places and meeting the people that we did, if we had not had that assistance. All the members of the Committee are grateful to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for his personal intervention to enable that to take place. We often forget that PNG is now the second largest nation in the South Pacific. It is the second largest nation in terms of Report population, and probably in terms of natural resources. We all know that Papua New Guinea is wondrously endowed with natural resources and more are being discovered all the time. It is a most significant nation and its proximity to Australia, of course, plus the traditional rClationships that have existed between Australia and Papua New Guinea, make it an extremely important nation, not only because of those traditional relationships, but also because of its significance in the South Pacific region. For those reasons it is absolutely essential, in my view, that Australian politicians continue to travel to Papua New Guinea on a constant basis. We should not just talk about it; we should make it a reality. It really is important that people in Papua New Guinea, particularly the politicians in Papua New Guinea and those in Australia at the Federal level, do know and understand the problems, the opportunities and the situations in both of our countries. The future of both of our countries depends to a great extent, in certain instances, on what is happening both in Papua New Guinea and also, of course, in Australia. What we did see was a situation where great problems confront the Government of Papua New Guinea. I will mention only a couple at the moment. Obviously, the Bougainville situation is having a major impact on the energies of the Government of Papua New Guinea. It is having a flow-on effect in the development of other resources and other resource developments within Papua New Guinea. The sooner that situation can be brought to a successful conclusion, the better. The other thing which is having an impact right across the spectrum is the law and order situation in PNG. We saw some instances of that. We should not overstate, in my view, the difficulties that confront the Government of Papua New Guinea in relation to the law and order problem. But it is important that Australia cooperates very closely with the PNG Government in whatever way it can, to a mutually acceptable level, to assist the Government in bringing the law and order situation back to more acceptable levels. A number of people want to speak in this debate and I recognise that. There is so much more that I could say but I will conclude my remarks. so that other members who travelled to PNG can make their contributions. I move: That the House take note of the report.",19
8,Mr LANGMORE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Fraser) (9.52 a.m.)I wholeheartedly endorse the comments by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar). It was a delight to return to Papua New Guinea, where I worked between 1963 and 1976. In every town, the official welcome to the parliamentary delegation was warm and polished. Provincial governments presented each member with leis and arranged displays of dancing. Discussions with national and provincial politicians were thoughtful and frank and the message everywhere was much the same-give us tied aid. Tied aid meant aid linked to national and provincial projects, not aid tied to purchases in Australia, which is the conventional meaning. Lawlessness, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Warringah, has said, is the subject most commonly discussed. The frequent brutal assaults on Papua New Guineans and foreigners in the main towns are symptoms of frustration and alienation caused by unemployment, the inequalities of income and wealth, and the difficulty of finding income earning opportunities. Yet it is quite clear from our visits and the talks that we had that the police are severely understaffed, undertrained and inadequately funded. In a sense, this offers hope because all of these problems can be readily addressed provided the Government gives law and order a high priority and sharply increases funding. The Prime Minister wants to recruit more police advisers from overseas, and Australia must respond positively to this request. The impact of the breakdown of urban social order, reduced public spending on investments and maintenance, and the inexperience and weak work disciplines of some of the work force tend to cast a fog of pessimism. Yet many positive factors are at work also. The most important factor is the stability and security provided for most of the community by subsistence agriculture in a very fertile country. In the monetised sector, the prospects for gold and oil exports offer the possibility of eliminating the current account deficit, despite the 75 per cent deterioration in the terms of trade during the last 10 years. The churches are an influential force for both service delivery and humanity. Also, Papua New Guineans have a more highly developed capacity for consensual planning and dispute settlement within their groups than do Australians. Members of the delegation were impressed with the competence, good sense, and openness of most of the politicians and public servants with whom we spoke. n is clear that, despite severe financial and organisational constraints, many senior Papua New Guineans are working with dedication and effectiveness to steadily resolve problems. Fifteen years of independence have increased the authority and self-confidence of many leaders. The fact that governments have changed peacefully several times is widely recognised as an example of a well functioning, national political system. Action is under way to resolve some of the constitutional causes of unstable government. Less generally recognised is the openness of discussion and diversity of opinion, reinforced by a free and forthright press. The principal development needs are for more and better roads, schools, health centres and police. Talk of eliminating Australian aid by the year 2000 is quite premature. For as long as there is widespread and unpredictable violence, massive needs for education, health services and infrastructure, Australian aid must be maintained. Papua New Guinea has now established its independence. The time has come for more general recognition of the natural interdependence of Australia and Papua New Guinea. More supportive action by Australia would be warranted. The visit was a fascinating and enriching experience for all who participated. I hope that the investment by Papua New Guineans in the delegation will bear fruit in closer and more productive relations between Australia and their country.",20
9,Mr SINCLAIR,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Obviously, each of us who visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) has returned with very strong feelings about Australia's affinity with that country. I echo the sentiments of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). We do not have long to debate the issue and I only want to add some brief comments to those that have been made. First, it is imperative that this Government and, indeed, any government ensures that there is a regular capacity for members of this Parliament to visit PNG. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Warringah, Australians must remember that our relationship with Papua New Guinea is unique. This relationship is essential to Australia's well-being and it cannot be maintained by only the occasional visit of some official parliamentary delegation. It should be a matter of ordinary convenience for members to visit PNG and to feel part of PNG, as it should be for those who live in PNG to visit Australia. If we are to preserve the long term relationship that we have with PNG, we must encourage members to visit that country. A recommendation has been made that members of this Parliament have an entitlement to visit Papua New Guinea at least once in each parliamentary term. I would strongly assert that that should be introduced as soon as possible, preferably in the next Budget. I agree entirely with the comment made by the honourable member for Fraser that it would be premature to phase out aid by the year 2000. As far as I am concerned, aid is a means by which we use our Australian resources to assist our long term interests. PNG is a nation with which we are always going to have long term interests. I regard any suggestion of phasing out aid as not being within present contemplation. As far as I am concerned, the infrastructures, particularly education, are the basic problems in PNG. They are the causes of the problems. In dealing with the law and order situation, there is a need to look at symptoms, not the causes. Australia must give help to that manifestly robust democracy which is PNG to ensure not only that democracy survives but also that people born with aspirations are given some opportunity to fulfil those aspirations. In that sense, I am also technical education is a field which, at this stage, has been neglected. We need to give greater help to the PNG Government to ensure that its technical education cilities are adequate and that young people are given trade opportunities which sure a future not only in the cities but the villages. There is still a real worry about the drift of population from rural areas. To overcome that, we have to sure the relevance of education to a way of life that will not exclude the villages the future. That is quite essential in social as well as the economic developan ment of the area. On the subject of aid, I want to refer specifically to the army engineers group in Mendi in the Southern Highlands Province. There has been concern extion pressed that this might not be relevant the task of the Australian Defence Force. In the last few weeks we have had a statement on the force restructure. While Mendi we met Major Darnley-Stuart and his men. In my view, it is one of the most effective aid projects that I have seen. The project is not being pursued at military level, but it provides fundamentween tal assistance to the people of the area, giving them long term knowledge of how to build roads and how to plan infrastructure development to which several members have referred, and also gives the Australians direct participation in community, which is a unique experience. Several of my own constituents were members of that small team of Royal Australian Engineers, and I was tremenrioration dously impressed by the way that they felt the work had practical value. I would strongly commend to the ernment the reading of paragraphs 3.19 to 3.23 of the Joint Committee on Fortroubles eign Affairs, Defence and Trade report a visit to Papua New Guinea, which outmain lines the working group's commitment to ensure that that work continues. I do not believe it would be in Australia's interests for the project to be terminated and I strongly recommend to the Government that, quite apart from other interests, it reads that part of this report, for it is essential that the Army engineers be alconcerned that lowed to continue their work. Like the honourable member for Fraser, on my return to PNG I was pleased to fasee the progress that has been achieved. I think that there is far too much negative endiscussion about the present and future in of PNG. It is a wonderful country with immense resources, human and material, and I am quite sure that, by a positive enapproach from Australia, we can ensure that that democracy, which I have already in described as robust, not only survives but the also thrives, and that PNG continues as important, vital nation in the region of which they and we are part.",21
10,Mr LEE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delegato Papua New Guinea, I also wish to to associate myself with the comments made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) and previous speakers. I at suppose the importance of Papua New Guinea to me as a member of this delegation was emphasised most strongly when we visited the Australian war graves in Lae. No Australian needs any greater a demonstration of the indivisible link be the future of Papua New Guinea in and that of Australia than to remember how many Australians gave their lives for the during the Second World War. Certainly, it was an honour for me to be able to go to Papua New Guinea for a the second time as a member of this Parliament. Yet, in the two years that have gone· since my first visit to Papua New Guinea, there has obviously been a detein the law and order situation there. Unfortunately, that is reported in Australia in a distorted way. If we follow Govthe stories on 60 Minutes or read the Australian reports of the law and order in Papua New Guinea, we peron haps might think that Australians are the target of violence. We were told-I think it was at the Australian police training project in Lae-that, for every Australian that might be attacked, 100 Papua New Guinea nationals suffer the effects of violence. Violence is obviously a great problem. It is a problem not just for the Australian expatriates who are living in Papua New Guinea but, more importantly, it is a problem that is creating terrible difficulties for the nation itself and for all of the people of Papua New Guinea. If the law and order problem is not addressed, then the great potential that the country has for tourism might pass it by. The incredible economic benefits that might result from the development of its gold, oil and copper projects might be lost if the law and order problem is not overcome. Previous speakers have said that they believe Australia can do more, and I agree with them. I think that the Australian police training project could be expanded; when we spoke to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Namaliu, he explained ways he thought the project could be expanded, and I think that they were very positive suggestions that should be addressed. I wish to endorse completely two comments made by the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Firstly, Australian parliamentarians should spend more time in Papua New Guinea learning about the country. Secondly, the Australian Army Engineers project in the Southern Highlands is an excellent project, and I will be very disappointed if the Government decides to wind back funding for it, because I think it is extremely successful. I would also remind the House that the Government has promised to expand the Australian Army Engineers' involvement in Papua New Guinea by introducing another project in the Vanimo area; it has not yet got off the ground, and I think it is time that any problems holding back that project are resolved. Everywhere we went we were told there is a debate as to whether Australian aid should be provided as part of the general budget of Papua New Guinea or as tied aid, project aid. I have some views on that, and I am sure all of us will argue that out when the main report comes down. However, I think the important thing is that, if we do have a switch towards more project aid, it is important that the Government of Papua New Guinea is still able to determine mainly where the money gets spent. Australia might want to know how the money gets spent and might want to ensure that it is spent as wisely as possible, but ultimately the decision as to where funds go will have to be the decision of the legitimate government of Papua New Guinea. Finally, I place on record my appreciation to Judy Middlebrook and all the other people who worked hard to ensure that this visit was a success. To our friends at places such as the Martyrs Memorial Junior Secondary School, to people such as Premier Robert Atiyafa from the Eastern Highlands Province, and to all of the other people who have helped us, I would like to say thank you very much.",22
11,Mr MOORE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"In the two or three minutes I have available it is difficult to comment on a visit to New Guinea in any real depth. I have always supported the view that Australia should pay more attention to its relations with nations within the Pacific Ocean area than to other nations in the world because this is our centre of interest. As a consequence of that view, it was of great interest to me to visit New Guinea, after its 16 years of independence, and to see what has taken place in that remarkable country. If we are not careful to maintain our interests in that area, paradise will be lost. It is an incredible country that offers enormous opportunities for individual development, for governmental relations and for commercial development, but there are certain structural problems within the nation. Certainly the structure of government is becoming overweighted, with local governments, provincial governments and the central government. Certainly there is a problem in the education system, where the standards of education in some areas have not been maintained, and they are turning out a vast array of young people-50,000 to 70,000 a yearinto a jobless market, which creates a lot of law and order problems. Probably the biggest problem area, besides law and order and education, is the development of management skills within the country. It is not possible to make the headway that is required there unless a big effort is put into training New Guinea nationals in management. In the future some of our aid might be better directed towards education in the managemcnt area.",23

In accordance with sessional order I02B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. STA''JDING COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT, COMMUNICATIONS NA Report  (10.08 a.m.)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communicaquality tions and Infrastructure, I present the port entitled Telecom's handling of cllstomer complaints, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.  have just presented covers a small but significant subject: Telecom's handling customer complaints. There is that the subject is small; there is equally no doubt that it is significant. There is an old saying that a satisfied customer tells a friend; a dissatisfied customer tells the world. An appropriate subtitle to this report, then, could have been: Beware, Telecom, they could be telling the world. That is why the way complaints are hanis a significant matter for any busiGiven, in particular, the new environment of impending competition, poor handling of complaints could reduce market share, reduce growth and adversely affect profits. Telecom recognises this. Tesays it is going to be very positive about the Committee inquiry, and this augurs well for the implementation of the the Committee's proposals to improve the Clerks handling of customer complaints. The terms of reference received from the Minister for Transport and Commuon nications (Mr Beazley) were very broad. These gave us the opportunity not only to I look at Telecom's internal procedures but also to examine the work of the external review agencies, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and Austel. From this broad exthe Committee has concluded there are four essential parts to Teeffective handling of customer complaints. These arc: improved quality of service measures that attack the causes an of complaints; a first-class system that handles complaints at the first point of contact; close monitoring of why complaints escalate past the first point; and the deterrent of the telecommunications carriers meeting the costs of external review. Prior to this inquiry there was no public recognition of the value of an effective complaints handling system to improve of service or increase customer resatisfaction. Following subcommittee questioning, Telecom detailed an objective of complaint handling: namely, that its primary objective for an appropriate complaints handling process is to improve customer service in all areas and in so reduce the number of first order complaints. The effective handling of cusof tomer complaints is an integral part of no doubt the quality of service. In recent years Telecom has introduced a number of measures aimed at making the organisation more responsive to the needs of the customer. These include: the creation of customer and product divisions in the organisation structure; Telecom surveys of customer attitudes to service, Telcats; Telecom's own internal performance indicators on installation fault repairs, et cetera; total quality agement- or TQM, as it is known; monthly business performance reviews; and the establishment of the Telecom Australia Consumer Council. Telecom is adapting to change in its external environment. It is placing increasing emphasis on the importance of quality of service and is monitoring and measuring improvements in quality. Its Telcats surveys and internal performance indicators-which cover quality of service improvements on installation, repair, billing and operator assisted services-are evidence of this. However, it would be unwise to treat complaints as a by-product of quality of service improvements. Complaints sometimes cover more than the subject matter of the complaint. They also include customers' perceptions about the way they are being treated. This is why complaints should be used as a positive tool of good management. An effective complaints system should be driven by a strong belief that complaints and the way they are handled are an important component of quality of service which merits separate treatment. To its credit, towards the end of the inquiry Telecom recognised and accepted the benefits of an effective complaints handling system. The second essential feature of an effective system for handling complaints is that there should be a first-class system for handling complaints at the first point of contact: that is, where the complaints occur. The approach of the Committee is to place primary emphasis on Telecom dealing effectively with complaints at the first point of contact, or the grassroots level, as the members of the subcommittee called it during the inquiry. It is also the view of the National Roads and Motorists Association, which says that front-line staff of an organisation have the best knowledge of the business processes that affect the customer and they have the best opportunity to resolve the customer's complaints. This is also the Telecom view. The management of Telecom encourages the customer inquiry-complaint being man- owned and dealt with effectively at the first point of contact. Unfortunately, there was little evidence to show this had been happening. The Committee's proposals for change in chapter 4 should result in a considerable improvement in the resolution of complaints at the first point of contact. The proposals either assist the customer, improve the quality of the process or increase customer confidence. Three proposals made by the Committee are worth highlighting. The first is meter testing. The largest single category of complaints is on metered calls disputes. It is pleasing to find that Telecom has proposed the setting of standards through an organisation outside Telecom. This would give the process a visibility and accountability that it lacks at present. The advantages for good customer relationships speak for themselves. The terms of reference asked the Committee to examine the desirability of Telecom establishing an organisational unit in each district office. The Committee has not supported this proposal. Instead, it has called on Telecom to nominate an officer in each local Telecom office to be responsible for complaints in that office. The Committee has also asked Telecom to establish an experimental task force in several local Telecom offices to monitor the handling of complaints in those offices. The task force should be a small team in which front-line staff are well represented. There was very little reference during the inquiry to the value of staff, only to their shortcomings. The task force is a bottom-up proposal which embraces the view that front-line staff have something to contribute. The third feature of an effective complaints handling system is close monitoring of why complaints escalate past the first point. Until recently, the monitoring of why complaints escalate past the first point has been conspicuous by its absence. However, one of the major functions of the newly established customer hclp centres is to evaluate higher order customer complaints. The fourth essential part of an effective complaints handling system, requiring the carriers to meet the cost of external review, is a policy matter for government. The Committee sees no reason why the taxpayers should meet the costs of external review, particularly when the organisation complained of is a government business enterprise and, more particularly, when its competitors would be private enterprise companies. A second and more important reason is the deterrent effect of requiring the telecommunications con:pany to meet the costs of external reVIew. Telecom does not find out why complaints escalate to the Ombudsman. If Telecom had to pay over $600,000, which is a very rough estimate of what taxpayers pay for the Ombudsman to investigate Telecom complaints, surely it would want to find out quickly whether anything can be done to reduce the number of complaints reaching the Ombudsman, Austel or the telecommunications industry ombudsman to be established. The Committee's proposals are of three types. The majority, some 15, call on Telecom Australia to do certain things. One proposal asks Austel to do some work on performance indicators. Finally, the Committee recommends that the new telecommunications industry ombudsman be located within Austel and that a scheme be introduced to require that the costs of the operations of the telecommunications industry ombudsman be met by the industry rather than by the taxpayer. I thank all those who made submissions to the inquiry, particularly Telecom Australia, which made 12 submissions-the majority being responses for information requested by the subcommittee. I thank the inquiry staff, including Mr Malcolm Aldons, the Secretary, and Mrs June Murphy, for their support. Above all, I thank my fellow subcommittee members-the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewcn Cameron) and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott)-for their support and assistance throughout the inquiry. I commend the report to the House.",24
15,Mr ELLIOTT,AND INFRASTRUCTURE,"I am pleased to speak in support of the remarks of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), on this report that has been presented today relating to complaints handling procedures in Telecom Australia. At the outset, I endorse the remarks of the Chairman of the Committee and commend him for the role he has played in bringing forward this report and its recommendations. There is no doubt that the report and the inquiry we have undertaken highlight the value of the parliamentary committee process. Just in the course of the inquiry itself we have seen a significant change in attitude on the part of Telecom. We are in the unique position of actually having a number of the recommcndations we are making today already on the agenda as far as Telecom is concerned. There has been a recognition-we can honestly say that there has been a marked change of attitude during the course of the inquiry-of the importance that Telecom placed on effective complaints handling procedures. The recommendations contained in the report go to the heart of dcaling with those matters. There is no doubt, as the honourable member for Shorthand has said, that complaints handling procedures should be seen as a fundamental part of the management of a government business enterprise such as Telecom. This particular Committee report has brought thosc issues into sharper focus. I have no doubt that the implementation of the recommcndations the Committee is making will give both Telecom and its customers the opportunity to ensure that customer satisfaction and customer service are fundamental parts of its ongoing operation. That will be important, particularly in the new teh!communications environment that we are facing. Some of the recommendations that I would like briefly to speak to relate to staff training, the provision of effective information for staff on handling complaints and also the documentation that should be provided by Telecom within the organisation to ensure that complaints have been handled most effectively. One of the things we found at the outset of this inquiry was that there was very little information about how complaints at the local level were dealt with. Complaints had to escalate, and in many eases did so, and there was a lack of real hard data as to the number and type of complaints, and whether there were problems or discrepancies from one Telecom office to another. They were matters about which Telecom and the other agencies clearly had little information. Our Committee sought to address those issues by requiring that Telecom provide full details of these matters as part of its annual report process. The other key question that arose during the inq uiry was what was the appropriate mechanism for dealing with complaints. A number of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Committee suggested that there was a need for a variety of umbrella organisations to be built into the system, providing a mechanism for the effective monitoring of complaints. The Committee took the view-I think very sensibly-that the most appropriate place for complaints relating to Telecom to be dealt with was at the first point of contact. It was much more sensible to ensure the mechanisms were in place correctly at that level rather than seek to provide what would become a whole lot of bureaucratic levels in the process. Whilst they might have had some value, they certainly did not ensure the most expeditious resolution of complaints, which was clearly the fundamental interest of customers and those who had difficulties with Telecom. As members of Parliament, we took the view that, when we receive a complaint from a constituent about a Telecom operation we would like to ensure that the proble- was fixed quickly and without the need to go through a great deal of communication at all sorts of levels within the hierarchy. So we have made r-com­ mendations that, if implemented, will ensure that the handling of complaints at that first point of contact, at the customer help centre, is a fundamental part of the whole complaints handling manual that Telecom should be adopting. Further, there is a need to ensure that organisations such as the Ombudsman, Austel and others have effective standards and monitoring processes in those fields. At the same time, that should be part and parcel of the process. Some of the recommendations include objectives for effective complaints handling which are capable of being measured and assessed. That issue was significantly addressed by the Committee. As well, Telecom should include in its corporate plan the development of an effective customer complaints handling mechanism as a sub-objective of its quality of service. Further, it should include customer complaints procedures within the next telephone account or as soon as possible prior to the issue of the telephone directory for 1992. One thing we were concerned about was to ensure that, as quickly as possible, all Telecom customers actually had an effective process to know how they could ensure-",26

18,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the Committee entitled Cars, prawns and interest rates: Review of the Auditor-General's report on data collection for the Consumer Price Index, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",27
19,Mr MARTIN,ADMINISTRATION,"The report I have tabled this morning is the result of the review of an Auditor-General's report on data collection for the consumer price index (CPI). The audit report found there was no reason to question the CPI's accuracy. The processing of data and the compilation of the index were based on sound principles and were professionally performed. However, the report also identified some deficiencies in quality control of price data and made some suggestions for the improvement of the management trail in the processing of that data. The Committee pursued these areas with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and also explored some other matters relevant to the CPT. The CPI is a very complicated statistical activity. It involves the systematic and regular collection throughout eight capital cities each quarter of over 100,000 prices on items as diverse as cars, prawns and interest rates. It also involves maintaining constant quality within the basket of goods and services from quarter to quarter. For example, as specifications for motor vehicles change the ABS must ensure that the CPI reflects only the pure price element in the price change and not that element which occurs as a result of quality changes. To establish an appropriate basket of goods on which to base the CPI, the ABS conducts what is called a household expenditure survey. During the survey, conducted Austral is-wide at five-year intervals, people in a sample of households are asked to keep a detailed diary for a two-week period in which they list all their expenditures. A number of longer term expenditure commitments are also documented. The result gives a picture of the expenditure patterns of the target household groups represented in the CPI index. The next household expenditure survey is planned for 1993-94. Remembering some of the problems which were experienced with the last household expenditure survey, the Committee asked the ABS whether changes were being planned, particularly in relation to claims that the survey was an invasion of privacy. The ABS indicated that it recognised that the survey was onerous, and indeed an invasion of privacy, albeit a necessary one; and, in accordance with a suggestion of the Ombudsman, the ABS is investigating the possibility that households be compensated for their participation. Also under way is research work to determine how future surveys might be conducted with the assistance of 'smart card' technology to relieve the burden of households having to record in writing everything they purchase. In regard to the specific matters raised by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), the ABS advised that many of the recommended changes were practicable and werc being incorporated into the new data processing applications currently being developed. Also, as a result of the computerisation, several other recommended changes have become redundant. A significant advantage of the new system is the facility provided for editing of data at the input stage, as recommended by the Audit Office. For field collection of prices, the advent of hand-held computers will facilitate input editing. When a price observation is recorded the previous price observation and the percentage price increase will be shown, thereby providing a context for subjective judgment about accuracy of the recorded price. Informed subjective judgment and accrued expertise are important aspects of maintenance of quality and accuracy in price records. A memorable example of informed subjective judgment was recounted in the audit report. In the course of the audit, concern was expressed by the Audit Office at the lack of response by the ABS to apparently aberrant behaviour in the price trend for prawns in 1989. The ABS advised that the result was anticipated because it coincided with the death of the Japanese Emperor, which in turn caused a dramatic fall in demand as Japan went into mourning. The result would have attracted attention had a price fall not taken place. While the Committee recognises the importance of such expertise, it is also aware of the extent to which quality control of data collection and compilation will now be dependent on computerisation of the process. Benefits gained will depend on the quality of that system. Any design fault in the system would impact heavily on the validity and reliability of the outcome. The ABS has dedicated substantial resources to ensure that the computer system replicates the outcomes previously achieved with the clerical system. It has been satisfied that this requireCPI, ment will be met. The consistency of the system will continue to be revicwed to ensure that any changes made do not alter outcomes. Other significant advantages have accompanied the computer implementation. These include the elimination of the scope for clerical computation error and the provision for imputation of missing observations, which has largely eliminated the need for clerical intervention. The Committee concluded that the ABS has taken the opportunity presented by the redevelopment of the CPI data processing system to address those areas highlighted by the audit report as having room for improvement. The implementation of these changes should ensure greater quality control of data and an improved management trail in its processing. In addition to reviewing the audit report, the Committee also considered the desirability of developing some other indices to accompany the CPI. The first of these is an index which excludes tobacco and alcohol. The crux of the argument for their removal from the cpr is that if tobacco and alcohol were not included governments could decide to increase taxes on these items in order to discourage their consumption without needing to consider the consequent cffects on the cpr and other economic measures related to it. However, it is important to guard the objectivity of the CP-. To remove goods for any reason other than a change in expenditure patterns would risk undermining public confidence in the integrity of the measure and would be out of step with agreed international practice on the construction of consumer price indices. The Committee has therefore not recommended the exclusion of these commodities from the CPI but rather the provision of a supplementary index which excludes them. The existence and availability of such an index will facilitate Government decisions relating to health issues surrounding alcohol and tobacco consumption. Having regard to the effects of indirect taxation on price movements and thus the the Committee also considered the possibility of producing an index which removes the effects of indirect taxation. The ABS outlined the considerable difficulties involved in quantifying the proportion of price changes attributable to taxation changes. However, the Committee believes that such an index would be of value to government by providing a measure of market induced inflation or deflation, and hence has recommended a re-examination of the feasibility of its production. The Committee also believes the construction of an index similar to the United Kingdom's tax and price index (TPI) could be of value to government and the community. The TPI indicates how gross income would need to change to maintain after-tax real income constant. The Committee has recommended that the ABS investigate the feasibility of producing a similar aggregate index to supplement the CPI. Finally, the Committee questioned the appropriateness of the CPI for the indexation of pensions and other non-wage earner benefits. Since the CPI is based upon the expenditure patterns of those in employment, it may not reflect the impact of price changes on those who are not in receipt of! a wage. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the ABS study the feasibility of constructing a nonwage earners' price index or series of price indices relevant to the expenditure patterns of non-wage earning groups. These could form the basis for adjustment of pensions and other benefits. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow subcommittee members-the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), the honourable member for St George (Mr Dubois), the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliot), the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson)-for their work on this inquiry. I also sincerely thank the secretariat staff, particularly Geraldine Skinner and Amanda Garlick, for their assistance with this inquiry. Whilst it was not a long or arduous inquiry, which is normally the practice of our Committee, nevertheless it was significant. I believe it does make a contribution to the understanding of the formation of the CPI, and that it makes some suggestions on alternative indices. I commend the report to the House.",28
20,Mr WILSON,ADMINISTRATION,"The consumer price index (CPI) report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration just tabled by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) makes some very important recommendations. In doing so, the Committee, by implication, draws attention to the limitations of the consumer price index. It proposes that some of these limitations be overcome by the compilation and publication of other indices. The CPI is a measure of changes over time in retail prices, but not changes in the tax cost of paying for governmentprovided goods and services; of a constant basket of goods and services representative of consumption expenditure, but not including income taxes paid to meet the cost of 'government-provided goods and services; by resident employee households, not pensioner and other household types; and in metropolitan areas, not in country areas. Employee households are those which obtain three-quarters of their total income from wages and salaries but exclude the top 10 per cent in terms of income. The basket of goods is divided into eight groups: food, clothing, housing, housing equipment and operation, transportation, tobacco and alcohol, health and personal care, and recreation and education. The relative importance of the components in total expenditure of these categories is reviewed every five years and from time to time as circumstances warrant. Notwithstanding this process, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has acknowledged that changes in health service arrangements have had a substantial impact on the CPI in some periods. Presumably, changes in arrangements with regard to education, housing and transportation which alter the public sector-private sector mix would also have a substantial impact on the CPI. The ABS argues that, to remove goods from the current CPI for any reason other than a change irt expenditure patterns, would prejudice the integrity of the index. No doubt it would have the same view about the inclusion in the CPI of changes in the cost of taxed financed goods and services or the exclusion from retail prices of any indirect tax component. The currently used CPI is not a perfect all-purpose index, yet it is used as if it were. It is used as a general measure of inflation, it is used to adjust pension benefits and allowances, it is used to vary tax rebates, and it is used as an indicator of overall economic performance. Over time, the CPI's inherent deficiencies have been largely overlooked. As a result, the CPI is used to distort public policy decision making as often as it is used to aid it. Firstly, governments are reluctant to change the direct-indirect tax mix by increasing reliance on indirect taxes, and that reluctance is because of its impact on the CPI. Yet they will often stand by and allow the unindexed income tax rates scale and rebates to increase reliance on income tax so as to dampen CPI increases. Secondly, governments continue to provide goods and services which taxpayers and others would prefer to purchase for themselves if thcy had the resources to do so. To pay for them, governments maintain high overall levels of taxation. However the actual cost to households of this government provision of goods and services is not accurately reflected in the CPI. This is because increases inincomc taxes are not measured when calculating changes in the CPI, whereas indirect taxes are brought into account. Thirdly, governments all too often hesitate when transferring responsibility for payment for these goods and services from the public sector to the private sector. This hesitation occurs even when a proposed transfer to households is linked with income tax cuts commensurate with the public sector expenditure transfer. This is because the transfer of responsibility of, for example, transport, health, education or other expenditures to such households has in the past, on the admission of the ABS, had a substantial impact on the CPI. It appears that changes in the employee household expenditure patterns resulting from changes in the public sector-private sector mix of responsibility for the payment of goods and services is not being contemporaneously reflected in appropriate adjustment to the components in the total expenditure of the cpr population group. For all these reasons, r urge the Government to strongly recommend to the Australian Statistician that he prepare and publish additional indexes and indices so that policy makers, commentators and the general public have available to them not only an index which excludes taxes imposed for health reasons to discourage consumption expenditure as recommended by the Committee but also an index for a range of household types which brings into account the cost of government provided goods and services as paid for by direct as well as indirect taxes so that there are measures of changes on the price of a constant basket of goods and services, including those purchased as well as those provided by the Government; and an index for a range of household types which removes the effect of indirect taxation on pricc changes. With the availability of such indices, it should be easier for governments to change the public sector-private sector mix of direct and indirect taxation, and the public sector-private sector mix of - he responsibility of paying for what are III fact consumption goods. Governments would then be more likely to make decisions on their merits without being unduly influenced by what they perceive, and the public perceives, to be CPI effects---:an index being treated as an all-purpose mdex for which it was not designed and never intended to operate. Preparation of thesc additional indices may not be easy, but this should be seen as a challenge for action rather than an excuse for inaction. I stress that and hope that the Statistician will take up the challenge rather than find an excuse. In saying this, I note that the Parliament could, in the view of the ABS, make the task of the ABS easier if it were to introduce a value added tax or a: goods and services tax at a fixed rate across the board. I want to emphasise that because the Statistician did make it clear that one of the difficulties for it taking up new indices is the complex mishmash of indirect taxation that we currently have in this country. Whilst we still have that mishmash, I still believe that the Statistician should take up the challenge, but I hope that it will not be too long before we rationalise and have a more efficient system of collecting indirect taxation by the introduction of a general fixed rate goods and services tax. Along with the Chairman of the Committee, I, too, would like to thank Geraldine Skinner, who acted as Secretary to the subcommittee, and all other members of the Committee staff for the assistance that they gave the Committee in the preparation of this report. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Does the honourable member for Macarthur wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion? Mr Martin-I do, although I also wish that then- was a little bit of extra time to take up the honourable member for Sturt on some of his latter comments. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Unfortunately, there is not. Motion (by Mr Martin) proposed: That the House take note of the report. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-In accordance with sessional order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday.

21,Mr SCHOLES,PROCEDURE,"Corio) (10.44 a.m.)On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the follo-ing repo!ts of the Committee, together with the mmutes of proceedings: A Citizen's Right of Reply and The Standing Orders Go-ern­ ing: General Rule for Conduct of BUSiness Procedures for the Opening of Parliament. Ordered that the reports be printed.",32
22,Mr SCHOLES,PROCEDURE,"These reports cover two quite different aspects. The first report on the procedures for t-- opening of Parliament follows a declSlon of the Standing Orders Committee. in 1989 t-at it would review the entue Standmg Orders. That has been done in respect of committee procedures and private members' business. Both procedures are already in operation. The Standing Committee on Procedure has presented a number of other reports which have not yet been dealt with by the House. The second report adopts a procedure which was introduced and pioneered by the Senate some time ago relating to the right of reply of a citizen to matters in the Parliament. My colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, intends to address that matter at some length. I point out that the Committee had previously reported in a negative manner on this and had reconsidered it at the request of the Speaker. With respect to the report on the opening of Parliament, standing orders 1 to l1A, the Committee has examined and given consideration, as was mentioned in the House some time ago, to the fact that standing order 1 as it appears in our present Standing Orders is no longer relevant to the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament. Whilst at the time of Federation the type of operation in this chamber was that of the House of Commons, we are bound by the Standing Orders at this stage to refer back to the Standing Orders of the House of Commons in any matters in which there is not a relevant precedent. I doubt whether there is any such circumstance in existence, but the practices of the House of Commons have subsequently evolved to meet the needs of the House of Commons, a different House, a larger House, and with quite different practices. This House has adopted its own practices. It has now prepared its own practice manual and it is appropriate that where there are any doubts in any areas, where there is silence on the procedures before the House, it should refer to its own references and not those of another parliament. The procedures for the opening of Parliament are changed in a number of ways. The report adopts an earlier report which changes the means by which the Speaker is elected in the chamber only to the extent that the most senior member of the House who is available shall take the chair during those proceedings, which alters the practice of the Clerk taking the chair and, in fact, follows a practice which has always been the case in the House of Commons. The new initiatives which are contained relate largely to the actual swearing in of members, the presentation of a Speaker, and the timing of those events. The new procedures provide that the Governor General should appoint two deputies, that a deputy of the Governor General should attend in the House, that the proclamation should be read in the House, and that the swearing in should take place in the House. It eliminates the requirement of members of the House of Representatives to be summoned to the Senate and told that they are to be sworn in in the House of Representatives which, in short, was the previous practice. It also eliminates the practice of the Speaker attending in the Library-in the most recent exercise in the Members Hall-and being presented to the Governor General prior to the opening of Parliament. Under the new procedures the Speaker will attend in the place appointed by the Governor General-this House has expressed an opinion by resolution on where that should be-and at the time of attending for the opening address will, prior to that opening address, advise the Governor General of his election as Speaker. The new procedures break new ground. They are not earth shattering and, as they cover events which happened once every three years, with the exccption of standing order 1, they are not the major reforms which we would hope to make to the Standing Orders, but in any process it is necessary to deal with the whole of the Standing Orders. This report docs make important reforms, as does the second report, which the honourable member for Tangney will speak to.",32
23,Mr SHACK,PROCEDURE,"I am delighted to join with the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), the Chairman of the House of Representatives Procedure Committee, in speaking to the presentation of these two reports. In particular, I want to confine my remarks to the second of these reports, entitled A Citizen's Right of Reply. I was not on the Procedure Committee when this matter was considered previously and the Committee reported in the negative, but I am delighted to say that the Committee has now changed its mind and, from my point of view, this is one of the most significant reforms of the Standing Orders as recommended by the Procedure Committee. It is significant not so much to the House or the conduct of this House as to the people whom this House represents. The House of Representatives is a representative chambcr and this particular recommendation concerning our procedure will be significant to those in the Australian community who may judge that they have been wrongly referred to in this House. One of the greatest privileges of being a member of parliament in this country is that one can come into the chamber and, within the rules and the Standing Orders, say whatever one likes without fear or favour. In an open democracy such as Australia's, I, and indeed all of us, think that is an essential requirement. The nation needs at least one forum where this can be done-where representatives of the people, in this case ourselves, can come into the chamber and say whatever we like, governed of course by the Standing Orders. If that is the greatest right and, indeed, responsibility that we have within our Westminster parliamentary system, I am ashamed to say that often it is abused. In the 12 years that I have been in this chamber, I have heard accusations and allegations fly around without substantiation and, unfortunately, people in the wider community have been slandered and their reputations have been seriously damaged. In the Westminster system that operates in Australia, and in the British system of law and justice which accompanies it, two of the principal tenets are that people are innocent until proven guilty and, in conjunction with that, one is not guilty by association. I regret to say that, in the rough and tumble of political debate, often we lose sight of those two fundamental principles and things are said backwards and forwards across the chamber without regard to those principles that people are innocent until proven guilty and without regard to the principle that one is not guilty by mere association. In terms of the political debate, we in this chamber can look after ourselves; in the rough and tumble of political debate we have the right of reply and we also have the protection of the Chair and the protection of the Standing Orders. But, unfortunately, when the names of people outside this chamber are brought into the chamber when accusations and allegations are made about them, those people hitherto do not have the right to defend themselves in this chamber, and if there is not a member of parliament who is willing to stand up on their behalf and put forward their case, then unfortunately the allegaindustry tions often go without defence. The whole purpose of this particular recommendation is to give to the ordinary Australian people, within specific rules procedures, the right to put forward their defence. This process was pioneered by the Senate and, in the three years that has been working there, there have been 11 such instances, and the system judged by the Procedure Committee of this House to be working well. Broadly speaking, we have adopted the same sysper tem. I think it is a major reform, it is going to add to the quality of our democbeen racy, and I hope that the Government looks very closely at this report and adopts its recommendations.",33

26,Mr HULLS,WOOL INDUSTRY,"I move That this House: (1) recognises the importance of the wool industry to the economy of Australia; (2) recognises the unique advantage Australia has in the world market due to the quality wool; and (3) calls for the, banning of the export ino genetic breeding material with such breaches of the ban to be reinforced by appropriate cial penalties. We all know that wool is of the utmost importance to our rural and national economy. It contributes about 25 per cent of the value of agricultural production. was, until 1988-89, our major export the Committee: earner. In 1988-89 Australian wool exThis ports reached $5.9 billion. In 1989-90 the strates effects of the current crisis were making themselves felt and wool dropped back to material second place in export dollar earnings betending hind coal. Despite the setback, the wool countries. earned 4.3 billion export dollars in 1989-90. I believe this Government is committed to seeing the wool industry back up there and at No. 1. Mechanisms are bcing put in place to stabilise the wool industry as one of our chief export earners, as evidenced it by legislation introduced in this House over the last few days. The indications is are good. The supplementary payments scheme was based on a sale price of 375c kilo. Yet, sincc the abolition of the reserve price scheme, it has never actually that low. Shortly aftcr the abolition of the schcmc, the price of wool dropped to 428c and it has now settled at around 574c. This means that the supplementary payments scheme will cost the Government far less than was first calculated. It is because this Government recognises the fundamental importance of the wool industry that I am urging my colleagues to think again about the export of material. When I talk about gebreeding material, I include genetic breeding material on the hoof as well as in the test tube. The cxport of merino rams for exploitation of their genetic material must, I belicvc, bc immediately halted. Much has changcd sincc October 1985 when the then Minister for Primary Industry, the new Trcasurer (Mr Kerin), established the Merino Export Review Committee. The Committee was asked to of our examine the effects on the wool industry of the present arrangements governing the of merexport of merino rams and other genetic material from Australia and to advise of finanthe consequences of any changes. The Committee's report was tabled in this House on 26 May 1987. That Committee found that the export of Australian merinos did not pose a threat to the Australian It wool industry. I quote from the report of view is based on evidence which demonthat the genetic make-up of the Australian Merino is not unique, that comparable genetic is available outside Australia and inimporters can obtain supplies from other I disagree, and so do many wool growers in my electorate and, in fact, all around Australia. I have said before in this House that the wool industry is as old as the European occupation of this country and its fortunes are indelibly linked with those of the nation as a whole. The fortunes of Australian wool are dependent on its uniqueness and not, as the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and many other rural economists argue, simply on our climate and the price of our land. If climate and land were the only key factors, then one must ask why our competitors want our genetic breeding material. Just why is it in such demand? I think it is fair to say that we produce the best quality fine wool in the world. Our growers and breeders have worked hard over the decades to achieve their high standard of breeding stock. We dominate the world market in fine wool because our stock is superior. I believe our wool cut per head is much higher than elsewhere and, therefore, the Australian merino would be capable of improving yield and the quality of wool cut in other countries, thereby taking away our competitive edge. Whilst some overseas competitors can achieve the same fleece weight and micron diameter as we can, there are two unique Australian characteristics that cannot be emulated overseas: firstly, the style that creates the unique spinning quality of our wool and, secondly, the relative absence of black hair in our merinos. I am very reliably informed that the only way our competitors can readily achieve these two characteristics is by using our genetic material, as neither characteristic has anything to do with climate or, indeed, land values. We are in competition with the rest of the world's wool producing nations. Our main competitors are the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Argentina, South Africa and, of course, the United States of America. It is no coincidence that it is these nations that have imported the highest amounts of merino genetic material. Figures on the export of semen by country of destination show that in 1988 the total number of straws exported to competitor countries other than New Zealand was 3,771. This figure rose dramatically in 1990 to 17,017. It is also disturbing to note that, while the effect of the reduced purchases of wool by China has been all too devastatingly obvious, the sale of merino rams from Australia to China has increased from 20 in 1987 to 330 in 1990, making China the largest importer in 1990. These disturbing facts, I believe, speak for themselves. It also disturbs me that, while the Merino Export Review Committee report concluded that sales of merino genetic material posed no threat to the Australian wool industry, and recommended that the export of merino rams under quota should continue and that the export of merino semen should be permitted, it recommended, conversely, that the embargo on the export of merino ewes, ova and embryos should be retained. There seems to be a contradiction here. The Committee found that the removal of the embargo on merino ewe material was not warranted because there was only a limited export demand for the product and because, to quote from page 83 of the report: Both wool growers and merino stud breeders strongly believe that the export of ewes would seriously constrain the genetic improvement of merinos in Australia because it could result in the sale of parent studs. On my reading of the report, and from the contact I have had with wool growers in my electorate, there are a hell of a lot of wool growers who also fear for the genetic improvement of merinos in Australia because of the sale of rams and other genetic material overseas. Back in 1972, the newly elected Labor Government held a referendum among wool growers on the question of whether export of merino rams should be permitted. Of the 46 per cent of eligible voters who answered, 58 per cent opposed exports. The then Australian Wool Commission submission to the Merino Export Review Committee opposed exports, and I believe more wool growers than ever are opposed to exports. I have rcceivcd hundreds of signatures on a petition calling upon the Government to ban the export of merino genetic material. Most branches of the United Graziers Association in my electorate also oppose exports. I will concede that there are some benefIts fi'om the export of rams and semen; however, the benefits are short term and go to very few breeders. The benefits arc confined to a few stud merino breeders who are generally not reliant on the sales for profitability. The situation for the wool industry has changed radically since 1987. Back in the halcyon days of the late 1980s, when the Merino Export Review Committee was commissioned, the wool industry was booming. In fact, the sky was the limit. At that time we were in such a strong financial and market position that we could afford to take risks. Sadly, the scene has changed. We can no longer afford to risk losing the advantage of our unique genetic base. Artificial breeding techniques are accelerating the rate at which gcnetic material impacts upon a flock. We need to rethink all these issues now. The Merino Export Review Committee recommended a further review in 1992. Let us have that further review now. We need to determine appropriate penalties and act to protect the Australian wool in?-stry in this time of unprecedented cnsIs. While the market price for our wool is stabilising, it is still at comparatively gain basement prices. Overseas competitors can pick up merino genetic material at much lower prices than they could four years ago. We cannot afford to lose our competitive advantage. I do not believe we will. However, I am concerned that the effects of the current crisis will rebound on us for far longer than necessary if we do not act to ban the export of genetic breeding material now. The bottom line is that we are in competition with the rest of the world's wool producing nations. Unless we stop the spread of our unique genetic material, this competition will become more intense and will inevitably have a strong downward pressure on prices, which is currently the last thing we need. We have to send a clear signal to our wool growers that we are going to fight for the survival of our industry and this motion, which protects the technological development built up over time by our growers, does just that. I commend the motion to the House. MI' Campbcll-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later. MI' MCARTHUR (Corangamite) (11.06 a.m.)-The Australian wool industry has bcen the major background of Australia's prosperity since white man came to these shores. The export earnings of the wool industry created the wealth that helped develop Australia. It helped develop the country towns and the infrastructure throughout inland Australia, and it has becn a basis of the industrial attitudes from which we have seen change develop in the years from 1891 to now, 100 years later. T will speak to that a little later. The Australian merino sheep, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), has suggested, is regarded as the most superior wool sheep in the world. That is the basis around which the argument about the export of genetic material revolves. In his recent book, Charles Massy traces the background of the development of the Australian mcrino sheep from the Spanish merino, through the introduction of other strains, to the development of the quite brilliant animal that now inhabits the pasbar- toral zones of Australia. Mr Massy talks about the breeding programs of the wonderfully intuitive stud master of the past, John Macarthur-no relation to me-who initiated the merino breed here in Australia in the early 1800s. From that early beginning the merino breed built up because of the skill of the breeders, who adapted genetic material to the environment, both in the pastoral inland throughout the whole of Australia and in some of the high rainfall zones. The Falkiners, the Pennefathers, the Claphams, the Peppins and other well known stud masters worked for lifetimes to adapt and make better the merinos and studs that have become so famous throughout Australia and the world. What they basically did was use their skills to produce sheep which suited the Australian environment, which helped to make the wool industry prosperous and wealthy. The improvement in cut per head was very much a product of the skills of these breeders. As we all know in this House, Australia was considered to have been carried on the sheep's back from the turn of the century up to the 1950s, when it was the major export earner for Australia, until such time as Australia developed mining industries, which then started to compete with the wool industry in terms of exporting ability. I refer now to the industrial relations attitudes that emanated from the wool industry. Part of the motion before the House mentions the contribution of the wool industry to Australia. Back in the 1890s the great strike occurred. We know that the Australian Labor Party celebrated its centenary in May of this year, and the origins of industrial relations attitudes, background of the Australian Workers Union and the formation of the Australian Labor Party emanated from the problems of the wool industry. In very simple terms, the shearers of the 1890s felt they were disadvantaged. They were able to group themselves together in the shearing sheds of Queensland and they put up a great fight at that time to seek better conditions and a more definitive statement as to their working arrangements. Of course, they were resisted at that time by the graziers and the wool growers of Queensland and elsewhere in Australia. Those fights gave a very clear indication of the basis of the Australian industrial relations systems that later emerged, with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act being implemented in 1904. I think some of those attitudes are now changing and there is a better outlook, both by the shearers in the wool industry and by the graziers and wool growers around Australia, as times change. I recognise the quite historic event that took place at Barcaldine in May 1891, where the basis of our very disadvantaged-in my view-industrial relations system had its roots and beginnings. We are now seeing a dramatic change in attitude: only recently the award was changed to allow for shearing on the weekends, and the wet weather argument has been overcome to allow a more flexible approach. Australia has about 170 million sheep. In this House this week we have heard great arguments about wool marketing, reserve price schemes, and how the Australian wool clip should be marketed. Our wool clip has been the dominant wool export around the world in terms of its quality and its quantity. Australian wool growers have had a view that they could dominate the market. Recent events have proved that they cannot do that, although they do maintain a superior position. Similar attitudes flow on to the merino ram embargo, as the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) has suggested. The simple argument is that we ought to maintain our pre-eminent position of having the best merinos in the world. As the the honourable member said, one can easily pick a fight about the merino embargo argument. I do not agree with him; it is not as simple as he suggests. The emotional arguments that some wool growers put up do not stand up to analysis. The 1987 report on the merino embargo clearly indicates that the arguments do not stand up to a more rational approach The simple argument is that we have the best merinos and we have superior genetic material, but export revenue does not match the amount of wool we might sell. The argument in favour of selling merinos and genetic material around the world is that the key issue in Australia's wool production is the environmental conditions. The ability of merinos to perform in Australia's pastoral zone is well known: it is not so much the breed but the environment. The selling of genetic material will not have a major impact on other flocks around the world. If we do restrain our sale of this material, we upset freer trading attitudes. In the period from 1900 to 1950 there were 600 million to 750 million sheep in the world; Australia has about 170 million at this stage, if these figures rect. The 1987 review clearly canvassed the arguments. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement setting out countries, numbers of sheep and percentage of merinos. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Is leave granted to incorporate the material in Hansard? Leave is granted, subject to the constraint that it is suitable for reproduction in Hansard.",34
27,Mr MCARTHUR,WOOL INDUSTRY,"I will move quickly through the various countries where this argument rages strongly. Russia has 140 million sheep and the table illustrates that 90 million of those sheep are merinos. They broadly operate in the southern regions of Russia. Russia produces about half the amount of wool that Australia produces. The interesting thing is that in Russia for half of the year the sheep are shepherded and for the other half of the year they are housed because of the extreme climatic conditions. So Australia maintains a remarkable competitive advantage compared to the wool industry in Russia. The other important thing is that Russia imports a large amount of Australia's raw wool product and is an important competitor in the auction system. China is the third largest producer of wool in the world. It has 105 million to 110 million sheep. It has a shortage of land. Eighty per cent of its wool is used in the domestic market. China has 1.2 billion consumers and is a very big participant, buying Australian wool in the auction system. In the longer term I do not think the introduction of merinos into its wool industry will make any difference. New Zealand has 67 million sheep which are basically meat-producing animals. Argentina has 26 million; South Africa, 21 million; Uruguay, 22 million; and Spain, 18 million. These competitors in the wool industry are not significant compared to Australia. Quite simply, we should be helping them to improve the quality of their wool. Since 1978 only 2,000 rams have been sold from Australia to these other countries. All the emotional outcry about upsetting the Australian industry, that we are selling our national heritage, are cor- does not stand up to the facts. Finally, the introduction of artificial insemination makes the sale of ram sires overseas almost irrelevant, because the movement of semen across international borders is so easy with modern technology. So with the passage of time this emotional argument will no longer stand up, and I am recommending that we sell merinos reasonably. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable mcmber's time has expired. In the course of the honourable member's speech he sought the inclusion in Hansard of certain material. I have now sighted that material and inform the House that it is suitable for incorporation. Therefore, leave has been granted. The document read as followsWORLD WOOL INDUSTRY, 1986 Wool Prodn.

28,Mr CAMPBELL,WOOL INDUSTRY,"It is a great privilege to speak to this motion by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls). I think he deserves recognition for the interest he has shown in the wool industry, which I know is very deep and very sincere. One can only say that it is a pity that is not going to be reflected in votes from his wool growers in Kennedy, who are what I would call congenital voters. I can only assume that there are many studs in the electorate of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur); I need to give the lie to many of his statements. It is true that this is an emotional argument, but it is very soundly based. Europe is very important to the Australian wool trade. It is in total a bigger market than Japan, although it tends to be fragmented. It is the fashion centre: it is Europe that sets the fashions for the world. When one talks to people in the great woollen mills of Europe-in Biella, in France, in Bradford-they look in amazement at Australia's policy of allowing its genetic material to be sent overseas. In Australian wool we have a premium product. When we look at world sheep numbers it is relevant to look only at those sheep which are for apparel wool production. Australia's wool is not irreplaceable. There are many synthetics that can do the job. The world does not need wool. We are going to have to market it to the world. It is a product that is marketable, fortunately, and if we develop the prestige of wool from certain parts of Australia we are going to be able to market it with great success. I can see expanding markets, but I do not think we do it well when we rely only on the International Wool Secretariat to push wool. Australian wool is significant for a ple of very good reasons. As the honourable member for Kennedy mentioned, style is important. Basically, style is achieved by having wool with a similar micron size throughout. When the Australian Wool Testing Authority tests wool for micron diameter it tests the average; It does it with antiquated 1940s airflow technology, which just gives the average. That can leave a very large tail in any given sample. The new technology developed by Melden Laboratories does much better than that. It takes a sample and counts 2,000 individual strands and gives their exact fibre diameters. It indicates what sort of peak and what sort of tail is in the fibre. When wool is spun it is the coarse hairs that go to the outside, and that is what gives the prickly characteristic to some wool. If the wool is of an equal fibre diameter, this effect can be reduced. The finer wools do not have it at all, of course. It is true that Melden Laboratories technology is now being exported across the world at $40,000 a unit. It is a significant breakthrough for Australia. It is going to help countries overseas go down the path of breeding sheep with consistent fibre diameter. In Australia we have achieved that by 100 years or so of·· specialised breeding. It is simply crazy to throw that away. In the short term the only way that the world can achieve the results that we have is by using Australian genetic material. It stands to reason that the only reason the world is seeking our genetic material is to improve the standard of their wool. If it was not a big issue, if this material was available from elsewhere, why would they be clamouring at the doors of Australia for access to this material? One of the other great advantages that Australia has in relation to fine wool-I am talking not just about fine wool, but about wool up to 23 micron-is the absence of black hair. There is no problem getting fine wool from South America. We can get 17, 18 or 19 micron wool from South America. Characteristically, that wool tends to have about 400 black hairs per kilogram, whereas in Australia it is couabout eight black hairs. The only way in which that will be improved is with Australian genetic material. Even if there are people in Australia who do not understand that, even if the honourable member for Corangamite does not understand that, the fact is that people overseas want that material because they know that it is this technology, this Australian expertise, that will improve their product. Improving their product makes them a world competitor which we are going to have to compete against. That will inevitably have a downward pressure on prices. That is how the free market works. It always surprises me that there are so many people opposite who do not understand the workings of the free market. I want to dwell on two characteristicscharacteristics, incidentally, which are very hard to assess with objective wool measurement, which the Wool Corporation seems intent on ramming down our throats. These characteristics can be improved in the short term only by the use of Australian genetic material. Of course, there is a crying need to protect our industry and of course we should be putting a ban on 'this. Recently, the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union (AWU) in Western Australia, Mr Bruce Wilson, put out a statement calling for the banning of genetic material. He said that in his view it was detrimental to the wool industry and the jobs of his members. It was a pity that he was derided by many people in the agro-political industry who went off on all sorts of tangents and suggested that the AWU was the cause of problems in the industry. It is an absolute nonsense claim. Anyone who looks at this objectively will see that, particularly in Western Australia, the A WU has becn quite receptive to changes. We got the samc sort of attitude from this agro-political industry when it immediately jumpcd in and condemned the appointment of the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who, I believe, will be an excellent Minister. I believe he will bring a freshness of vision to the industry and not be cluttered up with the prejudice- of the ploughboys opposite. If goat hair has an economic advantage for producing wool, it clearly has the same economic advantage for producing mohair and cashmere; cxactly the same conditions apply. When we try to improve our genetic strains by importing material from overseas-for example, from South Africa, China and the United States of America-it is very difficult. These people are very reluctant to let their genetic material come to Australia. While they apparently can see that their interests are not served by passing on this material to Australia, we apparently are blind to what must be blindingly obvious, and is blindingly obvious to people overseas. We arc told that the reason that the Merino Export Review Committee came down in favour of the export of Australian wool was simply that the main advantage Australia has is an economic one-the price of land here and the type of land. In South Africa the same sort of land is to be found. The same sort ofland is in abundance in South America, parts of the United States and even in parts of China. It was suggested by the honourable member for Corangamite that China is short of land. In fact, two-thirds of China's population is situated in one corner of China, in about one-third of the land. The rest of the land is largely semi-arid and certainly very vacant. Having been there, I can attest to that. There is another very important point to be made. The great Australian wool industry is under pressure. It is an industry that needs a morale booster. I believe that the wool industry deserves the sort of assistance that the Government can give it. If it boosts the morale of the wool industry in Australia to know that the Government cares enough to impose a ban on the export of genetic material, it will give the industry some hope and guidance for the future. I believe that alone is wcll worth doing. I certainly commend the motion moved the honourable member for Kennedy. I would hope that it is endorsed. I know that the honourable member for Kennedy will be taking this to our own Caucus seeking Government action on this. In conclusion, I think we ought to disregard the economic nonsense put forward by people who say that it is of no consequence. The facts speak for themselves. Technologically, the arguments are unsurpassable; they cannot be ignored. Nor should the advice of those people who use our wool be ignored. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",38
29,Mr SINCLAIR,WOOL INDUSTRY,"I wish, firstly; to say that I think that this process of being able to discuss a range of subjects in these private members' periods is an excellent one. As a former Leader of the House, I think it is a pity that it was not introduced before. The only difficulty is that I wish to goodness the Government would take some notice of some of the things that are said. Indeed, would that I had the time and the chance to speak on a motion on which you yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker, are about to speak, or have spoken-that is, the motion relating to the future use of the old Parliament House. These are matters which are very important, as indeed is this one on wool. I very strongly suggest that the motion that is to be moved by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) canvasses a matter on which every membcr of this place has a view. I have about 3'h minutes in order to comment upon matters relating to this motion in which I have a long and profound intcrest. Therefore, it will be quite impossible for me to do other than skirmish around some of the periphery. Firstly, I introduced the partial relaxation of the ban on the export of merino genetic material by permitting the partial export of merino rams. I make no apology for it. I strongly endorse that stance and believe it should continue. I know the views strongly held by my constituents, by the constituents of each of the honourable members who have spoken and indeed by wool growers throughout Australia. Many of them believe that what we are doing is prejudicing the capacity for Australian wool growers to compete in the future. I have not accepted that argument. The honourable member Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) referred to the 1987 review. It was an excellent review; it was a dispassionate review. In the comments made today by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), they looked for some detailed scientific material in the review to establish the concern. There is not any. Frankly, the problem that we have is that we do not recognise the inherent quality and capability of the Australian industry. Sure, we have a climatic advantage. The honourable member for Corangamite referred to the comparable production conditions in, for example, the Soviet Union and China-which are the second and third largest merino producers and hence should be seen as principal competitors to Australia-but they certainly do not have conditions which are comparable to ours. South Africa is the only country where there are parallel production conditions, although in the future some parts of South America may well be in that position. At this stage, they are not. In New Zealand there is also an increase in merino produetion, but again the climatic advantage in Australia continues. The advantage argument is not just a matter of eliminating black hairs in sheep; there is a lot more to this debate than that. It is a matter of getting more per square centimetre of wool. We want a softer wool, a cleaner wool and a wool that meets the market. For goodness sake, the whole of this wool debate is about our trying to recognise where the market is. Had I time, I was going to briefly refer to two items in this morning's Australian Financial Review which suggest how fragile the market is. The first is a comment by the agribusiness manager of the Westpac Banking Corporation about projected future difficulties in the cotton industry; the figures of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics show that. The second is some sign of movement in agricultural protection in the European Community. We have to understand that we are working in a very comfor petitive environment. I referred to cotton because it is a competitive fibre. I referred to the European Community because the common agricultural policy has plagued us in trying to get a fair price for the goods we sell. We have to produce well and efficiently what we can produce, and process it to the maximum. As far as I am concerned, the advantage of this partial relaxation of the ban on the export of merino rams is that it helps to keep the parent studs alive. Let everybody in this place and every wool grower understand that the reason I relaxed the ban was, had I not done so, those parent studs, which are subject to exactly the same financial pressures as any individual wool grower, would have largely gone out of business. Those parent studs are the base of all our genetic material. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The time allotted for the debate on this subject has expired.",40
30,Mr SINCLAIR,WOOL INDUSTRY,"Well, how tragic that is, Madam Deputy Speaker. I accept your ruling-Madam. DEPUTY SPEAKER-I agree, but I am Hraid that it has.",41
31,Mr SINCLAIR,WOOL INDUSTRY,"But I can tell you that those parent studs, indeed every wool grower, depends on their survival and they would not survive if it were not for that relaxation. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the ncxt sitting Thursday. The right honourable member for New England will have leave to continuc his speech when the debatc is resumed. I am sure that the right honourable member is vcry interested to hear that. NA NA Mr ANDru:W (Wakefield) (11.31 a.m.) I move: That this House: (1) recognises the disadvantage faced by rural Australian families in accessing tertiary education facilities; (2) calls on the Government to amend the administration of Austudy to help counter this disadvantage; and (3) requests the Government to take immediate action to ensure that the present rural crisis does not deny post secondary students in rural areas access to a tertiary course. My only regret in rising to my feet to move this motion is that I have, in a sense, intruded into the time allotted to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and I, too, was anxious to hear what he had to say about the export of merino material, particularly as it impacts directly on my electorate. That comment having been made, the whole question of education for rural Australians, education in the broadest sense of the word but particularly tertiary education, is a story-a litany, if you like-of deception and inaction by the Government opposite. The deception began when the Government proposed, in the Budget Speech of August 1990, that the assets test allowable for thosc seeking to access Austudy should be reduced from almost $700,000 to $400,000, and that impacted directly on rural land-holders. I do not claim an Opposition monopoly on this, but thanks to the work of Opposition rural members, thanks to the work of rural organisations around Australia, and thanks to the assistance of concerned rural members opposite, the Minister was persuaded not to go ahead with that absurd Budget recommendation. Round one to the Opposition! What then do we find? We find that, in the face of a rural crisis and with the grim reality facing every farmer and every primary producer around Australia, with dramatic falls in income, an assets test continues to apply to Austudy. So every farmer whose assets exceeded $695,000 in net terms was no longer able to access Austudy for his or her children, regardless of the parents' income. While the Government, or at least rural members opposite, were prepared to support the Opposition in endeavouring to have the original terms for assets testing on Austudy reinstated, they have been silent in supporting the Opposition's efforts to try to get access to Austudy for farmers who are currently denied Austudy simply because their assets exceed the assessable limit, even though their income may be negative. Wc do not have to look far in rural Australia to see what this policy is doing to tcrtiary education. Over 4 per cent of children who previously accessed tertiary education and came from a rural base have this year ceased to be involved in tertiary education opportunities. That 4 per cent figure represents 3,200 young Australians who are denied tertiary education because the Government refused to recognise the opportunity it had to review the present restrictions that apply to Austudy. Thcrc has been a genuine effort by the Opposition to assist the Government in this matter. Any Government member must appreciate that it would have been much easier for the Opposition to have exploited this politically sensitive situation, just as the Australian Democrats have done. It would have been far easier for us in the other place to have supported the Democrats when they sought to disallow the regulations which determine the level of the assets test on Austudy, and to have thrown the whole scheme into confusion, but we refused to do so. Our electorates expected us to do so, but we chose not to because we thought it was crazy to throw the schemc into confusion and to do in opposition something we would not have been prepared to do were we the government. Also, it would have been much easier for us to have supported the disallowance motion of Senator Lees which suggested that the asscts test should no longer apply in the Austudy area, but we chose not to. We chose not to because we believe that all forms of assistance should be targeted in some way. We chose not to because we voted for it originally-and so, by the \yay, did the Democrats, who chose conveniently to forget their original support for the assets test-and we chose not to because there was a much simpler way for the Government to aid rural Australians. That much simpler way was for the Government to abide by the Senate motion moved by the Opposition and supported by the Democrats which stated: The Senate calls on the Government to immediately introduce emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from Austudy by the assets test, but whose income has collapsed in the rural crisis, will not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds. That is not an unreasonable request from a responsible Opposition, an Opposition seeking not to embarrass the Government, but it is a request that has produced no reaction at all. All we ask of the Government is that it introduces already existing hardship provisions to the assets test on Austudy. In my electorate, and in the electorates of those such as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), children are being denied a tertiary education not because of the income of their parents but because their parents happen to have an asset which produces nothing at all. In spite of their negative income, they are unable to access Austudy, which would allow them to receive a tertiary education. What does this say for a Government that claims that its call is to have a clever country? Frankly, it intends to deny some of Australia's most entrepreneurial and innovative young people a tertiary education because of the non-productive assets of their parents. It could be rectified tomorrow, as the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has insisted, if the Government were simply prepared to introduce already existing hardship provisions. I could cite case after case to this House. I acknowledge the work done by Mrs Jan Snyed from Booleroo Centre in accumulating cases around South Australia, cases with which the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) ought to be familiar, of people who have been denied the opportunity for tertiary education for their children because of the assets test on Austudy. I refer to one of my constituents whose son happened to be dux of the old school that I attended, as did the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). That son, who wanted to go to Roseworthy College, is this year not at Roseworthy College because his parents cannot afford to send him there, and they cannot access Austudy simply because their assets mean they are no longer eligible. I refer to another constituent, a farm machinery distributor closer to Adelaide, who has had to take his daughter out of tertiary education simply because he cannot afford to keep her there. The assets test denies him Austudy not because of the value of his farm but because he is a farm machinery agent. His assets can come up to only $346,000 before he is denied Austudy. In the present rural climate, his farm machinery agency of course is not allowing him to earn enough money to get his daughter into tertiary education. Peoplc in rural Australia, not only those on the land but also those in industries associated with the land, are adversely affected by this absurd inaction from the Government opposite. I hope that the speaker who follows me will not have that level of barefaced audacity which would allow him to suggest that we should not be pursuing this because the Austudy program is under review. I am well aware of the joint party booklet which recommends changes to Austudy; I et;ldorse it, as does my Party. I am well aware that the Government has said it will put the Austudy program under review and that the Ministcr has appointed a consultant to do so. I support it; I welcome the review and hope we can endorse whatever the review determines ought to be done. But fancy saying to tertiary students, 'You will wait for a review before we decide whether you can access tertiary education', when the opportunity already exists for the Government to offer hardship provisions so that rural students can proceed with their tertiary education and there need not be any real embarrassment to the Government in budgetary terms. How on earth can the Government deny rural Australians a tertiary education simply because a review is in hand? The Government could act immediately to allow the students to access tertiary education, and its failure to do so condemns it. It was Diogenes who said in about 412 BC that the foundation of every statc is the education of its youth. The inaction of those opposite is denying some of Australia's most productive youth the opportunity to have a tertiary education.",42
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL AUSTRALIANS,Mr HoIlis)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Bruce Scott-I second the motion and reserve my right to spcak.,44
33,Mr NEWELL,RURAL AUSTRALIANS,"The motion beforc this House, because it clcarly indulges in some cheap political point-scoring-playing the electorate-contributes absolutely nothing to the great and ongoing debate about education in this country. In fact, the net result of playing to the gallery is the trivialisation of the very issues which honourable members on both sides of this House recognise as basic to the future of this great nation. There can be no doubt that under the present Government access to tertiary education-and in that general area r include both universities and colleges of technical and further education (T AFE)has seen great expansion. The House should recognise and acknowledge that fact. In my first speech to this House, I paid tribute to successive Hawke Governments and particularly to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) for the enormous changes wrought in my electorate of Richmond on the far north coast of New South Wales by the building of the former Northern Rivers College of Advanccd Education, now the University of New England, Northern Rivers. Not only has that university campus provided access to higher education for thousands of students who would, under earlier regimes, have misscd out on it, but the very presence of the University has had a powerful impact on the economy of this city of Lismore and other parts of the region. I raise that example because it is so easy for people to seek to belittle this Government's record for political reasons; but that record of providing access to higher education in my electorate has been repeated over and over again throughout this nation. We should not forget that not everyone wants to study at a university. In my electorate, New South Wales TAFE colleges are being built at Wollongbar; near Lismore, and at Kingscliff, near Tweed Heads, to serve the needs of a rapidly growing population. This Government's record of capital works provision for T AFE-providing the bricks and mortar-so that the access needs of people can be met needs no defence. Further, an often little-heralded initiative of this Government has been to break down the barriers which in the past locked people into dead-end credentials. Now, more and more credit and cross-credentialling between institutions and systems mean that career paths are being created. Of course, I would be the first to acknowledge that more needs to be done. This Government's tremendous achievement of dramatically increasing retention rates to year 12 has meant that pressures for increasing access to tertiary education are greater than ever before. It is true that there is not a large enough bucket of dollars to provide all that we want in bricks and mortar, so the question must be: how can we provide access for people in rural and provincial Australia, given that limitless funds are not available for capital works projects? In my electorate, I have been pressing this very question of provision of higher education access for people living in and around Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads. Of course, we would like to see a campus of the University there, but I think we all recognise that such things do not come easily. To provide access for people seeking higher education who simply cannot afford to relocate, for either financial or family circumstances, dialogue is at present going on between a local committee and the University of New England to provide access to that University's faculties and programs through a distance education program. What may emerge from these negotiations is a 'shop front' university together with on-line faculties and visiting university personnel servicing the needs of groups of students through external and distance education modes. I expect it is possible that other university programs, particularly those on the Gold Coast and at Griffith University in Brisbane, will be made available to the rapidly growing population around Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that last month the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) announced that a broad consortium of higher education institutions will undertake a pilot open learning project aimed at extending access to first year degree units through the use of educational television and independent learning materials. The particular focus of that project be on extending access especially to those in the community who, because of isolation or family or work responsibilities, unable to attend on-campus courses. The project is also intended to provide a taste of higher education through the television programs to people in the community who would not normally consider enrolling in a higher education institution. A small range of first year degree units in fields such as Australian studies, business, psychology, science and computing will be offered on a national basis via television and supplementary independent learning materials. Students will be able to participate in the project in one of three ways: watching the television programs only to get a taste of higher education; purchasing additional material to study in more depth; and going one step further to sit for a challenge examination in order to gain recognition and credit for the study undertaken. The project will be implemented on open learning principles. There will be no entry requirements or enrolment procedures, nor will there be any requirement for regular assignments and assessment. Students will not have to pay the higher education contribution charge. Independent learning materials and the challenge examination will be available presence, on a cost recovery basis. I draw the attention of the House to these developments simply to illustrate the clear point that this Government takes access to tertiary education seriously and has done, and is doing, something about it. I think the Government has its priorities right. I do not believe that Opposition members, when in government,did nearly as well in directing resources where they were needed in tertiary education. It was reported to me that a former Minister for Education on the other side of the House confided to the New South Wales Teachers Federation Lecturers Association, during the time of the first razor gang, that while he admitted there was a crisis of funds on university campuses, it was difficult to get relief in the coalition Cabinet for the situation. He put it this way: 'When I go into Cabinet to argue for more will funds for education, someone else wants to buy a new aircraft carrier.' I want to set the motion before the are House against that background. In so far as it refers to Austudy, it should be recognised that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has already announced a review of the scheme by independent consultants. There is no doubt that some issues to do with the targeting of Austudy need to be examined. The Government is spending $1.29 billion on student support in 1991, including $1.17 billion on Austudy, which is morc than three times as much as the previous Liberal Government spent. A total of 409,200 beneficiaries are receiving Austudy this year, which is a 25 per cent increase on last year; almost 61 per ccnt are receiving the maximum payment. As honourable members may know, Austudy is targeted to assist disadvantaged students who are 16 years of age and older. Since Austudy was introduccd in 1987, ycar 12 retention rates have increased from 53 per ccnt to 64 per cent in 1990. In rclation to pcople on the land, who are spccifically rcferred to in the motion, thcre is an assets cut-off double the normal assets cut-off point; it is $695,000 instead of $347,500. The report on student financial assistance, which was before the House earlicr and to which the previous speaker referrcd, made some 28 recommendations on which the Government will act and report to the House. Twenty-eight recommendations werc made to the Government, and they included the following: the personal income level should be increased to $8,000 from the present $4,000; the age criterion for an independent rate status should be reduced progressively from 25 years to 21 years over the next four Budgets; the value of fringe benefits should be included as income to ensure an equitable distribution of the resources of Austudy funds; tax deductions derived from negatively geared properties, superannuation and prior year losses should be excluded; and the family income threshold should be increased to 75 per cent of male averagc weekly earnings before benefits are rcduced. The report also recommended that cligibility for Austudy cease at the level of twice the average weekly earnings, which was $56,000 in 1990. Presently a family with five children can earn some $112,000 before the benefits cease. While we are talking about improvements, let us not forget that between 1989 and 1993 an additional 70,000 tertiary places were funded by the Government. In comments made by some members of the coalition, much has been made of the fact that there are still students missing out on places in educational institutions. Whilst I cannot deny that fact, it is also a fact that the Opposition tends to go for the survival of the fittest when it comes to education and business, and I am not convinced that it is serious when it decries those facts, because it never did anything about the matter when it was in government. The Opposition never pronounced the figures that were available on students who were missing out on educational institutions, especially over the last 20 or 30 years. It is only in 1991 that it has become an election issue and something that the coalition has taken on board as a matter it is serious about. I think the fact that the coalition has only recently started pushing those figures means that it is not serious about that fact.",44
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL AUSTRALIANS,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,46
35,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RURAL AUSTRALIANS,"The silence from the Government during the 10 minutes the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) spoke on this motion gives me no pleasure at all. He has absolutely no idea of what he is talking about, and little compassion for people in rural Australia. He comes from a rural electorate and I am absolutely surprised at his contribution. I am very happy, proud and pleased to support the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in his motion before the House today. I listened to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) earlier when he spoke about the export of marine rams. He said we must look again at that. I say we must look again, and very urgently, at the very real crisis facing rural Australia. I am very disappointed that we have only 30 minutes for this very important debate, a debate which I believe will bring some relief to people in rural Australia. The honourable member for Richmond mentioned the report on student financial assistance by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. We cannot wait for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to respond to that report. The crisis is out there right now. For the honourable membcr for Richmond to waffle on about what is in that report, saying that that will save some of these children from being denied an education, is quite wrong. Obviously he is not in touch with the people out there in rural and remote Australia. The coalition moved a motion on this matter in the Senate, a motion which now has the support of the Senate. We need to get the present motion passed in this House and get the Minister activated so that we can see some relief for the many children who will otherwise be denied an education. Why do we need emergency assistance to be introduced as a matter of urgency? We need it because children are being denied a further education. Why is that? It is because in many cases, although the parents may have assets, they have a negative income. Assets are not always a clear indication of the ability of people to educate and support their children. Already we know from the many studies done in the last seven or eight years that students from rural and remote Australia are twice as unlikely to enter higher education as those from an urban background. Those students are disadvantaged by their geographic location and, of course, in the seven or eight years they have been disadvantaged by this Government's economic policy. We have an inequitable assets test. People who have a $900,000 asset with a $200,000 loan against it-in other words, net assets of $700,000-can be much better off than people with twice that level of assets, but they become ineligible for assistance because the asset cannot generate income. The family home is exempt. A home on the coast in the electorate of Richmond, in northern New South Wales, could be exempt. People may borrow against that family residence in the same way they may borrow against a rural property or a small business in rural and remote Australia, yet most of these people have borrowed to the hilt now. The figures published earlier this year support that. The average debt of Australian farmers five months ago was a quarter of a million dollars; 75 per cent of farmers in Australia have debts exceeding $250,000. Such people have already borrowed to the limit. They have been through five to seven years of high interest rates-in excess of 20 per cent-and not only are they battling to survive this year, but also they want to give their children the best possible education. This Government talks of social justice. There is one thing that it could do right now: immediately bring in provisions to assist children who are being denied a further education. I know we are coming back in the middle of this month and I challenge the Minister to bring in legislation at that sitting to ensure that before we rise for the winter recess we have implemented provisions so that affected children can continue in education this year. I challenge the Minister to do that. If he thinks more of his northern hemisphere summer holiday this year than he thinks of children in rural, remote Australia, he stands condemned. That is the challenge I issue, and I hope he acts on it in the interests of-",46
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL AUSTRALIANS,Mr HolIis)last Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,47
37,Mr SAWFORD,RURAL AUSTRALIANS,"I have a great deal of time for the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and I respect his views when he genuinely represents his rural constituency. This is especially so in the current rural crisis so largely exacerbated by international trade problems. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), with whom I can more closely identify-with respect to the honourable member for Wakefield-also is a very effective and genuine member for a rural constituency. However, I must say that, when anyone on the other side of the House talks about education, access and equity, it is really done, with a couple of notable exceptions, with the head down, the eyes away from the direct gaze and the tongue firmly planted in the cheek. To give a bit of history, during the 1950s and 1960s, especially when we saw the raw beginnings of the development of the now clever countries of West Germany and Japan, the Liberal Party of Australia and what was the Country Party in those days did zilch for education. In the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s, about 24 per cent of people in the electorate of the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), had access to a university. In seats such as Port Adelaide, the figure was less than 4 per cent. The Opposition should not come into this House and talk of access and equity and expect people on this side to believe it. Retention rates for year 12 wcre basically ignored. The retention rate in 1969, I think, was an appalling 25 per cent. Fourteen years later, in 1983, the percentage increased to a miserly 35 per cent. The rest of the world at this time was running away from us. The still cmerging tigers of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea did not even make a dent in the intellect of those in former coalition governments. In 1983, just eight years ago, they remained in the educational void, still believing that unskilled and semi-skilled labour, and the quarry mentality on agriculture and mining, was tenable. Even then the Opposition failed to recognise that the greatest resource was the investment in human capital-that is, in what is betwecn the ears. In all honesty, I say to the honourable member for Wakefield that I am yet to be convinced that the 1950s and 1960s mentality and attitude to education has changed very much on his side of the House. If they are in the process of change, I would be delighted. Before addressing the three parts of the motion of the honourable member for Wakefield, I remind him of a situation in his own State of South Australia from 1979 to 1982 which would make both of us squirm. The State Liberal Tonkin Government scorched an extremely conservative teaching profession, and for the first time in South Australia the teachers went on strike. That was mainly the reason the Tonkin Government lasted only one term. It exhibited a lack of resolve in and commitment to education at any level and in any constituency, especially the rural constituency, which I am sure the honourable member for Wakefield will remember. I have no great argument with what the honourable member proposes. I only wish I could be confident that his positive views on education were shared by those on the front bench. An examination of the current status of student financial assistance is timely. When we analyse outcomes in education achieved by this Government, they are impressive indeed. To be sure, improvements still need to be made, but the important point is that substantive improvements are being attained. Austudy is a $1 billion program; it will assist over 400,000 students this year. In fact, the number of secondary student recipients has trebled since 1983 whilst the number of tertiary students has increased by 56 per cent. Corresponding with the jntroduction of Austudy in 1987, year 12 retention rates increased from 48 to over 57 per cent. As the honourable member for Wakefield will acknowledge, those retention rates are now well over 65 per cent. Unlike the situation when those opposite were in government, improvements under this Government are easy to quantify. Over 160,000 students are assisted by Austudy at the tertiary level, which represents an increase of 16 per cent. When we talk about adult secondary students, it is ovcr 44 per cent.",47

40,Mr SCHOLES,TEMPORARY PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I move: . That this House: (1) expresses concern that three years after the Parliament ceased to meet in the temporary Parliament House, no detailed proposals for the future of that building have been presented to the Parliament for its consideration; (2) draws attention to the facts that (a) the Parliament of Australia met in the temporary Parliament House from 1927-1988, a period of 61 years, (b) the building is one of the most significant in Australian history and (c) that the intention to vacate the building was announced 10 years before it was vacated; and (3) therefore calls for: (a) an immediate report to be made on the nature and status of the proposals heing considered for the future of the temporary Parliament House; and (b) an explanation why, on the third anniversary of the Parliament's departure from the temporary Parliament House, no decisions have yet been made on its future. It is with some regret that I move this motion. It is now 12 or 13 years since the announcement by the then Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, that the Parliament would move to this building in 1988. It is three years since that task commenced and the move to this building became a reality. To my knowledge, nothing has been announced and certainly nothing has been approved by this House-which is a requirement of the Parliament Act-about the future of the temporary Parliament House that this Parliament occupied and operated in for 61 years. In many respects the building is an important part of the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. The building was an exercise in Parliament acting in a way which it felt best suited its needs. In 1923, plans for the permanent Parliament House were rejected by the Public Works Committee of the Parliament-of which you now happen to be Chairman, Mr Deputy Speaker-and a temporary building was erected until the Parliament could resolve its problems with the design of a permanent Parliament House. It took about 50 years to resolve those problems and to pluck up the courage to carry out that project. The old Parliament House was a feature of Australian life. It was probably known to everyone as the wedding cake or the great white building. It was altered, amended, manipulated and in every way changed to try to make a temporary building that was never designed for the purpose meet the requirements of a parliament that was growing physically and in its national responsibilities. Menzies, Curtin, Chifley and Whitlam served out their entire parliamentary careers, which were all fairly long, in that building. Its place in Australia's history is beyond doubt. Whilst it is recognised in paper form, the building itself is wasting. It is unoccupied, and an unoccupied building deteriorates. The first reports I know of dealing with the future of that building were called for some six years ago. I would have expected those reports to have been presented to the Government at least three and probably four years ago. Those reports have not been finalised nor have plans been announced. It is almost the conventional wisdom that the building will be a museum, but I see no approval or announcement of that process in a tangible form that has been approved by either House of this Parliament; alterations to the building do have to be approved. A considerable amount of expenditure is involved and some serious decisions have to be made. Do we accept the original National Capital Development Commission proposal that the major part of the additions of 1964 and beyond be removed and the building returned to a condition that represents the 1927 House? Do we leave the building as it is? At least it would be an example of the manner in which permanent additions to a building were made on a temporary cost-cutting basis without any real consideration for the way in which they were to function; that was the norm. I doubt whether the public servants who designed some of those alterations would have been prepared to work in them, but they wcre good enough for politicians. Seriously, the decisions should have been made and announced and the program for the use of that building, for whatever purpose is determined, should have commenced by now. I make no apologies for moving a motion of this nature at this time. Almost 13 years have elapsed since it was decided-although not necessarily accepted by everyone-that we would move. Three years have elapsed since we actually moved: there is no question of that fact. There has been ample time to come up with a program of proposals for the future of the temporary Parliament House, the first Parliament House that was occupied in Canberra. This is a matter that concerns me. I played out a fair amount of my parliamentary career in that building, including a short period as Speaker. I understand the difficulties the building caused for people and the problems with which some people worked. But I also understand that a lot of our history was played out in that building, a lot of the dramatic events of the past. I believe that nowhere in the world would a government or a parliament be as tardy as we have been in ensuring the future of one of the most important single entities in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia-short as it is. The proper decisions should be made and the actions commenced. If the building is left vacant for much longer-it is not the best building that was ever built and it always had structural problems-and temporary patching up goes on while decisions are made, it will deteriorate to an extent where the cost of using it for any useful purpose will have accelerated to probably unacceptable levels. It was good enough to house the Parliament for 60 years; it is good enough for the Parliament and the Government of Australia to recognise that and to act now. I have already mentioned the history of the building and the time we have had to make a decision in this Parliament. I believe that a decision should be made and announced now and that this Parliament should consider that decision. I ask the Government to bring forward quickly its recommendations for the future of the temporary Parliament House, the original Australian Parliament House, so that the farce that is now developing does not continue.",49
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TEMPORARY PARLIAMENT HOUSE,Mr Hollis)Is the motion seconded?  and reserve my right to speak later.,50
42,Mr DOBIE,TEMPORARY PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I congratulate the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) on having had the wit to raise this matter on the third anniversary of moving into this House. I suppose that 9 May is certainly the most famous of dates in the history of the Federal Parliament. Though I may not agree with him on some points about what the old Parliament House building should be used for, I do say that it is time for this matter to be raised again. There are many aspects of the old Parliament House which should be considered. I will not go through the history because we are all aware of it and the previous speaker has spoken about it very well. What I am concerned about is the use to which it is going to be put. The one thing that we have to understand is that the provisional Parliament House has been altered so much that to have it as a purely historical, heritage type building is wrong. So much of the facade and so much of the building would have to be demolished to bring it back to the pre-air conditioned days of buildings that to come back to the original 1927 building would be a nonsense. The nonsense would be that it would not be available for any practical use whatsoever. One is reminded of what the Americans did in Washington when they were redoing the White House immediately after World War II. They in fact gutted the White House and had the American President move over the road to Blair House, where he remained for some years while the White House was completely and utterly redesigned and rebuilt to fit modern conditions-air-conditioning and facilities for the practical purposes of new government. Therefore, when one looks at the old building, the provisional Parliament House, one has to be mindful of that as well. What is going to be pulled down? What should be demolished and what should not be demolished? I disagree with my friend the honourable member for Corio on this basic point. I do not think that a decision should be made at this time, but I think that a very concrete move should be made to investigate what the building can be used for. I guess that I led the battle in the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House, for example, to bring the old Speaker's chair to this Parliament. I also led the battle-and we succeeded to a great degree-to get a lot of the 1927 furniture, which is scattered around in government departments all over the place. Mr John Bellchambers was put in charge of a small committee whose job it was to discover and to keep and to catalogue this old furniture. In my own office in this Parliament, we have managed to get one of the leadlight bookcases, which will be part of the collection when it is put together for some use. I made my first speech in the House on the Speaker's chair in 1985, at which stage the Joint Committee, of which I had been a member since 1983 and on which I had campaigned for the old chair coming up, had in fact decided, along with the architects and the designers, that the old chair should come into this chamber. I am still of that very :firm view, and I am delighted to be able to say that in subsequent years all members of the coalition were in favour of moving the chair up here. In fact, I am leading a committee that is looking at this very point at this time. The sad scene was that party politics raised its head on this issue. On 6 October, we had a full-blown debate, of which I was not able to be part, being away, in which the decision was changed by Madam Speaker of the day. I am not concentrating on the chair but am merely pointing out, in the spirit of the honourable member for Corio, that people were busy talking about the politics of the building instead of looking at maintaining some of the heritage buildings in Australia. For a long time, it was the preferred wisdom that this old building should be used as a convention centre. That is what one heard all around the old place when it was being discussed. That was a nonsense. It would not have been practical to do that and, besides, decisions were made to go ahead with the present and successful convention centre down in Civic. So that suggestion was ruled out. The second thing that got a lot of discussion was its use as a constitutional museum, and this was raised during the debate on what should happen to the chair. I had bcen lucky enough to serve on the Arts Advisory Committee since 1983. James Mollison. that fellow who did such marvellous· work with our National Gallery and did so much to educate the Australian public about the need for artistic expression and the housing of it, came up with the idea at one of our meetings in about 1984 that the old building should be a national portrait gallery. This is what I still strongly believe it should be. We have hundreds of portraits which cannot be shown in this building. We havc hundreds of portraits of historical personalities all over Australia, with no placc for them to be housed or shown. We have no place in Australia for a political cartoonists gallery. In the very brief timc that I have had to make this speech and prepare for it, I have raised the issuc of the National Portrait Gallery in London serving as an example. Some of us have been fortunate enough to visit that gallery on a regular basis over the past 20 years. Its use of circulating exhibitions and the use of paintings, prints and photography represent a current historical expression of varying times of modern British experience in history, as well as going back to the days of Elizabeth I. We obviously will not be going back that far. However, I believe for the old Parliament House to be a national portrait gallery within the Parliamentary Triangle would be an appropriate use of the building. It would be useful. It would require an absolute minimum of expense. It would not result in the building becoming just a museum, just a dead place. In fact, one of the interest, ing things is that the only room in the provisional Parliament House that was still original, before we came here, was the Senate Government members party room. It is as it was created and designed in 1927. It is the only place in the building that has not changed. I do not know what has happened to it now. I hope to heavens that we do not see the nonsense happening to the provisional Parliament House that we saw at the Hotel Canberra, where we had parliamentary committees all over the place and a history of Canberra was let go to a very large extent. I hope that the provisional Parliament House is not kept as just a blob on the face of Canberra and the parliamentary area, that it can be used for something to show to Australians that we do have a history. What on earth can we make of constitutional museum? What on earth would it be? Are we going to keep the chamber as we saw it as we left going to take it back to what it was like when 1 was first elected in 1966, or what it was like for the people who came in 1949? They are the times when the chamfor ber was changed. I think that we would be far better making that building a national portrait museum to fit into the mood and to honnorth. our all of those people who contributed so much to the development of parliabers. mentary government in Australia and also did so much for the development the Australian nation via its six colonies. I strongly suggest we have this, and I commend again the honourable member for Corio for having brought this imporqualities tant issue before the Parliament, not for immediate decision but to bring about some situation in which it is looked intelligently and with a great sense of gency.  (12.20 p.m.)-I am pleased to second the motion, as I did earlier, in respect of the the design of use of the old Parliament House, which calls for a report to be made to this Parliament as quickly as possible on the steps that can be taken to put it to further and to prevent the deterioration that occurring in the building. There are few structures in this country that relate to Federation. The old Parliament House is one of those structures. It is there as a symbol of the nation Australia. It is not a state building, it is not some structure that preceded Federation that has been put to use by the Commonwealth of Australia; it is one of the few buildings that symbolises the nation Australia and what we are about. Personally I prefer the old building to the new building. Whilst the old building was crowded and cramped and the ventilation was different from the ventilation that is here, it had about it a means of access and a closeness in the movement and workings of the Parliament that does not exist in this building. This is a large, sprawling, expensive, inefficient building. a One has only to look at the provisions in the Budget for the parliamentary departments to get some idea of the cost of or are we operating this building. Worse than that, this building has isolated members of the Parliament. At the in end of a division each member heads off a different point of the compassmembers of the House of Representatives to the east, senators to the west, Cabinet Ministers to the south and visitors to the There is no central point of exchange or mixing or mingling of memThere is not the access for who backbenchers to Ministers, members of of the Government and leaders of the Opposition that was available in the old building. Be it sentiment or whatever, the old building had many values and many that this building does not have. One might ask: who designed the old building? No-one is accredited with the at design of the old building. It was deursigned, as I understand it, by the then Department of Public Works which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would have considinterest in. The Joint Standing Committee on Public Works took part in the old building. Within that building is enshrined the history of this nation, the crises of World use War II, the problems of the Depression, is the crises in changes of government down through the decades. I do not think that another temporary building has been built in this country that has served so well and so long as permanent housing. The temporary building was in use for 61 years. Today it is still in considerable mand by people who want to inspect it. There are provisions for access to it by community groups for commercial uses. We moved the motion this morning to stress that the building is stagnating and deteriorating. We want a decision as quickly as possible. on the restoration of the building and we want it put back into active use. r have listened to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). Personally I would like to see the building brought back, wherever practicable, to the original design of 1927. It opened service in 1927. That may not be possible in some parts of the wings due to ventilation systems and access. r recommend that members of the public and members of both chambers look at the paintings of the opening of the original building that have hung in the halls of the old Parliament for so long. There is a balance in that building that is not in the building as modified in later years. The building needs to be brought back into use. r have talked to thousands of school children who have visited this building and the old building in its closing stages. I asked them what they thought ought to be done with the old building. I asked: should we tear it down? Occasionally I got an answer. They said, 'Yes, we could put up a hotel or a motel'. Generally the response from all the youth to whom I have spoken about the old building is that they want the building preserved and put to use. The displays, the exhibits, the constitutional development of this nation and the actions of the Parliament over the years are legislative history. It can house and exhibit the growth of Australia as a t1cdgling nation of 1923 to 1927 through to the strong, vibrant and much more diversified and outward looking nation that Australia is today. I very strongly support the motion moved by the honourable member for Corio. I urge the Government to bring forward a report to the Parliament as quickly as possible on what action de- can be taken to put the building back into good repair and to more active public usc.",50
43,Mrs SULLJVAN,TEMPORARY PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Unlike the honourable member for  going to canvass the issue of whether I prefer this building or the old one. My time is short and it is therefore very difficult to cover all the issues on such an important subject. It is a great pity that we are not going to vote on this matter today, because members have views they wish to express. I want to put forward some of my views on the matter. It seems that the malady that affected the body politic and prevented us from getting a permanent Parliament House until 88 years after Federation is now afflicting the Government in terms of what we do with the old provisional Parliament House. I joined the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House 10 years ago, for my sins, and even back then, in 1981, that Committee debated what would happen with what was then the present Parliament House. My involvement in the subject goes back further. I was elected to this Parliament, to the other place, 17 years ago. It was during the term of the second Whitlam Government, the first in which I participated, that I actually got to vote on whether the new Parliament House would be built on either Camp Hill or Capital Hill. There was a private members' vote. I remember saying to someone at the time that I felt very privileged that I got to vote on the matter during my parliamentary career because not every member of parliament who had been around in the previous 73 years had voted on it-though many of them had. It was a subject that had been debated for years, and many people had voted on whether it should be on one site or another. I thought that this was just another vote, but I have lived to be a member of the Parliament that occupies the new building. I recall someone saying to me at the time, 'Don't worry whether the decision is for Capital Hill or Camp Hill because it will never happen'. In other words, we never were going to move into a new Parliament House-but we have. I mention that because the principal reason people had for voting for Capital Hill versus what was considered to be Burley Griffin's preferred resolution, Camp Hill, was that if we had built this building on Camp Hill, which was behind the old Parliament House, it would have been necessary to pull down that building. By the time the final decision was made about where this building was going to be, there was enough feeling that the provisional Parliament House, which we now call the old Parliament House, should remain; it should not be demolished. It was built only as a temporary building, a temporary solution. As so many years had gone by, it was felt that so much history existed in it that it ought to be kept. The malady that had stopped decisions being taken on actually constructing the new Parliament House had given the provisional Parliament House some national significance. I am the fourth speaker to speak on this matter today. All members of parliament have thoughts on what could be done with the old Parliament House. I, along with every member of this Parliament, am frequently asked by constituents and others: what is happening about the old Parliament House? Mr Deputy Speaker, I see that you nod your head. This is a matter that people in the community care about and there is a curiosity. Rude as the Australian people may have been about it whilst it was occupied by Parliament-they called it 'the wedding cake' and 'that place on the hill', which the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) mentioned in his speechnevertheless there is a feeling amongst them that events that mattered to them happened in that building, and it is therefore a building that matters. I suggest that we follow a procedure not dissimilar to the one that was followed when this Parliament House was designed. I suggest that all members should be asked for their views on what might happen. Perhaps members of the public could be asked to put in submissions on their views. We might then draw up some guidelines on a project relative to that Parliament House and, as we did with the new Parliament House, we may decide to have a national competition on just how that is to be handled within the existing physical limitations of that building. We should get a real public involvement in it because it is a public issue and there is a keen public interest in it. I think that we should acknowledge that in relation to this very important public building.",53
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TEMPORARY PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Disability Services",54
45,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve today for my fellow Australians with disabilities. I grieve for those who are endeavouring to provide services for those people with disabilities; I grieve for the many volunteers who work for the homeless and the disabled; and I grieve for the parents of those children with disabilities who worry about what will become of their children when they, their parents, are no longer alive. This Labor Government and particularly the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) speak a lot about social justice. In fact, they speak as if they are the sole advocates for it, the only protagonists for it, and even the owners of social justice. Back in May 1988, the Minister told the House: What social justice is about is allowing people, regardless of their circumstances or background, the opportunity to participate fully in the life of their community. It is about fairness and equity, obligations and rights; it is not simply about notions of welfare. So let us look a little closer at the so called social justice policy of the Australian Labor Party. Is it social justice to deny the Parliament and the parliamentarians a general debate on disabilities? Yet that is exactly what this Minister and this Labor Government have done by not allowing a debate on our proposed amendments to the Disability Services Act or on our notice of motion. The Minister and his Department have made it clear outside the Parliament that all existing sheltered workshops, regardless of the excellence of their consumer outcomes, must re-profile if continuing government support is to be expected after 30 June 1992. The Government insists that people with disabilities must be integrated into the open workplace. This is regardless of whether they wish to be placed in open employment and regardless of the fact that, in this government induced recession with unemployment rising weekly, they will almost certainly not be the first in line for the jobs which are available. If this Government proceeds on this course to close sheltered workshops by next June, it will be denying many people with disabilities the right to work, the right to training, the right to gaining living skills; and it will be sentencing them to an existence of boredom and frustration at home with the consequent stresses on their families and carers. Is this social justice? The Government is currently trying to rush through the Parliament an important package of disability reforms-reforms that could affect the lives of all people with disabilities. This reform package was foreshadowed nine months ago in the 1990 Budget, yet was only presented to the Parliament last Friday and rushed through this House under guillotine. There has been no time for discussions or consultation. This Government and the Minister for Community Services and Health, who proudly foreshadowed these initiatives in August last year, have denied the basic right of consultation. There is no social justiCe in a denial of free speech or consultation. This Labor Government has an ambitious disability services program, one that received all-party support back in 1986. But the interpretation and implementation of the Act governing its policies and services is inflexible, and the attitude of the bureaucrats who enforce it is intransigent. Also, there is insufficient money to implement the Act according to its principles and objectives. The result is that, while some people are getting a Rolls Royce service, many others are missing out. Is this social justice? Is it fair or equitable? Of course it is not. The Minister for Community Services and Health now has key responsibility, along with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), for the rationalisation of Commonwealth-State financial arrangements. We understand that at the next Special Premiers Conference, postponed to 10 July because of the inability of the Cabinet to reach agreement on many issues, the devolution of some disability services to the States will get the final stamp of approval. The Commonwealth will retain responsibility for employment services, the rationale being that they dovetail with its broader responsibilities in the incomesecurity labour market area. Behind this logical rationale, of course, is the reality of the growing numbers of people on invalid pensions and unemployment benefits and the Commonwealth major objective of cutting these numbers and reducing social security outlays. When there are no jobs for people to go to after training and re-skilling, is this social justice? The Minister has also implied that the disability services devolution process has the support of the community. This is something of a distortion of the truth. Although the Government claimed to have undertaken consultation with a range of consumers and their respective organisations before the release of the working party report of the Council of Social Welfare Ministers on devolution of the disabilities services program in November, many organisations and individuals in the disability field saw no evidence of this consultation. Certainly, there was no meaningful consultation. Is this the Minister's interpretation of social justice? There is growing unease in the disability sector as people have studied the draft Commonwealth-State disability agreement. It is clear that State governments have the opportunity to put a whole new set of priorities on disability service provisions and reallocate resources to other generic services. The Government is changing the rules, again without consultation. Is this social justice? Social justice is also about meaningful consultation, not only with the community but also across ministries and departments, taking into account opinions, needs and concerns. It would appear from recent inconsistencies in thinking between the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of Social Security that Labor Government Ministers do not even consult amongst themselves. In addition to talking to the States on devolution, the interests of all would be better served if Ministers and departments talked with each other. There is evidence of a massive breakdown in communication and coordination across these areas. I pointed out when we were debating the Social Security (Job Search and Newstart) Amendment Bill last month that, on the one hand, the Minister for Community Services and Health was stating that jobs were universally available to people with disabilities whilst denying these people access to jobs in the Public Service and within his own Department and, on the other hand, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) was making provision for a huge influx of able unemployed because the jobs were just not available. Another instance of lack of consultation between the two Ministers and their departments was apparent in the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill. There appears to be some confusion between the two departments as to whether an intellectual disability is a medical condition. There is yet another matter of concern which is very current and on which, once again, the Government seems to have set its own agenda without sufficient or meaningful consultation with consumers, carers or service providers. This comes under the grand title of 'consumer focused funding approach' and already the Minister has approved of its introduction from 1 July 1991 for all new accommodation support and supported employment services with a plan to move existing services over by 1993. The Opposition questions whether this is not a voucher system by another name-a system that the Government has been fond of criticising when it has been canvassed by others but, in its own de facto way, intends to adopt with this funding approach. Concerns coming through to us indicate that the Government will be the assessing authority-without any knowledge of whether a medical or other model will be used-the funding authority, the monitoring authority and the provider of vouchers for these services. It would certainly appear that this system is about bureaucratic empowerment rather than consumer empowerment-and that is what social justice is about. We feel it is being introduced at this time to take people's minds off the impending transition date of June 1992, devolution and the myriad of other problems created by this and other Labor governments around the country. It is just another red herring. Social justice is about bipartisanship on issues affecting the disadvantaged and the frail aged in our society on issues that matter to people. For almost three years I have demonstrated that I would have liked the Government and the Opposition to have worked together in a bipartisan manner on these issues. But there has been no cooperation, no information supplied and no consultation. It would seem that the Government wants to use disability services and aged care for some other agenda for its own advantage, not for the benefit of those Australians suffering a real disadvantage because of their disability. The coalition of the Liberal and National parties has demonstrated its desire for social justice for these people. We have a concern for all those for whom governments have a responsibility in the provision of human services-the aged, the homeless, the unemployed, as well as people with disabilities. We have demonstrated this by stating our policy on disability services in the form of amendments to the Disability Services Act where we propose to bring the service-type guidelines before the liament, to make contracts secure and to apply an appeals mechanism. We have demonstrated this by attending meetings of workers, volunteers, people with disabilities and parents. By this means, the coalition has observed at first-hand the problems they have. We have demonstrated this by giving notice of a motion on 14 February 1991, which is as yet undebated. We want to work actively not only in addressing current problems but also by looking ahead and reassessing the needs of people with disabilities and their families to the year 2000.",54
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Corporate Child-care Centres,57
47,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Prospect) (12.40 p.m.)Child-care services are of great importance in my electorate, as they are in the majority of electorates in Australia With an increase in the number of parents returning to the paid work force, the need for child-care and family services support is fast becoming a necessity to many people. My grievance today is that there is not one corporate child-care centre within my electorate, not through lack of trying or lack of interest, rather through lack of financial commitment from local employers. Fairfield City Council has been trying to establish a corporate child-care centre in Yen nora, a suburb within my electorate, and it has been an uphill battle. The Fairfield local government area has a relatively young population of 40,274, or more than a quarter of all residents under the age of 14 years, and the 1986 census showed that a further 17.8 per cen were young people aged between J 5 and 24 years. Although these statistics prove that there is a need for corporate childcare services within the area, employers have not as yet come to the party on behalf of their staff. A meeting is being held tomorrow between the Fairfield City Council, the State Family and Community Services Department (F ACS) and interested employers to discuss commitment Parto the Yennora corporate child-care project. I urge those employers who will be attending that meeting tomorrow to not just consider their present situation, but to look to the future and to study the demographics of the local area in which there are hundreds of young families struggling to keep two jobs and have their kids cared for at the same time. For many this is physically impossible, unless they pay high fees to private child-care centres, which are already overcrowded. Child-care has become a major issue which will continue to require attention so as to best meet the needs of families, employers and the children being cared for. The increased demand for child-care has partly been a result of an increase in the labour force of women, particularly married women, who have been the star performers in the labour market in the last dccade. In the last 10 years, overall today. numbers of women workers have increased by 36 per cent, and the participation rate went up by six percentage points. The numbers of married women in the work force has now increased by some 40 per cent, with the participation rate jumping by nine percentage points, from 42 per cent to 51 per cent. The highest rates of growth in both labour force participation and numbers employed have been in respect of married women with children under school age. In 1988, 45 per cent of married women with children aged four years or under were in the labour force. This is particularly true of women within my Prospect electorate, many of whom must work and find suitable care for their children during working hours or t [ace giving up their jobs. It is for this reason that the provision of affordable and quality child-care is crucial to enable women's full participation in society to occur. To help work towards this goal, it was this Labor Government that introduced the industry initiative, a scheme designed to encourage private sector employers to provide child-care services on a non-profit basis for their employees. It is estimated that over the next few ycars around 28,000 new child-care places will be created in the commercial employer sector, as a result of extending fee relief to lower middle income families using these services. By providing child-care for employees, a company can reap substantial benefits and certainly improve its public image. One of these benefits would be that companies could reduce labour turnover, ensuring a more stable work force, and therefore substantially reducing labour costs. North American companies, for example, estimate that the cost of replacing appropriately skilled staff is 20 per cent of the annual salary cost. Companies providing child-care have experienced an average of 57 per cent reduction in labour turnover. Another benefit of work based childcare is that it docs relieve pressure on families by giving parents confidence that their children arc nearby and are well cared for during working hours. Contributions made by employers towards the operating eosts of child-care centres are rcgarded as normal business expenses and are fully tax deductible. Deductions are also allowed for depreciation on capital items, including buildings and equipment, at rates specified in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 47 (8) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act enables employers to secure priority of access in centres under the children's services program and to have these payments exempt from the fringe benefits tax (FBT). To encourage the expansion of employer sponsored child-care, the Government has enabled employcr paymentsto secure priority of access in private child-care centres-to be exempt from FBT, as of January this year. Another bonus for employer sponsored child-care centres is that for the first time these centres will have access to training and management support activities which will help to achieve consistent quality across these services. A recent report entitled Corporate ChildCare: Management's View has found that Australian industry is beginning to change its attitude towards employer sponsored child-care, with 45 per cent of private sector companies now supporting it. Commissioned by the Department of Employment, Education and Training's Women's Bureau, the report found that plans to introduce child-care arrangements were not confined to companies with high numbers of female employees, suggesting that companies no longer regard child-care as purely a women's issue. According to the report, although one per cent of companies actually operate child-care schemes, 26 per cent are currently investigating child-care and a further 19 per cent support the idea in principle. Obviously child-care is high on the agenda of employers who are thinking of the future. Again, I urge those employers in Yennora and the surrounding areas to consider the future when contemplating commitment to a corporate child-care centre. Industry now recognises that, if it is serious about workplace reform and increasing productivity, it must look at ways of better integrating work and family life. Companies which have embarked on child-care programs in the workplace in Australia inelude: worldwide communications company OTCLtd, accounting firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords, Melbourne branches of National Mutual, Colonial Mutual, ANZ and National Australia Bank Ltd, Ericssons, the computer company IBM, and the car manufacturing company Nissan. These may be large companies which can better afford to undertake corporate child-care schemes, but it is interesting to note that one of the most supportive employers for the Yennora child-care scheme has been a small printing firm. Obviously this company has the foresight to recognise the benefits of corporate child-care to the business as well as to the staff. The introduction of fee relief, as of January 1991, for families using previously unfunded commercial, employer provided and non-profit child-care services will ensure that all Australian families are treated equally and have access to quality childcare. This extension of fee relief is expected to benefit some 35,000 families, as well as centre operators. By participating in the scheme, centres may be able to attract families who had previously been unable to afford the cost of child-care. Since 1983, in a climate of economic restraint, the Government has provided tens of thousands of Australian families with access to child-carc services and has helped them to meet the cost of care. This Government has introduced an income tested fee relief system to allow low to middle income carncrs to afford childcare; a major expansion of child-care places involving an increase in the number of centres, family day care schemes and outside school hour care services; and guidelines to ensure that working families are given priority of access to services. The Government has introduced a needs-based planning system to ensure that new services are located in areas of high need. We have seen an expansion of services for children in special need, such as children from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. We are also now seeing new services providing occasional care for women at homc. This Labor Government has done much for child-care-public, private and corpOl'ate sponsored child-care. But it is time now for the employers to come to the party and investigate the benefits that can be achieved by making use of corporate child-care schemes. Some areas of Sydney are crying out for the type of opportunity that the Fairfield City Council, in conjunction with State and Commonwealth departments, is offering to employers around the Yennora area. I urge employers to recognise and cxplore the way such a corporate child-care centre could work for them, and to look to the future for their employees. Disability Services Program",57
48,Mr CHANEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to address the same subject matter that was addressed by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), namely, the disability services program. I do so because over the last few years I have had frequent representations expressing very great concern about the administration of that program. I would like to stress in what has to be a very short speech that those representations, and indeed my own views, do not involve opposition to the objectives of the Disability Services Act. In a very broad sense, those objectives can be said to be the provision of lives and lifestyles for people with disabilities which are as close to those of the general community as possible-what in the old days was called normalisation. The problems that arise are not with that objective nor with the fact that there are some signal successes. I think, for example, in the field of housing for people with severe disabilities there have been some wonderful advances over recent years, which are freely and openly acknowledged. There have been some successes in terms of getting people with very severe disabilities into open employment and that is acknowledged. But the problem arises with respect to meeting the needs of the very large number of individuals with significant disabilities in a way which is satisfying to them and also to their families. There are real tensions between the department administering this program, some of the service deliverers and some of the clients. I think one needs to understand, first of all, the vulnerability of the individuals themselves, many of whom do require assistance because of significant mental disabilities and many of whom really are likely to be in a very insecure position unless they receive some outside help. But also I think one needs to understand the sense of concern and anguish in families, particularly when they look to the long term interest of family members who will almost certainly be left without parents or perhaps siblings to look after them. There is a concern that long term structures should be put in place to provide assistance wheri it is required. I have taken this matter up with the local branch of the Department of Community Services and Health in Western Australia. I was assured that the Department is not about clamping down on existing services; it is about providing alternatives. I was assured that no existing service funding had been reduced or lost. But I would say that if that is true, there are vast gulfs of misunderstanding between some of the service providers and those who are administering this program. It does appear to me, on the evidence I have seen, that the enthusiasm in pursuing the laudable objective of providing other and perhaps, in the long term, better alternatives, is leading to some quite oppressive conduct with respect to those people who are delivering what might be termed traditional services, often to the satisfaction of both clients and their families. This is a difficult question because there is tension between the interest and the attitudes of those who have been in the field for generations and those who are seeking to introduce new means and new approaches. But in achieving a balance between those competing in the field, there is no room, in my view, for Commonwealth public servants and, indeed, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) himself to take an attitude which is contemptuous of the other views which exist. I must say that, as a member of the Federal Parliament, it is difficult to try to sort this out. One has limited time to listen to the different parties. But I do want to introduce into this debate a specific example of what I regard as oppressive conduct which I think gives credence to those who say that at times departmental officials go beyond the educative and cajoling role that they might have and become, in fact, very directive and, to use my word, oppressive. I have here a letter which was sent by the Department of Community Services and Health to Mrs Gloria Cassidy, who is the Secretary of the Disabled Workers Union of Western Australia, a body which has some 3,000 members with disabilities, and which is strongly supportive of the status quo-I think that would be fair to say-of the sheltered workshop system. Since I am not permitted under the procedures of the House to incorporate the whole letter, let me read some passages from it which will illustrate the point. This letter, which was written on 28 November 1990, starts in these terms: I am writing to you to express the Departments dissatisfaction with the views and opinions which you expressed during a recent radio interview. The radio interview is then named. The letter continues: In general you commented that you were opposed to the stance the Commonwealth Government was taking in regard to providing people with disabilities with employment options in non sheltered settings. You also expressed your opposition to people with disabilities having the opportunity for generic Union membership. I will leave out the rest of the letter because it is rather long, but the penultimate paragraph reads in these terms: To be eligible for funding under S.10 of the DSA,that is the Disability Services Actservices must demonstrate a commitment to furthering the Principles and Objectives of the DSA. With regard to your recent comments on radio, it would appear that the Disabled Workers Union is not furthering these Principles and Objectives, and as such calls into question future funding. I have been a Minister of the Crown in a couple of departments where we funded thousands of organisations and I have to say that many of them spent a lot of time bitterly criticising me and the policies of the government of the day. I remember my time in Aboriginal affairs with particular fondness in that regard. I do not remember my ever regarding it as a proper act of government to threaten people with a loss of funding because they criticised the approach of the government of the day. I doubt that more than 10 per cent of the Aboriginal organisations that received Commonwealth funding would have survived under that test.· I am told that this letter has been dealt with by the Minister. I simply want to put on the record that that is an example of, in my view, a public servant misunderstanding the function of government and the rights of people in society. From the lengthy discussions that I have had with people, I think that at times enthusiasm for what might be seen as beneficial change overcomes judgment. I think that in Western Australia, at least, there is a need for a little bit of humility on the part of those administering the program and a preparedness to really meet guarantees that the Commonwealth will, as far as it can, provide better alternatives. But, until those better alternatives are available and are taken up voluntarily by those for whom they are available, existing services should not be put under pressure or defunded in any way. They should not, for example, lose funds which are required for the maintenance or re-equipping of sheltered workshops and so on. I have visited enough of these organisations to say that, whilst they may not be perfect, they provide a significant benefit for the people who are involved in them. They provide a significant degree of security; if there are better options available, I will cheerfully embrace them. But I do not want to see a repeat of what has happened so often in fields of social concern. In too many places, including Australia, we find people with significant mental illness, for example, deprived of the questionable value of large centralised institutions before alternatives are readily available. This is not a peculiarly Australian problem. It is a problem that one finds in New York and in other parts of the world. There is a tendency, I think, among those who are advocating improved social programs to allow their enthusiasm to outrun them and to penalise existing programs before the replacements are available. I put the Minister on notice that my colleagues and I will continue to take an interest in this matter, because we believe that there arc instances of oppressive conduct and, indeed, of failure to accept the realities that families and disabled people often face. The last thing I want to say is that 1 raised this matter with the previous Minister. Although I endeavoured to discuss my concerns with him, I have not done so with the present Minister. I would like to put on record my view that the administration of this program requires some ministerial time. I think ministerial time has to be spent with the client group. I do not think surrounding oneself with advisers is adequate in this circumstance. I think Ministers, who I acknowledge are very busy, actually have to make time to visit people, talk to those who are concerned and play a personal role. In my own experience as Minister for Social Security, that was necessary because inevitably there are tensions between administrators and client groups. The object of having a democratically elected parliamentarian involved as a Minister is to ensure that he smooths down the situation and becomes the interface between contesting parties.",59
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Contract Law,61
50,Mr SNOW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," In the early and mid-1980s, Sapphire Investments Pty Ltd attempted to set up a retirement village in Merimbula, which is an area of high demand. Alfred Sauer and his spouse put a lot of work into the village. They spoke to me in the early stages. But later on they were affected by a complete lack of cooperation on the part of their creditors and an inadequate explanation of both legal and financial actions that were taken against them. They have failed to obtain legal aid and this, combined with the other factors, has had a devastating effect on their family. I have been unable take action on their behalf. Most honourable members would appreciate how difficult it is for a member of parliament to put himself or herself in the plaee of a lawyer. It is obvious that it is very difficult for us to enter into all the legal intricacies of a problem. Mr Sauer has provided me with substantial documentation to justify his plea for cooperation by legal authorities. I feel that his matter ought to be brought before this Parliament. Honourable members may remember that in the matter of Bond Brewing Pty Ltd, the Full Bench of the Supreme Court overturned the ruling of a single judge who had found in favour of an unsecured creditor ahead of other creditors because it was contrary to established Australian law. On 16 December 1987, a judge made the same sort of ruling as that ruling which was overturned. The judge made judgment in favour of respondents Estate Mortgage Group which appropriated large sums from a mortgage between Burns Philp Trustee Co. Ltd and Sapphire Investments, when Estate Mortgage was not a party to the mortgage. In fact, there was no contract, no legal mortgage, involved as far as Estate Mortgage was concerned. There was no documentary proof of debt required by the court or offered to the court before judgment was made in favour of Estate Mortgage. In fact, if this did happen, it would show that the amount was contrary to a Victorian trust deed between Burns Philp and Estate Mortgage, limiting lending by the trustee to 66 per cent of the sworn value. The view that has been put to me by Mr Sauer is that a judge accepted the entire cross-claim from the mortgagee that the principal of $3.881m was owing, when in fact the mortgage sum was only $3.5m-$381,000 less. Mr Sauer advises me that the court accepted that claim without requiring proof. Since then, Mr Sauer has been unable to obtain advice and assistance from the official receiver. The chain of events shows that Burns Philp and Estate Mortgage breached their trust deed by exceeding the lending limit to induce a mortgagee takeover of the firm Sapphire Investments; a lending limit which was imposed by the trust decd and the sworn valuation. Both firms, Burns Philp and Estate Mortgage, cancelled a contracted commitment for construction funds to force new conditions and agreements. So here we see a breach of a trust deed, cancellation of a condition and agreements and a replacement of new conditions and agreements. Sauer said Burns Philp forced Sapphire to enter into a joint venture, taking a 25 per cent profit share, and breachcd the trust deed, thus denying Sapphire its common law rights to trade and redemption and its rights to income and capital profits. Then Burns Philp breached contract law by refusing to pay mortgage funds to the borrower, preferring to pay them to the agent. I have been provided with information that Burns Philp did not advance mortgage funds available and caused collapse of the retirement village project. Mr Sauer has provided me with evidence to show that Burns Philp and Estate Mortgage are deemed to be in breach of law by making payment to some creditors in preference to others. They claim default on interest payments, knowing that no default of any kind has ever been notified to Sapphire or its directors. According to the evidence, Burns Philp made thesc claims of default after proceedings had been commenced against it for breach of contract and violation of trade practices provisions. According to Mr Sauer, Estate Mortgage refused to give proper account details suitable for an audit to restrict Sapphire to be accountable and competent. Burns Philp refused to honour the mortgage sum, contrary to advice from the trust auditors and its agent, Estate Mortgage. Mr Sauer feels that Estate Mortgage and Burns Philp engaged in deliberate sabotage of the project to precipitate a mortgagee takeover. He said that they made false and unsubstantiated demands under section 57(2) (b) of the Real Property Act 1900, resulting in an 'illegal judgment', to use his words. Burns Philp ejected the Sapphire directors-guarantors from their family home before the appeal and, according to Mr Sauer, it failed to account for the $195,000 realised, which was approximately 50 per cent of the actual value of the property. So there was not even proof that the family home would be required. He said Burns Philp failed entirely to protect the unit holders' security through not internationally marketing the mortgage property in 1988-89, leaving 21 nearly completed retirement units standing empty and in a deteriorating condition since 1986. On 23 March 1987, Burns Philp appointed a director, who later became a deputy chairman of Burns Philp Trustee Co. Ltd, in the full knowledge that he was in full charge of the Sapphire matter at another firm, Freehill Hollingdalc and Page. Alfred Sauer alleges that the directors of Burns Philp Trustee Co. Ltd and its parent, Burns Philp Co. Ltd, are personally liable for the disaster because of full knowledge of matters pertaining to the Sapphire loan of trustee funds and the family's resultant court action. Mr Sauer has given me evidcnce that Burns Philp failed entirely in its responsibilities as a trustee of the Bega Valley Retirement Trust, which was set up by the borrower. It accepted conflicting ests as trustee of Estate Mortgage Trusts and mortgagee of Public Investment Funds. Mr Sauer tells me that Estate Mortgage and Burns Philp misrepresented the facts of this case in the mortgagc ers, thereby deliberately misleading the unit holders and its bank lenders. Alfred Sauer alleges that Burns Philp knowingly entered into anum ber of conflicting positions in the project known as the Valley High Resort Village, with the express purpose of fraudulently dispossessing Sapphire Investments Pty Ltd and the Alfred Sauer Family Trust of its assets. They were aided in this endeavour by Estate Mortgage Group and other agents and representatives. Alfred Sauer has provided me with a substantial amount of written documentary evidence in support of all those allegations against Burns Philp, Estate Mortgage Group, their directors and known associates. I do not take this lightly. The faet that I have brought this before the Parliament shows that I have endeavoured to take action on behalf of Sauer through the Legal Aid Commission in New South Wales and other organisations and have failed. I feel it is important that the matter come before Parliament. I ask the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to give serious consideration to legal aid so that, just as in the case of Bond Brewing, the Sauers at least will be able to show that a judge had ruled in favour of an unsecured creditor ahead of other creditors, which shows that the decision was improper. I believe in this particular case that the matter ought to be tested before the Supreme Court. The Sauers ought to have legal aid made available to them. Disability Services",61
51,Mr CADMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mitchell) (1.10 p.m.)their Today I wish to grieve for people with disabilities in Australia, for their parents, their advocates and the staff of centres assisting those who are disabled. In particular, within my electorate there are Cumberland Industries Ltd, MCCall Garden Colony and Warrah Village, which provides disability services based on the inter- philosophy of Rudolf Steiner. Warrah Village is an excellent centre located in Harris Road, Dural. I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of the Executive Director, ledg- Mr Karl Kaltenbach, OAM. Warrah is situated in an idyllic bushland setting with well-formed pathways linking the buildings. Although rustic in appearance, its facilities are modern. The Warrah centre was commenced in 1969. It has provided 20 years of stable and sensitive support and care in an integrated community and individualised services for people with disabilities. Over the last 10 years, Warrah has expanded its facilities to five cottages in the suburbs and seven cottages based within the village. In total, 41 adults are serviced by Warrah; 26 are living outside the centre. Those who managed the centre noticed that many of them were talked into living outside the ccntre because of the forthcoming requirements of the Disability Services Act 1986. This was a process that was resented and resisted by many of the parents and many of those who formerly lived in Warrah. There are also 27 children in the village. For the purposes of my grievance, I wish to draw to the attention of the House, the nation and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) the requirements of the Disability Services Act and the impact that it has had on this wonderful and beautifully managed centre. Of the 41 adults, 13 work on a farm based at Wanah in Dural and 28 have activities at the Castle Hill workshop of Warrah. A notable feature of Warrah is the reverse integration, where families who have normal children and who are normal themselves live in Warrah with those who are disabled. The community mixes in a proper integration process right at the tablishment. At Warrah, 10 people are profoundly disabled; they are incontinent and cannot walk or feed themselves. These people and their parents are being told that they should live in the community. These people must have a day service and be supported by a sensitive service such as that supplied at Warrah. Warrah on many occasions has tried to put to the Department of Community Services and Health a proposal that is acceptable to the philosophy outlined by bureaucrats rather than that which is outlined under the Act itself. Few of the people that I have spoken to in any of these establishments have any real quibble with the principles of the Act. However, the administration of those principles is causing great concern and reaJ anguish. I was delighted to visit Warrah recently, with the shadow Minister for community services and health, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), for a meeting of parents. Both of us understood what had been endeavoured and what had been achieved. The proposals put by Warrah to meet the provisions of the Act included the provision of a new organisation supplying physiotherapy, speech therapy and generic services. It was proposed by Warrah that it should provide an independent living training person. That was also rejected by the Department as not being suitable. Finally, Warrah was offered $45,000 for a day service program for a six-month period. But the service providers said that they did not have places to assist Warrah and so the funds have been lost. It was impossible, in fact, even to implement the very proposal to which this Act is supposed to so strongly adhere. There is really only one option under the Act for those with severe disablement, and that is to stay at home and be involved in independent living training-to be bused around the countryside to pick up the skills that are supposed to support and provide the profoundly disabled with the living skills so that they can live free of their parents and free of support in the es- community. Yet these people have such inherent problems. I think it is impossible for the Act, as it has been expressed, to meet the requirements. This group of profoundly disabled people is referred to by workers from the Department of Community Services and Health as 'the residue'. What a terrible term to apply to people who are humans, who have troubles, but who are wonderful individuals; they are referred to as the residue. At the meeting at Warrah I found that the term has been extended, which I find really distressing. The Department and workers in the field use the term, but the people of Warrah, MCCall Garden Colony and Cumberland Industries do not. The term being used is no longer parents or relatives, but advocates. They are categorically not allowed to be referred to as parents or relatives; they have become advocates. Their children in these centres are now called clients. So a group of people that the system will not deal with is being branded as residue; parents are known as advocates and children are known as clients. It is a deplorable situation-such an impersonal, non-feeling approach to this significant problem. Once there was a genuine partnership between Warrah and the Department of Community Services and Health. It is not there any more. Instead, there is something that is prescriptive and ill-advised, a poor philosophy. In fact, what has been implemented is very similar to the recommendations of another report in New South Wales, the Richmond report deaJing with the mentally disabled. The proposition in that report was to empty the institutions and to normalise the activities of people who had been there. The same philosophy is being applied to those with severe disablement. It just does not work. It did not work under the Richmond recommendations in New South Wales. It caused severe problems both for the Government and for the Minister. Here again in this instance it is causing severe probWe lems for the Minister for Community Services and Health and for ment. It really is an excuse, I believe, for Government to cut funding in this area tion and to dump all the problems onto the State governments. The Government has been absolutely uncaring in its expression of attitudes. But I do not believe the ister is an uncaring man. I would like to read a letter from Christopher Rolnik. Christopher has written in his very best writing. I will show Christopher's writing to the shadow Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary. Christopher is aged 37. He has tried his best express himself. The letter reads as lows: I like Warrah the cottage in which I live and farm. There is no traffic and more bush space. After work I can do what I like, anybody in the other cottages and go with bike to the shops where I like to go. I stay in this village. I have known Christopher for 20 years. On the night that we were at Warrah we heard many similar stories from the ents and the young people. I have had the agreement of the Parliaproached mentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at table, to table a resolution passed by paras ents at that meeting on 24 May 1991 and also a collection of letters written by people such as Christopher-those with disabilities, parents, advocates of the Warrah Village. I seek leave to table those documents. In the concluding few seconds, I would like to plea with the Minister to make this a non-partisan issue; let us be as partisan as we can be. I would like to issue, on behalf of the parents of Warrah, an invitation for the Minister to visit centre, to see for himself the quality the services, the happiness of the people, the relationships between staff and those who live there and the confidence that parents have in Warrah, and to decide for himself whether there should be changes to this Act or the implementation of the Act. In fact, in the motion passed at rah the parents stated: support the principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act. the GovernBut they went on to say: We believe that the shared living environment the provided at Warrah Village is the accommodaoption providing the least restrictive alternative . . .",63
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, Order! The honourable member's time Minhas expired. The honourable member for Mitchell sought leave to table certain documents. Is leave granted? Leave granted. World Overpopulation,65
53,Mr HOLLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Throsby) (1.21 p.m.)to Yesterday, 5 June, was World Environfolment Day and we were challenged to consider what we could do to preserve this the already fragile planet. Yet in all the words and more spoken and written about the environvisit ment, very little attention was paid to my what is the greatest threat to the environwant to ment, that is world overpopulation. No-one argues that the protection of the world's rainforests, pollution of the waterways or land degradation are not imporpartant issues; of course they are. But I suggest that these problems cannot be apon an ad hoc basis. They are caused, in the main, by the pressure of the overpopulation. Until we as individuals, legislators, indeed governments, tackle the basic fundamental problem of overpopulation, the millions spent on our environmental problems will, in many cases, and staff be millions lost. The world population of 5.5 billion is expected to increase by another one billion people during the 1990s. The world's population is not only growing faster than biever before, but also is growing fastest in the poorest parts of the world. Approximately 90 per cent of the growth in world that population is occurring in developing of countries, those least equipped to meet the needs of their people and still invest in the future. Of the present population, over one billion people live in poverty. It is not clear that the world can meet the quite modest aspirations of this bottom billion as well as those of the better off Warwithout irreparable damage to our life support systems. Already the impact of the present population has been sufficient to degrade the soils. of millions of hectares, substantially reduce genetic diversity, seriously pollute the world's water resources, thin the ozone layer and initiate a global warming of which the full consequences cannot yet calculated. Population growth will have be halted and probably reversed if susyears, tainable development is ever to be achieved. However, the issue is not simply one of global population size. The populations the rich, industrialised countries, the billion, have been responsible for conis suming most of the world's resources for creating most of the world's pollution problems. Birth rates have declined dustrial countries largely bccausc of social and economic development which has on been linked to high levels of per capita consumption. Many developing countries are caught in a vicious circle, with rapid population growth eroding any gains in living standards brought about by ecobring nomic growth, thereby minimising the increase likelihood that lower birth rates could brought about by improvements in living standards. Dr Nafis Sadik, the Executive Director of the United Nations Fund for Population Ac6vities argues that the choices taken over the next 10 years will be cial in deciding the quality of life in twenty-first century and that they may even decide the future of the earth as habitat for humans. Thus, at the commost mencement of the 1990s, it is imperative that action be taken to slow population growth, attack poverty and protect environment. If prompt action is not healthier taken, present and future generations will suffer rapidly falling living standards and will be forced to live on a polluted seriously degraded planet. We in this Parliament avoid the issue of population. Many issues are raised each day in this building, yet one topic that gets little mention is the rapidly increas412 ing world population. Perhaps it is cause we, as members of parliament, indeed our constituents, do not see ulation as a problem for Australia. I would suggest that, of aJl the problems facing this planet, the overriding one must be that of the rapidly increasing population. Australia, with a population of just over 17 million and a population density of 2.2 people per square kilometre, does be not face the population-related problems to of many other countries. Indeed, for many through our own immigration program, we have sought to increase significantly our population. We in Australia cannot remove ourof selves from the population problems of top Asia. It is not only an Asian problem, it an African problem. Indeed, it is a and world problem. For this reason, I am pleased that Australia is a member of the in inAsian Forum on Population and Development and, indeed, I represent Australia the executive of this important group. This world could achieve prosperity for all, not just the lucky few, if we could overcome the problems of rapid population growth and unstable food supply. To down the rapid rate of population is to broaden the choice for future be generations. Checking population increase is a means of achieving the final objective which is improving the quality of life of this and future generations. At this stage, I should like to say that the recent death of Mr Takashi Sato, cruChairman of the Asian Forum on Poputhe lation and Development, was a severe loss to all involved in the question of populaa tion and development. Mr Sato devoted of his time and energy to confronting this problem. His monument will be that, through his efforts, many of his felthe low humans will enjoy a better and a life. By the end of this century, the global population is expected to reach 6.2 billion but, without the dedication and and energy of people such as Mr Sato, the world population and its endemic problems would be much greater. According to population council researchers, the world population today is million less than it would have been bewithout organised family planning proor grams. They concluded that in the abpopsence of family planning programs, the population of Asia, Latin America and Africa could be expected to reach 14.6 billion by the end of the twenty-first century instead of the 10 billion currently projected by the World Bank. Since I have been speaking, the world's population has increased by 2,555 persons. By this time next year, it will have increased by 80 million. worldwide and, in Asia, by 54 million people. This increasing population must be the overriding problem facing the world. We have no hope of solving the environmental problems-indeed, a whole range of problems-unless we tackle this, the main problem. I hope that, in the many issues that we as politicians face every day, we can devote more time to this issue. If we do not, I ask: what sort of future will we and future generations have? Mr Deputy Speaker, the time for talk is over. We must act and we must act now. There must be a commitment from this Parliament to educate the Australian public about population issues, including the need for population control programs in developed as well as developing countries. We must continue to play our part and increase funding for bodies such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nations Fund on Population and Development. We in Australia have a role to play and we must take up the challenge. We cannot isolate ourselves. We cannot continue to think in the short term and we can no longer think only of Australia. We must think globally and we must act globally. Indeed, we must match our words with actions. Threats to the very survival of the human race, so evident as the twentieth century approaches its end, and the need to deal with those threats more effectivcly at the political level are forcing us to act. If we are to take seriously our claim as caring world citizens, we must accept that world overpopulation is as much a problem for Australia as for any developing country. We make much in this Parliament of being a part of Asia. World overpopulation is most evident in this area. Indeed, our former colony, Papua New Guinea, has one of the fastest increasing population rates in the world. That country will never achieve its full potential unless the population question is tackled there. The situation is the same in so much of Asia, so much of Africa, and so much of Latin America-all over the world. The developed world, which continues to consume so much of the world's resources, has, to a large extent, solved its population problem. But to give the people of the developing world the opportunity to participate in this environmcnt, they, with our help, must solve their ovcrpopulation problems. Services for Disabled Persons",65
54,Mrs GALLUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"l intend to take up the matter of disability services that was raised by the honourable members for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), Pearce (Mr Chaney) and Mitchell (Mr Cadman). In doing so, I refer particularly to my own State of South Australia. In gazetting the principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act in 1987, the then Minister for Community Services and Health-now the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett)-gave notice to people with disabilities that they could expect to be provided with special services to live in the community; that they could expect access to generic services, special aids, independent accommodation and supported or open employment. Not surprisingly, those with disabilities and the families of those with disabilities took the Minister at his word and waited expectantly for the new era. Unfortunately for many, especially those with intellectual disabilities, head injuries and psychiatric illnesses, that era never came. For them, the Disability Services Act of 1986 has turned out to be a cruel hoax. In saying this, in no way do I wish to criticise the Act or its principles and objectives. My criticism is of this Government which, in gazetting the principle and objectives in the way it did, raised expectations that it could not meet. However, my criticism goes further than this. I believe that in aiming for philosophical purity, this Government has provided aver"" few people with a high cost service while leaving the majority of people with disaable bilities, and their families, worse off. At the time the Government introduced the Disability Services Act, and even later when it gazetted the principles and objecents tives of the Act, one group felt that fichildren. nally, at long last, help had arrived. This group was the families of those with head injuries, intellectual disabilities and chiatric illnesses. These families had suffering for years. Many of them mained in thcir own homes 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year caring for their son or daughter. Listening to the Government, they thought things would now change, that they could look forward to the future with some hope. But the majority were hoodwinked. The majority of families in South tralia with children with head injuries, intellectual disabilities and psychiatric illness cannot find accommodation for their children. They cannot find daytime activdation ities for their children, let alone the ingful work the Government promised. They cannot get respite, they cannot gain access either to special or generic services and they cannot say what will happen their children when they die. Let me first turn to accommodation. Objective number one in the book DisaIt bility, Society and Change, which the Government presented to people with disParents abilities and their families, says in respect of accommodation: A place to live in the community means a place to live that's like where most other live, in a regular neighbourhood, a house that houses. looks like a regular home, is the same size, with access and support as necessary, to community activities. It also means having access to ordinary housing in the area or community that a person chooses to live in. It may mean that a person with a disability has to have a support worker living in. That was the promise. And, indeed, people have been given exactly this type of accommodation. But it is only a very small percentage of those in need and in cases many cases the majority have missed It is heart breaking to receive phone calls from parents looking for accommodation for their children. They call my ing that they have heard that I might be to put in a good word with someone to get their child on a waiting list. I have to explain that there is nothing I can do. In the last month I have had two parwho have threatened to abandon their One of th- parents said that she could no longer cope because her son was larger than she was and not only did he psybeat her up but his exhibitionist behavbeen iour was causing enormous problem with reneighbours. Although she had actually made up her mind to leave her son at an institution and not collect him, she rang me up the following day to say that she could not go through with it. Workers in the disability area say that this is a frequent occurrence. The parents are desperate for some relief but, even though they are pushed to the limit, they cannot bring Austhemselves to abandon their children. There are 800 people with intellectual disabilities on waiting lists for accommoin South Australia. Two hundred meanof these are regarded as urgent. I cannot tell you how many people with head injuries or psychiatric illnesses are looking for suitable accommodation, but a repreto sentative from the Mental Health Resource Centre in Adelaide said the situation was horrific. In her words: is quite appalling. Quite horrific. Parents are desperate. are desperate, but what about the people with intellectual disabilities, with head injuries, or with psychiatric illnesses whose families cannot care for them? people Where do they go? They go to boarding There are 400 to 500 people with head injuries, intellectual disabilities and psychiatric illnesses in boarding houses and hostels in Adelaide. One service worker described the boarding houses 'as ranging from the barely adequate to the Dickensome sian'. He went on to say: We have to use the boarding houses or these people would live under bridges and in some it might be better to live under bridges. out. Accommodation is so scarce in some boarding houses people with disabilities are living four to five to a room-a long office sayway from objective No. 1. Some boarding houses help their residents with medication and some even look after their finances. There are some very caring boarding house proprietors and some who are not. But even good proprietors have their limitations. They are not trained to care for people with disabilities and it should not be their responsibility. They have been left with the responsibility because the Government has wiped its hands of it. Now there is talk of handing accommodation services for people with a disabilitv over to the States. What will change then? Nothing, but this Government will not be faced with the acrimonious position of the contrast between the Disability Services Act, its principles and objectives, and what is actually happening in the wider community. Accommodation is one major problem; occupation is another. In South Australia at the moment what do you do with a child who has a moderate intellectual disability who turns 20? She or he can no longer attend school as the Education Department forces a cut-off at this age. Technical and further education courses are now oriented towards the less seriously disabled, in that they provide so-called bridging courses to assist people with minimal disabilities to go out into the community for open cmployment. Day-care activities have been closed down as philosophically undesirable. All the employment centres that employ people with intellectu'al disabilities are and on top of that, with the recession and 10 per cent unemployment, there are no jobs anyway. The net result is that there are a large number of families where young people aged 20 spend every minute of the day with their parents or alone in boarding houses. In South Australia 2,000 people with disabilities have no daytime activities and this is being added to at the rate of 60 to 70 people a year. If the figures for those with intellectual disabilities sound horrific, it is because we have figures for those with intellectual disabilities; we do not have the same information for those with head injuries and psychiatric illnesses. They are completely forgotten. Yet, while there are thousands of people without work or daytime activities, the Government has threatened closure of those places of employment that do not live up to the standards set out in the objectives and principles of the Disability Services Act. It seems everyone has to live up to the principles and objectives except the Government. There is no doubt that it was desirable for many of the pla,ces employing people with intellectual disability to initiate workplace reform. However, as one of the parents of a child with intellectual disability said: Second or third best is better than nothing at all. This is what is being offered fo the majority of people with disabilities in my State-nothing at all. Dianne Lueckenhausen tells us what it is like to be a sole parent with an intellectually disabled son: I am 42 going on 75, My son is 17, He is a six foot three inch two year old. There's only one of me and I have to bath and dress him. I get so tired. When he's here, when he's not at school, I can't go out. I can't have a normal type of life like you have. I'm frightened to death about what happens when he turns 20. 24 hours a day, every day, for th- rest of my life. I'd rather stick my head in an oven. Dianne's plea is for some direction from the Government. Again, in her own words: I really want to impress upon you the fact that parents want to have some directions for the future. Parents need to know where they're going. full Parents of autistic children have just had to withdraw their children from a special school-the only one of its kind in the State-because it had been forced to close through lack of funds. People with physical disabilities cannot obtain the physical aids, wheelchairs, lifting aids and special footwear they were promised. It is time this Government acknowledged its failure in the disability area, stopped its philosophical grandstanding and provided real assistance to those with disabilities and their families. Roads",67
55,Mr HARRY WOODS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the short time left for this debate, I ,would like to mention the importance that rural communities place on roads. They are aware of the .lobbying done by local governments for Increases in road funds. Local governments and the Commonwealth Government have forged a good relationship in this regard. Last Saturday, I was honoured to officially 0l?en the MCDonald's Bridge between Casmo and Kyogle in northern New South Wales. I was able to see first-hand the result of that relationship. The Commonwealth provided the majority of the fundIng !or the bridge-$133,OOO from the Austrahan bicentennial road development prog-am and $403,500 in the form of a bndge subsidy grant. This brought the t-tal Commonwealth Government allocatIOn for that bridge to $530,000, which was a large percentage of the total cost of $807,000. Of course once the funding from the Commonwe-lth was provided, the involvement of the Commonwealth Government was really finished and it was left up to the Ric-mond. River Sh-re Council to get the bndge bUllt. The ShIre President Councillor David Parkinson, the Deputy Shire President, Councillor Col Sullivan and their willing tcam of workers did a tremendous job. The design was done by the Council. The work was undertaken by the Council's bridge gang, using local contractors for the manufacture of the piles and girders, thereby at least partially helping the chronic unemployment problem that the north coast. of New South Wales and the Northern RIVers has. The finished product is first class and it is a credit to all those involved, not just the Council. It is a great credit to the Council that the work was completed in just over 12 months. The work started in January last year when the Council drove the first test pylon and when the real work started it took the Council only 12 months to build a bridge that will hopefully last for more than a century. That is a commendable achievement. Even more commendable is the fact that the Council built the bridge, and it is unusual in t-ese days, within the budget allocated. It IS the second bridge that the Richmond River S-ire Council has built recently, the other beIng the bridge at Coraki. In both cases the bridges have provided important links for local communities-something that local government bodies in high rainfall areas and flood-prone areas really have to do a lot more of. One only needs to ask the Deputy Shire President, Councillor Col Sullivan, about that because Col Sullivan has been a member of the Richmond River Shire Council since 1974. His father, William, was a councillor for eight years; his grandfather was a councillor from 1922 to 1937 and his great grandfather, John, who officially opened the original bridge, .was a councillor from 1908 to 1920. It IS that type of dedication that is often demonstrated in country areas. Nevertheless, the commitment of that family is extraordinary. I believe that in the past country people have been short-changed by both the State and Federal Governments, particularly in the funding of roads and infrastructure. Governments have got their priorities wrong. Instead of encouragin.g people to use public transport by offen-g a .b-tter service governments have bUllt bllhons of dollars worth of roads in cities. We continually see the result of that on television-thousands of cars with one person in each choke up roads. We really need to discourage people from going in cars into the middle of cities. The funding has been largely inequitable. Country people still have to travel on gravel roads and on worn, twisting and deteriorating bitumen roads. Country people do not have the c-oice of using public transport because, In most case-, no public transport exists and to me thIS is an anomaly. People in the city have the choice of two major forms of transport and both, in most cases, are of high quality. Country people do not have that choice. Instead of governments now spending massive sums on grand schemes in the city to push more an- - ore pe-ple continually into the centres, It IS now tIme to start diverting some of that money to the bush. That spending is not without its benefits. From a social perspective it provides people with improved opportunities to meet and on a commercial perspective it pro,:,ides the infrastructure so necessary for mdustry and commerce to survive in country areas. Sadly, in my electorate that infrastructure is inadequate and that is a point on which both the State member Bill Rixon, and I agree. We need morbridges tha- are not blocked by flooding; we need qUIcker access for our agriculture and other products to metropolitan markets; and we need our roads to be safe.",69

I would like to hear his comments on whether that is an accurate assessment of how the little person today has been affected by the economic policies of this Government and what he in his new portfolio intends to do about it.

It is my pleasure to advise members of Economy the House that the Parliamentary Education Office has now published a new booklet, which will be a very handy booklet. It is a very small, pocket-sized edition of the Australian Constitution. The Office is making these available to all schools for the very reasonable price of only 60c a copy. I think that is a very positive new development that the Parliamentary Education Office has undertaken. I will be encouraging all schools in my electorate to purchase copies of the booklet, because ' I think it is very important that young people, in fact all people in the community, gain a better understanding and ' knowledge of the way in which the Constitution operates and the very important role of members of parliament as the custodians of the Constitution in the way in which we operate in this place and in the work we do.

Their aim was to work for and to speak on behalf of ex-servicemen and women and to represent the needs and values of ex-servicemen and women to politicians and the community. Today, 75 years later, the League, with a membership of just under a quarter of a million,. continues to act on behalf of members.

62,Mr BRADFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The citizens of Slovenia are continuing to persecuted by the Yugoslav armed forces. Last December, a referendum of the people of Slovenia clearly indicated their desire for independence from Yugoslavia. Two weeks ago, the Yugoslav armed forces sent armoured vehicles into the city of Maribor and later arrested the leader of the Eastern Slovenian Territorial Defence Force. A citizen was killed when an armoured vehicle rammed a wall of protesters. Many Slovenians are still being forced to serve in the Yugoslav armed forces. The world condemned the events in Tiananmen Square. What is the Australian Government doing to protest to the Yugoslav Government about its inhumane treatment of the people of Slovenia? On a happier note and one much closer to home, I would like to inform the Parliament about the opening of a new tourist attraction on the Gold Coast called Warner Bros Movie World. This is Hollywood on the Gold Coast. The opening of Warner Bros Movie World is the biggest entertainment event in Australian show business history. The total site area of the existing film studio and theme park is 167 hectares.

63,Mr NUGENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Two weeks ago, I attended a funding cut protest meeting in Melbourne in my electorate of Aston is a at the Knox Spastic Society Centre. In great parallel with an almost indecent haste down the path of integration for disabled people, the Government has imposed a 10 per cent cutback in funding to this organisation. This is simply not acceptable in the be absence of any other meaningful facilities being offered to the Spastic Society residents. Instead of rushing ahead with the intcgration program in a relatively short span of time, the Government should be providing support to voluntary agencies like the Spastic Society. These organisations are the proven delivery mechanism for support services to many areas of disadvantage in our community and particularly so to the disabled. Such community organisations are well established, provide outstanding services and are the cxperts in the field. Unfortunately, Government planning in recent years all too often seems to be peopled by people with little practical experience, who spend their lives just dreaming up new schemes. For families with disabled children who have to livc with the strain and load placcd upon them day in and day out, year after year, it is a long term issue. They arc alarmed at some of the recent trends, particularly in the implicit policy that seems to be emerging to gradually withdraw all funds from the Spastic Society. I have urged residents and parents to lobby Federal and State Government members of parliament loudly and frequently to ensure that funding is maintained for the Spastic Socicty of Victoria. I call upon the Minister for Community Services and Hcalth (Mr Howe) to give the many very upset parents of disabled people and the disabled thcmselves reassurance that their funding will be maintained and will be secure in the future.",72

It would be very casy for me to join in the political pastime of allotting blame to onc political party or another. But it has gone past that. Tasmania at the moment has an unemployment rate of about 12 per cent and the Australian Paper Manufacturers mills in the Huon Valley are closing down. Ovaltine IS shedding labour, as is the Electrolytic Zinc Company at Risdon. There is also a rumour at the moment about, I think, Comalco. The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) is in here at the moment and he feels the same as I do. What are we going to do about it? Wc cannot do a dashed thing. Everybody knows what I think about greenies and that greenie candidate is down there saying it is a good thing to close the silicone works in Hobart, Tasmania. I ask her, and I ask all the other greenies that are getting involved in the economic debate in Tasmania, what they are going to do for the men who are losing their jobs. What are they going to do for the women who are losing their jobs and for the families that are being disrupted as a result of these firms closing down?

67,Mr HOLLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Two weeks ago the people of the Illawarra region delivered a devastating rejection to the Greiner Government in New South Wales. They did so for two reasons. First of all, since. it has been in power, the Greiner Government has ignored the Illawarra region. That is why, in the State seat of Wollongong, we saw a 30 per cent swing to the Labor Party and my colleague, Gerry Sullivan, elected to the New South Wales Parliament. There were swings of 5 and 6 per cent in other seats. Every seat in the Illawarra was returned to Labor. The other reason for the rejection is that the Greiner Government in New South Wales is doing exactly what the crowd opposite will do if they get into power. It is introducing industrial relations legislation which is exactly the same as the New Zealand legislation. The people of the Illawarra knew what was going to happen. They saw what the Greiner Government was doing with industrial relations legislation. They rejected this legislation just as the people of Australia will reject the proposed Liberal-National party indJ.lstrial relations policy. I make a plea to the workers of Australia to look at what is happening in New Zealand. If they want to see what they would get in terms of. industrial relations from the crowd opposite, just have a look at what is happening in New Zealand today and reject it.",73

I listened very carefully to what the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) said and I sympathise with him that businesses in his electorate are cloSing down. I, of course, live in the best part of Australia and businesses in my part of world are opening up. I want to pay a couple of tributes. A few minutes ago, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) mentioned the opening of Warner Brothers Movie World which, of course, is a big thing for the Gold Coast. But it is an even bigger thing for Moncrieff because it happens to be in my electorate. I want to congratulate everybody who was involved in this very brave, wonderful and exciting venture. Last Friday, two days before the opening of Movie World, Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd opened its new Australian factory in my electorate. It is relocating to the Gold Coast, not just because the climate is good but also because a lot of other things are good, too. Of course, one has very happy and settled workers, if one happens to have one's factory on the Gold Coast. I want to congratulate Colgate-Palmolive on taking what was a very brave and bold decision. I know that it is very pleased. It has an absolutely excellent factory, which is very environmentally friendly. This business has gone to great lengths to make sure that it preserves the environmental integrity of the Gold Coast and the welfare of everyone living there. I look forward to the relocation of even more firms to the Gold Coast, even if it is to the loss of people like the honourable member for Franklin. Rugby League",74

The centre is one of the most important community facilities that service the people of Moreton. It plays an important role in giving some respite to the carers of dementia sufferers. It does so by ensuring that carers are able to undertake normal family business while their family members, their loved ones, enjoy a range of activities for the day. The day respite care centre that the Blue Nurses run on Logan Road, Mt Gravatt, is a very important institution, as is the other Blue Nurses' institution in the electorate of Moreton, the Sal vin Park nursing home and hostel. Both of these facilities provide very important services to the aged people in the electorate of Moreton.

74,Mr HAWKE,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I have had cause to say, as has the previous Treasurer and other economic commentators, that the monthly figures are volatile. Together with other members of the Government, I welcome the fact that there has been this fall assoof ciated with the reduction in the participation rate; but we are not prepared, on the basis of one month's figures, to come to some longer term conclu-ion. I assure the honourable member that we will feed these figures into our considerations in the next couple of months to see whether there is any revision required. But I trust that the honourable gentleman would join with me and those on this side of the House in welcoming the fall. NA",75
75,Mr BRERETON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training inform the House about conditions in the Australian labour market in the light of today's release of Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures for May 1991?",75
76,Mr DAWKINS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and whilst I catch my breath from running into Question Time I note that the Prime Minister made some observations about these figures as I was coming in. These figures were not entirely unexpected. They do confirm the Government's view that the labour market continues to deteriorate. There was a fall both in the number of people in employment and in the number of people unemployed. I think the important thing about this set of figures is that it tends to correct the view, which was apparently included in last month's figures, that there was a very rapid deterioration in the labour market. As a result of last month's figures some people were speculating that the unemployment rate might rise to something like 12 or 13 per cent. I think today's figures are much more consistent with the view of the projections put out last week that maybe the unemployment rate will peak at somewhat below 11 per cent, either at the end of this year or early next year. I want to make it perfectly clear that the Government is far from complacent about these figures. Obviously they are a matter of grave concern. That is why, in anticipation of this pattern emerging, the Government took decisions in the context the March statement to expand significantly the number of labour market places and training places available for those out of work. In March we decided to spend some $250m in the course of the next two years to create some additional 60,000 full time and part time places for those out of work. This is in sharp contrast to the approach which has been consistently advocated by the Opposition. Whilst it laments what it has described as the continuing deterioration in the labour market, and continues to put the most gloomy prognostications on the figures as they have come out month by month, if we look at its prescription as to what we should do about this, in every instance it has involved punishing the unemployed and depriving them of decent training opportunities in order to get back into the labour market now or as the labour market improves. If we look at what the Opposition was saying at the last election, we find that it talked about cutting labour market programs to the tune of about $200m a year-in circumstances which the Opposition itself says are difficult times for the unemployed. The honourable member for Braddon; as spokesman for the Opposition, did rather lead with his chin today when he said that, had the participation rate remained unchanged at April's level, there would have been a further rise in the unemployment rate. If Opposition members want to debate participation rates with us and their effect on the unemployment rate, we have a very lucid, very clear illustration for them: if the participation rate now was at the level that it was seven or eight years ago, the unemployment rate would not be between 9 and 10 per cent; rather, it would be closer to 5 per cent. I am not resting on the participation rate as any kind of alibi for the real situation that exists in the labour market today, or as a way of alleviating our concern for those people who are out of work, but it is curious for the honourable member for Braddon to start trotting out these figures now as a means of trying to pretend that the present unemployment level is worse than the figures reveal. T make an additional point, because the honourable member for Braddon weeps crocodile tears for the teenagers who are out of work. Of course it is the case that the unemployment rate for young people is now, as it always is, higher than it is for the population as a whole. But if we look at the actual number of teenagers who are out of work, there are some 40,000 fewer out of work now than there were in April 1983. That is because this Government has a real concern about opportunities for young people, and it has provided those opportunities within the school system, the technical and further education system and the higher education system. It is because there are more young people doing decent things in education and training that 40,000 fewer of them are actually looking for work now compared with the time when the Opposition was in office.

I am aware of the study that was referred to by the honourgalable member and have noted its conclusions, in particular a confirmation of the role of the general practitioner in the Australian health care system, the sugregestion that closer integration of preventative care with existing medical services may ensure effective delivery of services, lack of support by rural residents, and a regionalisation of services because of fears that hospital closures may lead to loss of general practitioner services. The study, together with the question, draws attention to several interrelated isany sues the Government is addressing through a range of initiatives. The major 31 priority issues arc that too few general practitioners live or work in many country areas, as opposed to the fact that there the are often too many general practitioners in the urban areas, particularly in the is greater metropolitan area of Sydney; and a shortage of other health professionals in It is the rural and remote areas. These problems flow from three related issues. Firstly, for some general practithe fee for service system, based on an average cost per service, is not adequate in the country, where service costs can be higher while volume of services is lower. Secondly, many country genpractitioners feel isolated from their peers and other professionals and are not able to access education and training opportunities. Thirdly, the lack of education facilities and other social opportunities for their families is often a powerful inand centive for doctors and other health professionals to move to the cities, even when there is an oversupply of doctors in I turn briefly to a range of initiatives we have in train to seek to deal with these issues. Firstly, the national health strategy is examining alternative methods of organising and remunerating general practitioners to encourage primary health care which is of a high standard, cost effective and well integrated via the health and community services. There are a broad range of-options. For example, we could provide incentives for general practitioners to locate in particular areas, we could pay GPs a block grant to service particular communities, and we could encourage, for example, more salaried GPs in rural areas. The solutions will vary from area to area. Secondly, the structure of the medical work force is being examined. I turn to this particular issue, which has broader implications. It is one we are currently discussing with the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and is of some importance. The structure of the medical work force as a whole needs to be examined, in part for the reasons I have just referred to-the mal distribution, if you like, or the inadequacies of distribution of GPs. Earlier this year a joint AMA-Government working group on medical work force supply and distribution identified three issues requiring further examination: the impact of medical integration on the medical work force; the role of general practitioners in hospitals; and medical education and training. In March the Australian Health Ministers Conference established a Commonwealth-State working group to advise on these issues and report in October. A resolution must encompass the needs of ethnic groups, the problems I have been referring to in terms of the distribution of doctors, as well as the concerns of overseas trained doctors. Finally, there is concern about the isolation of rural health workers in terms of their profession. The Government has a range of programs in place, involving expenditure of about $5m a year, to seek to address those concerns. The honourable member for Hinkler has raised what I think is an extremely important issue, one that will need to be addressed as part of our health strategy, one that points to inequities between urban and regional areas that certainly are exacerbated by the current distribution of doctors. As Minister, I am determined that we should find some real solutions to what is, I am sure, for honourable members representing rural electorates a problem of very serious concern. NA NA NA  Minister to reports that he, in apparent contravention of the law, received and utilised intelligence derived from a telephone interception for impermissible purposes. Given that the Prime Minister has effectively waived the accepted convention of neither confirming nor denying reports of such allegations, it is no longer open to him to rely selectively upon that convention to save him from exposure to the truth. Consequently, I ask the Prime Minister, with his waiver in mind: why did he use material obtained by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), totally unrelated to matters of national security, in an endeavour to bring a ministerial colleague into line?",77

Of course, there is a fine line which legislature has to tread as to what should be the absolute right of citizens of tralia to freely come into this Parliament and view the proceedings. I have always taken the view that one should always attempt to err on the side of what I think is nearly an absolute right. HonourCan able members saw during the Gulf war debate in the House that there were some demonstrations in the gallery. I think all honourable members accepted after a while that it was probably a healthy thing that people might have been able to let off steam in that way. However, if people think that they can come into the national legislature and disrupt the proceedings of this Parliament in an attempt to get across a point of view, then they will cause the rights of other of Australians to have to be looked at, because it is absolutely untenable that people should attempt to jump into this chamber from the galleries. It is absolutely untenable, in my view, that people should see this sort of organised disruption as the way to put their point of view. Even though I would like to continue take the view that all Australians should have the absolute right to come in here and see what their legislature is doing, galdemonstrations such as that today cause a worry to all of us, and they cause a worry to me when I often have make that decision about the rights of all these other people in the gallery versus a rowdy few who might like not to take any account of what is going on here.

102,Mr SAWFORD,WORLD AGRICULTURE,"My question is dithe rected to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. Is he aware of Ausreports that farm subsidies have risen substantially in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, costing taxpayers and would consumers some $300 billion in 1990? he advise honourable members in the House what significance this has for Australia and for its attempt to achieve rethat form of world trade in agriculture?",79
103,Dr BLEWETT,WORLD AGRICULTURE,"I am aware of the figures to which the honourable member for Port Adelaide refers. They come from the 1991 annual Agricultural Monitoring and Outlook report of the OECD, which was released in Paris this week. It must be said that it paints a very gloomy picture for the outlook in world agriculture. There are increasingly large surpluses in many of the major agricultural areas; there are record levels of wheat production; there has been a 35 per cent fall in the world price for wheat; and there has been a substantial increase in agricultural subsidies over the last year. The report concentrates very much on these subsidies and provides a damning indictment of the way in which these subsidies have corrupted world trade in agriculture. The report points out that the cost to taxpayers and consumers of these subsidies and transfers in the OECD countries rose by 12 per cent in 1990 to the figure cited by my colleague, that is, $US299 billion. Of the various major users of these subsidies, for the EC12 the subsidies amounted to $US 13 3 billion; for the United States, $US74 billion; and $US59 billion for Japan. The report points out that Australia and New Zealand are the only two countries with agricultural sectors which respond predominantly to market signals. They have by far the lowest subsidies of all OECD countries-we have some $US700m in subsidies and New Zealand has $USlOOm. The report stresses the prospects for trade in agricultural commodities in the immcdiate future and through this decade being closely linked with a successful Uruguay Round outcome, and it warns of the dangers of failure. I will quote paragraphs 8 and 9, which I believe should be used by all members of this Parliament to push the case, because here we have an independent body of the OECD which presents very clearly the case which we have been arguing in international fora for the last five years: The implications of the foregoing for trade in agricultural commodities are closely linked with the outcome of the Uruguay Round of international trade ncgotiations. A successful outcome resulting in significant reform of agricultural policy in the direction of a greater role for market signals in guiding pro duction and consumption decisions will generate adjustments in supply and demand. The result will be a simultaneous reduction in trade tensions and an easing in the economic burdcn currently being borne collectively by consumers and taxpaycrs. It contrasts that hopeful scenario with the other, as follows: . . . should the Uruguay round fail to deliver significant reform, the consequences are potentially extremely serious and furthermore are not just confined to the agricultural sector. Solutions in many other areas which are of crucial importance to the economic well-being of the world and a positivc outcome to the agricultural trade negotiations are inter-linkcd. The impacts, should an overall solution not be found, include a contraction in the rates of growth of world trade and national income; an increased risk of regional trading blocs and discriminatory bilateral arrangements; a further escalation in trade tensions and a continuing reluctance to open markets to developing countries and to the central and eastern European economies, thus depriving them of an important source of economic growth. It concludes by stating: It is certain that these problems will not go away and can only worsen if reform is . . . delayed. In this regard, I welcome very much the overnight OECD communique from Paris which confirms that all participants, including the European Community, are now willing to negotiate to achieve specific commitments on domestic support, market access and export competition. But we have heard those words before. Now is the time for action. In the next two or three months, we do need to see progress on the European Community side in genuine commitment to the reform process in agriculture. Moreover, there could be no clearer evidence for the consumers and taxpayers of Europe than the cost to them of agricultural protection in Europe. I am now considering proposals for how Australia might hclp in getting that message across to the European consumers. Mr Downer-I ask that the Minister table the OECD report, given its general interest, I am sure, to all honourable members.",79

108,Mr HOWE,HOUSING AGREEMENT,"In March I offered to bring forward some $842m in payments to the States under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. This offer is intended to encourage the States and Territories to bring forward their housing construction programs. This will be a significant benefit to the building industry at a time of low levels of building activity. The payments will be made in two lump sums on 1 July and 1 October 1991 instead of monthly. The Housing Industry Association estimates that this offer can generate a total of 12,500 jobs. The governments in Victoria, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Westcrn Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have responded positively; I expect to hear positively from the other State governments in the near future. It is conditional on this offer that and Territory governments agree to maintain the employment of apprentices, to use any gains for housing purposes and to make their plans consistent with the agreed objectives of the housing Ministers to improve the form and structure of Australian cities. This is an important initiative, going as it does with the employment figures today, and a commitment to ensuring that the industry has a higher level of activity, that skills are maintained within that industry and that any further development is consistent with the Government's plans in respect of Australian cities.

111,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,Order! I warn the honourable member for Gippsland. HIV-AIDS TREATMENT,81
112,Ms MCHUGH,INFORMATION,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Community State Services and Health and relates to the provision of drugs for AIDS treatment. The Minister would be aware of continuing criticism about delays in implementing the recommendations of the December 1990 report of the Australian National Council on AIDS working party on the availability of HIV-AIDS treatments. Can the Minister inform the House of progress in relation to this report and any other actions taken to examine the drug trial and marketing approval processes? Mr HO\VE-I am very conscious of the concern of the honourable member for Phillip for people living with AIDS and with the whole issue as it affects people not only in her electorate but also in the wider Australian community. I would like to say that today's demonstration was associated with the issue of AfDS and a group called ACTUP which is concerned to draw dramatically to our attention problems, as its members see them, about drugs in particular. I draw to the attention of all honourable members an issue about which each of us is concerned and about which we have had a great degree of absolutely necessary bipartisanship in the Parliament. Today is the tenth anniversary of the diagnosis of the first case of HIV - AIDS in the United States (US). As pcople know, Australia has an excellent record in dealing with AIDS. I think that is due in part to our health insurance system, our excellent health care and the fact that we were abJe to establish a partnership between the first-class research done in this country in the relevant disciplines and the community organisations that have worked very closely with those researchers to get the message of prevention out to the community. Concerns about treatment were raised some time ago, and in the middle of last year the Government established through ANCA-the Australian National Council on Aids-a working party to look at the issue of treatment. That was chaired by Professor Peter MCDonald from Flinders University and his report included many recommendations, almost all of which have been implemented already by the Government. The Government has taken action to introduce a clinical trials notification scheme to run parallel with existing clinical trials, allowing institutional ethics committees the power to approve clinical trials. Wc have modified the individual patient usage scheme to enable doctors in major hospitals to approve drugs; we have revised individual importation arrangements, allowing noninjectable drugs for personal use, provided they arc prescribed by medical practitioners. Along with those changes in terms of trials, we have had to approve new committees, such as the Clinical Trials and Treatment Advisory Committee, and Community AI DS Trials Networks that enable us to decentralise the availability of drugs and to put them within the proper disciplined and supcrvised context. There has been criticism recently of the availability of drugs in Australia compared with the US. However, unlike the United States, Australia has a comprehensive system of medical care and treatment that is provided free to all citizens, not just those who can afford to pay for it. One needs to be aware that the approval system in this country is related to a commitment by the Government to pay the costs. Only onc treatment is presently approved in the United States to act specifically on the virus HIV, and that is the drug azidothymidine (AZT). This treatment is also approved in Australia with government subsidy; in the United States most people must pay to access the drug or go without it. The suggestion that around 100 drugs are available in the US compared to only seven in Australia is also misleading: most of these drugs are treatments for the opportunistic infections associated with HIV. Again, many of these arc available in Australia through a variety of measures. Some issues went bcyond the province of those specifically concerned with AZT but to more general issues of concern in drug evaluation. To meet those concerns-again with some promptness-the Government established the Baume review to look at the drug evaluation and access procedures. Professor Baume is well known to this Parliament, and he will report on those additional issues by 1 July. Finally, the issue of drug evaluation is one of getting access to the very best treatments available in the world as quickly as possible, but it is also a question of maintaining the safety of the Australian people. There is always some tradeoff between access and safety, and I am sure that Professor Baume will bear those twin objectives in mind. The Government will certainly give prompt attention to Professor Baume's report. I thank the House for its attention to an issue that causes a great deal of concern but which I believe the Parliament and the Government are addressing with a great deal of promptness. NA NA NA",81
113,Dr HEWSON,INFORMATION,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his two previous answers to questions from my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong.

116,Mrs KELLY,HUSKIES,"I thank the honourable member for Throsby for his question and for his great interest in this issue. I understand he is putting in his own request to have one of the dogs. Some time ago I explained to the House the details of the treaty that had been made in Madrid on the protocol for Antarctica. As part of that I explained that there had been an annex to the Protocol on the Conservation of Antarctic Flora and Fauna which included a ban on the introduction of dogs and calls for those presently in the treaty area to be removed by 1 April 1994. Australia, as one of the three nations which still use dogs in Antarctica, had held out in all the negotiations on this to retain them against strong opposition from the other countries. At the meeting in Chile in November 1990 Australia sought a provision which would provide for the importation of dogs necessary to maintain the genetic viability of existing stocks. At the Madrid meeting, howcver, the United Kingdom announced that it would be removing its dogs, as did Argentina. That left Australia absolutely isolated and we had no choice but to agree, if we wanted to get this protocol up, that we would actually remove the dogs. Mr Downer-What will happen to the dogs?",83
117,Mrs KELLY,HUSKIES,"I will get to that. Most treaty nations argued that it was difficult to stop the introduction of dogs to support private expeditions unless national operators also removed them. They were concerned about the introduction of disease and also about the possibility of dogs breaking free and attacking penguin colonies. Australia was faced with a situation in which it was pushing for a very stringent international agreement for the protection of the Antarctic environment. We have got that, but one of the areas in which we had to reach agreement with the other nations was the removal of these dogs. I recognise the traditional role that the dogs have played, both recreational and in terms of the support they have given the expeditioners. The Antarctic Division intends to examine all options to move the dogs in a way which minimises their stress and respects the traditional role that they have played. No dogs will be destroyed as a result of this decision. I rcpeat that: no dogs will be destroyed as a result of this decision. The preferred option is to repatriate the dogs as working teams. Further, very many people have indicated that they will be very pleased to look after them. Once all these options have been considered, the Antarctic Division will make its proposals public for further comment. The proposed outline will also be submitted to the committee which advises on Antarctic animal ethics-remembering, of course, that the date for removal is 1 April 1994. NA",83

I think the facts which were outlined by the honourable member for Dawson in his question-Dr Kemp-Is it a designer tie?",84
125,Mr BEAZLEY,STATES AND AUSTRALIA,"Calm down. I am buying the honourable member a wig next week. I suggest that he go on the Ray Martin Show as well; people do not know what they will get handed as they walk out the door. Capacity has increased by 16 per cent since 1988 on the South Pacific route. In this time total traffic between Australia and the US has increased by only 3 per cent. At present there are 58 flights per week in each direction on the South Pacific route to and from the US-24 by Qantas, 16 by Continental Airlines, 14 by United Airlines and four by American Airlines. Capacity arrangements between the US and Australia are market driven. The minimum entitlement per year per airline in these arrangements is an extra two B747s per week. Since 1988 one major US airline, American Airlines, and United Parcels Service have been approved to operate services on the South Pacific route. In answer to part of the honourable gentleman's question, Northwest Airlines is expected to commence service next week. Despite this market driven environment for capacity determination, we saw US visitor arrivals fall by over 18 per cent in 1989 and by 3 per cent in 1990 compared with previous years. There were 69,000 fewer visitors in 1990 compared with the number in 1988. In 1990 Australian residcnt departures totalled 299,000, which exceeded US visitor arrivals totalling 255,000. Capacity entitlements are well out in front of demand. There were approximately 9 million passengers in 1990, compared with negotiated seat entitlements of 18.5 million, and the gap is widening. There are some new services in the pipeline. In addition to the Northwest application, United Airlines has applied for an additional three services a week on the South Pacific route. T do not think anybody can complain about the capacity across the Pacific in terms of a requirement to provide additional services, but there is clearly something of a challenge which confronts our tourism operators and others concerned with bringing people into this country-a challenge to meet the capacity that is put on that route. I might say that if they do not do that, of course, the principal suffercr will be our national airline, Qantas, for which the trans-Pacific route is a very important onc. For the other United States airlines it is marginally costed and it is very much an increment to activities that they conduct elsewhere. The opportunities are there, and the tourism authorities would do this country and the national airline a great favour if they grasped the opportunities that are provided. !VII' Hawke-- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

The same people who disrupted the proceedings of the House conductcd a demonstration of sorts in the entrance foyer earlier today. This involved their occupying a prominent part of the foyer for a period of time. I ask whether you gave such approval and in consultation with whom. If so, what guidelines will apply in future for similar requests to hold demonstrations within the precincts of Parliament House?",85
129,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"No approval has been given to people to hold demonstrations in the precincts of the Parliament. I doubt whether the President and I would ever give approval for people to hold demonstrations in the building itself. I think all sides of the House accept that we should allow people to demonstrate outside the building, and we have done so in the past. It is often difficult, however, for the attendants, without using undue force, to deal with visitors who come into the Parliament and decide to have an ad hoc demonstration. There may have been a particular potential danger with some of the people demonstrating today and that had to be handled in a sensitive way. But I say again that I do not think any of us would want to restrict in any way the rights of Australians or others to come into this building as visitors or to come into this chamber to see the proceedings of the Parliament. People who do things such as those people did today infringe dramatically on the rights of other Australians who want to come to .see their legislature. Indeed, if in fact we have apprehended the people who jumped into the chamber, I think it would be my intention that we should have them prosecuted. I do not think that I would ever arrive at the conclusion that we should prosecute people for other things, but, if people have so little respect for this institution that they think they can just jump in here and disrupt the proceedings in that way, then the House should say in a very strong fashion that we will take action against them. But there has been no permission by either me or, I am sure, the President for any demonstration to be held in the building. I would be hard pressed to think of an occasion that would allow us to come to a conclusion that people could hold a protest in the building. There areas outside the building where we all expect protests to be able to occur, and in a democratic society they have every right to occur.

131,Dr HEWSON,HAWKE MINISTRY,"I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister and his Ministers, past and present, for their deplorable lack of integrity and their preoccupation with the current leadership struggle at a time of grave economic crisis. Mr Speaker, this has been a very sad week for Australian politics, not simply because the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has lost his job and not simply because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is in trouble-not at all, in fact, because the former Treasurer lost his job-but because the actions of both men have rent the very fabric of our political system. We know that politicians are not held in very high regard at the present time by the Australian people. That is a particularly big problem because all of us who are keen to see genuine economic reform and genuine change in this country recognise that the events of the last week have set that process of change and the Government's capacity for such change back a considerable amount of time, if not terminally. At a time when the people of Australia are crying out for leadership and good government, in the midst of the worse recession in 60 years, this Government has simply given them the worse political crisis since 1975. I guess the events of this week have only eroded what little Orders faith the Australian people had in us and our political system. Before this week, of course, Australians were already deeply disillusioned about politics, but they have been particularly shocked, I think, in the course of the last week to hear that the Prime Minister would blatantly lie to them in an election campaign. They have been appalled that the former Treasurer, who has plunged this country into the worse recession in 60 years would put his own ego and his own ambition ahead of their best interests and of course they have been dismayed in the last few days by a veritable parade of senior Ministers who have gone out there to rationalise the Prime Minister's lie and rationalise the wrecking tactics of the former Treasurer. Just when we need a government of particularly high integrity and a government that can provide the leadership that this country desperately needs, this Government has again significantly failed the people of Australia. I think it is instr!l-­ tive to go back to the events that ongInated just a week ago today and think about some of the incidents. that have occurred that clearly demonstrate the extent to which the integrity of this Government has evaporated; not surprisingly, the confidence of the people of Australia has evaporated with it. I go back to this time last week; it was the former Treasurer who went to see the Prime Minister. He did not go because of any fundamental policy difference with the Prime Minister. He did not go because he wanted to change the way they were trying to solve our economic problems or to put in place a genuine reform agenda or a strategy to get this country out of recession; he simply went there because of his ego and the impatience that had built up in him because of his inability to get his own way and to take control of this Government. In classic Jack Lang terms, I guess, Paul Keating was very much a wrecker. He had nothing more in mind than naked ambition and ego when he went into see the Prime Minister just a week ago. Yesterday I was fascinated to hear on radio one of his defenders this week, Senator Graham Richardson, who described these circumstances in a particular way. He said: I think Paul has handled himself with a special kind of dignity. A special kind of dignity! He is referring to the fact that the former Treasurer went into see the Prime Minister knowing he did not have the numbers, deliberately going in there simply to wreck this Government and the chances that this Government might have had to p-t in place policies that might turn thIS country around. Senator Richardson said: I think Paul has handled himself with a special kind of dignity throughout and it is difficult to maintain that, especially when y<;Ju know,. as he did last week that he wasn't gomg to Will. He knew he could do well but he knew he wouldn't win. What an appalling admission from one of the senior Ministers of this Government-who, quite surprisingly, continues to be a senior Minister of this Government, despite his duplicity and dishonesty as revealed in the course of the events of the last week. What an amazing admission that it took a special kind of dignity for a Jack Lang-style wrecker to walk into the Prime Minister's office and put the Government under a leadership challenge that he knew he could not win. Similarly, consider the nature of the deal that emerged in the course of those discussions and became public very soon thereafter: four people sit down at Kirribilli House-the Prime Minister and the ex-Treasurer then Deputy Prime Minister the two' most senior people in the G-vernment with two outsiders, the head of the trade 'union movement, Bill Kelty, and a close, large-business mate.' - ir Pet-r Abeles. They trade the prime mlllistership and they trade the future of this country as if it is just a sack of potatoes. They completely compromise the processes of their own Party and the basic tenets of our political system in putting that deal together. On the basis of that deal, they knowingly went out-both of the---nd ?eliberately misrepresented the SItuatIOn III the course of the last election campaign. So it is little wonder that the people of Australia, seeing the magnitude of - h- lie perpetrated by both the Prime MIll1ster and the ex-Treasurer have lost the little bit of confidence they' had left in our political system. They are staggered that the Pril?e Minister then was to go on and claIm that, in effect, his political suryival was more important than their best lllterests. Indeed, he has spent a large part of the last week! emphasising the fact that he would do anything in order to keep us out of government. He would misrepresent; he would lie; he would deliberately mislead the people of Australia, simply to ' ensure that he would win and we would lose and he could then stay in power just another term. It was an unbelievably appalling set of circumstances based on the ego and ambition of the ex-Treasurer and revealing the ego and ambition of the Prime Minister in the extent of the lie that was perpetrated on the people of Australia. When the Prime Minister then was under some pressure to explain and to justify his behaviour, we got just one day of explanation. On Tuesday there was an attempt to rationalise what had happened and why it had happened, and some very significant differences emerged between the explanations of the Prime Minister and his people and the ex-Treasurer and his people. It is important to note that the Prime Minister said a number of things by way of justification. One was that he had to do it to stop us getting into government, as I said before, and that he would do anything to stop that occurring. Secondly, he did not really ever intend to honour the deal with Paul Keating.",86
132,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE MINISTRY,Nonsense!,88
133,Dr HEWSON,HAWKE MINISTRY,"That was absolutely the thrust of what he said on many occasions. I will pick that up. In his press conference, for example, he said the following things: I did it reluctantly to keep him on because thought it was best that he stay on. we won . . . I would retire during the fourth term. . . . If I had gone to the electorate in saying I was only going to serve part of the and they were voting for Paul Keating, we not have won the election. . . . I was reluctant to do it because I had the profound belief that I would continue the one best able to lead this Government victory, and when 1 gave the commitment I must say that I hoped that as time went on during term that hethat is the ex-Treasurermay come to understand that. I would say that the Prime Minister never intended to honour the agreement bevival, tween himself and the ex-Treasurer. He not only lied to the people of Australia about the course of the 1990 election, he also deliberately misled the ex-Treasurer. He said that he reluctantly entered the agreement to keep the ex-Treasurer on, and he hoped to be able to convince him that he could stay on, as the ex-Treasurer would come to accept the position-the Prime Minister's view, anyway-that he was the best person to lead the Labor Party into successive elections. The Prime Minister not only lied to the people of Australia, he lied to his Treasurer as well. That was the second element of his explanation. The third one related to the national interest and the betterment of Australia, which the Prime Minister claimed to have put over personal interest. He drew a reference to his 30 years in public life and the extent to which he has always made phenomenal personal sacrifice on behalf of the people of Australia-another lie because, as far as I can see, surely his political survival is a very personal thing to him. Is that not what, after all, he put above the interests of the people of Australia in not being prepared to go to the last election and tell the people of Australia precisely the situation in terms of the leadership deal that had been struck between himself and the ex-Treasurer? So there are many examples on the Prime Minister's part and on the ex-Treasurer's part of a total lack of honesty and a total lack of integrity in circumstances where I the Australian economy is in the worse J said that if recession in 60 years. It is interesting, when one looks over 1990 the events of the last few days, how the term Prime Minister's senior colleagues have would divided up on the extent to which they are prepared to support him rather than then set themselves apart from him. The Minto be ister to whom the Prime Minister is to speaking at the table, the Minister for the Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), honourable members might have noticed, when asked a direct question today about whether he thought it was defensible to go out and misrepresent the circumstances for the sake of political surrefrained from answering the question. In fact, only two of the Prime Minister's colleagues, Senator Tate and Senator Button, have publicly dissociated themselves from his position. Scnator Tate said: I do not believe the end justilics the means, I never have. Senator Button said: · . . let me say that in the context of an election, politics is not a line art in which truth is always paramount. When he had slept on it, he said: · . . deliberately lying is not acceptable in public life, nor does the end justify the means in public life. That stands in sharp contrast to Senator Richardson, who has been out there giving the official view of what happened: · . . but he broke a prom ise, or whatever. In my view when you are putting the nation first as he believes he has, then I don't know if you want to put it as ""the end justifies the means"" - all I know is that the betterment or Australia will justify almost anything. We have a situation where the Ministers are clearly dissociating themselves from the Prime Minister's behaviour, with the exception of Senator Richardson. He is the only one, apart from the ex-Treasurer, who has come on side with the Prime Minister's explanation. The Minister for Community Services and Health, Senator Tate and Senator Button have now publicly either formally dissociated themselves from the Prime Minister's position or refused to make a statement in support of his position. The people of Australia should be in no doubt, however, that the loss of integrity and the extent of dishoncsty are not confined to the Prime Minister. Both the Prime Minister and the ex-Treasurer are equally guilty of that same type of behaviour. One of the disturbing features of the press in recent days has been the extent to which it is being painted as if the Prime Minister is more guilty than the ex-Treasurer when it comes to the issue of the loss of integrity and the extent of dishonesty. Of course, both of them lied in a very similar way to the Australian people. They lied about the recession. Remember those commitments that there would be no recession? And they lied about the deal, of course. Equally, both of them welshed on some aspect of the deal. Both of them also compromised the most senior office in this land, the office of Prime Minister, by having at that meeting Bill Kelty and Sir Peter Abeles, two outsiders, who were then put in a very unusual and powerful position, a holding position over this Government, and one that begs all sorts of questions as to what they were able to extract by maintaining their silence about that deal. Similarly, both the ex-Treasurer and the Prime Minister looked after themselves first. They have always put their personal interests and political survival ahead of the best interests of the nation, and here we have a clear-cut example of how that was the case. Both of them have mates in the union movement and mates in the business community, and both of them have paid out to those mates in one form or another over recent davs. There should be no doubt in the minds of the people of Australia that both the Primc Minister, Bob Hawke, and the ex-Treasurer, Paul Keating, are equally guilty of disloyalty and dishonesty right through this process. The suggestion that somehow the honourable member for Blaxland could be the saviour of this country must be the most difficult proposition that has ever been put by his supporters and they expect the Australian people to pick it up. Can honourable members imagine the suggestion that the honourable member for Blaxland could save this country? After all, they have admitted and Senator Richardson admitted that the Prime Minister and the ex-Treasurer have been one right through. The ex-Treasurer sat there and pulled the levers for eight years. He created the worse recession in 60 years in this country. He is equally guilty of misrepresenting the situation, as I have pointed out; indeed, his only claim to fame that has emerged in the course of the last week is that he is a successful parliamentary head kicker. The people of Australia do not want a successful parliamentary head kicker, with no particular qualifications for running this country beyond that, to deal with the worse circumtimes. stances in 60 years. Not only has the last week shown the extent to which dishonesty and disloyalty and a loss of integrity characterise this Government, but the most disturbing ture has been the extent to which the policy parameters of this Government now seem to be shifting. The one big change that came out of the minor reshuffle that followed the events of the last week was the ascendancy of the loony cendancy of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) to the position of Deputy Prime Minister. It is instructive to go back over some of the recent policy prescriptions of the Deputy Prime Minister in order to demprogress onstrate the extent to which he may push or may aim to push, and certainly bePremiers lieves he will push, government policy a particular direction. He was asked reotherwise cently, for example, about the circumstanjust ces that he saw in terms of the influence of the Left. He said: . . . So if you've got a crystal ball I would gest that you might well see in the 90's that the left of the party will not only be part of continuinfrastructure. ing labor governments but they will playa stronger role, make a greater contribution they did in governments in the 80's. He made that statement at the Press Club lunch recently, drawing attention to increasing significance of the left wing. The Prime Minister has survived leadership of this Party because of the deal that he struck with the Deputy Prime Minister and the loony Left. On the basis of that we can expect to see a number of significant changes which have been relating ferred to quite explicitly by the Deputy Prime Minister in recent days as he sought to differentiate his product from that of this Government. the ex-Treasurer. For example, do honourable members remember the occasion when he put forsector ward the recommendation for a capital gains tax to be imposed on the family home, to eliminate the capital gains exemption which he said he would not totally rule out? Then there is the issue Commonwealth-State relations where he is a known centralist and was very much at odds with the Prime Minister in earlier There was a suggestion that taxing and spending powers would be handed back to the States. What did we see yesterday, the first stage of the pay-out? An answer by the Prime Minister to a dorofeathy dix question on Commonwealth-State relations where he backed off at 1,000 miles an hour from the previously stated position on Commonwealth-State relations. The Deputy Prime Minister is already having his influence over policy at Left-the as a very important level. As honourable members might recall, there was a Premiers Conference last Friday. It got lost as a farce and a sideshow to the main event-the leadership challenge. Let us go back and see what little was made in the context of that Premiers Conference. In order to keep the quiet they were just bought off in and the whole process that might have been initiated was lost. It is not a question of Commonwealth-State relations either where the new Deputy Prime Minister may have some influence. He has also spoken in the past of massugsively increasing our investment in public He uses the word 'massive' much as the required increase on projects such than as railways, hospitals, sewerage and so on-major elements of his basic strategy to increase and broaden public sector the ownership in Australia. The new Deputy Prime Minister is going to have a hospithe tals and sewerage led recovery. Equally, on industry policy the Deputy Prime Minister has referred to selective assistance to picking winners, to targeting assistance to particular sectors, to stimucertain firms in particular parts of the economy. There is a very significant policy shift under way at present under Finally, he has drawn attention to the fact that he does not believe the public borrowing requirement is all that important and he does not see why it cannot be moved into the negative and tax kept in the negative. We have seen an outcome of the Prime Minister's very desof perate attempt to maintain power in the course of last week. The deal done with the left wing of the Party will, over time, see a significant shift in the direction of policy in this country and, in precisely the wrong direction from what is required in the most difficult economic circumstances in 60 years, we will see the Government-",88
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HAWKE MINISTRY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Reith-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,91
135,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"I do not think I have ever seen the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have less heart in moving a censure motion than I witnessed from him today. That is indeed putting it mildly. I will deal briefly with some of the things that the Leader of the Opposition has said and then go on to other matters which I regard as relevant. He has made the quite absurd allegation that I was involved in trading the prime ministership. I have had cause to say before that nothing of the sort was done. The determination as to who will lead the Australian Labor Party-and the history of this country shows that that is synonymous with saying who leads the Government is a matter for the Labor Party Caucus. Nothing that was done could, or was intended to, alter that fact. Mr Reith-Why did you do the deal?",91
136,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence. Why don't you reciprocate? It ill becomes those opposite to talk about people from outside the Parliament being involved in discussions about leadership. I simply ask them to cast their minds back to the period of the ascension of Malcolm Fraser. The papers were full of the meetings in Melbourne with people who had nothing to do at all with the parliamentary party being involved in discussions as to who would be the next leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. is an act of complete hypocrisy for the Leader of the Opposition to be saying that it is unusual for someone outside the actual parties in this Parliament to have any interest or involvement in discussions which may touch on these issues. The most important thing is to repudiate the outrageous allegation that was made by the Leader of the Opposition in the course of this most uninspiring speech when he said of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and me, in respect of the two gentlemen who were present at Kirribilli-that is, Bill Kelty and Sir Peter Abeles-that we have both paid out to our mates. I regard that as one of the most despicable allegations that could be made against the honourable member for Blaxland and me-that in respect somehow for their presence at this meeting the honourable member for Blaxland and the Prime Minister have, in some way or another, incurred some obligations in which we have paid out to them. I repudiate that allegation absolutely. It does no credit whatsoever to the Leader of the Opposition. When this thing is washed out, as it will be, it is the making of that sort of allegation which will leave the stain on that side of the House, not on this. As I had cause to say in answer to a question yesterday, if there is one Prime Minister or one government that Sir Peter Abeles and his organisations have cause not to like, it is this Government and this Prime Minister. I will not take up the time of the House on this occasion by repeating the details which I gave, but I notice that once I gave that answer there was no rejoinder from the other side, because the facts which I put were absolutely devastating in terms of repudiating that proposition. Nor is there any way in which either the honourable member for Blaxland or I have paid out to Bill Kelty. I plead guilty, and I believe that if my friend the honourable member for Blaxland were here he would plead guilty, to the fact that we have done a deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I have made that point in this House on It many occasions. It is a deal of which I am proud and for which the Australian people are grateful. It was simply a deal which brought to an end the years of drastic, disastrous confrontation which characterised the conduct of policy by conservative government which treated workers and their organisations as enemies. On the other hand, I came to government in 1983 on the specific promise of an accord, of a deal done with the trade union movement. It was a deal done with the very deliberate intention of saying that it is much more likely that in this country the entirely legitimate aspirations of working-class men and women, on the one hand, to maintain and improve their conditions of employment and of employers, on the other hand, to increase their profitability will be achieved in a situation where we can have an agreement under which the trade union movement will not seek to flex its industrial muscle to the limit but will be prepared to take lower money wages than it otherwise could have obtained in return for improvements in the social wage. Put in the simplest of economic terms, that meant the Government, the taxpayers, picking up some of the wages bill of the employers of this country. That meant that we were able to have a lower inflationary situation than we otherwise would have had. I remind particularly the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who is at the table-and it is a fact which I have put before-that this occurred in this country as the result of the deal which the former Treasurer and J did with the trade union movement. As a result of that deal which we did, we have been able to have under this Government a rate of employment creation four times higher than those opposite had under their period of government. That is the result of the deal that the honourable member for Blaxland, in his former capacity as Treasurer, and I and others of my colleagues did with the trade union movement. That is the nature of the deal, and J am proud of that deal. But not only am J proud of it; in 1983 I went to the people of Australia with it as a proposal and they endorsed it. I went to them again in 1984, 1987 and 1990 and said, 'You have the alternatives, the electorate of Australia has the alternatives of that deal, that arrangement of cooperation between the trade union movement and the Government, or the Opposition's policy of confront ation'-and four times in a row they have said that they want that deal, they want that arrangement, because they have seen the benefits which come to this country, not only in terms of what I have said in regard to four times the higher employment rate of growth, but also a 60 per cent reduction in industrial disputation, an 11 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs, and a rate of employment growth twice as fast as the rate anywhere else in the world. Do I have to say to the Australian people that J apologise for that deal with the trade union movement? I do not. r am proud of it, and so is my Government; and we will continue, when we go to the next election in 1993, to say, 'Here is the alternative that you have. You have the alternative of a return to the confrontation of the past, or you have the alternative of adherence to a structured, reasonable, honourable arrangement between the Government and the trade union movement'. So I repudiate this thoroughly unworthy observation by the Leader of the Opposition that either the honourable member for Blaxland-Mr Ruddock-Are you sure you've got your heart in it?",91
137,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"I have not only got my heart in it; I have my mind in it, which is more than the Leader of the Opposition had. I repudiate his thoroughly unworthy observation that, in some way or another, I and the honourable member for Blaxland had paid out. Of course, he also threw in the observation that I had not intended to keep my promise. When I challenged him, he said, 'Well, let me look it up'. He went to all his records there and he could not find anything to sustain his proposition, because there is nothing to sustain it. Having disposed of, as I say, the quite pathetic and, indeed, thoroughly unworthy observations of the Leader of the Opposition, just let me go on to say something about the facts as far as the Opposition is concerned and the responsibility of government and of attempting to get government. There is no greater responsibility here, I believe, that any of us has, whether in government or opposition, than the responsibility to advance the best interests of the Australian people. I suggest that no-one can legitimately aspire to or retain the prime ministership, unless he or she is 100 per cent dedicated to advancing those interests. The mistake that the conservative parties have made in this country, as they have repeatedly made throughout the 1980s, is to assume that they were born to rule. That is the assumption that they have made: that they deserved to rule and all they had to do was to wa.it for government to fall in their laps. They say, for instance, that I robbed them of government in 1990. Let me say this to them: they had the chance of beating me. They had the opportunity, It was a long campaign. I stood up there and I was prepared to have a debate with their Leader. I had the debate with him. They had the campaign. It is as though they are trying to say that there was some trick whereby I wiped out an election campaign and we just did not have an election in 1990. They had an opportunity, and the simple fact is I was too bloody good for themas I will be in 1993. Mr Charles inteljecting",92
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HAWKE MINISTRY,Order! I warn the honourable member for La Trobc!,93
139,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"Let me say that the truth that the Opposition parties ignore with motions such as this is that winning and retaining the right to govern in this country involves more than just making the assumption that they have the right to rule. It involves showing to the people of Australia that they are capable of governing and that they are dedicated to advancing the best interests of the Australian people. Through all of the 1980s now they still have not learned that truth. They are still guilty of complacency. They are still not prepared to do the hard work of opposition. If there is one thing that characterises us on this side of the House it is that in opposition we were prepared to do the hard work of preparing for government. It was a matter of great pride for me when I came into this place in 1980-and I am a relatively recent member of this place, as honourable members would know-to see how the then Opposition was doing the hard yakka. Mr Tim Fischer-Bill Hayden did the hard yakka.",93
140,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"Yes, under the leadership of Bill Hayden. That is right; I have never ignored that and I have publicly paid tribute to him for the leadership he . gave. We did the hard work. We did not insult the intelligence of the Australian people by saying that, just because we were in opposition and those opposite had been there for some time, we were entitled to get government by default. We knew that we had to work for it. But those opposite will never do that. They sit over there election after electiort. How could it be that, from 1983 to 1990, they went all that time and into the 1990 election without a health policy? Do they think that had anything to do with them not winning a 1990 election? Do they think that had something to do with it? Here we had a Minister then, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), who had furnished the Australian people with a functioning, relevant health policy. Those opposite had all that period of time, seven years, to develop an alternative. But they are so insulting to the Australian people that, after seven years, they were not prepared to do the hard work of saying, 'Here is an alternative health policy'. They had to go in there and say, 'We're sorry, we haven't got one'. That is what elections are about. That is what winning elections are about. It is about preparing for elections with alternative, relevant, viable policies-not sitting there and thinking that, by making some snide accusation, the government of this country is going to fall into their laps. Of course, in this case, those opposite have had their roundabout of PeacockHoward-Peacock-Howard. They now have the man whom I call 'the bubble blower'. He thinks he can just blow a few more bubbles and fudge the details of his own disastro-s policy prescriptions-or 'predispositions', as he is inclined to call them-but never answer the important question of detail. He can say, 'I'm going to impose a broad-based consumption tax; take in another $12 billion by the imposition of a broad-based consumption tax on the people of this country', but thinks he can get away with not spelling it out; not saying what that means; not telling the people in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan Australia, rural Australia, how much more they are going to pay not only for their goods but also for their services. That is the characteristic of conservatism in this country-the characteristic that they were born to rule, in their view, and that they do not need to spell out. They will not get there in that way. They have no chance. We have demonstrated to them in the 1980s that the Australian electorate is much more sophisticated than that. If those opposite think that I have any fear or worry about going to the Australian electorate in 1993, having kept my commitment to them that I will serve through the whole period of this Government, then they have got another think coming, because what we will see in 1993 is a very simple thing: we will see a government which has had to govern in difficult times and which grieves for the fact that some people have had to suffer-we take no pleasure in it-but which does not say to those who are suffering, 'We'll throw you off the dole in nine months', as those opposite say. And that will be the alternative: a government which has achieved enormous progress in restructuring this country with compassion, as against an alternative government which will seek to impose an additional $12 billion, to transfer billions of dollars in that way from the pockets of the poor into the pockets of the rich. I look forward to that election because, in 1993, as we have done through the 1980s, we will beat them again because we deserve to.",93
141,Mr REITH,HAWKE MINISTRY,"Flinders) (3.30 p.m.)What a pathctic performance: this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Prime Minister of those opposite, could not lie straight in bed. So much for the talk about Abeles's attitude to deregulation. Let us just put down a couple of points. I am glad those opposite have stopped to listen. On the claim about the defence of Abeles, I have here a clipping from the Sydney Morning Herald of 15 January 1987, which says: The head of Ansett Airlines, Sir Peter Abeles, has called for total deregulation of domestic aviation and the sale to private shareholders of Australian Airlines . . . So much for the pathetic defence on the Abeles point. On the question of policywho are thesc blokes kidding?-those opposite did not have any policies in 1983. They reckon they put a lot of hard work and effort into tax policy. What was their tax policy in 1983? It was one page and a promise that there would be no capital gains tax. Honestly, how can those opposite come in here and expect people to take them seriously with their claims today? Wc have had a week to 10 days of trcmendous turmoil in Australia's political life; we have had a Prime Minister who has been in office for eight years and who has long prided himself on his claims of integrity and honesty; and at the start of this week we had a clear public admission from the Prime Minister that he went into the 1990 election living a lie. It was not just the Prime Minister but the for-. mer Treasurer and two others. I say to those opposite that if they had an ounce of decency they would admit that that was a lie, that that was wrong, that the Australian public has been deceived. This Prime Minister ought to have come in here this week and issued an apology to the Australian people for his conduct. There is an air of unreality about these people who have said publicly this week, 'You are entitled to lie to the Australian public to ensure that you, as a political party, are returned to office'. Essentially, the Prime Minister has not backed off from that basic proposition. It is the Australian Labor Party credo on how to run elections. In the economic debate, it is said that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. That has certainly been positively subsumed by the pack of lies that have been revealed about the Labor Party's conduct in recent times. Even today, lies are still being told. We have the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the failed former Treasurer, who publicly says that there is no challenge. There is nobody in this building today who believes that there is no challenge against the swinging carcass of the Prime Minister. Honourable members on the other side were meeting last night at the house of the environment Minister to talk about the leadership. We have the blokes opposite plotting openly in the corridors: they are not just talking to themselves, they are even talking to the Opposition about the numbers that they are getting. Cabinet Ministers are going on the air publicly declaring their support for the honourable member for Blaxland. It is incredible that these people could claim that they can maintain some standard of honesty and integrity in public life when we have the living lic sitting on the back bench plotting his challenge, plotting his return. The facts speak clearly for themselves. To go back to 1990 and to the deal preceding it, the Kirribilli conspiracy is one of the greatest lies ever pcrpetrated on the Australian public. It is for that simple reason that we today, in this censure motion, call the Government to account. We call upon not just the Prime Minister but past and present Ministers to explain their conduct in the circumstances leading to the Kirribilli conspiracy and the cheating and fraudulent nature of their 1990 election cam paign. The one person who has not come into this chamber this week, but who ought to, is none other than the failed Treasurer because, of course, in the conspiracy he was the co-conspirator with the Prime Minister. It was he in fact who was the beneficiary of that deal at Kirribilli House. Furthermore, it was his blind personal ambitions which brought that meeting to fruition and which extracted the deal from the Prime Minister. Firstly, if the honourable member for Blaxland has any scmblance of respect for this Parliament, he ought to come in and explain his actions at the Kirribilli House deal; he ought to explain his actions in lunging the knife at the Prime Minister; and he ought to come in and explain, thrbugh the Parliament, to the people of Australia his motives for running his campaign now for the prime ministership in the next few months. I say to the ex-Treasurer, the failed Treasurer: the public is entitled to know why he personally lived a lie in the 1990 election. Many in the press gallery would have us believe, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said, that the former Treasurer is lilywhite, that his hands are clean of the Kirribilli conspiracy. That is clearly not true. It was to his personal benefit that that deal be kept a secret so that he could get his hands on the reins of power following the 1990 election. I say that the public deserves a clear explanation. Secondly, he ought to come in and explain the difference between his version of events about the Kirribilli conspiracy and the Prime Minister's. It is not good enough that this Parliament should rise this week for the winter recess with a clear difference of opinion existing, a clear difference in the factual circumstances arising and leading up to the Kirribilli conspiracy. The Prime Minister has said publicly: The faet is that that meeting was the initiative of Bill Kelty and the people at it were the initiative of Bill Kelty. That is what the Prime Minister has said, yet the former failed Treasurer says that it was a three-step process, that Sir Peter Abeles was at the meeting at the invitation of the Prime Minister and that Bill Kelty was invited to go to the meeting by the failed Treasurer. When the Prime Minister and the failed Treasurer-the former Deputy Prime Minister-get together and do a deal to trade the prime ministership of this country, the public is entitled to an explanation of what their motives were, what their reasons were, and a full explanation of their conduct leading up to that meeting. It is wrong that this Parliament should rise without a clear explanation of those circums-nces. Thirdly, the failed Treasurer ought to come in because there is a glaring discrepancy between what he says and what he did. I refer particularly to the fact that in the 1990 election the failed Treasurer was very specific in his assertions that there was no deal. He said one thing and did another. I say to him that he ought to give this Parliament an explanation of his conduct. Only a week ago, on the leadership issue, he said to the Parliament that the leadership: . . . will be an issue of relevance on our side of politics only when the Prime Minister deigns it to be. On the face of it, on the facts as we know them, that was a blatant lie, a blatant misleading of this Parliament. I say to the ex-Treasurer that he has an obligation to come into this Parliament. It looks like a lie, it smells like a lie and it definitely sounds like a lie. Is it a lie? He ought to come in and explain himself. He wants to be the next Prime Minister-he is campaigning to be the next Prime Ministerso he has an obligation to this Parliament. Fourthly, what reasons does the next Prime Minister give for breaching his undertaking not to release details of the Kirribilli conspiracy? The deal was that it was a secret deal. What is his justification? Is it that two wrongs make a right? Is that the core of his breach of a confidence with the Prime Minister? If so, we are entitled to ask ourselves: is this man as morally bankrupt as the Prime Minister who now occupies that post? Why should we not assume that his actions amount to nothing more than a faithless betrayal of trust to advance his own cause? This week even the London Economist, which judges the circumstances from afar, comes to the conclusion that the ex-Treasurer's action could be justified only by personal ambition. That is a charge now made against him not only in this Parliament but broadly in the community, in Australia and abroad. He owes this Parliament an explanation. The onus is on him to prove otherwise. Fifthly, people are entitled to ask: why did the ex-Treasurer accede to a veto being given to Sir Peter Abeles and Bill Kelty? This was political dynamite. If any witnesses to this deal had let it be known publicly that the deal was on-that it had been made-that would have brought the Government down. In other words, Bill Kelty and Sir Peter Abeles had in their hands the future of the Government of Australia. people are entitled to know what it was that drove these people to come to a meeting, to do a deal and to give that sort of power to the head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a millionaire businessman . What magnitude of personal ambition would possess the then Treasurer to give such people such a hold over a democratically elected Govcrnment? How could he? The members of the press gallery would tell us that he is a great political strategist and a great campaigner. How could he not have seen the implications of the involvement of those two people? Was it simply blind ambition that prevented him from seeing the consequences and the implications of his own actions? I say that the Parliament properly deserves an explanation for his motives in bringing those people to a meeting and concurring with it. I also ask, on behalf of members of Caucus: why did the ex-Treasurer and the Prime Minister treat the Caucus with such contempt? Caucus members ought to ask themselves why it is that they sit there and allow the prime ministership to be simply the plaything of the failed Treasurer and the Prime Minister? What sort of personal fiefdom do these people consider the prime ministership to be? What do their actions say about their real attitude to Caucus members? I say that prima facie they show the absolute arrogance and contempt that these people have for democratically elected institutions, and Caucus members ought to take that up with the Prime Minister. The Caucus itself is entitled to an explanation, and I demand it on behalf of those members of Caucus. Seventhly, we are also entitled to know whether or not a lie was told in the 1987 election. There is a very revealing story by Richard Farmer which suggests that there had been a deal before the 1987 election, and I reckon it has a ring of truth to it. I think it explains the Prime Minister's private comments around the Parliament such as, 'Surely Paul knew that (the Prime Minister) would not honour the 1988 deal. Surely Paul would know'. Why would he know? Because the Prime Minister had breached the agreement back in 1987. Why did Farmer write it? Farmer is close to the Prime Minister, as everybody knows. What is the Prime Minister trying to do? He is just trying to build up the story, 'Surely Paul would know. Surely he's not so naive as to understand that, having been dudded once, he would not be dudded again'. It fits as well, because why did they want witnesses the second time around? We know old Paul: once bitten, twice shy. Therc is no parallel to these events in the Australian Parliament. The only parallel I can think of goes baek to the days of the fall and decline of the Roman Empire, when Caligula made his horse a senator and promised him the top job. The only difference is that the horse never believed him. I say that this Government deserves to be censured. It treats the Australian public with absolute contempt. It lied through its teeth to get into office. It has said publicly that it is entitled to lie to the Australian public to gain office. For that, it deserves absolute censure, and I invite honourable members to vote for the censure when the question is put shortly.",94
142,Mr HOWE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"We have just heard from the Opposition two puerile, facile speeches, full of cant, full of hypocrisy, full of the of morality that one has come to expect from someone whose standard of thinking is little better than that of some Sunday school teacher in a Baptist Sunday school somewhere in the hillbilly country of the United States. They showed no sophistication, no understanding of what morality is about. We just heard the Uriah Heap of the Opposition, Uriah Reith of Stumpy Gully memory, of the kind of morality of the land deals in Victoria, who comes to this debate in terms of a history, in terms of deals, in terms of betrayals and backstabbing, in terms of the Opposition, which are unparalleled in the history of Australian politics. After all, how much were we prepared to talk about the kind of language that was used in a private conversation between Jeff Kennett and the honourable  kind of private conversation that went to what they thought of one another and what they thought of fellow leaders in the Liberal Party? My God! That was revealing; that was full of morality; that was full of the highest language; that was full of integrity! What about Johnny Howard-poor little Johnny Howard-the honourable member for Bennelong? Look at the support that he got. How often was he given a word of integrity, a word of morality or a word of support? We hear morality from the Opposition. What political group in this country has ever had the stature and standing to talk about morality that this miserable outfit that opposes us in this chamber has? Opposition members come in because there is talk of a deal, an agreement, because a few people got together in terms of what might happen in the Australian Labor Party and its processes. That is made so much of because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is the second longest serving Prime Minister within this country. It is made much of because the Prime Minister and the former Treasurer were probably the most significant political combination that we have seen in the postwar period. It is made much of bekind cause the Opposition does not want to deal with underlying and substantive issues, because it does not want to display its own lack of integrity in terms of policy and confronting the real issues of this country. That is why Uriah Reith-that person who whinges and whines every day in Question Time-is unable to substantively argue for any policy issue. He is probably the most empty shadow Treasurer that we have seen in the history of this country. He is someone who is quite unable - to defend his position anywhere except in a situation in which he is not under question and scrutiny. He certainly could not hold a press conference and defend himself against critical debate and in terms of how his theories stand up. So he talks about the Government in terms of what we may not have achieved. I will tell the Opposition what we have achieved. We have been able to go out and talk about wages policy, with all of the difficulties that that has involved. Against the record of Opposition members in terms of wages policy, with the massive blow-out of 1982-83, we have been able to put a wages policy in place in this country which has allowed us to resist inflationary pressure, which has allowed us to achieve restructuring in industry, which has allowed us to achieve an employment record absolutely unparalleled in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nationsa wages policy that has enabled us to continue expanding the economy when so many other countries have been pulling their economies back. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about morality. What about the morality of the Opposition's failure to face up to taxation reform during the years his Party has been in opposition? It got to the point where the Opposition had to appoint a royal commission, which unfortunately went into areas that those opposite never anticipated. In terms of the heart and integrity of the previous Government, one of the few growth industries was the taxation industry. We saw rort after rort uncovered by the Deputy Leader's mates who are into tax avoidance on such a scale that we found large sections of the establishment effectively paying no tax. That is a record of taxation reform involving difficult issues that the Opposition was unable to face up to. I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition resents the capital gains tax, as indeed the land-holders in his electorate no doubt resent it. But at least it is fair. The Opposition resented every piece of taxation reform, whether it related to fringe benefits, entertainment tax or the foreign tax credit system. Whatever the Government did to remove the ramps and the rorts, members of the Opposition found no friends, no allies, no morality and no integrity. That is the reality in terms of politics in this country. When it comes to a hard decision, where is the Opposition? It is absent because it is full of members with weak spines. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is leading a party that is made up of people with very weak spines. ' Again and again the Deputy Leader comes into this chamber and talks about the need to cut back on social security. Inevitably, he would cut back on those people who are most defenceless and disadvantaged and who have the least clout. Again, that indicates something of his intestinal fortitude and his guts in terms of morality. His guts have no substance whatever when a hard decision is involved in the very tricky and difficult area of morality. Someone said to me last night that if we look at a country's taxation and social security system we see what its morality is all about; we see what it is about as a society. If we look at the Liberal Party we would be ashamed to see its values reflected in Australian society. Its values are about protection of privilege and about transferring responsibility from the strong to the weak, not the reverse.",97
143,Unknown,HAWKE MINISTRY,Opposition members interjecting,98
144,Mr HOWE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"Honourable members opposite can be upset about it, but they should look at their record in terms of taxation reform. It is an abysmal record. They should look at their record in terms of protecting people who are weak at a time of high unemployment. The Opposition reduced the level of payments. For families with children it reduced them even more substantially. For sole parent families with children it reduced those payments even more substantially again. The Liberal Party is a party without morality or ethics and without a commitment to integrity in terms of policy. It has the hide to come in here and have the Baptist Sunday School teacher who leads it spin a story, a parable, about morality. That parable about morality says nothing ultimately about the commitment of this Party to reform and social justicc and to putting in place an approach to policy which has some fundamental integrity. Let us look at another area which indicates the morality and the ethics which drive the so-called Liberal Party. Let us look at the area of manufacturing industry, an area in which for years we saw Liberal governments defending the privileged, defending sectional interests and holding up by way of protection industries that were no longer competitive, could no longer survive and could no longer help to maintain the productivity and standards of living of Australian people. The Opposition was captive to sectional interests. We should compare that with this Government which. since 1983, has been prepared to bring' about the most fundamental rcforms in terms of tariffs of any government in the history of this country and integrate the Australian economy with the world economy. It has been prepared to tackle the issue of competitiveness, in a way that has required immense courage, against all of the concerns and sometimes disadvantage caused to people who work in those industries. I speak with some passion in terms of my electorate and the Prime Minister's electorate. We are well aware that when we make a change in relation to tariffs, that affects real people. It affects migrant workers in the clothing and textile industries. It sometimes affects workers who have built up skills and who have had their whole lives-and perhaps the lives of their fathers and grandfathers-built around the boots and trades industries of the Fitzroys, the Collingwoods and the Northcotes. We know what that means but we have been prepared to make that decision because it is moral and because it is right and good for this country. The Deputy Leader spoke about morality and ethics. I have never heard such cant and hypocrisy. Members of the Opposition run from the chamber-as indeed they ought to run from the chamber-to build up the great sense that somehow there is some moral crisis because members of a political party meet somewhere and make some agreement. As if that was the essence of what political morality is about! That is what the members of the Opposition would like morality to be about. They would likc to say that it is about thosc kinds of paradigms, rather than the tougher policy paradigms that they have never been able to come to terms with. I refer to the paradigm of the two-airline agreement. What a cosy relationship. It went on, government after government. We went from leader to leader-Menzies to Gorton to Holt to Fraser and so on. It was always too hard for members of the Opposition to handle. Even when Sir Reg had gone, it was too hard to handle. That is moral fortitude. It was absolute moral fortitude to leave a cosy relationship like that, a relationship that virtually printed money for Ansctt through all those years because members of the Opposition did not have the guts or the political courage to take it on because it was a hard issue. We have heard recently in this Parliament talk about watcrfront reform. The Government has recognised that waterfront reform and shipping is an area of fundamental structural change. Unlike our opponents, we have been prepared to take it on, no matter how difficult it may be and no matter how hard the decisions are. Opposition members-Ha, hal",98
145,Mr HOWE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"Again, members of the Opposition laugh. How many of their friends or people who belong to the Liberal Party or who are associated with it have worked on the wharves and in the ships and seen how hard it is to work under the conditions that historically applied to those industries? Mr Downer-For goodness sake, Brian. It's not hard.",99
146,Mr HOWE,HAWKE MINISTRY,The honourable member says that it is not hard. The honourable member would not have done a day's work in his life. He is one of the silver spooners characteristic of members of the Opposition. Reform is difficult. Reform is a matter of morality. It is a matter of a deeper kind of morality and a deeper understanding of ethics than the Baptist Sunday School teacher gave us today. Mr Downer-Do you hate Baptists? Do you dislike Baptists?,99
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HAWKE MINISTRY,Order! The member for Mayo!,100
148,Mr HOWE,HAWKE MINISTRY,The Baptist Sunday School teacher gets all excited about fibs. Mr Downer-Are you a Methodist? Is that it? The Methodists don't like the Baptists?,100
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HAWKE MINISTRY,I warn the member for Mayo.,100
150,Mr HOWE,HAWKE MINISTRY,"If he had listened to the Kennett tape he would not have been able to stand it because he would have heard the swear words that Kennett used about the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong. That is the level of morality we find in the Opposition. It says, 'Don't drink, don't swear, don't tell fibs'. It is not a morality that is about political policy-about spelling out a future for this country. The Prime Minister made a commitment to the Australian people that was about the politics of this country over a period of time. He made a commitment to pursue that politics within the Labor Party and within our tradition. He has remained as the leader of the Labor Party and he has been re-elected this week as leader of the Labor Party. It may cause the Opposition considerable chagrin that the Prime Minister continues to be the leader of this Party, given his standing and his capacity to move amongst the Australian people and gather support. It is not his morality that worries 1I.lembers of the Opposition. It is the fact that he is a strong political figure who, over four elections, has proved stronger than they. He is the second longest serving Prime Minister in this country's history. He is someone who has been able to embrace and translate Labor values, values that mean something to those people who have voted Labor over the years right throughout this country-votes that are about putting our own interests aside and looking to the interests of the country. We belong to a proud tradition that very often has been prepared to inflict hardship on our own supporters for the purpose of achieving change and for the purpose of achieving a better country. Opposition members belong to a party that has a history of avoiding hard decisions because it is intimidated and fascinated by privilege. At the end of the day, their inheritance is not about producing a better society but a more unequal society, a backward society, a society that is unable to pursue in this world a competitive economy necessary to maintain Australian living standards into the twenty-first century.",100
151,Mr TIM FISCHER,HAWKE MINISTRY,"The tone of this Parliament has been lowered yet again by the comments of the new Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) in attacking an office holder of this Parliament on the basis of his professed religious worship. I have been in this Parliament for a number of years and I was in the State Parliament in Macquarie Street during the Wran years at their worse, and I have never heard a member's religion enter into debate before. Shame on this Deputy Prime Minister for raising the question of an office holder's religion, and raising it repeatedly in the context he did. If he had any decency, at the end of this debate he would apologise for having done so. I will respond to one other point made by the Deputy Prime Minister, and that is in relation to his claim that the coalition has I never risen to the occasion to provide support for this Government on difficult decisions. I will mention two key areas. The first is the matter of deeming with respect to pensions. When this matter was first raised under the Fraser Government by then Minister Chaney, now the honourable member for Pearce, the Labor Party Opposition mounted an enormous emotional attack and managed effectively to delay proceedings at that time. This time around, the Liberal and National parties have adopted a very responsible approach to the controversial and complex policy issue of deeming. It does the Deputy Prime Minister little credit to come in here and not acknowledge that our position on deeming has been a correct one and has effectively helped the Government, when we need not have done so, because we recognised what was in the national interest. If honourable members want a better example, I turn to the Gulf war. There was more support for the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Gulf war from this side of the House than there was from the left wing, which sidled up to the Prime Minister in the vote last Monday. Indeed, we gave total bipartisan support in respect of the Gulf war. Some of us even made the effort to go to the Gulf and visit our contingent during the build-up to the ground war. It does the Deputy Prime Minister little credit yet again not to acknowledge those two key areas of deeming and the Gulf war in which we extended full bipartisan support. I give credit to the Prime Minister on this one matter: he has acknowledged that bipartisan support on a number of occasions. We are a responsible Opposition. We have responded responsibly, and we do so on this occasion, with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) laying down this very correct motion at the end of the parliamentary sitting week to test the fides of this Government once and for The truth of the matter is that we now have a lame duck Prime Minister; we now have a sitting duck Prime Minister; in fact, we have a dead duck Prime Minister who has lied to the Australian people and who should pay the price. The latest round commenced last Thursday, as the Leader of the Opposition stated, in response to the wrecking ego of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), when he marched into the office of the Prime Minister at about five o'clock on that day. I just happened at that time to be delivering a personal letter to the Prime Minister, and I could not get out of the office quickly enough in the circumstances. 1 simply say that the latest round has had two immediate ramifications. First, it has knocked out the decision-making timetable of this Cabinet with regard to Coronation Hill. The country is crying out for a decision on Coronation Hill. The mining industry has a right to know what this Cabinet will decide about Coronation Hill after 2112 years of reports, deliberations and investigations. Finally, we had the Cabinet moving up to the start line last Thursday night, but not even the failed Treasurer could stand the heat of that decision. He chose his knockout round, just two hours ahead of that Cabinet meeting, to destroy the Cabinet meeting on Coronation Hill. Here we are, one week later, and still there is no decision on Coronation Hill. I do not know where you stand on that issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I know where your electors stand. They are interested in jobs and a sensible, balanced decision-making process. They want to see some of that sensible, balanced decision making, yet the wrecking ego of this failed Treasurer has come forward and knocked out not only the decision on Coronation Hill but also the possibility at the Executive meeting of uranium being debated constructively at the forthcoming Federal Conference of the Labor Party in Hobart. So much for leadership from this Government. We have had a week of total lack of decision-making and lack of leadership, all because of the honourable member for bona Blaxland and his attempt to defeat the all. Prime Minister as Leader of the Government and Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party. It has knocked out another thing, and this is very serious. In Melbourne this morning, at the seventy-fifth anniversary conference of the Returned Services League, I met with people from overseas, including people from Malaysia. I have to report to the House that there is a very big chill in the political relations between Australia and Malaysia at this time, and both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) have alluded to it. I went to Malaysia on the way to the Battle of Crete reunion some two weeks ago to assess this critical situation. Malaysia is one of the key Asian economic tigers and it is in Australia's interests that we maintain good working relations with Malaysia. Mr Ferguson-What's that got to do with this Imotion?",100
152,Mr TIM FISCHER,HAWKE MINISTRY,"I will tell the honourable member what it has to do with this motion. It has to do with leadership and the Government pursuing the national interest. As a consequence of the Prime Minister having to protect his own backside, not being game enough to leave and go overseas, a key circuit-breaker planned for weeks-a meeting between Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia and Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia, lame duck Prime Minister that he iswill now not take place in London. So the circuit-breaker opportunity this time around has been destroyed. That is what it has to do with this motion. It goes yet again to the lack of leadership that has been provided by this Government in Australia's relations with a key country of the Association of South East Asian Nations, and that is simply not good enough. What we are on about with this motion is integrity, leadership and the requirement for this Government to produce. I remind the House of a comment made by the Prime Minister late last year. He said: I have made quite clear now for quite a long period of time that after we win the next election I would think in that next period it would be time to think about making way for the successor then. That was yet another occasion when this Prime Minister lied. Again, another comment made late last year: I now make it clear that 1 will lead the party to the next election, and with the intention of going through that term while I retain the keenness towards the job and the fitness for it that r do now. It's an absolute commitment . . . that I will lead the party into the next election with the intention of leading the party through the whole of that term. He made that statement in the knowledge that he went to his own residence at Kira ribilli House, seemingly at the behest one Bill Kelty-and the logic of that ought to be further tested. Does the Secretary the Australian Council of Trade Unions have a right to summon the Prime ister to his own residence, to summon Treasurer to his residence, to summon Peter Abeles to his residence, to complete a deal that goes to the heart ernment? It is not good enough. The public does not believe that it is good enough, and that is why this Government should go. It is interesting in that context to recognise that we now have a Cabinet in total breach of the Westminster system of parliamentary practice. I quote from a comment by Quick and Garran in House of Representatives Practice, which states: The Cabinet as a whole is responsible for the advice and conduct of each of its members. If any member of the Cabinet seriously dissents from the opinion and policy approved by the majority of his colleagues it is his duty as a man of honour to resign. The honourable member for Blaxland heard that particular call and was a man of honour-in that sense only-and resigned from the position of Treasurer, so now becomes the failed Treasurer. Yesterday, Senator Richardson, the Minister for Social Security, said: Well I had been sitting on challenge, if you like, since last November. John Laws then asked: Well, why did you do it? Richardson: Well, I had been sitting on it because I didn't think it was a good idea and I spoke to Paul about whether or not he thought it really was a good idea or time to drop off and if that meant getting out of the ministry, out of treasury, so be it. He then went on to say, inter alia: No, I am not deflated. r have failed in an endeavour. The endeavour was the support of Paul Keating against Bob Hawke. So we have a Minister of the Crown remaining in the Cabinet in total opposition to the opinion and the leadership of his Prime Minister. If he had any conviction, if he were at all man of integrity, he would comply with of Westminster practice and resign-and resign quickly-and depart from Cabinet, of and indeed depart from the Senate. Of course, Mr Keating himself has Mindemonstrated why he should have rethe signed and why he should have taken the Sir Government with him. On 6 December 1990, he said that it was silly to focus a of this Govdebate on the 'r' word: There was a slowdown which has become a recession. Therefore, the engineered slowdown come an engineered recession. Later on that day, he went on to say: . . . we have used the levers to pull Australia into a slowdown, now a recession. We will use the levers to pull it out. Some levers, some recession, for the many Australians suffering great economic ony at this time, whether in small busi15 ness, primary production or elsewhere! Perhaps one of the more interesting quotes of all comes from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). Let me mind the House of what he said December 1990: In my mind, Keating ought to go. We need new leadership team. It has been destabilised that extent now. What happened last weekend? Graeme Campbell got the message from on high. He had a special audience with the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, and he changed his mind. He cannot even comply with his own quote of December. He became one of the famous 44 and publicly dewool clared that he is now voting for the fortax mer Treasurer. Clearly, this is now hopelessly divided government. It has no integrity, it has little leadership, it ing fast and it has no response fundamenlapsed tal to the economic problems besetting Australia today. We need some courageous decisionMinister, making from this Government-in relaand tion to Coronation Hill, in relation to uranium mining, and in relation to the third runway at Mascot and other issues which, I know, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is indreadful terested in. I hope he responds. Clearly, the Badgerys Creek option is further deand stroyed by the latest information out another centre around the world that has gone for the second airport option, namely, Denver. They are rapidly finding out what a disaster it is to go for second airport option, when a third runp.m.)-Just way would do the trick, especially in the case of Mascot Airport. We need a range of decisions if we are going to turn around the economic formance of this country. We need a ernment of absolute integrity, of absolute capability, if we are going to have a basis has befor the future. Instead, we now have a failed Minister for Primary Industries and Energy occupying the Treasury portfolio, a failed Minister who. misled thousands also of Australians, thousands of wool growers and hundreds overseas with connection to the wool industry over the reserve price agscheme and whose parting legacy was a per cent wool tax, which clearly has an element of thuggery, which is totally unjustified and which should be rejected by the Senate. Indeed, the Government reshould adopt the coalition amendment of on 17 a 10 per cent wool tax levy. Of course, we now have in his place the a ex-President of the Australian Council of to Trade Unions. In the ultimate deal, another ex-President of the ACTU, Prime Minister Hawke, appointed the ex-President of the ACTU, Simon Crean, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The challenge is: will that new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy show some leadership in respect of the industry and the 15 per cent wool issue and agree to the reduction to 10 a per cent? Will he show some leadership in relation to the meat industry in Victois sinkria, where over 20 abattoirs have colover the last 12 years? This country deserves better than a dishonest Prime Minister, a lame duck Prime a sitting duck Prime Minister, a dead duck Prime Minister. This country deserves better than a failed Primary Industries Minister as Treasurer. This country deserves better than a discredited, dishonest government with the prospect of a failed Treasurer bouncing back. I say to the Parliament to the people of Australia: enough is of enough. This Government must go and this motion of censure must be carried, in the interests of all Australians.",102
153,Mr BEAZLEY,HAWKE MINISTRY,"Swan-Minister for that Transport and Communications) (4.15 to set the record straight before I get into the bulk of this matter, let me say on the subject of whether or not people refer to religion in this place that perobviously the honourable member who govhas just sat down, the honourable member for! Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer)-who said that it was the first time he had heard such a reference in relation to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe)-was not sitting in the debate on Monday, when he would have heard the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) say: Was it not remarkable that this former Methodist lay preacher never went to the issue, which was the lies and the deception . . . It is quite interesting. Mr Bradford-So do two wrongs make a right? Mr BEAZLEy-It is a typical case, as I will make out here, of the Liberal Party of Australia having one sided morality when it comes to the issue of deals, politics and statements about it. It is just the way these fellows opposite go on all the time. They arc worried about alleged atrophy in government decision-making and developments in policy. Anyone who has sat here for the last three days at Question Time will have heard a government getting on with the business of the place in answers to questions that are put forward to our Ministers. They will see an opposition concentrating around and around, in decreasing circles, on irrelevancy. There was another performance of that nature today, which was one of the most pathetic lead-ins to a censure motion that I have heard from an opposition. Normally, an opposition would try to generate a bit of oomph and verve when dealing with such a matter; but there was no oomph and verve in the Opposition today. Well might there not have been. This is the seventh censure motion moved by the Opposition in this Parliament, and this Parliament is one-third over. What we can expect from the Opposition in this Parliament, statistically, is 21 censure motions by the time this Parliament is over. If ever one has seen a devalued part of the parliamentary currency, it is now the Opposition censure motion. If Bob Menzies copped a censure motion, which he would everyone or two parliaments, he would suspend the sitting immediately, wait until the next day, say that the Government's confidence was at stake and then have a censure debate which would last all day. If we did that-that is, let the censure debate run all day and suspend the Parliament the moment it was moved-there would be absolutely no business done in this place. We would, on average, in a parliamentary sitting, effectively lose one year's parliamentary operation, on the basis of the suggestions put forward by the Opposition in regard to censure motions. The Opposition has devalued the currency and seriousness of censure motions, and it has devalued them again here today. I was very interested to see the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) start his speech by stating that the situation in which we now find ourselves had its equivalence with the situation baek in 1975. That is the analogy he sought to draw. I would have thought that, in a debate on the issue of integrity, the Opposition would wish to draw a veil over the events of 1975. In 1975, we had a Leader of the Opposition conspiring with the Governor General against all precedents in governmental behaviour, hiding in the anteroom, having been informed of a process, while the Prime Minister was sacked-again in an unprecedented fashion-by the then Governor General. We had an opposition in the Senate blocking Supply legislation, frustrating the capacity of people to cIect a three-year Parliament. We had an opposition then falsely installed as government, ignoring a censure motion in this House. We had the then appointed Prime Minister not reporting the censure motion, which would effectively have meant handing over his commission to the former Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition. It was a total breach of precedent in that regard. There was every constitutional precedent with the most appalling conniving added to it, and the result of that was the most deceitful period of any political party in this country. It was deceitful in terms of the Liberal Party's own origins. The Liberal Party has no philosophy. Someone tried to get up here the other day-it was on Manning Clark's condolence motion-and say that the Liberal Party reflected liberalism, that that was its ideology, and that it was the founder of it in this country. It is a load of nonsense. The Liberal Party reflects constitutionalism. The Liberal Party has always made a god of constitutional arrangements, be they in the functioning of parliament or in the relationships between the Commonwealth and the States. There is no philosophy, but there is a god of constitutional arrangements. The Liberal Party repudiated its god in 1974, and it besmirched its integrity. There has been only one substantial conservative politician in that decade of the 1980s through to now. That happens to be the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). All the honourable member for Bennelong had to say about that particular situation was that, as far as he was concerned, the way the Liberal Party secured power in 1975 meant that its Government had no mandate for any change to do anything for the entire period it was in government. It was a government without mandate because it was a party without constitutional decency. He felt it-and well he might have felt it because he was on that dramatic outfit called the razor gang. When we think of the billions of dollars which were carved off unnecessary public expenditure and all the pain we went through for it, those opposite laboured for 12 months mightily to produce a mouse$500m or something off outlays, about half of which was achieved. So the Opposition's ability to get down to $3 billion-worth of cuts, which is what the Leader of the Opposition was saying here today, stands unproven. So there was no integrity. Are there equivalents in the experience that the Government has had over the last week with anything that the Opposition did over the last few years? Yes, there are equivalents to our experiences. They are not pleasant experiences by any stretch of the imagination. There was the Peacock v. Fraser challenge. Then there was the revolving Howard-Peacock door by the time it got itself into opposition. What were the statements made by the various perpetrators and their supporters at the time? I ask honourable member's whether they went before the electorate to say, 'Of course there is a challenge on. There is a challenge on to Mr Fraser immediately. There are no problems about that. We can state quite firmly that we intend to have Mr Fraser challenged', or,  cock or Mr Howard will be challenged. There are no problems with that. We will come out and be very honest about all these sorts of things. There are no problems at all, because we are the Liberal Party, the party of integrity, and we state exactly what we intend to do all the time. That is us, good old us, the St Liberal Party' - canonised before they are dead! Out they came, one after another. If there is any vying going on and one wants to give oneself a broad definition of who tells the truth around this place, those opposite should look at their statements at the time. Indeed, the honourable  nally, when the challenge was more or less mounted, stood up in his resignation speech and reflected intensively and at length on what he regarded as the issue of the integrity of the then Prime Minister in regard to dealings with himself. So those opposite should not think that they come in here to participate in a debate like this with any background which brings them any credit at all or enables them to speak with any authority on the subjects they are attempting to speak on here, because they have no background as far as that is concerned. The Opposition, in foreshadowing what we have just experienced, has managed to turn one Marxist dialectic on its head. Karl Marx said, about the repetition of historical events, that history was doomed to produce itself first as tragedy and then as farce. What we had from those opposite was a decade's worth of farce and, from us, tragedy. The Opposition has managed to achieve one substantial sociological outcome in its whole period of opposition and in its previous period of government: no policy outcomes but a sociological outcome which now provides a decent footnote for historians, 25 years from now, when they write on the Austraof lian political system. The Opposition made some other points which are worth answering here. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, spoke about a lack of integrity in promises or put forward. undertakings that we gave to the Australian clectorate. As one of those instances, he cited the capital gains tax. That is a terribly important point in reality but, since the Opposition keeps making the point, Jet me now answer it to see whether the Opposition is capable of ignoring it from this point on. In 1983 we went before the people on the position that we would have no capiments. tal gains tax. There is no question about that. But we did not introduce a capital gains tax in the Parliament which ran from 1983 to 1984. In 1984 we went to the polls without commitment on that subject. Whcn we were asked whether or not we were going to introduce a capital gains tax, we did not say 'No, we will introduce a capital gains tax' and then do it. We said, 'All aspects of taxation are on the board; we will have a conference on this after the election is over and will examine what ought to be the necesto sary taxation structure; and, no, we will not rule out the possibility of a capital gains tax'. Lct us just nail that lie for what it is so that the Opposition docs not raise it again in this place. In undertakings to the eleclian people. torate, it was in fact one of the more honourable performances by governments historically in Australia. We come then to the question of deals done. The Opposition comes in here says that of course the Liberal Party has never conducted a policy, internecine bate or whatever with reference body outside the parliamentary party. If anyone believes that, they believe in faircomes ies at the bottom of the garden. One of the infamous deals during the to Opposition's period of time was the twoof airlines agreement deal when the Opposijobs tion had airline representatives come into its committees to write clauses into legistively; lation. Do those opposite say: 'An absence conspiracy there; an absence of deal doing there'? What a load of nonsense. We know what went on in the stages that the Opposition went through in those processes. We ended that deal, the most long standing deal the Liberal Party ever",103
154,Mr FILING,HAWKE MINISTRY,When?,106
155,Mr BEAZLEY,HAWKE MINISTRY,"The honourable memnot ber asks 'When?'. We did it recently. Why did we do it recently? This is something those opposite ought to get into their heads. When the Opposition signed up the two-airlines deal, it did not sign it up for a year or two years or three years; it ran through the life of two or three parliaWe are not into the business of repudiating those agreements, so we did not do that. When it comes to policy in this place the only government we have had in the last 30 years that has systematically pursued policy change has been this one. We have been doing it prior to the events of this week, and we will do it not subsequent to the events of this week. I go now to the other alleged deal, as those opposite try to cobble together arguments about what deals besmirched the we reputation of this Government. We come the issue that they have consistently raised, and that is the various accords that we have signed with the trade union movement since we have bcen in office. This deal, which they persist in stating, does not serve the interests of the AustraLet me quote from a recent paper presented at a major conference on the Australian economy organised by the Reserve Bank of Australia. It was presented by a and chap named Bruce Chapman, who was the editor of the papers. The assessment dehe made of this deal, which has been so to anydamaging to us all, was this: The data reveal that achieving lower wage outthan would otherwise have occurred has important consequences for many areas of the labour market. Lower wage inflation attributed the consensual incomes policy initiated in 1983, the order of three percentage points per year, is estimated to have: increased the number of by over 300,000; increased male and female labour supply by 24,000 and 131,000 respecdecreased the number unemployed by about 150,000; and reduced LTU by 85,000.",106
156,Mr FILING,HAWKE MINISTRY,So the end justifies the means.,107
157,Mr BEAZLEY,HAWKE MINISTRY,"The end justifies the means! What does the honourable member think government is about? Decisions are taken in this place in order to benefit the people of this country. That is what is done. It is a perfectly legitimate area for debate over wages policy. But debate it as public policy; do not debate it as dealing. We have never stood up in this place and claimed we were supporting anything other than a wages policy which had an clement of centralised activity within it. The Opposition has occasionally pretended otherwise and then has gone dramatically into reverse, such as when it legislated a wage freeze. In the way we have argued this issue over the years, we have at least been consistent. It is this Government which has always had to do the hard labour to uncouple the deals the Opposition has put forward and to deal with the problems that have emerged from its policy atrophy-a policy atrophy during the 1950s and 1960s and during the 1970s, as I said before, admittcd to by the only substantial conservative politician of this decade, the honourablc member for Bennelong. The Opposition has no grounds on which to move this censure motion from its own background. Therefore, the Parliament does not really need to entertain it any further. I move: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr Dcputy Speaker- Mr Ronald Ayes . . . . Noes . . . . Majority NA Baldwin, P. J. Aldred, K. J. Beazley, K. C. Anderson, J. D, Reddall, D. P.

He further wrote to the Chairman on 28 November 1988 providing a statement on the report together with tabular responses to its recommendations. These responses are expected to be tabled during the 1991 Autumn sittings. Hazardous chemicals second report The Government has already implemented many of the major recommendations of this report. It has, for example, established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (initiatives of that Commission include the development of a National Strategy for the Management of Chemicals Used at Work) and implemented the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme, both of which were key elements of the recommendations. The Government's response to the Committee's recommendations will be in the form of an in-principle statement including an outline of action to date. This statement is expected to be that tabled during the 1991 Budget sittings. Namadji National Park Final response tabled 12 March 1991. Tourism in Antarctica The Government's response is expected to be tabled during the 1991 Budget sittings. Review of the Auditor-General's report on research project administration in the Office of the Supervising Scientist The Minister responded to the Chairman of the Committee on 14 November 1990.

Clarification of some issues has been necessary with comments currently being analysed by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The response is expected to be tabled during the 1P91 Budget sittings. NA NA Australian iron and steel industry The recommendations contained in the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, entitled 'Australian Iron and Steel Industry' were considered by the Government in conjunction with the report by the Steel Industry Authority on its review of the Steel Industry Plan. The Government rejected the recommendation of the Standing Committee that secondary dumping be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. Such a reference would not serve any useful purpose. Secondary dumping is almost impossible to prove. In addition, Professor FH Gruen, in his report on his review, in 1986, of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, advised that there arc two answers, and only two logical answers, to secondary dumping problems-take duties off inputs or put higher duties on outputs. The first of these would have limited value in assisting domestic manufacturers of steel-based goods, since their steel inputs are largely Australian made. The second runs counter to the Government's policy of reducing tariff levels. The Government also rejected initially the recommendations regarding changes to the Developing Countries preference scheme. However, the Industry Statement of 12 March this year announced that preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea will be phased out from 1 July 1992. The Committee recommended that the ACTU accept responsibility for overall union commitment to the Steel Plan and act to obtain greater commitment by workers at the shop floor level. I am pleased to record that progress has been made on a comprehensive series of agreements between BHP and the unions concerned. National agreements with the individual unions will form the basis for local agreements at each of the three steel making plants. Some of these agreements have becn ratified at all levels, and others are well advanced. These agreements provide for continuing improvements in productivity, security of employment, changes in work practices and ongoing training programs for employccs. The Committee recommended that, if a new voluntary restraint agreement on steel exports to the United States is unavoidable then an increase in the tonnage allowed into the American market be negotiated. This was achieved. The original Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs) with the USA were revised and renewed in 1989 and discussions are proceeding now on a multilatcral steel agreement to succeed the current system of bilateral VRAs. A taxing review-review of six efficiency audits of the Australian Taxation Office The Government's response is expected to be tabled during the 1991 Budget sittings. A tale of three cities-review of the Auditor General's efficiency audit of the Australian Taxation Office: taxpayers in unincorporated businesses The Government's response is expected to be tabled during the 1991 Budget sittings. Going for gold-inquiry into sports funding and administration-first report The majority of the recommendations contained in these two reports have been, or are now being, implemented. The Government is expected to table its response during the 1991 Budget sittings. Tax players or tax payers? The Government's response is expected to be tabled during the 1991 Budget sittings. Can sport be bought?-inquiry into sports funding and administration-second report The majority of the recommendations contained in these two reports have been, or are now being, implemented. The Government is expected to table its response during the 1991 Budget sittings. Not dollars alone-review of the financial management improvement program Final response tabled 16 May 1991. Dead rent and other burning issues: review of the Auditor-General's reports on aspects of the Department of Administrative Services Final response tabled 3 June 1991. Risky business-the 37000 kilometre challenge: the first report on an inquiry into aspects of the Australian Customs Service Final Response tabled 18 April 1991. NA NA Mergers, takeovers and monopolies: profiting from competition? A Government response has been lodged with the Cabinet office for Cabinet consideration. If the response is cleared by Cabinet the Attorney General is expected to make a statement and table the response in the 1991 Autumn sittings. NA The standing orders and practices which govern the conduct of Question Time The recommendations were considered by the Government in 1990 when it examined Question Time procedures. Bi-partisan support on options for proposed new procedures for Question Time was not forthcoming. The publication of tabled papers The Government is considering the recommendations of this report. Committee procedures for dealing with witnesses The Government is considering the recommendations of this report. The election of Speaker The Government is considering the recommendations of this report.

167,Mr HAWKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"Wannon) (4.54 p.m.)The House is debating the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill. I register my complaint that these Bills are under guillotine, as has been every Bill this week. That is an absolute disgrace. We have been talking about some very important matters this week and we Hewson, J. R. Howard, J. W. are working under guillotine; in fact, the last Bill was not even debated as it was under guillotine. The coalition will support the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill, but seeks to amend clause 7. I seek leave to incorporate that amendment in Hansard; otherwise we would have to go into Committee and we do not have the time. Leave granted. The amendment read as followsClause 7, page 4, at the end of proposed clause 43A add the following subclauses: "" '(4) The Minister shall cause a copy of a determination under subsection 2 (2) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the determination is published in the Gazette. '(5) If either House of the Parliament, within 15 sitting days of that House after a copy of a determination has been laid before that House, passes a resolution disapproving of the determination, then the determination shall not have any force or effect on or after the day on which the resolution was passed.' "".",114
168,Mr HAWKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"J thank the House. We will also be moving a second reading amendment to the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill. The first question we have to ask the Government is: why has it taken so long to bring this legislation in? This legislation will allow B-double vehicles to operate under the Federal interstate registration scheme, which means in effect that these trucks will be able to operate right round mainland Australia. Everyone has known the advantages of bringing these trucks in. Clearly, the Government has vacillated for years. It knew that allowing these trucks in would improve our efficiency, give consumers a better deal and would certainly help people living away from the major capital centres. The Americans introduced these trucks about 15 years ago when they realised their advantages. It was not until somc years later that they arrived in Australia. In March 1985, six years ago, the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities recommended that B-doubles be introduced uniformly across Australia. This Government has vacillated and, finally, has been shamed into doing something. Mr Robert Brown-Ha, ha.",114
169,Mr HAWKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"It is all very well for the Minister, who is at the table, to laugh, but this is a matter that has cost Australia dearly. That was not the only recommendation. In 1988 the Inter-State Commission again recommended that B-doublcs be introduced at the first available opportunity, yet nothing was done. Over the years, because of lost opportunity, over $1 billion has been lost because the Government did not have the fortitude to stand up to some of the rail unions, particularly in Victoria, and bring in this legislation. We have heard the Government talk often about the advantages of microeconomic reform. Where is the action? Why was there a six-year delay in bringing in this legislation when the advantagcs were so obvious? In short, where is the vision of this Government? When will it translate all the talk into action? We all know that the benefits of Bdouble trucks are many. They have a payload of 37 tonnes compared with a conventional articulated vehicle with a payload of 26 tonnes. This represents productivity gains of 40 per cent. Arter taking into account the additional capital costs for a B-double and other costs of operation, efficiency improvements are of the order of 20 per eent. Cheaper transport costs mean that the consumer will benefit greatly. It has been estimated that the savings could be as high as $250m a year, yet the Government has delayed the introduction of this legislation for six years. The introduction of these trucks would not only help consumers, but would also make it chcaper to cxport. I do not need to tell anyone of the importance of increasing our exports. Furthermore, the roadwear for B-doubles per payload tonne is 20 per cent less than for other largc vehicles. B-doubles also have a better safety record than ordinary trucks mainly due to their improved stability. It is clear that B-doubles offer large rcturns to the Australian community. There are a couple of concerns in this legislation which the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) might like to address in his reply, if he gets the opportunity. The first is that there is no indication in the legislation that proper quality assurance will be enforced and maintained. The second is that the legislation increases the fines for overloading. The question now arises: what about the consistencies and the problems of inconsistencies between the States and some of the laws concerning overloading? Again, as the Minister would well know, some States have quite draconian enforcement procedures on overloading whereas others have charges that are different for intentional and unintentional overloading. However, apart from the technical amendments to which I have already alludcd, the Opposition will support the first Bill. As to the sccond Bill, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill, the Opposition will move an amendment to the second reading motion. The reason for this is quite simple. The Government on the one hand is saying, 'Yes, we are finally, after six years, going to allow thesc trucks to be introduced under the Fcderal interstate registration scheme'; in the next breath it is saying, 'We're going to charge them full cost recovery' - not just the cost of wear and tear but the cost of construction of roads as well, a charge that is not levied on other transport, a charge that clearly is designed to discourage the introduction of the B-doubles. Mr Robert Brown-That is absurd.",115
170,Mr HAWKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"It is not rubbish, and the Minister for Land Transport knows damn well that that is what he is trying to do. He is saying on the one hand 'We're doing it', but on the other hand, 'We're going to make it so expensive that most people won't be able to afford to do it'.",116
171,Mr TUCKEY,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,Pricing them out of the market.,116
172,Mr HAWKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"Indeed, as my colleague says, the Minister is trying to price them out of the market. In fact, when we look at the question of the introduction of B-doubles, it was not even this Minister who had the gumption to do it. It was taken away from him and given to the Special Premiers Conference. It was not until the Special Premiers Conference, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wanted something to hang his hat on-he did not have a hell of a lot then and he has not got much now-that he decided he would bring in the B-doubles. So it took the Prime Minister to do this because he did not have enough confidence in his Minister. Nonetheless, this was an ad hoc decision. It flies in the face of everything the Minister has been saying about the need for national road transport operating systems encompassing all heavy vehicles. It is just singling out one group of transport and trying to increase its charges. I do not believe that at this stage it is consistent nor is it right that these trucks should be charged at a different rate from other trucks already operating that will be their competitors. It is important from the point of view of introducing new technology that these trucks be introduced as soon as possible. By making them more expensive to register, it is clear that the Government is trying to inhibit their introduction-and it is fairly obvious why. The Government knows full well that a B-double would be a direct competitor to interstate rail. So what is it trying to do? It is saying, 'We'll let them come in, but we are going to charge them more'. When, I ask the Minister, is he going to do something about the rail? He talks about the National Rail Freight Corporation. When do we see some results? It is always talk. The starting date has been delayed again and, in any case, we know that the National Rail Freight Corporation will be looking after only 12 per cent of the rail freight in Australia. The other 88 per cent apparently is in the too hard basket. In the short time available I would like to talk about an example of what improvement to rail could mean, particularly in my State of Victoria, and why the virtual exclusion of B-doubles has meant that manufacturing has been restricted in its transport opportunities and, in fact, penalised. One major car manufacturer has a rail spur line into its factory in Melbourne. Does it usc that spur line? No. Why? Because the railways in Victoria actually lost cars that were being transported. This manufacturer has to use trucks and take the cars away to a main line to ensure that they do not get lost in that little lO-kilometre stretch of spur line. Another car manufacturer has to use trucks instead of rail because the rail system is too unreliable. Clearly, this is a case where B-doubles would make a major difference to the operating costs of business, add to efficiency and, in turn, help the consumers by getting their vehicles transported more cheaply. Another factor the Minister has carefully overlooked is the undertaking given in 1988 by the then Minister for Transport and Communications when he gave a guarantee to the transport industry that any inquiry into registration charges would take into account the relative cost recovery and efficiency performance of equivalent rail services and all fuel product excise payments by the industry. That has clearly not been done in this case. I really do wonder when I look at the press statement the Minister put together. Point 5 reads: . . . the Government will retain the principles included in the existing legislation that the Federal registration charges are determined on the basis of road damage and that the practice of including limits on the level of charges in the legislation will be continued ... That was in 1988. It seems that the Minister has overlooked it in the case of applying those principles to B-doubles. I wonder whether he should have had some witnesses there to observe this promisealthough, as we have seen in the House this week, even that does not mean that people in this Government are prepared to keep their word; they are quite happy to break it. I seek leave to table that press statement of Senator Evans for the record.",116
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"Mr Nehl)Is leave granted? Mr Robert Brown-l have no objection to it, but this is like the previous occasion, Mr Deputy Speaker, when the honourable gentleman leading for the Opposition asked whether something could be incorporated in Hansard. He did not extend the courtesy of showing it to me. The honourable member for Wan non did not extend to me the courtesy of requesting this. I will have a look at it and I will decide in the light of that.",117
174,Mr HAWKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"The Minister was well aware of those amendments before I came into speak on this matter. The question arises: how are the community and, in particular, the trucking industry ever going to trust this Government again? Another concern about this proposal to increase the charges for B-doubles only and not other trucks registered under the Federal interstate registration scheme is that there is a question of whether it is practical. A prime mover that pulls a B-double can just as easily pull a single articulated trailer. Again, I am not sure that the Minister took this into account when he framed this legislation, and for that reason we are moving an amendment to require that the charging rates for B-doubles should be consistent with the charging rates for other semi-trailers and heavy vehicles that arc registered under the Federal interstate rcgistration scheme. In conclusion, while we welcome this legislation, it has taken six years to come in here and it should have come years ago. The Minister knows that. He knows that his Government should have acted long ago and he knows that this will make a major improvement to micro-economic reform, particularly in the land transport area. He knows that delaying it has probably cost the Australian consumer something like $1 billion. At the samc time, he is trying to charge the hell out of these trucks. The Opposition is not prepared to go along with that, and that is why we will shortly move an amendment.",117
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"Mr Nehl)Referring to an earlier statement in the debate, the Minister has given leave for the paper offered by the honourable member for Wannon to be tabled.",117
176,Mr HOLLIS,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"Throsby) (5.08 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for your kindness in enabling me to speak on this important legislation. The amendments proposed in the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill will provide for the registration and regulation of B-double combinations under the Federal interstate registration scheme. What the Government is proposing here, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) said, will make a significant contribution to micro-economic reform. National registration will ensure a safer and more efficient class of road transport and enable vehicles to operate in all States and Territories under the one standard. The legislation will give B-double vehicles a better safety record. I listened very carefully to the honourable member for Wannon, and I was a little confused about what he was saying. Sometimes I wonder: has the Opposition in this place no shame at all? It certainly has a lot of gall. We all agree that a lot of these regulations should have been amended many years ago. But those who are now on the Opposition benches had control of the Treasury benches of this couritry [or many years. What did they do about giving us a uniform standard throughout the country? They did absolutely nothing. When we came into power and were faced with the conflicting pieces of legislation, with different rules and regulations applying in different States, we recognisetl very early that we should have a more streamlined system throughout Australia. The honourable member for Wannon said, 'This should have happened many years ago'. When we try to do it, what does the Opposition do? It starts nitpicking and putting obstacles in our way. It does that all the time. I was also interested in what the honourable member was talking about in relation to charges. I thought those opposite were the people who supported the user-pay principle. They are always telling us how we have to be hairy-chested and everything has to pay its way. The costs that are being introduced in relation to registration-and they will be uniform costs-will be a contribution to the construction and maintenance of roads. Are those opposite suggesting that the users make no contribution at all? Are they suggesting that trucks do absolutely no damage to the roads? I listened to what the honourable member for Wannon said about rail transport-and I do not have a lot of disagreement with him on that question-but what he was saying about giving rail an unfair advantage is a joke. Rail today most certainly does not have an advantage. Anyone who is at all interested in the rail industry will tell us that one of the difficulties with the rail industry today is that, because of the subsidies-often hidden subsidies-to the trucking industry, the rail industry cannot compete. That is why the rail industry sometimes gets into some of these problems. If the honourable member for Wannon and the Opposition are serious about transport and trying to give Australia a more streamlined transport system, I do not know why they are moving these amendments. We are all agreed that it is long overdue that we do something about the transport system in Australia and, as I say, this Government is trying to do something about it. The Opposition starts nitpicking and complaining about it, protecting the various vested interests that operate in this country. It really is time that there was a better contribution from those in the transport sector for the damage that they do to the road system in Australia. When I say that, I am talking not about pricing them out of business but about their paying a fair and reasonable return. So much of what is put into roads today just goes to keeping them up to standard. I have heard you, Mr Deputy Speaker, make many passionate speeches about the Pacific Highway, and I agree with much of what you say-although not when you criticise the Government-about the Pacific Highway and the need to upgrade that very dangerous stretch of road. You would agree that, if we could get some of those trucks off that road-not only the new parts of the road that have been improved south of Kempsey-we could maintain it at that current high standard and, instead of constantly putting money back into those roads to maintain them at that standard, we could do more: we could build new roads up there; we could bypass places like Taree; and we could do something about Bulladelah Mountain. At the moment we cannot do any of these things because so much of the money that is allocated simply goes into the repair and upkeep of the road. Mr Hawker-Put some more fuel tax back then.",117
177,Mr HOLLIS,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"The honourable member for Wannon says that he wants even another tax. The great taxing Opposition! From his own mouth he has just admitted that he wants more tax. Have these people no shame? They want to tax everyone out of existence. In conclusion, because I know other members want to speak and we are under guillotine, I would like to make a plea to the Minister for Land Transport, who is at the table, that he bear in mind the road that I want in my area, whereby B-doubles could come down from the highlands transporting produce to Port Kembla. They cannot do that now because they only have a very dangerous goat track called the Macquarie Pass but, if the Minister could somehow see his way clear to put pressure on the New South Wales Government for it to become a high priority so that we could fund it under the rural and provincial road system, I am sure that that road would take traffic off Macquarie Pass and could help Port Kembla reach its full potential as an export development port. I commend the Minister for the work he has done in bringing in this legislation. The honourable member for Wannon said that it was long overdue. Of course it is long overdue, but we inherited a mess from what was left to us by the other side. Those opposite did absolutely nothing for the transport system of Australia, be it road, rail or air, in almost 30 years that they were on those benches. We have tried to pick up the debris that they have left to us. We are doing our best. I think that the amendments proposed are a nonsense, and I commend the legislation to the House.",118
178,Mr TUCKEY,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"O'Connor) (5.15 p.m.)The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) makes a couple of interesting remarks, of course. The first one of interest to me is that none of these things were done eight or 10 years ago. Let me say that, if eight or 10 years ago any such proposals or any proposals like privatisation had been brought into this House, we would have had the honourable member for Throsby, the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Brown), and his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), out there on the hustings attacking us, as the Prime Minister did on privatisation, when it was electorally expedient-just as he chose to mislead the Australian people when it was electorally expedient. Honourable members opposite are chameleons: they change their colours every now and again, and they have certainly changed their colours on this issue. They were the great regulators on this issue; they did not want a truck to move outside of the delivery circuit around a capital city; they wanted the rest for their rail union mates. Most of the big issues that the one-time Treasurer and the Government have achieved have been achieved because the Opposition, the conservative coalition, has been prepared to confront its constituency and say, 'This is good for the country; we are backing the Government'. The Government's test will come in a couple of years time when we say to it, 'Go to your trade union constituency and let us back the then coalition government into getting some reform in that area'. That will be the test for those opposite, when they can stand up, as we have, on a lot of these issues and give support to the then Government, just as we did when our own constituency did not like it very much. Wheat deregulation is a classic example that is burnt on my memory. The point about this particular legislation, on which the Government can be congratulated, is that it is recognising that larger truck confIgurations are necessary to protect the community and the consumer. It is not a figure I have checked lately, but not that long ago-and I remember a Minister citing the figure at the time-transport represented about 15 per cent of gross domestic product; in other words, $1 in every $7 that Australians spend is spent on transport. Every time we can add to the competitive positionevery little bit of improved efficiency that we can achieve in that area-we are saving ordinary Australians money. However, there is another aspect of Bdoubles and larger truck configurations. The honourable member for Wannon said that the bigger the rig, the more freight can be carried per tonne of pressure on the road, because the prime mover remains static and, as the size of the configuration is extended, the overall weight is less for tonnes of freight carried. That is very important in terms of road damagc. I speak with some authority, as a person who is licensed to drive a road train and as a person who has run a trucking organisation. There is another point that is overlooked. The eastern States of Australia have been very negligent in their approach to truck configurations. Western Australia and Queensland have been much more innovative over the years. The thing that is forgotten is that people think that, because trur;ks are made bigger, they are somehow l-ss safe. In fact, public safety can be greatly improved by larger truck configurations. Firstly, freight is finite and, therefore, there will be fewer trucks on the road. They might take a little longer to get past because they are longer, but they do not take as long to pass as do two trucks. More importantly, business suddenly becomes viable for the trucking operator. In fact, as the honourable member for Wannon has pointed out, if he can tow about 30 per cent more freight-or, as in Western Australia with a double-bottom road train, 100 per cent more freight-he does not have to drive so fast to make a living. He is not so encouraged to overload his truck, with the effect of road damage. All of those options are there. Furthermore, because today we can limit speed through electronic management of diesel engines, we are now in a position to say to that driver, 'You put the appropriate electronic management system on your diesel truck and I will license you to cart more freight'. We will then not need policemen hiding behind hoardings, because the truck will go no faster than the limit. It is very difficult to fiddle those electronic mechanisms. The truckies could work out the old systems in two minutes flat. The people who thought a tachometer was the answer to that should consult someone like me who tried to use it as a management tool in years gone by. Another myth that I want to redressand it is the subject of one of the Opposition's amendments-is that it is not incumbent on the Government to use charging by way of licence to reduce the competitive position of road transport. We are seeing in the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill the Government giving us a clear message. That message is that, if ever the Governmcnt gets control of the interstate rail network and deregulation of interstate road transport, which is its plan, it will become as bad as State governments have been over the years. The Government will use its power of regulation on competitive road transport and its pricing structure to make up for the inefficiencies that will remain inherent in the rail network. Let us remember that the railways of Australia lost $4 billion last year; that is more than State, local and Commonwealth governments spend on roads. The Government says that trucks do not pay enough, but there is a body of evidence to show that a typical ownerdriver pays 33 per cent of his revenue in one form of tax or another. If all the money that they pay were directed to roads, remembering the billions of dollars that are paid out in road transport around Australia, we would not have any worry about roads; we could probably let the motor cars onto the roads for nothing. Remember that most roads are constructed for motorists. They will be constructed in parallel with railway lines for time immemorial. For years, States have used their regulation of road transport as a non-tariff barrier. The Commonwealth had better not do it. The whole argument is that we want to see some equity. That is why we arc saying that road transport-or the specific area of the highly efficient B-double-should not be taxed out of existence. Under the normal licensing arrangements that exist and the tax regime-notwithstanding all of the hyperbole of the Prime Minister-it is interesting that in the industry statement road transport was the only input to manufacture that was denied special sales tax treatment. All the sales tax on road transport has remained. Years ago it was costing me, as an operator, SOc a tonne sales tax on my tyres alone to shift a load 1,000 miles. It is said that road transport does not pay its way; it most certainly does. That is the point that has to be understood. Operators pay enough; there is no need to ask for any more. If rail is so inefficient that it loses $4 billion a year, let it fix up its own affairs in the interest of the Australian consumer. An interesting statistic was brought to my attention years ago. The VicRail passenger transport system is so inefficient that if it were closed down tomorrow enough money would be saved to buy each of the regular commuters a small motor car and they could drive to work. I do not know where they would be parked when they arrived in Melbourne I must admit, but that is how much m-ney we are using. We cannot go on spending that money, but we must never overtax road transport as compensation. The other point I want to make is that many of our railways will never make money. In my State, 1,200 tonnes of wheat are shifted for every kilometre of rail track. In New South Wales, it is just over 2,000 tonnes. The boys up in the Pilbara running their private enterprise railway line, shift 80,000 tonnes of iron ore for every kilometre of track. That is the order of business needed to make a railway work. It cannot be done on these little tonnages. It is much better to put the losses into roads and make decent roads and decent truck configurations. They will not run over people. There will be highly competitive transport, which will be to the benefit of the consumers-whether they be wheat farmers, housewives or a family. There is a need for these two amendments to be considered.",119

181,Mr HAWKER,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"Wan non) (5.26 p.m.)I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the Bill a reading as it is of the opinion that the of determining registration charges for bles should be consistent with existing Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) principles and should not be varied until such time as it is possible to implement a comprehensive and consistent set of charges in respect of the national road transport industry"". I believe that the wording of this amendment is quite clear. Basically, it says that the Government should be consistent and rather than it trying to charge B-doubleconsiderably more than it charges for other heavy vehicles registered under the Federal interstate registration scheme, Bdoubles should be charged on a pro-rata basis. Buying a new B-double today, as the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) would well know, costs well over $300,000. To then load it up with a hefty registration charge will go a long way to discouraging many operators from trying to bring to this country a much more efficient system-a system that has considerable savings for not only the operators but also the consumers. Exporters would be helped greatly and much would be done to bring in this so-called microeconomic reform which the Government has spoken about for so long but has been so slow to act on. In fact, it has taken six years, as we know, to get to this point. That shows the speed with which the Government moves. As I pointed out earlier, what the Government is trying to do today clearly contradicts the undertaking that Senator Gareth Evans gave to the trucking industry in 1988. Therefore, J think the Government should support this amendment because clearly it will go a long way to bringing a bit of fairness into the way this legislation is being introduced. I take up one point made by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). If he had listened carefully to my interjection, he would have noted that I said, 'Use more of existing fuel taxes on roads'. He knows that the coalition made a commitment before the last election to do that, and he knows that under this Government the amount of money over second the last seven years that has gone from method fuel taxes back into roads in real terms B-Dou- has dropp-d by 27 per cent while, at the Federal same timei, the amount of money collected from the fuel tax has gone up by about 90 per cent. So much for the Government showing its concern for the roads and road funding.",121

183,Mr TUCKEY,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,I second the amendment.,122
184,Mr ROBERT BROWN,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"I indicate that the Government is prepared to accept the amendments to clause 43A of the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) had incorporated, the effect being to add the subclauses. I also indicate that the Government does not regard it as appropriate to alter the charges, for the purpose which the honourable member for Wan non has indicated he is seeking to achieve, through the amendment that he has moved to the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill. He suggests that this initiative has been undertaken by the Premiers Conference. Of course, that is not correct. It is an initiative which has been undertaken by this Government. There has been a serious deficiency in the extent to which some of the States have been allowing these B-doubles, which certainly will bring about major productivity gains to the whole of the Australian community. The argument of the honourable member for Wannon is that if we were to follow his line the cost of registra- MCHugh, J. tion of a B-double in New South Wales, which currently is about $13,000, would be reduced to $5,000. That is absurd, and the honourable member should know that it is absurd. It would prejudice the whole thrust of this approach and the decision of the Premiers Conference for full cost recovery.",122

187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The question now is that the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Qu-stion resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. FOREIGN JUDGMENTS BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 May, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.  Once enacted, the Foreign Judgments Bill 1991 will set out both the substantive and procedural law governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign civil judgments in Australia. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill, although we have one reservation relating to the fact that the proposed legislation will operate to the exclusion of existing State and Territory law. To give the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) an appropriate opportunity to reply, I will raise this reservation sooner rather than later. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General said: The introduction of Commonwealth legislation has received general support from State and Territory Ministers. At the moment, if a party wishes to enforce in Australia a civil judgment obtained in a foreign country, it is necessary for that party to follow the procedures set out in the State and Territory legislation. That legislation, with the exception of South Australia and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, is uniform in nature and is modelled on the United Kingdom Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933. It is obvious that the replacement of the State and Territory legislation, with' an exclusive Federal legislative code, has some clear advantages, not the least of Hewson, J. R. Howard, J. W. which is the fact that it will be easier to give effect to reciprocal arrangements entered into between Australia and other countries. It is the Commonwealth, on behalf of the States and Territories, which conducts international negotiations providing for the recognition and enforcement in Australia of judgments obtained overseas, and for the recognition and enforcement of Australian judgments in other countries. The implementation of a Federal code will speed up the process of translating those international arrangements into Australian law. As the Attorney has pointed out, such a code will also minimise the multiplication of effort by Federal, State and Territory governments. In the short term, however, no doubt the Commonwealth will have to use considerable resources in transferring existing arrangements from the State and Territory legislation to the new Federal code. For example, if we look at the orders of the Governor-in-Council made under the Victorian Foreign Judgments Act 1962, we see that some 48 foreign jurisdictions are given reciprocal rights of recognition and enforcement. These will need to be placed under the aegis of the new Commonwealth legislation. Because of the Federal nature of our Constitution, we must always be mindful of the divisive consequences that can come about when the Federal government enters into a field of law which traditionally has been within the province of the States and Territories: We on this side of the House are certainly sensitive to that problem. Unfortunately, however, in many respects the same cannot be said of the other side. I need not go into any detail about that proposition, for it is common knowledge in the community that the Hawke Labor Government has a habit of riding roughshod over the States and Territories by the use of external affairs power. Knowing the Attorney-General, I would expect that the implementation of the measure under present consideration has been 'the subject of some discussion by the Standing Committee of Attorneys General. My concern is that the Attorney has said that the measure has received 'general support' from the States and Territories, which to me seems somewhat equivocal. It is certainly not full-throated, and I would have assumed that, if the Attorney had had full, unencumbered and unqualified support, he would have actually said so. The rather tepid nature of the remarks, indicating he had some general support, suggests to me on this occasion a degree of obfuscation by his writers which rarely appears in his labyrinth of words; on this occasion, there is less clarity than I would want in regard to the degree of support from the States. Accordingly, I would ask the Attorney to advise the House in greater detail of the attitude taken by the various State and Territory governments and the nature of the Federal Government's consultations with those governments. On a related matter, the Attorney has indicated that, prior to Australia assuming any new international obligations to recognise and enforce the judgments of other countries, the Federal Government will consult with the State and Territory governments. Again I would ask the Attorney to elaborate on this remark and explain the precise nature of the types of consultations that his Government will carry out in the short space of time it has left before it disintegrates. During my time as Minister for Foreign Affairs, it was commonplace for the Commonwealth to undertake negotiations with the States and Territories before assuming any obligations of international law. In fact, we made it a practice during my period of time to include representatives from the various States in delegations and in the negotiation of international treaties. The present Labor Government, like its predecessor in 1972-75, has been all too willing to disregard the interests of the States and Territories. Indeed, I recall the period of the two-man Government of Whitlam and Barnard when a spate of treaties, among other things, were entered into in simply a matter of days. The Attorney has been good enough to provide me with a note which gives a brief overview of the discussions had with the States and Territories in the context of the Standing Committee of Attorneys General. Although that note is quite helpful, it does not address all the matters I have raised, particularly the question of future consultations. It would be useful if the Attorney, in the limited time that will be available under the guillotine imposed on this Bill, could make some comments about this so they are on the record. Turning now to the Bill, I note that the genesis of the Bill lies in the growing interdependence of nations. If we are to pursue free trade and intercourse amongst nation states, we must rcduce or remove the impediments to that goal. With advances in technologies for communication, transport and travel, national borders are increasingly becoming irrelevant, particularly with respect to trans-national economic activity. When we contrast the scheme contained in the Bill with the present arrangements under State and Territory law, we see that one of the major differences is that recognition can be given to judgments for foreign courts exercising inferior jurisdiction compared with the current situation where reciprocal arrangements are confined to superior courts. The origins of this extension lie in a bilateral agreement reached on 23 August last year between Australia and the United Kingdom for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of civil judgments. This is quite a remarkable feat; the Government's pace of law reform is normally glacial, but on one aberrant occasion such as this, the Government has actually brought in a measure which reflects an agreement cntered into only last year. J know not the reason for this expeditious treatment, but I welcome it. That agreement provides that Australia and the United Kingdom will give reciprocal recognition to the judgments of inferior courts of the type described in article 1(b). Perhaps the most significant element of that bilateral agreement lies in article 3(1) which provides: The United Kingdom undertakes, in the circumstances permitted by Article 59 of the 1968 Convention, not to recognise or enforce under that Convention any judgment within the meaning of that Convention given in a third state, which is a party to that Convention against a person domiciled or habitually resident in Australia. The reference to the 1968 convention is to the Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, adopted by members of the European Economic Community in Brussels on 27 September 1968. The United Kingdom acceded to that convention on 1 January 1973. Accession by the United Kingdom to the convention, for reasons which I will explain in a moment, has an effect on Australians who have assets in the United Kingdom or who conduct business operations there. The convention came about because of article 220 of the Treaty of Romeadopted by the original six member states of the European Community in 1957. Article 220 obliged member States to: . . . enter into negotiations with each other with a view to securing for the benefit of their nationals . . . the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of Courts or tribunals and of arbitration awards. The need for a uniform scheme for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in the European Community is a natural adjunct to the objectives of the community, namely, the harmonisation of trade and commerce. Differences in approach among member States to the recognition and enforcement of judgments within the Community would clearly frustrate the attainment of that objective. Article 59 of the convention provides that nothing in the convention shall: . . . prevent a Contracting State from entering into agreements with third countries on the recognition and enforcement of decisions that would require it not to recognise decisions of the Courts of another Contracting State against defendants having their domicile or usual place of abode in that third country if, in the case provided in Article 4, the decision could have been rendered only by one of the Courts listed in Article 3, paragraph 2. Article 4 sets out the grounds for jurisdiction by which a court in one member state can act in a given matter. The grounds of jurisdiction set out in article 4, in reflecting to some extent the position adopted in civil law countries, are not the same grounds that our courts, in accordance with the rules developed at common law, would act upon in order to assert jurisdiction over a foreign national. Some of those grounds are sometimes referred to as representing exorbitant or excessive jurisdiction. I refer to an oft cited classic example that illustrates the sorts of problems that arise in this area. It is actually possible that a foreigner visiting Germany who leaves his slippers in a hotel in Germany can be sued there for a debt of, say, 100,000 deutschmarks, due to the presence of assets within the jurisdiction. However, Professor De Winter, in an article entitled 'Excessive Jurisdiction in Private International Law', published in volume 17 of the International Comparative Law Quarterly, points out that not all the 6lame should be levelled at the civil law countries. The common law countries have also been known to exercise jurisdiction over foreign nationals in situations where the connection between the litigant and the country concerned is somewhat tenuous, to put it mildly. An interesting example of this can be found in a 1965 decision of the New York Court of Appeal in the case Bryant v. Finnish National Airlines, a report of which can be found in the second edition of volume 15 of the New York Reports at page 426. The case concerned a resident of New York who sued Finnish National Airlines for injuries incurred at a Paris airport through the alleged negligence of the airline. The Court of Appeal held that it had personal jurisdiction because the airline maintained a 1112-room office in New York city where some publicity work was done. As Proft)ssor De Winter points out: . . . if our objective is to get rid of so-called ""excessive jurisdiction"", we have to deal with a world-wide problem not limited to a few continental countries, although their laws and practice may provide us with the most spectacular examples. In this respect, the bilateral agreement between \Australia and the United Kingdom represents an interim measure designed to protect Australian interests in the United Kingdom from any harsh consequences that may flow from the operation of the Common Market Convention - a European Community convention. It is clear that much more needs to be done if we are to achieve a workable integration of the common law and civil law jurisdictions of the world. In this respect, writing in 1974 Professor Michael Pryles and Professor Francis Trinidad suggested that Australia should take three steps in order to ensure that Australian interests are properly protected. I am referring to an article published in volume 48 of the Australian Law Journal commencing at page 185 entitled 'The Common Market (EEC) Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters-Possible Impact Upon Australian Citizens.' The first step that Professors Pryles and Trinidad suggested was that Australia take advantage of article 59 of the convention and negotiate with the United Kingdom to enter into a bilateral convention on recognition and enforce-' ment of judgments. That has been done, but there are other steps Australia should take, and perhaps the Attorney-General could investigate this. In this regard, Professors Pryles and Trinidad suggest that Australia should support the supplementary protocol to the April 1966 Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters; request the United Kingdom to seek revision of articles 3 and 4 of the Common Market Convention so that Australians domiciled in Australia would not be faced with the possibility of having judgments obtained in the continental countries on jurisdictionally excessive grounds being enforced in the United Kingdom against assets which such Australians might have there; and make use of article 17 of the Common Market Convention, which allows for agreements to be entered into with persons domiciled in continental Europe to designate a court of a member state as competent to settle disputes which may arise out of a specific legal relationship. It is suggested that it may be appropriate to designate United Kingdom courts as the only courts that shall be competent to settle such disputes. I should add that Professors Pryles and Trinidad point out that this should not be construed as a sign of 'any mistrust of the impartiality of courts in the other Common Market States'. There are simply good practical reasons for adopting such an approach. There now remain only 121/2 minutes under the guillotine for anyone else to contribute to this debate. I sum up by saying to the Government that it should use its best endeavours to pursue the lowering of legal obstacles to free trade, for it will have our support and encouragement. I reiterate that the Opposition is not opposing the Bill.",123
188,Mr LAVARCH,PAIRS,"I will not keep the House for any great length; I know that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) wishes to have an opportunity to respond to a few of the matters the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable  raised. The Foreign Judgments Bill is not one which the Opposition is opposing, and for good reason. It is a useful reform to enhance the certainty that judgments from foreign courts can be both registered in Australian jurisdictions and enforced. The Bill will put into place a new national scheme to replace the present State-based legislation for the enforcement of foreign judgments. The current State-based scheme is modelled on the United Kingdom Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act of 1933. This legislation is basically uniform throughout all the States, with the exception of South Australia, meaning that judgments made in foreign courts can be enforced in Australia provided that there is a reciprocal arrangement between that State and the particular country. The difficulty with the current scheme, even though it is uniform so that there is not much difference in the law between the States, is the uncertainty and the differences between the States in the nature of the countries with which agreements have been made. This problem has been long recognised. I think it was first raised in 1980 at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. At that stage the Commonwealth, at the request of the Attorneys of each of the Australian States and Territories, agreed to go down the path which has eventually led to this particular Bill. In the early years the Commonwealth was engaged in actually finding out what were the arrangements in place with each of the States. Though one would have thought that would be a fairly straightforward exercise, it did take a number of years, which I suppose reinforces the point and the desirability of having such a scheme handled at a national level rather than the Commonwealth negotiating at the request of various States. Having undertaken that exercise, the Commonwealth then proceeded through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, gaining broad agreement for this Bill; and hence we are at this stage. As the shadow Attorney pointed out, the Bill is another step in the process of micro-economic reform. Even though it is hardly spectacular, like the waterfront or transport or telecommunications, which are much heralded, it is nonetheless a very important area because it touches on the services sector. Certainly, as Australia's economy has become increasingly internationalised over recent years, as it will continue to do, it is absolutely essential that barriers which currently exist in the enforcement of judgments between countries be eliminated. Steps such as this Bill are quite consistent with Australia's undertakings under the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round and are certainly perfectly consistent with the Government's program to reform and improve the way in which the Australian economy works. It is also another fine example of the cooperative approach which can come about through the Commonwealth and the States acting together, and as such it is perhaps a very small foretaste of new federalism. I will not go into the particular details of the Bill. They have been well canvassed by the Attorney in his second reading speech and by the shadow Attorney in his recent contribution. It is a Bill which makes good sense and the scheme, when enacted, will enhance commercial operations within Australia. It will also help Australians, companies and individuals in their dealing with foreign countries in making sure that they also can enforce judgments in those countries. For those purposes I am pleased to be associated with this Bill, and I commend it to the House.",126
189,Mr DUFFY,PAIRS,"in reply-Before replying to some of the matters raised by the honour I present a correction to the explanatory memorandum, which, in one line, referred to the insertion of a new section 9A. It was a typographical error. It should have read 'new subsection 12(9)A'. Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) from this side of the House for his contribution to the debate, for the explanations that he has given and, for that matter, for his assistance in many of the debates within this portfolio. I also thank the honourable member for Kooyong, the shadow Attorney, f<;lr supporting this Foreign Judgments BIll. We have reached that stage on quite a few matters during the current sitting of the Parliament and, for that matter, the previous one due to the fact there has been consultation and cooperation. It might be a lesson we can continue with and which some other people might adopt. It does make life a little easier. However, the shadow Attorney did indicate some concern about the States and felt that there may not have been sufficient negotiations with the States. Whilst I must say that in this portfolio it is extremely necessary to consult with the States it is a fairly tortuous exercise from time to time. The fact is that, in respect of the corporations legislation which was in this place yesterday, if the negotiations had not been interrupted by challenges and then eventual agreement, we probably would have been able to have proper protection of investors in this country a lot sooner than has happened. As the shadow Attorney said, I provided some background to him on the reciprocal enforcement of judgments: the problems of 1980 and then, as he indicated, the 1980 decision of the StandingCommittee of Attorneys-General (SCAG), the 1984 SCAG decision, the implementation of the 1984 SCAG decision, and the present position. To some extent, that was done not just to provide information to the shadow Attorney, but to indicate to him how tortuous a process it is to in fact get what is necessary in these cases to get agreement. The schedule provided to the shadow Attorney shows that the reactions of State and Territory Ministers to the Commonwealth legislation on reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments were quite extraordinary. It was not necessary to enter into any agreement, but those who eventually wrote back and said 'We support it' were Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Queensland said it was in agreement. The position of the Attorney in Western Australia was: 'If other States and Territories agree, we agree'. It was opposed only by one Attorney, the then Attorney-General in New South Wales, the Hon. John Dowd. I am not sure whether that view will prevail in New South Wales; I have some reason to bclieve that it will not. The fact of the matter is that that was the only area where there was disagreement. It is worth noting how long it takes to go through this process of everyone agreeing. Whilst, as the honourable member for Fisher indicated, there is uniform legislation, the fact is that it was not working as well as it should, for all the reasons indicated on both sides of this House. But by the time one goes through the process of a Standing Committee of Attorneys General, it is not as easy a matter as some people might think. The shadow Attorney, in a sense, called upon his halcyon days as Foreign Affairs Minister when he indicated the cooperation with the States in that area. I think it is a lot easier in that area because at the end of the day, in most instances, that is totally a Commonwealth responsibility. Contrary to the suggestions made by the honourable member for Kooyong-I stand to be corrected on this, and if it is a misrepresentation it is not intended to be-this Government has in fact adopted in that area the principles which I thought had been in fact drafted by his former leader, colleague and close friend, the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. Although I do have some limited experience, I have nothing like the experience of the honourable member for Kooyong, who now tells us that he drafted them. ",127
190,Mr DUFFY,PAIRS,"I am uncertain about that, but the honourablc gentleman has interjected and said 'That is right', so my view that it was Mr Fraser is wrong. We have followed that wonderful example that the shadow Attorney has set, and I think he is under a misapprehension if he thinks we have not. Indeed, State representatives are still included in Commonwealth negotiating teams. The concerns expressed by the honourable member for Kooyong in respect of consultation with the States in fact arc ill-founded; we have consulted with the States. In relation to the shadow Attorney's query as to the future, we will go through ,that whole exercise againdutifully and very carefully-and hope that we will in fact get some cooperation again, as we have in this instance. In closing, I mention that the problem is not so much getting agreement with the States as getting a reply to a letter. That is the problem from time to time with State governments.",128

193,Mr FIFE,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"After the drubbing this Government has taken this week, I know that the end of the parliamentary sittings cannot come soon enough for the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and, indeed, for the Government. It is anxious to put up the shutters and to cut and run. However, before Government members slink away into the night, another example of the Government's hypocrisy and contempt for the Parliament should be exposed. Earlier this week, the Leader of the House when introducing the guillotine told us that because the Government was so hard worked, and because it legislated very heavily, there was no escaping the guillotine if it was to fulfil its full legislative program. Thirty-seven Bills, most of them introduced between midnight last Thursday and 3.30 a.m. on Friday, were subject to the guillotine so they could reach the Senate in time to be dealt with before that House went into recess on 21 June. Now we learn that quite a number of those Bills put under Monday's guillotine, and the one earlier in the previous week, will not be dealt with by the Senate until the Budget sittings beginning in August. Among the guillotined Bills that have been put aside is the highly contentious Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. This Bill, which we asked to be split to allow the two separate issues of the advertising ban and the political disclosures provisions to be dealt with on their respective merits, was, according to the Government's view, so urgent that it could not be delaved for a moment and had to be debated ""under the guillotine. But now, for reasons that I am sure all honourable members understand, the urgency has evaporated. It can now wait until August. What then has changed? It is because the Government is shrinking from the opprobrium that is going to attach to it through passing legislation which so clearly constitutes a blatant denial of the basic right of free speech. Let it be noted that this view was rcinforced by the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, who said that the legislation clearly constituted a breach of Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There is then a clutch of about 10 so called urgent Bills which apparently can also wait until the Budget sittings before being dealt with by the Senate. Let me name some of them. They include the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill; there was absolutely no debate on that Bill in this House. There are two Bills relating to interstate road transport; the Foreign Judgments Bill; the Copyright Amendment Bill; the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill, the passage of which we facilitated. There is the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, and so it goes on. The Senate mayor may not get to the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Bill and the Export Control Amendment Bill. There is some dispute over the package of seven fisheries Bills but, in the view of the Opposition, no real urgency attaches to them and they are unlikely to come under consideration in the Senate. That is not to suggest that these Bills are not important; of course they are. But like so much of the Government legislation which it insists is urgent, the package of fishery Bills deserves more thorough consideration than was afforded them in this place. It is irresponsible of the Government to come into this House with a motion to limit debate on important and complex legislation and then backtrack and declare that it is not so urgent after all. It is another example of the failure of this Government to properly handle the business of this Parliament. It also highlights again the way that this Government uses Parliament as a rubber stamp and merely as a means of getting its legislation through as quickly as possible and then scurrying back to the Cabinet room and the Caucus room to actually govern this country. The Government's attitude to Parliament not only runs against the true interests of the electors of this country; it also strikes at the rights and privileges of members of this House. As members we have a responsibility and a duty to those we represent to give adequate and proper consideration to the legislation that comes before us. The way the Government insists on ramming its legislation through in the last few days of each session abrogates that right. It shows that this is a Government callously contemptuous of the Australian people as well as of the institution of Parliament and democratic government. We were hearing some two or three weeks ago that the Parliament would come back not only on the 20th and the 2 J st, as this motion provides, but also in the first week in July to deal with any amendments to the Bills that are now no longer urgent. However, the Government, obviously because of its own disarray and its own leadership problems, is getting the Parliament up as soon as possible.",130

197,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I think that we on this side of the House earn every bit of our pay. The simple facts of the matter are that some of the matters alluded to by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), are correct in factual terms but not in inference. The fact is that the Senate will not consider a good deal of legislation that we put forward to it in anticipation of its operating something effectively like the Macklin motion. The Senate now has decided not to do that but to deal only with 1 June start-up-date Bills, or, in other words, some 20 Bills fewer in the Government's program than we previously considered it ought to deal with. The Senate says that it will come back early in August to deal with the others. 1 cannot absolutely guarantee that those two sitting dates that we have announced will in fact be the last sitting dates in this session. Being in this place and dealing with the Opposition in this time of difficulty for us is like being savaged with wet lettuce. We have absolutely no problems in having the House sit to deal with the matters that arise. Mr Fife-You should be able to give us some indications. We are ready to come back in July.",131
198,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"We can give all the indications the moment we get information out of the Senate. At this moment, as of last reading of the Senate, we are going to get only those 20 Bills and we are going to get them by the date that is outlined in this motion. If something changes-and anything is possible-it is conceivable that other things could apply. The best information we have, however, is that this is it, and that until a midpoint in August the Senate will consider nothing more that we have put before it than those 20 Bills.

201,Mr LINDSAY,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the Committee entitled Examination of the Annual Report for 1989-90 of the National Crime Authority. Ordered that the report be printed.",133
202,Mr LINDSAY,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"by leaveUnder section 51 (1) (c) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 it is the duty of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to examine each annual report of the Authority and to report to the Parliament on any matter appearing in, or arising out of, any such annual r-port. The report I have just tabled contains the results of the Committee's examination of the Authority's annual report for the financial year ended 30 June 1990. The Committee's report is confined to a narrow appraisal of the adequacy of the Authority's report. The Committee considered that it was more appropriate to deal with the broader issues arising from matters contained in the annual report when the Committee reports on its current detailed evaluation of the Authority. The Committee commenced this evaluation in July 1990 and it expects to report in the Budget sittings later this year. The evaluation includes the issues of accountability and parliamentary supervision of the Authority. The Committee considered that the annual report was presented to the Parliament in a timely way. However, it criticised the fact that the National Crime Authority Act does not specify a time within which the report must be presented for tabling. Unlike most other bodies whose reports are tabled in the Parliament, the Authority does not present its annual report directly to a Minister who is then required to table it. Instead, the Authority presents its annual report to the intergovernmental committee which is established under the National Crime Authority Act. This Committee then passes the annual report to the Attorney General. I am pleased to report that the Committee considered that the report was satisfactory when evaluated against both the reporting requirements set out in section 61 of the National Crime Authority Act and the relevant guidelines for the preparation of annual reports. The Committee did have some minor criticisms of the annual report and suggestions on how some information could be more usefully set out. It wrote to the Authority seeking explanations on two matters. The Authority's reply is included as an attachment to the Committee's report. In that reply, the Authority concedes that its annual report contains a technical breach of the reporting requirements and that some figures in the report are incorrect on the number of warrants granted to the Authority authorising it to intercept telecommunications. I compliment the Authority on the quality of its annual report. NA INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That: (1) if the House is not sitting when the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has completed its report on genetically modified organisms, the committee may send the report to the Speaker, or, in the absence of the Speaker, to the Chairman of Committees, and, in that event: (a) the publication of the report is authorised by this resolution; and (b) the Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees, as the case may be, is authorised to gi ve directions for the printing and circulation of the report. (2) the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing and sessional orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders. NA",133
203,Mr SPEAKER,TELEVISING OF PROCEEDINGS,"On 12 February the House agreed to a trial period of televising of the proceedings. At that time it was made clear that there would be a review of the arrangements after a reasonable period. I believe that now would be an appropriate time to initiate that reVIew. In agreeing to the television trial, the House adopted conditions to be complied with by the broadcasters and also guidelines for the operators of the television equipment. Recently there have been claims that on some occasions certain broadcasters have not complied with the conditions. I have written to the heads of the bureaus about these claims and made reference to one instance when I consider the guidelines were breached. Similarly, there have been suggestions that the conditions have been difficult to apply in some circumstances. It is appropriate, therefore, that any review body should look at these conditions and guidelines at the same time as it is conducting its general review of televising of the proceedings. It would also be appropriate, in my view, if those conducting the review also looked at the arrangements which should apply to the televising of committees. As the Senate has recently determined its own arrangements for the televising of its proceedings, it would not be appropriate for the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings to consider the arrangements for the House alone. Accordingly, I suggest that the members of the House who serve on that Committee would be the appropriate persons to constitute a select committee to conduct the review. I understand that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will be moving accordingly and that appropriate terms of reference arc to be proposed with the Committee expected to report to the House at the commencement of the Budget sitting. The existing conditions for televising of the House will continue to apply until the House decides otherwise. The trial of televising has been an interesting and informative experience. I am sure that the televising of the procedures of the House is a matter on which all members would have a view. I would encourage all members to make their views known to the review committee. NA NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: (1) That a select committee be appointed to inquire into and report on the televising of the proceedings of the House of Representatives and its committees with particular reference to: (a) the impact of the trial period of televising from 12 February 1991; (b) the reactions of Members and others to the trial period; (c) the suitability of the conditions govern- (13) ing the tclevising of proceedings adopted for the trial period; (d) the suitability of the guidelines for the camcra operators; (e) difficulties encountered by the broadcasters in complying with the conditions; and (f) any other matters relevant to this issue. (2) That the committee consist of 5 members, 3 members to be nominated by the Government Whip or Whips and 2 members to be nominated by the Opposition Whip or Whips or by any independent Member. (3) That every nomination of a member of the committee be forthwith notified in writing to the Speaker. (4) That the committee elect a Government member as its chairman. (5) That the committee elect a deputy chairman who shall act as chairman of the committee at any time when the chairman is not present at a meeting of the committee and at any time when the chairman and deputy chairman are not present at a meeting of the committee the members present shall elect another member to act as chairman at that meeting. (6) That the committee have power to appoint subcommittees consisting of' 3 or more of its members and to reCer to any subcommittee any matter which the committee is empowered to examine. (7) That the committee appoint the chairman of each subcommittee who shall have a casting vote only, and at any time when the chairman of a subcommittee is not present at a meeting of the subcommittee the members of the subcommittee present shall elect another member of that subcommittee to act as chairman at that meeting. (8) That the quorum of a subcommittee be a majority of the members of that subcommittee. (9) That members of the committee who are not members of a subcommittee may participate in the public proceedings of that subcommittee but shall not vote, move any motion or be counted for the purpose of a quorum. (10) That the committee or any subcommittee have power to send for persons, papers and records. (11) That the committee or any subcommittee have power to move from place to place. (12) That a subcommittee have power to adjourn from time to time and to sit during any sittings or adjournment of the House. That a subcommittee have power to authorise publication of any evidence given before it and any document presented to it. (14) That the committee report by 20 August 1991. (15) That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they arc inconsistent with the standing and sessional orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders. Mr FIF;E (Hume-Manager of Opposition Busihess) (6.32 p.m.)-The Opposition supports the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) on the clear understanding that we are not going to entertain any recommendation for the cessation of the televising of Parliament. When televising commenced at the beginning of this year it was always understood that there would be a review. Providing the select committee conducting the review looks at the procedures that are followed and the guidelines, the Opposition has no problems with what is proposed and, indeed, we warmly support it. It is obvious that after a trial period there will be need for somc changes, but I indicate to the Leader of the House that we would not want the guidclines in this chamber to be any more restrictive than they arc in the Senate. I think there are some technical reasons as well as open government reasons for that. It is difficult for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when it is moving from one chamber to another if those guidelines are significantly different. I also indicate to the House, and particularly to the Leader of the House, that we would also like to see the adjournment debate televised. I accept that that will be a matter for the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings to consider and to report on. The Opposition holds a strong view that the adjournment debate should not only be televised, but it should also be broadcast. I have not researched the reasons for the decision in the early days of broadcasting to see why the adjournment debate was not included, but I think that time has proved that it would be of interest to the public to be able to listen to that debate the same as all other debates.",134
204,Mr BEAZLEY,REPRESENTATIVES,"I have no problem with the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings considering all those sorts of things. I am happy that the Opposition has notified me of that fact. It did not need to do that. I seek leave of the House to amend paragraph (2) of the motion, which should read: That the Committee consist of the Speaker, 2 members to be nominated by the Government Whip or Whips and 2 members to be nominated by the Opposition Whip or Whips or by any independent Member. The Clerk has just pointed out to me that I had an agreement with the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), earlier in the evening that there is no requirement to record their names as paragraph (3) states: That every nomination of a member of the committee be forthwith notified in writing to the Speaker. We believe that is sufficient to achieve the purpose; we do not need to put their names in here. There is a problem with the way in which this motion is worded as to the Speaker's position. He is not able to be nominated by a Whip and, therefore, the terms of paragraph (2) need to be amended to take account of that fact.",136
205,Mr FIFE,REPRESENTATIVES,"Since the Speaker is not able to be nominated by a Whip, presumably that means the Government Whip has gone on strike. Seriously, I accept the proposition that has been put forward by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). As I understand it, members of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings will constitute Mr Speaker as Chairman and there will be two members of the Government and two members of the Opposition. For our part we will be nominating our representatives on the Committee. They are the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks).

However members of this House were not advised: and I ask you why members of this House were not advised.",137

But the matters that he is raising do not constitute points of order and there is other business before the House. NA BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Free, for Mr Kerin, and read a first timc. Second Reading",137
218,Mr FREE,INSURANCE LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), foreshadowed in announcements on 6 November 1990, 21 January 1991 and 11 February 1991 that the Government would be implementing a range of measures to provide financial support to policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Ltd and Regal Life Insurance Ltd, and to increase the general level of prudential protection provided to life and general insurance policyholders. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, together with five other companion Bills, gives legislative effect to the measures outlined in those announcements. The five companion Bills are: - the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991; - the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991; Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991; - the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991; and - the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991. Taken together, this package of Bills will: - improve the financial and prudential standards which must be satisfied by life and general insurance companies; provide a mechanism for the prior screening of changes to the ownership and control of life and general ance companies; - put in place levy arrangements which will ensure that an appropriate degree of protection is provided to policy holdcrs of Occidental Life and Regal Life; and - allow for the recovery of costs arising from additional resources provided to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, for the purpose of improved industry supervision, through an increase in the life and general insurance supervisory levies. The measures have been developed in liaison with senior representatives of the life and general insurance industry associations. In this respect, I would like to place on record the Government's appreciation for the constructive comments and advice received from the industry associations and underwriters during this process. This cooperation demonstrates the industries' understanding of the need for soundly based and well directed supervisory legislation. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 effects a number of amendments to the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945 to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the existing supervisory arrangements. The Government is introducing these measures to overcome a number of deficiencies in the two Acts which became evident during the investigation into the affairs of Occidental Life and Regal Life at the end of last year, and as a result of other developments in the life and general insurance industries. The measures in some cases represent a bringing forward of proposals from the current review of the Life Insurance Act 1945. This review, which involves a ber of detailed and complex technical is1945 to: sues relating to the solvency standards to be observed by life offices and the controls which should apply in relation to new and innovative life products, is expected to result in further amendments to the Life Insurance Act in 1992. This Bill is structured in three parts. Part I provides necessary formal short tiinsurtle and commencement provisions. Part II amends the Insurance Act 1973 to: - increase the minimum capital and solvency requirements for authorised general insurers, and introduce an additional solvency requirement based on the level of a company's outstanding claims provisions-phasing-in provisions are to apply to existing authorised companies; - give the Commissioner, rather than the Treasurer, the discretion to exempt companies carrying on limited forms of insurance on a very small scale from such provisions of the Act as may be determined; - effect a number of minor amendments to the description of accounts and statements required to be lodged with the Commissioner; - permit the Commissioner to direct an authorised insurance company to havc an actuary, who is not an officer of the company, carry out a review of its outstanding claims provisions and for the Commissioner to receive a copy of the actuary's report; - enhance the provisions dealing with investigations, appointment of inspectors and the giving of directions to authorised insurance companies; - provide measures to disqualify a person who has been bankrupt, or convicted of an offence relating to insurance or dishonest conduct, from appointment as a director or to a senior management position; and - enable the public disclosure of information additional to that which is already available from statutory returns lodged with the Commissioner by general insurers. numPart III amends the Life Insurance Act - increase the minimum paid-up capital requirement applying to registered life offices which have a share capital, and require all registered life offices to maintain an excess of non-statutory fund assets over non-statutory fund liabilities-phasing-in provisions are to apply to existing registered life offices; - increase the frequency of actuarial investigations to be made into the financial condition of a registered life office by an appointed actuary-the increase win bring the requirement into line with current practice; - reducc certain pcriods speciflCd in the Act for the lodging of annual statutory returns by registered life offices; - enhancc the provisions dealing with investigations, appointment of inspectors and giving of directions to registered life insurance offices; and - provide measures to disqualify a person who has been bankrupt, or convicted of an offence relating to insurance or dishonest conduct, from appointment as a director, to a senior managcment position, or to the position of appointed actuary. I would now like to address some of the more significant provisions of the Bill. Minimum Capital and Solvency Requirements The Bill proposes that the minimum paid-up share capital requirement for a company seeking authorisation to conduct general insurance business be increased from $500,000 to $2m, and that the minimum amount by which the company's assets arc to exceed its liabilities be increased from $lm to $2m. The Bill also provides for similar amendments to the minimum capital and solvency requirements which must be maintaincd at all times by authorised general insurers. The effect of the new solvency arrangements, which apply to all business of Australian incorporated companies and to the Australian business of overseas incorporated companies, will be that the value by which an authorised insurer's asscts must excecd its liabilities will, subject to transitional provisions, be the greatest of: - $2m-increased from $1 m; 20 per cent of its premium income in its last preceding financial yearthe existing requirement is unchanged; or - 15 per cent of its outstanding claims provision as at the end of its last preceding financial year-this is a new requirement. The minimum capital and solvency requirements of the Insurance Act have remained unchanged since 1984. The increase in the mlllimum monetary amounts is therefore a measure to bring the requirements up to date and more into line with present conditions. The proposed additional solvency requirement, equal to 15 per cent of outstanding claims provision, will enslire that the minimum required solvency margin better reflects the circumstances of insurers with large outstanding claims provisions. The present solvency margin, which has regard to the level of a company's premium income, has proved to be deficient in cases where companies with very large outstanding claims provisions suffer a decline in premium income. The Bill ensures that an appropriate degree of protection is provided to policyholders in such circumstances. The Life Insurance Act 1945 currently provides that, where a company seeking registration has a share capital, it must have a minimum $2m paid-up capital and share premium account balance. No similar obligation is placed on non-share capital companiesmutual companies-seeking registration and there is no requirement for branches of overseas insurers to maintain funds in Australia. The Bill provides for an increase from $2m to $lOm in the minimum capital rcquirement imposed under the Act. This will apply to all companies with a share capital on a continuing basis. It also imposes a requirement on companies without share capital to maintain assets of $10m, and for foreign companies to maintain assets of $10m in Australia. These assets must be held outside the statutory funds. In addition to the existing requirements which deal with the solvency of individual statutory funds, registered life offices will now be required to maintain an excess of $5m of assets over liabilities, to be held outside of the statutory funds. The requirement to also hold funds outside the statutory funds will ensure that proprietors maintain a financial commitment to the effective operation of the life office and that additional support is ultimately available to the statutory funds should this prove to be necessary. Investigation Provisions During the investigation into the affairs of Occidental Life and Regal Life, it was found that the existing provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1945 relating to investigations and the issue of directions restricted the ability of the Commissioner to act to protect - the interests of policyholders in a timely manner. In particular, the Commissioner was not able to issue directions concerning the business of the company until after his investigation had been completed. There was no scope, as is the case with the Insurance Act 1973, for the issue of interim directions in circumstances where it has become clear that these are justified but the overall investigation is not yet completed. This is an issue which is of considerable concern to the Government as it is possible for circumstances to prevail where the position of policyholders could be severely compromised by the inability of the Commissioner to respond in a timely fashion. As a result, the Government is moving to ensure greater consistency between the provisions of the two Acts relating to the conduct of investigations and the issue of directions. The amendments proposed in the Bill draw upon the stronger features of the relevant provisions in eaeh of the Acts. The Bill therefore amends the Life Insurance Act 1945 to provide that the Commissioner may issue directions during the course of an investigation, and prevent a life office dealing with certain of its assets. The Insurance Act 1973 is amended to provide that the Commissioner, rather than the Treasurer, can appoint an inspector to undertake an investigation into the affairs of an insurer and give directions to a company pursuant to such an investigation. Disqualification of Certain Persons The Government has had concerns for some time that the safeguards in the insurance supervisory system are not sufficient to exclude from key positions in insurance companies people who have been convicted of dishonest conduct. The Bill therefore provides that an insurance company will be prohibited from appointing to certain positions a person who has been found guilty of an offence in respect of insurance or dishonest conduct. It also provides a similar prohibition in respect of persons who are, or have been, bankrupt or insolvent. The positions to which this disqualification will rclate are director or principal executive officer of an Australian company and local executive officer of a foreign company. The provision will also apply to the appointed actuary under the Life Insurance Act 1945. Provisions have been included in the Bill to provide a defence against prosecution where the defendant company shows that it did not know or suspect that an appointee was disqualified. Actuarial Investigations The Bill introduces new provisions into the Insurance Act 1973 which enable the Commissioner to direct an authorised insurer to have an actuary carry out a review of its outstanding claims provision. The outstanding claims provision is almost invariably the largest liability of a general insurance company. Significant delays can occur, even in respect of well managed companies, in the reporting and settlement of claims, particularly in the liability classes of insurance business, including workers compensation and public liability business. The outstanding claims provision of a general insurance company is determined on the basis of a process involving statistical and actuarial estimation. The proposed measure will enable the Commissioner to have the company's estimations independently verified where this is considered to be appropriate. The Bill also includes provisions to bring the Life Insurance Act into line with current practice by requiring an investigation into the financial condition of registcred life offices to be carried out annually by the company's appointed actuary rather than at five-yearly intervals. Financial Implications The measures contained in this Bill to increase the prudential protection available to insurance policyholders, together with those contained in the companion Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991, will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The additional resources needed to give effect to these measures have been estimated at $510,000 in 1990-91, $785,000 in 1991-92 and $410,000 in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. These additional costs will be fully recovered through the life insurance and general insurance supervisory levies. It is for this purpose that the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 are included in the package of Bills before the House. I commend the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.  journed.

219,Mr FREE,INSURANCE ACQUISITIONS AND,"Lindsay-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.19 p.m.)-I movc: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991 forms part of a package of six cognate bills which are being introduced today. Taken together, these Bills increase the level of prudential protcction provided to life and gencral insurance policyholders and provide a measure of financial support to policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Ltd and Regal Lifc Insurance Ltd. The Bills give effect to announcements made by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), on 6 November 1990, 21 January 1991 and 11 February 1991. The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill now before the House sets out new rules for compulsory notification to the Minister and screening of proposals relating to: - acquisition or issue of significant shareholdings-15 per cent or more-in Australian insurance companies; - acquisition or leasing of a significant portion-IS per cent or more-of the assets of Australian insurance companies; and - control of agreements, whether formalar informal, relating to the directorate of Australian insurance companIes. The changes provided for in this Bill complement other measures being introduced today in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1991 to strengthen and enhance existing insurance supervisory legislation. The Government is introducing legislation providing for the screening of proposed changes to the ownership and control of insurers in order to reduce the risk of financial loss to policyholders where. inappropriate persons assume ownership or control of insurance companies. The measures seek to preserve the good standing of these important industries and to ensure that the national interest is protected where changes to the ownership or control of insurance companies are proposed to be made. The Bill aims to protect the public interest by: - ensuring that the conduct of the affairs of Australian life and general insurance companies is not adversely affected by changes in ownership or control of those companies; - preventing unsuitable persons from acquiring a position of influence over Australian life and general insurance companies; - preventing transactions or arrangements which would result in undue concentration of economic power in the Australian life insurance industry, the Australian general insurance industry or the Australian financial system generally; and - preventing transactions which would be contrary to the national interest. In developing the measures contained in this Bill, the Government has taken into account other comparable legislation, including the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and similar legislation operating in the United Kingdom. The Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill is structured in 10 parts. Part 1 provides a number of necessary formal provisions, a clear statement of objects, and a simplified outline of the Bill. It also defines key terms and concepts for the purposes of this Act. Parts 2, 3 and 4 deal with the acquisition of ownership or control of Australian insurance companies. The parts deal with acquisitions by means of: - issue or acquisition of shares; - acquisition or leasing of assets; and - agreements relating to company directorships. In particular, the three parts provide for: - a trigger threshold of 15 per cent of ownership or control of a target company for purposes of notification of a proposed acquisition; - a 30-day time limit for the Minister to make a decision in respect of a proposal; - the Minister to grant conditional approval, make permanent or temporary restraining orders and to make divestment orders where it is appropriate to do so; and - penalty provisions for contravention of orders made by the Minister. Part 5 provides for the Federal Court to make judicial orders for the enforcement of ministerial orders made under the Bill. Part 6 provides a mechanism to unwind schemes which may be effected to avoid the notification and approval provisions of the Bill. Part 7 empowers the Minister to set down principles to be tabled in Parliament, to be followed in making certain decisions under the Bill. Part 8 provides a mechanism for the review of decisions by the Minister and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Parts 9 and 10 contain a number of miscellaneous provisions of relevance to the administration and operation of the Bill. These include provisions relating to the secrecy of information provided to the Government for the purposes of the Bill. The Bill provides that proposals involving the acquisition of ownership or control of interests in an insurer in excess of a 15 per cent threshold must be notified to the Minister. The 15 per cent threshold is defined in terms which are sufficiently broad in scope to ensure the notification of proposals to acquire significant direct or indirect interests in an insurer. The threshold takes account of interests arising from the operation of informal agreements and understandings. It also has regard to the interests of persons who are associated with the acquirer as well as interests that may be directly held .. Under the Bill, proposals must be notified prior to the acquisition of an interest in excess of the threshold and the Minister has 30 days in which to make a decision. The Minister may decide that he has no objection to the proposal or, alternatively, that the proposal may be implemented with or without conditions. If the Minister makes no decision within the 30day period then the proposal may be implemented. The Minister may also issue a temporary restraining order where more time is needed to examine a proposed transaction. The life of such orders is subject to limits laid down in the Bill. Where the Minister is satisfied that the proposal is not in the public interest, he may issue a permanent restraining order. The Bill also contains broad antiavoidance provisions. In particular, it provides penalties for non-compliance and the Minister has power to issue a divestment order in circumstances where a person has acquired an interest in an insurer without seeking prior approval and where that acquisition is considered to be contrary to the public interest. The need for the type of legislative trols which will be provided by this Bill was demonstrated by the circumstances leading up to the attempted sale of Occidental Life and Regal Life. In that case, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner was aware from informal industry contacts that steps were being taken to arrange for the sale of the two companies. His attempts to obtain precise and detailed information concerning the proposed transaction were frustrated by the lack of formal authority to investigate the matter properly. More generally, the Commissioner has been concerned that he has been required to rely on the cooperation of the industry rather than on formal arrangements for monitoring changes to the ownership and control of life and general insurance companies. Experience has clearly shown that it is ah important element of supervision to be in a position to appropriately monitor significant transactions of this nature. Such monitoring arrangements are important not only for prudential purposes but also to place the Government in a position to effectively monitor changes which could lead to undue concentration of power in the insurance industry and financial markets generally. In framing the Bill, the Government has been aware of the need to build in appropriate safeguards and review provisions in order to avoid unnecessary intervention in the operation of the market. Accordingly, the Bill contains measures for the protection of the rights and interests of persons and companies affected by its operation. In particular, the Bill contains appropriate secrecy provisions and review provisions which will give scope for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of key decisions under the Act. In summary, the measures being introduced in this Bill are designed to further protect the interests of insurance consumers as well as the broader national interest. The Bill does not unduly' interfere with the open and competitive market for insurance business. At the same time it provides clear rules and guidelincs con- with respect to the ownership and control of insurance companies while providing for the protection of the privacy of affccted individuals. Financial Implications The measures contained in this Bill to provide for the screening of changes to the ownership and control of insurance companies, together with the improved prudential arrangements contained in the companion Insurancc Laws Amendment Bill 1991, will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The additional resources needed to give effect to these measures have been estimated at $510,000 in 1990-91, $785,000 in 1991-92 and $410,000 in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. These additional costs will be fully recovered through the life insurance and general insurance supervisory levies. It is for this purpose that the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 and the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1991 are includcd in the package of Bills bcfore the House. I commend the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991 to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.  journed. NA HOLDERS' PROTECTION LEVIES BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Free, for Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",141
220,Mr FREE,LIFE INSURANCE POLICY,"Lindsay-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.28 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991 and its companion Bill-the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991-introduce measures to enable a levy to be imposed on life insurers to assist policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Co. of Australia Ltd and Regal Life Insurance Ltd. These Bills form part of a package of six cognate Bills dealing with insurance matters. Taken together, the six Bills introduce measures to provide: - financial assistance to the policyholders of Occidental Life and Regal Life; - machinery for screening changes in ownership and control of both life and general insurance companies; and, - a range of other improvements which will generally strengthen existing insurance supervisory arrangements. As honourable members will be aware, a judicial manager was appointed to take control of the business of Occidental Life and Regal Life on 7 November 1990. This followed the attempted sale of the two companies in September last year and the subsequent revelation that $65m of statutory fund moneys of the companies had been misused. Under the Life Insurance Act, all policyholders' funds must be held in statutory funds which may only be applied to meet liabilities and expenses applicable to those funds. Investigations by the judicial manager have indicated that there is a potential significant shortfall in the major statutory funds of the two companies and that the amount of the shortfall is dependent on the outcome of various legal and other proceedings. Against the background of the significant implications of these events for affected policyholders and on the life insurance industry generally, the industry devoted a considerable amount of time and effort in attempting to develop voluntary support arrangements to provide assistance to the policyholders involved. Notwithstanding the goodwill and assistance shown by the industry, it was found that significant legal and technical difficulties stood in the way of an effective industry approach. This led to the Government announcing on 21 January 1991 that it would introduce legislation to provide for one-off levy arrangements similar to those which were proposed under the industry voluntary support arrangements. This Bill and the associated Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill give effect to the announced arrangements. In developing these arrangements, the Government had particular regard to the importance of the life insurance industry to the Australian economy as a repository of long term personal and retirement savings. It also had regard to the special and unusual circumstances involving the unauthorised dealing in statutory funds moneys which led to the potential for serious loss on the part of policyholders, and the need to carefully balance the interests of those policyholders and the interests of policyholders generally. A key component of the Bill is that it will permit the making of regulations to impose one or more levies on the Australian proportion of the value of the statutory .fund assets of a life insurance company for purposes of ensuring that up to 90 per cent of policyholders' claims against Occidental Life and Regal Life are satisfied. In line with the Government's announcement of 11 February 1991 concerning the proposed levy arrangements, the Bill also contains provisions which will limit the total amount of levy collected under the legislation to $65m. Other provisions in the Bill, and in the companion Collection Bill, provide for safeguards which prevent the levy arrangements from applying unless the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is satisfied that the financial position of Occidental Life or Regal Life, particularly in relation to availability of assets, is such as to warrant resort to the levy process. The two Bills have been developed in consultation with the senior representatives of the life insurance industry. In addition, a committee of senior industry representatives has been established to assist the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in the implementation of the levy arrangements. It is envisaged that the Commissioner and this Committee will be working closely with the judicial manager, or liquidator, of Occidental Life and Regal Life in this process. The Bills complement court and other actions which have been set in train by the judicial manager in an endeavour to recover statutory fund moneys due to the two companies. It is also relevant that investigations to ensure the prosecution of persons who may be guilty of offences relating to the circumstances of the two companies are continuing. In concluding this outline of the Bill, should emphasise that it is the clear tion of the Government to do all it reasonably can to prevent the kind of problems that have emerged as a result of the attempted sale of Occidental Life and Regal Life. It is for this reason that the Government attaches considerable importance to the other measures, such as those dealing with prior screening of changes of ownership and control of insurers and im* proved capital standards and prudential requirements, being brought forward in this package of Bills. I commend the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991 to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.  journed.

The Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991 and its companion Bill-the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill 1991introduce measures to enable a levy to be imposed on life insurers to provide an appropriate level of protection for the policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Ltd and Regal Life Insurance Ltd. These Bills form part of a package of six cognate Bills which also deal with a range of other insurance matters, including minimum capital standards and other prudential requirements and machinery for screening changes in ownership and control of both life and general insurance companies. . In my second reading speech on the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection I Levies Bill 1991, I outlined the backintenground and other considerations which have led to the development of the levy arrangements provided for in these two Bills. In broad terms, the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill is concerned with establishing the detailed machinery relating to the collection and application of levies imposed for the purpose of providing financial assistance to policyholders of Occidental Life and Regal Life. Under the provisions in part 3 of the Bill, a special trust account, the life insurance policyholders' protection fund, is established to receive levy moneys paid by life offices. The Bill also provides in part 4: - for the grant of financial assistance from the fund, on request from the judicial manager, or liquidator, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the financial position of Occidental Life or Regal Life, particularly in relation to availability of assets, is such as to warrant resort to the levy process; - that a grant is subject to the condition that it will only be used to pay up to 90 per cent of each policyholder claim, and related administra, tive expenses; and - that the Commissioner may impose other specified conditions, including that grant moneys not be applied to the benefit of persons who may have contributed to the difficulties of Occidental Life or Regal Life. He may also impose additional conditions in a grant \. determination where this is approprIate. Part 5 of the Bill deals with the repayment of grants of financial assistance. In particular, the part provides for: - the recovery of grant moneys from the judicial manager, or liquidator, where conditions to which the grant is subject are breached or in circumstances such as where the judicial manager, or liquidator, obtains settlement of debts; - grant repayments to have priority over most other debts of Occidental Life and Regal Life; and - repayment of any surplus levy mon-ys to the insurers who paid the levles. The Bill also contains a number of addiintroduced today. tional safeguards to protect the interests of insurers subject to the levy and the policyholders of Occidental Life and gal Life. These provisions will grants paid, and their application in accordance with the conditions attached to the grant, will be under the control of the judicial manager, or liquidator, who in turn is subject to the control of the court. The provisions also establish arrangements for the review of key decisions under the legislation and regular reporting to the Commissioner and the Parliament In summary, therefore, this Bill, and the companion Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Bill, provide for the imposition of one-off levy arrangepervisory ments to assist policyholders who may be affected by the events which led to the appointment of a judicial manager to cidental Life and Regal Life. The broader measures included in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill and the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill will ensure that policyholders generally will, in future, be better protected from events such as those which led to the imposition of this levy. I commend the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Bill 1991 to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.  journed.

This Bill amends the Life Insurance SuLevy Act 1989, which imposes an annual supervisory levy on life insurers in order to recover the cost of their Ocsupervision under the Life Insurance Act 1945. The annual rate on which the life insurance supervisory levies are calculated is increased by the Bill from $20,000-the annual rate currently imposed' by regulation-to $25,000. It also increases the statutory upper limit for the levy, that is, the indexed ceiling governing the extent to which the levy may be increased by regulation, from $20,634 for the 1990-91 financial year to $28,000 for the 1991-92 financial year. However, any regulations increasing the annual rate of levy above $25,000 are not to be effective before 1 July 1992.

224,Dr BLEWETT,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"I welcome the introduction into this House of the motion on Tibet, which has bipartisan support and was adopted in the Senate on 6 December last year. Tibet is an area of endless fascination, both for its strikingly unique geographic features and for its rich cultural heritage stretching over thousands of years. Its lack of accessibility to travellers and its difficult environment have helped to maintain its mystique and the romance associated with the roof-top of the world. Unfortunately, Tibet also has a history of human rights abuses, dating particularly from the period of the cultural revolution in China in the 1960s and 1970s, ebbing in the somewhat more tolerant period of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, but with persistent reports of alleged abuses leaking out of Tibet in more recent years. No government can be immune to the tragedy of the recent reports of alleged abuses in Tibet relating to religious intolerance, arrests and mistreatment of prisoners for so-called 'subversive activities', which in fact are often expressions of religious and political vicws and values, and of the denial of freedom to practise cultural values to the indigenous Tibetan population. Although the allegations, so ably documented by Amnesty International, Asiawatch and a number of Tibetan interest groups are difficult to verify, the fact that they continue to emerge tends to suggest that they have some substance. The Australian Government remains concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet, as in the rest of China. We have on many occasions raised our concerns with the Chinese Government in both bilateral and multilateral forums. The annual Australian statements to the Commission on Human Rights have included specific reference to the situation in Tibet. Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, and I have raised specific cases of abuses in Tibet with Chinese Government Ministers during the annual United Nations General Assembly consultations, during my visit to China in September last year for the Joint Ministerial Economic Commission meeting and during Senator Evans's visit to China in April 1991. Although we have pushed hard on the specific allegations of abuse, and successive representations at ministerial and officiallevel consistently have addressed the specific cases, we are yet to receive responses from the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on them. One encouraging development, however, is that the Government of the PRC has agreed, during Senator Evans's visit to Beijing in April, to receive an official Australian delegation to examine and discuss the human rights situation in China and related matters. This is a significant development, as the Government of the PRC has accepted, by agreeing to such a delegation visit to discuss human rights issues, that human rights are a matter of international concern and not an internal matter as it had argued in the past. The delegation, which is expected to spend about 12 days in China, will visit Beijing, Chengdu in Sichuan province, Lhasa in Tibet and Shanghai during the July parliamentary recess. The composition of the delegation. reflects the very serious approach that the Australian Government is making to develop a meaningful human rights dialogue with the Chinese Government. It contains experts in international law and human rights, sinologists, as well as experienced parliamentary representatives and diplomats. The delegation consists of eight members led by Senator Chris Schacht, Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and of its subcommittee on human rights. It includes David Connolly, Liberal Member of the House of Representatives for Bradfield and Deputy Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; Senator Vicki Bourne, Democrat spokesperson on Foreign Affairs; Professor Stephen Fitzgerald, Director of the Asia-Australia Institute, and Australia's first Ambassador to China; Professor Alice Tay, Challis Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Sydney; Mr Chris Sidoti, Secretary of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; Mr Jon Sheppard, Director, Human Rights Section, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Secretary of the delegation; and Dr Richard Rigby, counsellor, Political Section, at the Australian Embassy in Beijing. Three of the delegation members speak fluent Mandarin. Of course, it would be unrealistic to expect that a visit for such a relatively brief period would result in an encyclopaedic study of human rights in China. However, the delegation's objectives, which were agreed during Senator Evans's discussions with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, are entirely realistic and include the commencement of a constructive and serious dialogue on human rights issues of concern, or of interest, to both sides; the obtaining of information on Chinese laws and policies affecting human rights, including on formal and constitutional rights; the Chinese legal, judicial and penal systems; and how laws and policies are observed and implemented in practice, particularly in relation to the protection of the rights of the individuals. The delegation will also hold discussions with, and convey Australia's views on human rights issues to, relevant Chinese organisations, officials and others involved in human rights matters. The delegation will seek information and make representations about particular cases, pursue the establishment of a satisfactory mechanism for conveying such representations in the future and respond to any Chinese interest in human rights in Australia. A feature of the agreement betwccn Senator Evans and the foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China was that the first visit would be reciprocal and Australia would host a visit by a Chinese delegation, should that be sought at any time by the PRC Governmcnt. Details of the delegation's visit are still being worked out with the Chinese Government; those details include the institutions and individuals the delegation may meet. While a number of questions remain to be settled, at this stage there is no reason to assume that the visit will be other than productive in opening up a constructive dialogue between Australia and China on human rights related issues. The delegation will use this opportunity to impress firmly upon the Chinese Government the importance of recognising, and complying with, internationally accepted standards of human rights. The delegation's visit to Tibet is an integral part of that exercise. Australia recognises that Tibet is a part of China and it is important that dialogue is established with the Chinese authorities on the human rights situation in Tibet. Finally, I reiterate that the Government welcomes this resolution on Tibet. The Government will work vigorously to discharge to the Parliament its obligations to investigate and to make representations to the Chinese authorities about the situation in Tibet. !VIr CONNOLLY (Bradfield) (8.52 p.m.)-The Opposition supports this motion, as it does the decision of the Government, in cooperation with the authorities of the People's Republic of China (PRC), to have a delegation visit China and Tibet in the near future. I have the honour to be the representative of the Opposition parties on that delegation. As my colleague Senator Robert Hill, the Opposition spokesman on this matter, has said, the Opposition is cautiously supportive of the delegation; however, it will prove ineffective if it is not given full access to organisations, officials, political prisoners and other individuals in China. I am pleased that both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), who is at the table, have confirmed that is also the view of the Government. In his visit to Peking some months ago, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) also raised the question of human rights issues in discussions with Chinese authorities. I want to reiterate the posiuntil tion taken by my colleague the honourditional able member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who spoke on this motion some months destroyed. ago and who emphasised the continuing importance of this matter and the interest of the Opposition in this field. Most of what we can find out about events in Tibet officially is information that does not run counter to the interests of China. Tibet is geographically isolated by the highest mountains in the world and politically isolated by the Chinese Government, which is well known for preventing the free flow of information into and out of China. Following demonstrations regarding dependence for Tibet authorities have been known not only to detain activists, but also to cut telephone and telex lines, expel journalists and seize film from tourlanguage ists. Journalists and diplomats arc rarely granted permission to visit the area. only do Tibetans risk imprisonment for collecting information about conditions, but they have been imprisoned for critiInformation cising the Chinese state while talking foreigners, an offence which has attracted a 10-year gaol term. All of this says much about the human rights problems in Tibet. Despite official assertions to the contrary, it has been corded by Amnesty International and tween 1987 and 1989. other human rights organisations that many individuals in Tibet continue to be deprived of the basic rights of freedom speech and expression, freedom of moveapparently ment and the right to practise freely religion. The human rights abuses have continTibetan ued since the invasion and occupation Tibet in the 1950s. It has been estimated that more than 87,000 Tibetans were killed in a mass uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. The International Commislasted sion of Jurists in a 1960 report stated that: . . . acts of genocide had been committed Tibet in an attempt to destroy the Tibetans religious group . . . Few families were untouched by loss of life or by torture, and during the subscthese killings. quent period of Chinese communist rule reforms in the early 1980s the traTibetan way of life that had prevailed for centuries was effectively Thousands of monasteries were destroyed and a sizeable proportion of the male population of Lhasa was transported to labour camps. Tibetan society was transformed by large scale Chinese immigration and the outflow of thousands of Tibetan refugees, many of whom went to neighbouring countries, especially Nepal. Today Tibetan culture is portrayed in the Chinese media as inferior to the dominant Chinese culture, and a colonial mentality prevails in Tibet. A form of inapartheid has existed in Tibet, with segregation in hospital wards and restricted schooling for Tibetan children; the Tibetan is not taught, and religious and cultural activity remains restricted. There Not has been a marked deterioration of respect for human rights in Tibet since autumn 1987. Lawasia and the Tibet Network have found that the to lifting of 13 months of martial law in Lhasa in April 1990 does not appear to have altered that assessment. Amnesty reports that in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, dozens of Tibetan demonstrators were killed reby security forces on four occasions beSome of these deaths occurred in the context of violent clashes between security of forces and demonstrators, while some were unprovoked and carried out their without warning. Those killed without warning or provocation included two monks who were leading a peaceof ful demonstration in Lhasa on 10 December 1988 and were reportedly shot at close range by security forces. In March 1989 during violent unrest in Lhasa, which three days, PRC armed police troops were reported to have fired automatic weapons at unarmed crowds of in demonstrators, again without warning. as a Depending on the source, estimates of the number who died range from 16 to 150, but there has been no official inquiry into Since the resurgence of proindependence protests and demonstrations in 1987, thousands of Tibetan nationalists have been detained. In April 1991 the official New China News Agency reported that 1,025 people had been arrested during pro-independence demonstrations since September 1987. The Agency reported that most of these pcople had been released within legal detention time and that 218 were either sentenced by the courts or sent to rcceive re-education through labour. Amnesty rcports that during a wave of arrests, following the imposition of martial law in Lhasa early in March 1989, more than 1,000 people are believed to have been detained, although official sources have acknowledged only 400 arrests. Amnesty reports that it has been estimatcd that about 200 people remain detained in Lhasa for political reasons. Some prisoners have been tried and sentenced to prison terms, but others continue to be held without trial. According to official sources, between Septem bcr 1987 and 1991, 97 Tibetans, including many young nuns, were assigned without trial to re-education through labour. Lawasia and the Tibet Information Network have compiled a list of 77 known political prisoncrs held at Drapchi Prison in Lhasa at Septcmber last year. The average length of sentence for a Drapchi political prisoner is 71/2 years, with most prisoners aged in their 20s. They are usually found guilty of a range of political crimes, with some of the major accusations including criticising the Chinese state while speaking to foreigners, spying or passing information to the enemy, printing leaflets and forming counter-revolutionary organisations and hoisting the Tibetan flag. One man is reported to be serving 12 years for encouraging youths to sing reactionary songs. Many of the prisoners are monks, six of whom are serving sentences ranging from five to 19 ycars for passing information to the 'encmy'-the enemy being the Tibetan Government in exile. The youngest prisoner, who is 14 years of age, was arrested for making pro-independence leaflets at his school. The oldest-a monk arrested for failure to reform, according to monks who werc present when officials read out'the charges-is said to be 75 years old. If he survives his prison sentence, he will be 81 years old when he is released. There have been many reports of torture and ill treatment of Tibetan political detainees. Some of the cases reported by Amnesty include a tailor from Lhasa arrested in April 1990 for possessing a video cassette showing pictures of the Dalai Lama. He was reportedly severely beaten while held incommunicado for several days in a police station. Lhakpa Tsering, a 20-year-old Tibetan, was reported to have died as a rcsult of torture in December last year while hcld in Drapchi prison in Lhasa. He was arrested in November 1989, accused of having formed a counterrevolutionary organisation, displaying reactionary posters in central Lhasa, and having called for the independence of Tibet. Lawasia and the Tibet Information Network have stated that first-hand accounts from released prisoners describe the use of elcctric batons applied to the torso and sometimes in the mouth, soles of the feet and genitals; the use of lighted cigarettes to inflict burns; the use of dogs to bite detainecs; and the use of manacles and chains to restrain prisoners for long periods. Chinese media accounts of life in Tibetan prisons suggest a model prison system where prisoners spend much of their time completing correspondence courses in economic laws, electrical engineering and civil engineering, overcoming illiteracy in language classes or growing vegetables and tending orchards. Detainees are often held incommunicado for weeks or months without being able to see a judicial authority or anyone from outside their prison. Amnesty has also been concerned by many reports that torture and ill treatment are commonplace in some holding centres known as shelter and investigation centres. 'Shelter and investigation' is apparently a form of administrative dctention imposed by police which bypasses the procedures for arrest and. detention provided for in China's cri:ininallaw procedure. In recent years Chinese legal experts have questioned the legality of this form of detention and have expressed concern about the routine abuse of detainees which occurs in some shelter and investigation centres. Some of the cases of alleged torture or ill-treatment of Tibetan political detainees in Lhasa have been raised with the Chinese authorities by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture. The authorities have responded by rejecting the allegations, saying that the cases have been investigated but giving no details of the investigations in question. Amnesty considers that all reports and complaints of torture should be promptly investigated by independent and impartial bodies not involved in the process of arrest, detention or investigation of detainees, and that their methods and findings should be made public. Tibetans suspected of opposing government policies continued to be arrested during the last year. Amnesty reports that following the lifting of martial law in Lhasa on 1 May 1990 the Lhasa Public Security Bureauthe name for the police-published a decree on 5 May requiring that prior permission be obtained from them for any kind of public assembly. Regulations on demonstrations published a few weeks later prohibited the use of religion or other activities in demonstrations or parades that would endanger national unity or social stability. The recent history of Tibet and its relations with China, the treatment of Tibetans under Chinese communist rule, especially during the Cultural Revolution, the period of liberalisation, large scale Chinese immigration and an increase in the number of refugees fleeing Tibet, the breakdown and deterioration of Tibet's religious and cultural heritage are all very important issues tied to the issue of human rights abuses in Tibet. Unfortunately, I am unable to elaborate on all of these issues in the time available, but I would like briefly to mention the role of religion in Tibet as it is integral to understanding Tibetan culture and why Tibetan religious leaders and teachers have been the subject of so much persecution. Mahayana and tantric Buddhism first came to Tibet in the seventh century AD, largely from Nepal and India. By the fifteenth century large monastic cities existed and by the mid-seventeenth century the Dalai Lamas, the heads of the Drepung monastery, had gained control of both religious and temporal affairs. This rare form of theocratic government, where religion and politics ran in parallel, lasted until 1959, though the present Dalai Lama remains head of Tibetan Buddhism and leader of the government-in-exile based in Dharamsala, north India. This may contribute to explaining the connection between the expression of religious belief and independence still evident in Tibet today. The Dalai Lama is seen as both a religious and political leader. Thus, those who show support for him, whether by displaying photographs or listening to recordings of his speeches, are on dangerous ground. The Chinese constitution allows freedom of religion, but the Communist Party is implacably opposed to such a freedom and promotes atheism. It is not difficult to see which one wins. A report to the British parliamentary human rights group describes religion as Tibetans' national identification. Its ability to flourish can be used as a yardstick of Chinese policy. The Chinese have repaired many of the temples and monasteries previously destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, though it has been said that the only temples and monasteries likely to be seen by foreigners are those which have been restored. Lawasia and the Tibet Information Network report many restrictions on the practice of religion in Tibet, and in the past year Amnesty has found that Buddhist monks and nuns were expelled from monasteries and convents near Lhasa on various occasions. A protest held at the beginning of the recent movement for independence illustrates well the connection between religion and politics in Tibetan society. The details contained in the report of Lawasia and the Tibet Information Network on China and human rights in Tibet states: On 27 September 1987, a group of 21 young monks from Drepung monastery turned an everyday act of religious devotion-the circumambulation of holy sites-into a symbolic expression of dcfiance. The monks were angry about the Chinese government's vehement denunciation of the Dalai Lama's ""Five Point Peace Plan"" unveiled in Washington the week before. Their response was to walk about a lkm circuit encircling the Jokhang temple in the heart of Lhasa shouting pro-independence slogans such as ""Chinese get out of Tibet!"" and ""May the Holiness the Dalai Lama live 10,000 years!"". Since then more than 55 similar demonstrations have been staged and thousands of pro-independence posters and pamphlets printed and distributed throughout Tibet. In conclusion, I would like to add that whatever is said or done in the future to protect human rights in Tibet, whatever is said or done so that it appears that human rights are being protected, I personally will not be convinced until Tibet's doors are opened and information flows freely in and out of Tibet. Freedom of information is our most powerful weapon against human rights abuses, and I hope that the Australian human rights delegation to China in JUly of this year will be able to make a significant step forward in achieving this most important outcome.",148
225,Mr LINDSAY,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"I am privileged to support the motion before the House. I think it is important that the Australian people understand the background to this motion and to the tragedy of the conquest of Tibet. In 1949 communist Chinese armed forces invaded Tibet. They quickly defeated Tibet's small and inadequately trained army. It was a brutal conquest, executed with unremitting ferocity against an independent and peaceful nation. This act of unrestrained aggression culminated on 23 May 1951 when Tibet was forced to sign a surrender document which purported to annex and incorporate Tibet into China. This shameful document, entitled 'Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet', was signed by Tibet under duress and made official by the communist Chinese with a forged Tibetan Government seal. During the 1950s and 1960s the United Nations condemned Chinese aggression against Tibet and called for Tibct's right to self-determination in General Assembly resolutions 1353 in 1959, 1723 in 1961 and 2079 in 1965. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations in 1961, Ambassador Plimpton, summarised the official Unitcd States position on Tibet, saying: The United Statcs believcs that our objective must include the restoration of human rights of the Tibetan people and their natural right of self determination. In 1959 the pcople of Tibct attempted to rise up against communist Chinesc occupation forces but were brutally crushed. The Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people, was forced, along with about 80,000 Tibetans, to flee to India. Many of them still reside there today. In the years following the uprising, Western intclligence sources estimate that as many as one million Tibetans may have died as a result of the Chinese occupation. During communist China's cultural revolution from 1966 to 1976, all but 11 of Tibet's 6,200 monasteries were destroyed. The calculated and official Chinese policy of destruction of Tibet came to an end on the death of communist Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung in 1976. However, to this very day, China continues to deny Tibetans their political, cultural and economic rights and exploits Tibet's rich natural resources for its own use. Under the established principles of international law, Tibet is an occupied country. In 1960 the International Commission of Jurists issued a report which found that Tibet demonstrated the conditions of statehood as accepted under international law, namely, a defined territory, population, independent government, and the ability to conduct domestic affairs and independent international relations. Australia has a moral responsibility to recognise Tibet as an occupied country and to recognise the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile as the legal and constitutional Government of the Tibetan people. On 7 May 1991 the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution recognising Tibet as an occupied country under established principles of international law, whose true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile as recognised by the Tibetan people. The resolution asserted that Tibet has maintained throughout its history a distinctive national culture and religious identity, separate from that of China. The congressional resolution further asserted that China's archival documents and traditional dynastic histories, including those pertaining to periods of Manchu and Mongol rule, never refer to Tibet as being made 'an integral part' of China. Indeed, the Congressional resolution goes on to acknowledge that several countries, including Mongolia, Bhutan, Nepal, British India and Czarist Russia, recognised Tibet as an independent nation or dealt with Tibet independently of any Chinese government. Two weeks ago the Chinese Communist Party celebrated the fortieth anniversary of China's conquest of Tibet with the erection of a 230-feet high monument in Lhasa, Tibet's capital city. This so-called celebration was nothing less than a display of the brutal might of China's armed forces and communist China's contempt for basic human rights. Australia has always vigorously opposed the illegal use of force by one country against the sovereignty of another. Australia has always condemned violations of international law, including the illegal conquest of one country by another. Indeed, this was the justification for Australia's involvement in the Gulf war. Communist China must end its conquest of Tibet and it must cease the tyranny against the people of Tibet. Communist China must leave Tibet immediately. If China fails to abide by the basic obligations of international law and human rights, then China must accept the consequences of its actions from the international community. The United Nations should introduce trade sanctions against communist China until such time as Tibet is liberated and its legitimate Government restored. Australia has a moral responsibility, as an outspoken defender of human rights, to initiate such action in the United Nations without delay.",153
226,Mr CADMAN,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"Mitchell) (9.14 p.m.)I must say that I have a great deal of sympathy with the words of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). His words stand in stark contrast to some of the wimpish remarks that have come from Government members speaking prior to him in this debate. It is a tragedy that the best we can do in this Parliament is to agree to a bunch of platitudes which call on the Australian Government to continue its representations to, and seek responses from, the Government of the People's Republic of China on allegations of human rights abuses in Tibet. We can go much further and do much better than that. We have stood for people who have been oppressed right around the world. But it seems in this instance that this Australian Parliament can do no more than wave a feather at the People's Republic of China: that is a tragedy. For many years I have watched the oppression of the people of Tibet and the subsuming of their culture by the Chinese interlopers-since 1950, in fact-and their wish to wipe out all traces of culture in Tibet. Other democracies around the world pass and implement significant initiatives in support of the people of Tibet-a unique, distinct, culturally separate, isolated people-but the best we can do here is to wave a feather at the Chinese Government. I am pleased that Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) is in the House because I would like to point out to the Australian people and to the Parliament that he is the Minister who went into China first after Tiananmen Square and, without there being any statement of compassion or willingness to retract attitudes or change in direction from the Chinese people, was prepared to make a gift of $12m or $13m as a goodwill gesture from this recession racked country to the People's Republic of China. I think that was a deplorable action and one that I completely disagreed with as an appropriate action on the part of the Australian Government. I understand diplomatic contact, but to blandish gifts of that size in the face of what had happened in Tiananmen Square and to have it endorsed tonight by what happens in Tibet-I think the Australian Government is off its rocker. It has got its priorities wrong and does not understand where its real directions should lie in world affairs. It seems to me that if a Minister or the Government has a notional feeling of personal goodwill to anybody or any individual, then the foreign affairs initiatives follow. I do not agree with that approach in foreign affairs. Australia will not stand proud in the world unless it stands consistently on principles. We have taken bipartisan stances generally as a nation in foreign affairs, but our attitude in this area of Tibet and China goes back to some sort of enthralment with China. We can be enthralled by China and its culture, but not by the Marxist regime which subj ugates its proud and hard-working people. We do not gain anything for freedom and democracy by adopting those attitudes. Let us look at some of the resolutions adopted by the United States Congress. In the United States Senate on 29 June  Mr Cranston and Mr Murkowski, across the parties-committed a resolution which was concurred with by the Congress and by the House of Representatives and which said strong things. There we have the Parliament of the United States standing up for human rights, standing strongly for what it recognised as the democratic rights of the people of Tibet. The introduction of that motion says: The Congress has previously expressed its cern regarding the policies of the People's lic of China in Tibet, including the violation of Tibetan human rights, and has called on the Chinese Government to ameliorate the situation. It goes on: The Dalai Lama has now prepared a proposal for a democratic system of government for the people of Tibet founded on law, by agreement of the people of Tibet, for the common good and protection of themselves and their environment. What we have here in this Parliament are platitudes about the Australian Government continuing its efforts to seek rcsponses from the Government of the People's Republic of China on allegations of human rights abuses in Tibet. Speaker after speaker here tonight has documented those abuses of human rights; there has been chapter and verse from our side and from the Government's side. Member after member has been able to give instance, date, circumstance, prison, the sort of punishment meted out or the number of deaths involved. Speaker after speaker has done that. There has been no inexactitude-it has been completely justified and documented proof of abuseand we have a wishy-washy motion about seeking to have the Government change its attitude on the allegation of human rights. I am disgusted with the motion that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has brought to the House. I think we could be much tougher and between us agree on something that is much stronger than this. Maybe the Government or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had some role in drafting this, but the motion starts well. It says: . . . recognises that human rights abuses have been committed in Tibet by the People's Republic of China since 1959 . . . endorses Resolutions No. 1353 of 1959, No. 1723 of 1961 and No. 2079 of 1965 of the UN General Assembly. It endorses those resolutions. The commencement of this motion being debated before the House sets one thinking that now we will have the Australian Parliament standing strongly for some of the proposals that the other democracies of the world endorse; but no. The motion goes on: . . . endorses the call for the cessation of praccontices which deprive the Tibetan people of their Repubfundamental human rights and freedoms: commends the Dalai Lama and his representatives for consistently rejecting the use of violence. For goodness sake! How many of us met the Dalai Lama in the old Parliament? He is a man who is proud, dignified and compassionate, feeling nothing but concern for his own people, travelling the world and encouraging others to understand the difficulties that the people of Tibet have. We acknowledge and commend the Dalai Lama, but the United States Congress is backing in its forums the proposals to establish the rule of law put forward by the Dalai Lama. The United States Congress said, 'By agreement of the people of Tibet for the common good and protection of thcmselves and their environment'. The United States motion goes on: The proposal of the Dalai Lama recognizcs that the primary responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs, and the exclusive rcsponsibility for the defense of Tibet will remain with the Government of the People's Republic of China, in order to fulfill its defense responsibility, will be permitted to maintain a restricted numbcr of military bases in Tibet, but these bases must bc locatcd away from population centers. It goes on to enunciate further the proposals of the Dalai Lama: (A) Specific steps be taken to fulfill the goal of transforming the Tibetan plateau into a pcacc sanctuary. These steps include convening a regional security conference to determine ways to reduce regional tensions and eventually to demilitarize the Tibetan plateau and bordering regions. (B) Tibet will be founded on a constitution, or basic law, which will provide for a democratic form of government, with an independent judiciary, and a popularly elected chief executive and legislative assembly. The basic law will contain a bill of rights which will guarantee individual human rights and democratic; freedoms as expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. So there we have the United States Congress endorsing the proposals of the Dalai Lama, passing motions in both the Senate and the Congress to endorse the democratic resolution of the problems of Tibet, and the best that we can do in the Australian Parliament is to say that we commend the Dalai Lama. We do not acknowledge or support his recommendations. We support his recognition by the receipt of the Nobel Prize. We endorse the representations made by the Australian Government-and that was the feather-waving we saw tonight from the Minister and from others in the House. We then go on to say: recognise the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Human Rights Covenants. We endorse those. We are not taking a step, though, to say that there ought to be a democratically elected government in Tibet and that there ought to be the rule of law in Tibet. The Government motion pulls back from that-and that is where it is so wrong. The Government is not prepared to give those people their freedom. Jt is prepared to acknowledge the tyranny of the Chinese Government while condemning it here in this place. The Government documents it in this place, but it is not prepared to stand against it. Why is the Government not prepared to stand against it? Is it trade factors? Does the Government really endorse the activities of the Chinese Government? Does it endorse the Marxist line that it has adopted? Does the Government endorse the takeover? Come on! I want to know where the Government stands on these issues. The Minister has not answered those questions. He has said, 'We will talk to the Chinese'. It is like his talk every day in the Parliament about trade with Europe: he talks from a distance, castigating the Europeans for not doing the right thing. I do not think that works. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will not go overseas on a trade mission and the Minister stands in the House and castigates the Europcans from afar for not doing the right thing in the General Agreemcnt on Tariffs and Trade discusSIOns. I would likc to sce this Parliament adopt a similar resolution to the courage expresscd by all sides of the House in the United States Congrcss. They are the true democrats. They understand the rule of law. They are prepared to stand against the tyranny of China. They have got more to lose in world affairs and world currency than Australia has in making their statement clearly. Australia has little to losc compared with that great superpower, the United States, with the Union of Sovict Socialist Republics, China and Europe-in trade forccs, in forcign affairs and in military forcescounterbalancing each other; yet we have the people and the Congress of the United States standing up for the rule of law, a Bill of Rights, an independent judiciary and a democratic form of government which will guarantee individual human rights and democratic freedoms as expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I am disappointed with the Government. I did not think that I could speak long on this motion. I know about 30 Tibetans. I know what quiet, gentle, proud people they are. They are not aggressors. They do not seek to take over or expand. They have no claims whatsoever on their neighbours. Yet their proud, long culture stands destroyed. The Australian Parliament .cannot even condemn the genocide document and the subsuming of a culture by a conscious act of the People's Republic of China.",154
227,Mr LEE,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"Before the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) leaves the chamber, I might just address a few comments to him in reply to his speech tonight, which I found quite distasteful. As far as I am concerned, it was simply an attempt to inject a party political tone into a debate which I would have hoped could have been bipartisan.",157
228,Mr CADMAN,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,You didn't hear your previous member.,157

230,Mr CADMAN,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,You didn't understand him then.,157
231,Mr LEE,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"He certainly did not make the party political comments that the honourable member for Mitchell made tonight-in particular, his comment that this resolution is simply waving a feather at the problem. I remind him that this resolution is word for word the resolution which was unanimously passed by the Australian Senate.",157
232,Mr CADMAN,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"Wow! Why don't we go to the House of Representatives in the US and the Senate there. _ Mr LEE-The honourable member dismisses that. For the benefit of the honourtributed able member, I will read to him what the Australian Tibet Council News said about that resolution. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Mitchell cannot stay; he has need to lcave the chamber. The Australian Tibet Council News described the resolution in these terms: Australian Senate scnds strong message to China. The Australian Senate on 6 December 1990 passed an unprecedented resolution calling on China to end human rights violations in Tibet and to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and his representatives. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, praised the Dalai Lama and his representatives for consistently rejecting the use of violence and endorsed UN General Assembly resolutions 1353, 1723 and 2079 which recognised Tibet's autonomy and its right to self determination and condemned China's violation of human rights of Tibetans. This article then quotes Dr Michael Van Wolt, the legal adviser to the Dalai Lama. I would like to read a section of the report from the Australian Tibet Council News into the record too. It states: Dr Michael Van Wolt, legal adviser to the Dalai Lama, who was accompanying the Tibetan Minister in Australia was especially pleased with the bipartisan character of the resolution. It recognises that the problem of Tibet goes beyond individual rights. The real issue is the violation of Tibet's right to self-determination. That is increasingly being recognised. The people who are concerned about the human rights of the Tibetan people were very proud of the fact that the Australian Senate unanimously carried a resolution. As an individual, I have to say that I am very hopeful that this motion can be carried unanimously by this chamber. I know that there are people with very strong views on this issue on both sides of the House. Some people might have different views about the way the rights of the Tibetan people can be advanced and some people might think that some strategies are preferred to others. This motion has been worded in such a way that we can get both chambers of the Australian Parliament to unanimously carry this motion. That is a goal which I think deserves to be commended. It is something which I do not think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell, has conto tonight. He may have the best of motives for speaking out strongly tonight, but I know that both the Government and the Opposition are very keen to ensure that both Houscs of Parliament speak with one voice on an issue of great importance. That is the point I would like to make - onight. In any debate on Tibet we have to consider the history of the region and the history of Tibet. The People's Republic of China will argue that Tibet is part of its country for various historical reasons and will claim that an agreement was signed by the Dalai Lama on 23 May 1951, which is called the 17-point agreement. That justifies the fact-to use the Chinese Government's words-that Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951. It is interesting to compare the attitude of the People's Republic of China to that agreement and its attitude to agreements on Macau and Hong Kong which, I would argue, were signed by the then government of China under duress. The fact that Macau and Hong Kong will probably ultimately return to China is the result of those agreements being signed under duress, under very difficult circumstances in past times. In the same way it is very clear that the so-called peaceful liberation of Tibet and the 17-point agreement was the result of similar circumstances-duress and unfair pressure being put on one side in the negotiations. If we look at what has happened to the people of Tibet since 1951 it is clear that they have had to struggle for their human rights. Many of them have lost their lives by seeking to demonstrate freely, to express their political views and to demonstrate in favour of the free expression of their religious beliefs. It should be of concern to all of us when human rights in any country, especially a country such as Tibet, are violated. I wish to refer to some excerpts from a report by Amnesty International entitled People's Republic of China: Violations of Human Rights. I am sure honourable members will recall when I spoke in the debate on the Gulf crisis that I made some point of emphasising that the Amnesty International report on what was happening in Kuwait strongly influenced my view on Australia's reaction to the Gulf crisis. I hope I am being consistent by pointing out that China, which did take a sympathetic position in the United Nations Security Council on the Gulf crisis, should also be put to the test by an examination of Amnesty International's record on its activities. The report by Amnesty International dated April 1991 states: Thousands of Tibetan nationalists have been detained in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) since a resurgence of demonstrations in favour of Tibet's independence in September 1987. During a wave of arrests which followed the imposition of martial law in Lhasa in early March 1989, more than 1,000 people are believed to have been detained, though official sources have acknowledged only 400 arrests. The report goes on to detail a number of allegations of torture and ill treatment of prisoners in Tibet. I simply quote one case from the report: Topygal, a tailor from Lhasa arrested in April 1990 for possessing a video-cassette showing pictures of the Dalai-Lama, was reportedly severely beaten while held incommunicado for several days in a police station in the Jebumgang area of Lhasa. The report goes on to make some statements about the Chinese authorities shooting at unarmed demonstrators. I quote to the House a report of activities which took place in Lhasa: In Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, dozens of Tibetan demonstrators were killed by security forces on four occasions during demonstrations in favour of Tibet's independence between 1987 and 1989. Certainly, no-one could have any doubts about the independence and integrity of an organisation like Amnesty International. It is certainly an organisation which I know that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), the Minister at the table, has a lot of time for, given the many hours of work he has put into the Australian parliamentary group of Amnesty International. I am sure that he would also be aware of the report by Law Asia on human rights in Tibet. That is something that I know other honourable members have studied very closely. I recently had the privilege of being in Nepal. During a very short visit to that country, I had the privilege of meeting a small group of Tibetan refugees who had to flee with their families from Tibet more than 30 years ago. They knew of Australia through a record put out by a man called Craig MCLachlanwho might be known to some honourable members of this House, not for 'Click Go The Shears' or 'Waltzing Matilda', but for a song called 'Hey Mona'. The fact that Mr MCLachlan grew up in my electorate will not influence me or encourage me to publicise his record; but I was intrigued that Tibetans, who are currently forced by circumstances to flee their country and now live in Nepal, would know something about a country as far away as Australia. What certainly impressed me about these Tibetans was the fact that despite the great difficulties that their country is going through, they still have a sense of humour. They still are very optimistic about the future of their country and their aspirations for their country to again be free again. Certainly, that was something which has encouraged me to speak tonight. In conclusion, I would like to join honourable members from both sides of this House in supporting the motion which, I believe, has been carefully worded and seeks to allow all honourable members of this House to join with all honourable senators in speaking out as strongly as we can for the human rights of the people of Tibet.",157
233,Mr TIM FISCHER,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"l will not detain the House at length, but I rise to express support for this motion-in part at the behest of the Government, given other matters which are in the pipeline. Also, I commend the fact that, for once, this House is focusing on the south Asia region-Tibet and surrounding areas-in terms of the motion before this House. In that context, I have to say that I have never had the privilege of visiting Tibet, but J have been to Nepal and Bhutan as part of my policy of trying to get to the south Asian nations, quite apart from the south-east Asian nations, just as often as I can. I think the future of this country rests more and more in terms of building our economic, political and cultural links with South East Asia; but also south Asia. On the southern border of Tibet, of course, is the country of Nepal and also the tiny country of Bhutan. The officials I have met in both Nepal and Bhutan are very sensitive to the situation in Tibet and they have very reasonable concerns in relation to all that has happened in Tibet. I will forward a copy of this motion to some of my contacts and friends in both Nepal and Bhutan. The kingdom of Bhutan, located as it is between India and Tibet, to the west being Sikkim and Nepal and to the east being parts of Assam, used to have all its access through China and Tibet and not from the south through India. That was dictated in part by the area's terrain and othcr factors. So it was that, in the 1950s and 1960s, the major trading routes and major commcrcial access to the kingdom of Bhutan, with its 1% million people, were generally through four natural passes which exist betwecn Bhutan and Tibet. However, I must caution that one has to be reasonably fit to pass through those natural passcs; they go up to about 10,000, 12,000 and 14,000 feet. I ventured as high as about 12,000 feet and blew the whistle, dare I say, on that particular project because it became a choice between a by-election in Farrer and proceeding further up that particular pass. I decided to try to avoid the cost of a by-election in the Fedcral electorate of Farrer. With modern engineering practice, some major roads were then driven into Bhutan from India, and so gradually the influence on Bhutan swung back towards India, with which it has official links in any case. There are a number of regional sensitivitics associated with all that is happening in the autonomous region of Tibet, and they have an impact and ramifications extending beyond Tibet and relating to Bhutan, Nepal and India. I would add in this context that, when I visited Beijing with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I took the opportunity to raisc some of these concerns. I particularly raised the question of the acceptance of the independence of Bhutan as a dynamic nation which should not feel threatened in any way by any of its neighbours. I am pleased to relate to the House that the Chinese officials involved said that they had recently made an official visit to Bhutan for the first time in many years as part of building up the relationship between the tiny kingdom of Bhutan and the massive giant of China. But significantly in terms of this motion, they also alluded to the need to finalise the border between China itself and parts of India and then, separately from that, between Tibet and Bhutan, and Tibet and Nepal. There is some argument as to exactly where the watershed is on the Himalayas and where the correct location is for the international border. For many years there have been disputes over whether sections of the Himalayas constitute part of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal or India. It is my hope that some real progress will be made in overcoming all of the human rights abuses which have been occurring in Tibet. I commend the honourable members who have spoken in praise of the Tibetan people, their heritage and their wonderful culture. It would be an absolutely unforgivable tragedy if that culture was to be lost to the world-and, of course, it would be totally unacceptable. I learned today that, in fact, recently the Chinese decided to improve the television broadcasts to Tibet as part of 'a strategy'. I am, not sure what that means in the longer term. This motion is an important one. It relates to a similar motion carried in the Australian Senate. It is in some ways inadequate, but equally it is an agreed way of advancing consideration of this important matter and, as such, I support the motion. I am delighted that the House is, on this occasion, dealing with a foreign affairs issue in our own region, and that is, indeed, important. The kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan and India are members of the South Asia Regional Cooperation (SARC) group of nations. The SARC group of nations headquarters is at Kathmandu, Nepal, and that group is building up its own momentum and helping to contribute to rcgional stability. The SARC group of nations, of course, does not include China or Tibet, yet the group takes a great deal of interest in what is happening on its borders and just beyond its borders. I believe that Australia should develop the same degree of interest in the SARC group of nations as it has in the countries that make up the Association of South East Asian Nations. That should be done as part of our strategy in this decade of the 1990s in building up economic and trading links and political-cultural links as well. I understand that the next summit of the SARC group of nations is scheduled to take place at the end of this year. It will takc place presumably following the Indian elections. It is to be hoped that following the tragic dcath of Rajiv Gandhi, there will be a stable outcome of those elections and that a new government will be sworn in with a prime minister, thereby allowing that SARC summit to proceed. It is also my hope that Australia will monitor closely the discussions which will take place at that summit, when it docs takc placc, and that the situation in Tibet will be further considered at that level in the interests of the Tibetan people, in the interests of stability in that region and in the interests of the well-being of the Nepalese and also the Bhutanese. I have had the privilege of visiting Bhutan, as I mentioned, on two separate occasions. In fact, I understand that I am the first Australian member of parliament ever to make it into Bhutan, let alone twice. I commend to honourable members that they do take a deeper interest in our own region and visit that area. It is my sincere hope that next time. I go there, I will indeed be able to go into Tibet, now that direct flights have resumed between Kathmandu in Nepal and Lhasa in Tibet. That will open up that area to access from the south, and that will greatly assist honourable members and others who visit that particular area, and I hope that that will happen in the not too distant future. The question before the House relates fundamentally to Tibet and its future; it relates to human rights abuses; it relates to commending the Dalai Lama and his representatives for consistently rejecting the use of violence. Should it be my privilege and should the Dalai Lama ask to do so, I would be very happy to meet with him when he comes to Australia later this year. In so doing, I do not seek to be provocative or, indeed, cause difficulties for others. But I take the viewpoint that am entitled to seek to meet with him it is my hope that he might seek to with me in order that I can advance my knowledge of all that is happening in that part of the world. I support the motion before the House and it is my hope that it will pass without difficulty. It is my hope that it will a contribution towards progress of the complex situation that exists in Tibet. Question resolved in the affirmative.",159
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERVISORY LEVY AMENDMENT,"Mr Nehl)The motion is agreed to unanimously. DEFENCE INTO THE TWENTYNA Debate resumed from 30 May, on present. motion by Mr Griffiths: That the House take note of the paper",161
235,Mr LINDSAY,FIRST CENTURY,"Herbert) (9.49 p.m.)When announcing major changes to AusAffairs, tralian defence policy last week, the ister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), whilst emphasising that Australia faces current military threat, claimed: These changes will provide for a force capable overcoming the long distances and isolation Australia's environment. Our strategy to capitalise on Australia's geographic advantages and technological lead to ensure that any aggressor would face major obstacles in an aftack this nation. The force restructuring announced by the Government represents an attempt to upter's date the Australian Defence Force, which has been left substantially unchanged for a very long time. While there has been significant development of Australia's strategic thinking, especially since the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities in 1986, the fact is that, with a few exceptions, the underlying structure future. of the defence forces has changed very little since the Whitlam Government abolished conscription at the end of 1972. There was an obvious need to bring the Defence Force structure more into conpriority formity with Australia's modern strategic requirements. The Government's decision to undertake a major reassessment Australia's Defence Force structure was I therefore both necessary and responsible. and This Force Structure Review addresses a meet number of fundamental Defence Force structural issues. Perhaps the most spectacular of these concern the future structure of the reserve forces, having regard to the review's rejection of the militia concept, recommended by consultant Alan make Wrigley, and its adoption of the Ready in respect Reserves concept. Certainly, this is a controversial new initiative. If this initiative does not succeed, the combat capability of the Australian Army will be significantly degraded. I hope, therefore, that the Government will be working with feverish diligence to ensure that the Ready Reserves scheme delivers on its considerable potential, but I will not say a lot about this topic at Honourable members will be aware that the Defence Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Defence and Trade is presently Mininquiring into the Australian Defence Force reserves. As I am the Chairman of no the Subcommittee on Defence, I will not pre-empt the subcommittee's report, which of is proposed to be tabled in Parliament of during the early part of the forthcoming is designed Budget session. The strategic directions and Defence on Force structure, supported in the 1987 Australian Defence White Paper, have been dramatically altered by the Minisstatement last week. The 1987 Defence White Paper maintained that the threat of invasion of the Australian mainland was non-existent. Australia's neighbours simply did not have the capability to mount a full scale invasion of Australia then, they do not have it now, and are unlikely to have it within the foreseeable However, the White Paper did refer to other unlikely threat scenarios, namely, small scale raids upon Australia's northern infrastructure. The White Paper gave to developing capabilities by the Australian Defence Force to destroy low level incursions on Australian soil. The of 1987 Australian Defence White Paper stressed \the doctrine of self-reliance and reaffirmed Australia's acceptance of its responsibility as a rcliable ANZUS partner. Abovc all, Australia was urged to develop, as soon as practicable, a self-sufficient defence capability. One of the tragic consequences of basing force structure on threat perceptions, or a lack thereof, can be seen in the 1991 New Zealand Defence White Paper. The New Zealand National Party Government has obviously decided that there is not, and is not likely to be, a credible threat contingency to the existence of the state of New Zealand. Consequently, a once capable and highly respected New Zealand Defence Force will now be reduced to what will be basically a constabulary role. The notion of 'no threat small defence force' was very popular among the democracies in the years of appeasement before World War II. It found ready acceptance in pre-war Britain under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The consequences of persisting with the folly of this defence concept do not have to be described in detail. The tragedy of World War II is sufficient testimony. Present day Britain does not have threatening neighbours, nor does Britain face neighbours with a defence capability to successfully invade Britain. However, successive British governments, both Labour and non-Labour, have rejected the doctrine of 'no threat small defence force' in favour of maintaining a defence force capability able to be deployed to meet security emergencies and, in particular, a defence force able to meet Britain's alliance responsibilities and to defend successfully its national integrity. The financial aspects of defence have been of concern for many years. Why is it that no government has yet succeeded in giving reliability to the financial forecasts for defence spending? In 1976 the Fraser Government's first defence Minister, Jim Killen, tabled a Defence White Paper with a very detailed forward financial program attached. However, the Fraser Government was never able to meet the financial comm itments contained in its White Paper. It got further and further behind and eventually presented the Hawke Government with a substantial backlog. In 1987, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), then Minister for Defence, presented to Parliament the Hawke Government's Defence White Paper. The 1987 Australian Defence White Paper provided strategic guidance around which the structure of the Australian Defence Force was to be developed. In this regard, the 1987 Defence White Paper judged that the minimum expenditure to achieve those objectives would be between 2.6 per cent and 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). In 1986-87 the Government spent 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product on defence. In succeeding financial years, as a percentage of gross domestic product, the Government has spent 2.5 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent; this financial year the estimate of expenditure on defence, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is 2.3 per cent. Using the 1987 Defence White Paper benchmark of 2.6 per cent to 3 per cent of GDP, the estimated shortfall in defence expenditure since 1986-87 varies between $ 3.7 thousand million and $9.3 thousand million. These reductions in defence expenditure, from the announced minimum objectives of the Defence White Paper, arc in my view the principal source of the difficulties facing the Australian Defence Force today. Unfortunately, while the tail of the Defence Force is being chopped even further, one cannot add teeth to the Defence Force unless it is provided with the necessary resources. I appreciate that the Force Structure Review has recognised the difficulty of maintaining defence expenditure at the levels indicated in the White Paper in difficult economic times and has, therefore, based all of its analysis and financial programming on an assumed zero per cent real growth in the defence vote over the coming decade. In fact, paragraph 1.10 of the review says: . . . where no growth was provided, about three-quarters of the White Paper program could be funded. This implies, in effect, that about 25 per cent of the 1987 Defence White Paper program will not be in place by the turn of the millennium, if Australia maintains a zero real growth defenee budget. It is unfortunate that developments beyond the Government's control have led to this outcome, because it is likely to have a very adverse effect on future Defence Force capabilities. Obviously a major problem with the review is the probable effective loss of 25 per cent of the 1987 White Paper program due to zero real growth funding projections. But other problems exist also. One problem seems to be the placement of many of the Force Structure Review's important initiatives well down the track. There are a number of very useful proposals in the review which, in a more favourable financial environment, might have been under way very soon but which now have to be notionally programmed towards the end of the decade. I refer in particular to the airborne early warning project, the troop-carrying helicopter ship, the increased number of Navy combat hulls, and the replacement offshore petrol vessel. All of these projects have been included in the review's specific proposals. Unfortunately, lack of funding has meant long term deferral. It is also unfortunate that in order to maintain the FA18 inventory of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and avoid a too rapid consumption of the aircraft's finite 'life-of-type', to use the review's words, flying hours have been restrictedor, as the review in paragraph 2.44a says, to manage the F A18 fleet so as to keep it in service almost a further two decades, to the year 2010. It is distressing that this kind of finanthe cial constraint exists. Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that the tight financial situation has given a significant impetus to such matters as moves towards civilianisation, which will have very positive implications for Australian Defence Force teeth-to-tail ratios by removing valuable uniformed personnel out of jobs that can and should be done by civilians. This bullet should have been bitten a long time ago, but it has taken cost pressures to get things moving. Likewise, as the inquiry into this topic by the Defence Subcommittee showed, it was necessary to bite the bullet, so to speak, on the troubled inshore minehunter project and stop throwing good money after bad. Much as one might regret the curtailment of the inshore minehunter project, it must be accepted that there comes a point when continuing with the original concept is simply not cost effective. The review has concluded that this point has been reached. In continuing the Government's program of shifting important defence capabilities and assets to the northern region of Australia, the review maintains the basic strategic concept and operational concepts of the Dibb review and the subsequent 1987 White Paper. When the proposals of this review are put into place, we will have a substantial combat capability in the north of Australia, notably two Army brigades, one already at Townsville and another to be located in Darwin. The decision to proceed with the development of air base RAAF Sherger at Weipa and the growing capability of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar system are endorsed in the review. It is a substantial and strategically very significant recognition by the Government and the Defence Force of the need to maintain credible operational infrastructure capacity in the northern part of the Australian continent. There are, however, other decisions in the review which are also cause for alarm. For example, the decision to restrict FA 18 flying hours will squeeze extra ealendar time out of the airframes and engines. This must place significant restrictions on capacity of the RAAF to maintain its expertise in all aspects of FA 18 operations. It will also be important to ensure that the financial constraints on the Army communications projects Raven and Parakeet do not result in loss of operational flexibility for units in the field. Inadequate communications links are one of the major deficiencies in the Australian Army. The decisions announced in the force structure review represent recognition by include: the Department of Defence of some hard realities, especially in the area of defence budgeting. It is no good governments going to the Defence Department and the forces, as the Fraser Government did with its 1976 White Paper, and giving them extensive shopping lists which get reputer diated a year later. Whatever problems Act there are with this review, and there are many, given the Government's straints on Government spending in general and defence spending in particular and the pledge by the Liberal and National parties to reduce Budget spending even further by $3,000m, this review provides a realistic and credible forward financial outlook which the Australian Defence Force can use for planning poses with some hope that targets will be met. Debate (on motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned. NA NA Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. In Committee Senate amendments No. I-After clause 2, page 2, insert the followwhich ing clause: Grant to minimise transitional pressures prices ""2A. There is payable to the State of Victoria, out of monies appropriated by the parliament the purpose, an amount of $30 million in respect of each of the two years after 1 July 1990, in order to minimise transitional pressure on prices on an equitable basis."". No. 2After clause 43, page 45, add the following Part: ""PART 7-REPORT ON OPERATION OF NA Report on the operation of Act ""44. (1) The Minister, by 30 November 1992, is to cause to be laid before each House of Parliament a report on the operation of the Act.

""(4) In this section: 'Minister' means the Minister who administers the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967; 'the Act' means the Petroleum Resource Rent at least Tax Assessment Act 1987."". Motion (by Mr Griffiths) proposed: That amendment No. 1 be disagreed to and puramendment No.2 be agreed to.",161
236,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRRT ACT,"Lest people outside this chamber are confused, we are now considering as a Committee of the Whole two key amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill. These 1991 amendments arose within the ambit of the original debate in this House, when I indicated that the coalition would place this Bill before a relevant Senate committee for further consideration. I am delighted that two amendments have emerged from those proceedings. I am particularly delighted that the Government has accepted amendment No.2, which relates to clause 43, page 45, and insists that the Minister, by 30 November 1992-that is, the Minister of that on gas day-is to cause to be laid before each House of Parliament a report on the operation of this complex trailblazing legisfor lation. That report must examine the impact on prices and industry with regard gas to ethane, gas and oil of the petroleum resource rent tax on the Bass Strait. It is also to cover a number of other areas, and submissions will be invited in the formulation of that report. This is a key breakthrough. It provides a degree of insurance in respect of the first two years operation of this legislation the that a proper review will take place of the impact of this secondary taxation and these changed arrangements operating in respect of Bass Strait. I know the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), the honourable member for Bendigo (\1r Reid), the honourable member for La Trobc (Mr Charles), the honourable member for lndi (Mr Ewcn Cameron), the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and I in regard to my own electorate of Farrer, have had much correspondence, especially in relation to the impact of resource rent tax on gas in Victoria at this critical time of its deep receSSIOn. Part of the Governmcnt's problem is that this legislation has been delayed for so long. It originally was announced in the Budget of August last year. It is a Budget Bill, a taxation Bill, but it is only in June, in the closing hours of the formal autumn session of Parliament for this year, that we have finally dealt with this legislation in both Houses. It is now back in the House of Representatives to consider these two Senate amendments. I welcome the Government's agreement with amendment No.2. I think it represents a common sense and constructive approach by the Govcrnment. The added scrutiny will be of value perhaps to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd or Esso, but more particularly to all those users and consumers of such products as gas, including ethane, and other products, in Victoria especially. I turn to amendment No. (1). This now is the remaining area of disagrecment, essentially, between the Liheral and National parties and the Government. That amendment calls for clear-cut assuranccs that the two lots of $30m, a total of $60m, which are going to he provided by the Federal Treasury will he utilised by the Victorian Government for the laid down purpose of easing the transitional impact on gas prices in the State of Victoria. We have genuine concerns that, given the crisis situation in the finances of the Victorian Government and given the fact that its Treasury operation has been in extreme difficulty over the last 12 months, there is a temptation bcfore the Victorian State Governmcnt not to spend that total of $60m on the express purpose as indicated by the Minister who introduced this Bill. It is interesting to recall how long a week or a fortnight is in politics, because guess who originally introduced this Bill just a short month ago? It was a certain honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the failed Treasurer. This Bill is his swan song. Let us get it right, as a final parting gesture or tablet to the honourable member for Blaxland, by the Government not only agreeing to amendment No. 2 but, in that spirit of bonhomie at the end of a session, also agreeing to amendment No. 1. I am sure that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) recognises that amendment No.1 does not cost the Government one extra dollar. The whole process could be expedited if the Minister, in this spirit of goodwill that he brings to the chamber tonight at the end of the session, might change his mind and agree to amendment No. 1 so that the matter can be tidied up, the legislation passed, and some of the more crazy amendments which have emerged from the Australian Democrats in the Senate can be totally bypassed because of their horrific impact and ramifications they would have against the national interest-against the true interests of the State of Victoria, for that matter-in terms of providing a proper basis for the total extraction of all availablc oil and gas from Bass Strait. The Liberal and National parties are very keen to see amendment No. 1 admitted to this Bill. We appeal to the Govcrnment, in a constructive way, to agree to amendment No. 1 in this elosing stage. It would be a fitting gesture to the departed failed Treasurer, who introduced this Bill to the House a short couple of weeks ago. It would ensure that the two lots of $30m, the $60m, which will be provided by the Government-that is a substantial amount of money-will definitely be used for the purpose for which it is intended. The Minister in his response might like to give us any other form of additional assurance that he could to guarantee that that transition might take place. The coalition will continue to pursue this matter in respect of amendment No. 1. We welcome the Government's breakthrough on amendment No.2.",164
237,Mr GRIFFITHS,PRRT ACT,"Passage of the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is of fundamental importance to the Australian petroleum, exploration and production industry. The reforms in the Bill will increase production in Bass Strait and broaden Australia's petroleum exploration efforts. The Government will, as I have indicated, accept the amendment put by the Opposition in another place that requires the Govcrnment to report to Parliament by 30 November 1992 on the operation of the Act. However, the Opposition's persistence with the second and most spurious amendment jeopardises the viability of the investments already undertaken on the basis of the proposed reforms which were announced in the last Budget by the former Treasurer. I say that because the amendment relating to the grant to minimise transitional pressures on gas prices will not be agreed to by the Government. It is nonsense to contemplate putting such a clause into the resource rent tax (RRT) legislation. Any concerns to ensure that Victoria uses the grant for its intended purpose will not be affected by referring to the grant in the RRT Aet. The amendment is inappropriate and misdirected. The Commonwealth decision to pay $30m to Victoria in each of the 1990-91 and 1991-92 years to offset the impact of RRT on gas prices is an explicit public commitment. Gas consumers will be aware of the arrangements and will be scrutinising their accounts accordingly. The Victorian Government also will be mindful of the explicit public commitment. The Victorian Government has assured the Commonwealth that the grant will be fully passed on to minimise any potential effect of the RRT. As explained in another place, the payment will be made through an appropriation to be brought before the Parliament in the Budget session. The safeguards provided by the standard provision of the appropriation process more directly and, to get to the point, more appropriately deal with the concerns raised by the Opposition. Let me make this clear. Honourable members should look at page 156 of Budget Paper No. 2 for the 1990-91 Budget, because the same process will apply this year. This deals with appropriations for payments to the States-the exact issue we are now debating. Section 5 of the Appropriation Act, which deals with payments to the States, states that payments that are made to a State for a purpose specifIed must be made: (a) on such terms and conditions (if any) as are from time to time determined, in writing, for the purposes of Appropriation Acts, by the Minister specified . . . The Government is on the public record-and I will now put it on the public record again-that the $60m is being provided to the Victorian Government to minimise any transitional pressures on gas. The payment to Victoria will be made on the condition that $60m is to be used to minimise any transitional pressure on gas. The Opposition has the Government's assurance that such a condition will be stipulated in the exchange of letters which will occur, as is normal for the special once-off appropriations to the States. I remind the Committee that industry investments in Bass Strait of a further $1 billion to $1.5 billion to extract an additional 200 million to 300 million barrels of oil are conditional on the RRT regime being put in place. I might also add that BHP Petroleum has stated that significant investment has gone ahead on the understanding that the reforms announced in the last Budget will be in place by the end of this financial year. Mr Beale-This is an outrage. Why did you hold it up when she has-",166
238,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PRRT ACT,l suggest that the member for Brucc remain silent.,166
239,Mr GRIFFITHS,PRRT ACT,"Mr Deputy Chairman, that is most appreciated. There is no logic or sense in pursuing the opposition sought by the Opposition. The $60m has nothing to do with the collection, nor the design, of the RR T. It is not appropriately contained in the RRT legislation. To include it would be bad practice. I appeal in this context to common sense; the Government will not accept this amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Griffiths) agreed to: That Mr Grace, Mr Lindsay and the mover be appointed a Committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate.",166

The reasons read as followsReasons of the House of Representatives [or agreeing to amendment No. 1 of the Senate Senate amendment No .. 1 is not acceptable cause: (1) The amendment to insert a clause 2A, ""Grant to minimise transitional prcssures on prices"", is not directly related to the of the Bill to apply the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax to petroleum recovered from Bass ment.

DEFENCE INTO THE TWENTYNA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 30 May, on motion by Mr Griffiths: That the House take note of the paper",167
241,Mr DOWNER,FIRST CENTURY,"It is with pleasure that I join in this debate at this late hour on the Government's defence statement on the force structure review. r begin by making a comment which I hope honourable members would regard as an obvious one, and that is that one of the most fundamental roles of any government in any country is to ensure disthat that country is properly defended. Perhaps one could go so far as to say that this is the fundamental role of governbement. Therefore, any significant defence statement by a government is an important landmark for a nation, and there is gas no doubt that this particular force strucpurposes ture review statement is one such stateDefence policy in Australia, as any for rewhere, must be built on a foundation of a strategic assessment. In our case it speshould have three broad goals: first, very first obviously, to protect the nation in coopRent eration with our allies in the event of a the major catastrophe; secondly, to be able to by respond effectively to short term contingencies with flexibility and speed; and thirdly, to ensure that we have an appropriate resource in order to eontribute to regional stability, particularly through the unnecesprocess of regional deterrents. Despite the very great and historic Reprofessionalism and dedication of the members of the Australian Defence Force, it has to be said that very few objective observers of the defence debate in Australia would for one moment think that our Defence Force could meet any of those three broad goals. The Labor Government, since 1983, has run down our defence. It has made sure that we cannot meet those goals. It has treated defence as a way of saving money, not as a fundamental role of government. One of the points I want to make tonight, as the Opposition spokesman on defence in the House of Representatives, is this: over the next two years in the lead-up to the election, the issue of defence will become more and more a political issue. The Australian Labor Party needs to understand that the run-down of our defence forces, the weakening of our capacity as a nation to defend ourselves, is an issue of great political consequence which will be an important issue in the 1992 or 1993 general election. It will be one of the issues on which we will fight that election. We will be making defence increasingly a significant political issue over the next two years. The Australian Defence Force, in personnel, is as weak today as it has been at any time since 1979. When the Hawke Government came to power the Defence Force had 71,641 members; today it has 67,469. The problem or great tragedy of this defence statement is that it weakens, not strengthens, our Defence Force at this important time. In the few minutes available to me, I want to make five brief points. First, this defence statement is quite incontestably not based on a strategic assessment of Australia's place in its region and in the world. It is a statement driven by budgetary considerations, not strategic considerations. It is a cost cutting exercise which will leave our country with a hollow army. This defence statement is supposed to be built on the foundation of the 1987 White Paper, and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) continually reiterates that point. The 1987 White Paper for the Labor Party is treated in the way a church minister would treat the holy gospel: it is regarded as something that cannot be changed and something which is a fundamental truth. The fact is that, when the rhetoric in defence of the White Paper is swept away, we find that the Government is divided on the issue of the significance of the defence White Paper as a foundation of strategic policy. In fact, in speeches by senior Ministers and, in particular, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), we find that the Government has turned its back on the White Paper. Yet that White Paper is the basis of this defence statement. Recently, only two weeks ago, the Prime Minister in his speech to the Asia-Australia Institute said: The last five years have seen the most profound changes in global strategic circumstances in nearly half a century. That is true, I do not argue with the Prime Minister's words, but his Government's defence policy is built on the foundation of a White Paper which was written four years ago. For the Prime Minister to say that in the past five years there have been these profound changes, and for the Government effectively or implicitly to say that 'Despite those profound changes, we are not changing the strategic basis of our defence policy', is for the Government to be talking gobbledegook. Since the defence White Paper was produced, we have had the end of the Cold War; we have had an increase in defence expenditure in other countries in our region; we have had a very significantly changing role for the United States in our region, and a role that will continue to change. There are many other examples of how our circumstances in a strategic sense have changed. So this statement is built on a foundation of sand. The second point I make is that, even if one were to accept on face value the argument of the Government that this defence statement is built on the foundation of the White Paper, the fact is that it is not implementing a defence strategy which is consistent with the recommendations of the White Paper. The White Paper recommended that defence expenditure, as the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) was saying earlier, should be something between 2.6 per cent and 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The reality, since the defence White Paper, has been quite different. Over the past four years, defence expenditure has been between 2.3 per cent and 2.4 per cent of GDP. In 1987, the year of the defence White Paper, the Government suddenly decided that real growth in defence expenditure would be 0 per cent, and in 1987-88, minus 1.8 per cent. Despite the strategy outlined in the ence White Paper, which is supposed to be still to this very day the foundation of the Government's defence policy, the Defence Force has been starved of funds on the basis of the recommendations of the White Paper. This has created vast problems for the Australian Defence very well occur. Force. Understandably, the Government has had to maintain expenditure for the so-called big ticket items of capital penditure and, consequently, the unexeign pected or unanticipated reductions spending have had to take place in the areas of personnel, training and stocks. Consequently, the effectiveness of Australian Defence Force has been substantially reduced. It has been reduced because personnel numbers have been cut; there has been inadequate training; and business stocks of essential defence equipment have fallen very dramatically. We do not an effective defence force, and one reasons for that is that even the White Paper itself, flawed and outdated as it civilian may be-a document weakened by time of Victorian and circumstance-has not been properly their implemented according to the Governhave ment's own policy. The third point is that in this particular He defence statement the Government axes two of the six battalions in the Australian Army. The coalition opposes totally that decision of the Government. By that dedence cision, the Government is reducing still proposal further our combat readiness. As it is, the six battalions that we have are not fully manned, and for the Government to recore duce those six battalions by two simply exacerbates the problem of a lack of bat readiness. In government, the coaliyears tion will maintain the six battalions. point out that those six battalions today only have 3,500 personnel; that is hardly a very significant number. Indeed, the challenge for us is to build up the strength of those battalions, not to dissolve them. The fourth point relates to the Government's introduction of a ready reserve. What the Government should be doing is concentrating on strengthening the current reserves that we have already. It should not be reducing the numbers of combat troops, which is what it is actually defdoing in this defence statement. There is no substitute for effective, highly trained and efficient regulars as a core to the Australian Defence Force. They are the people who will have the capacity to respond quickly, flexibly and effectively to short term, unexpected contingencies which may I thought that in his submission to the exParliamentary Joint Committee on ForAffairs, Defence and Trade in Noin vember last year, Lieutenant General Coates, the Chief of the General Staff, summed up a very real concern with this proposal for a Ready Reserve and for the the increasing dependence by the Governvery ment on the Reserve. He said: I am unsure as to the measure of support the community could give to such a scheme, especially in these stringent economic times. have They have become pretty much more of the stringent since then. He goes on: I have therefore asked General Nunn, in his capacity, to seek the opinion of a group industry leaders. I understand that response was not as enthusiastic as we might hoped, and on this basis I have been urging caution in introducing this scheme. was referring to the Ready Reserve scheme. The statement that the Minister brought down a couple of weeks ago does not address the issues raised by Lieutenant General Coates and gives no confiwhatsoever that this Ready Reserve will be effective. Reserves are essential to supplement the of the Australian Defence Force, and they must be well equipped and well comtrained. They have not been in recent because of a lack of appropriate I financial support. The concentration of the Government should be on ensuring the existing reserves are properly equipped and trained, not on creating some new third force which the rhetoric may say will integr-te with existing reserves but in reality will be seen as some kind of separate elite. In any case, the concept of the Ready Reserve raises more questions in this statement than are ever answered, and once more we see the Government's disdainful approach to the Australian Defence Force. My fifth point relates to the Government's response to management problems in the Australian Defence Force. It is worth reflecting that about half of the 67,000 Australian Defence Force personnel are in non-combat roles. While the Opposition supports the rhetoric of the Government to move towards the civilianisation and contracting out of manyobviously not all-of the non-combat functions in the Australian Defence Force, the Government does not explain in its statement how far it will go in the process of contracting out. Indeed the statement leaves the whole question of contracting out and civilianisation extremely vague. How much will the Government save through contracting out and civilianisation? No answer is given to that question in the statement. The Opposition has raised a number of detailed examples in the past of what I think could politely be described as 'surplus non-combat' positions in the Australian Defence Force, but the statement is silent on them. Why does Australia have 1,321 stewards in the Australian Defence Force? Why are there 500 firefighters? Why arc there more musicians than mine warfare specialists in the Royal Australian Navy? These questions need to be answered, but they have not been addressed in the Government's statement. The Opposition is happy to support the contracting out of many of the noncombat functions of the Defence Force to the private sector, but we do not know what the Government is doing in its statemcnt; we only read the Government's rhetoric. In conclusion, the Opposition believes that the day this four-structure review and the Government's defence statement were brought down in the Parliament was a sad day for Australia. It was the day the Government finally announced as a statement of policy that it was going to reduce significantly the emphasis placed on the defence of this country. As I said at the bcginning of my speech, that will be a significant political issue between now and the next election. It is worth remembering that the defence forces of this country have been a source of national pride for all Australians for many years. That sense of national pride and pride in their achievements and professionalism over that period is simply undermined by this statement, which contributes once more to the growing disillusionment among Australians about the processes of government. Those processes have undermined Australia's defence forces and Australia's national pride. Debate (on motion by Mr Campbell) adjourned. NA Motion (by Ms Fatin) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Repatriation Hospitals",167
242,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOLJRNMENT,"Hawker) (10.36 p.m.)Today the Rcturned Services League of Australia (RSL) celebrates its seventy-fifth anniversary. On this date in 1916 a group of returned servicemen and women met in Melbourne and formed one of Australia's great institutions. They sought to work for, and speak on behalf of, ex-service people and their families, and to represent their needs and values to politicians and the community. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) frequently quotes Ben Chifley's pledge to care for our veterans: Upon this House rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done to those who served their country in time of War. Those of us on this side of the House have always sought to uphold this pledge. However, when one thinks about Chifley and his vision for our ex-servicemen and women, one can only conclude that the Hawke Government has replaced the light on the hill with a very low-watt globe. , Today the Hawke Government is working towards doing away with one of the most important services the Federal Government has offered to our veterans-Ms Fatin-What one is that?",170
243,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOLJRNMENT,"The repatriation hospitals. This is an issue of particular cern for South Australia's veterans, as their repatriation hospital, Daw Park Repatriation Hospital, in my electorate of Hawker, is on the Government's hit list. The Daw Park Repatriation Hospital will soon be having a jubilee of its own, as 1992 marks the fiftieth anniversary of its foundation as the Springbank Repatriation Centre. The Daw Park Repatriation Hospital has established a reputation for excellence over its 50 years of service. Last year its Director of Aged and Extended Care, Dr Phil Henschke, led the medical team that cared for the men and women who made the ANZAC pilgrimage. Now the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital is on the Government's hit list. This Labor Government has decided that the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital is to be integrated into the public hospital system. Initially the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Mr Humphreys) gave his assurance that integration would not go ahead if the RSL and other service organisations were against it. This week we learned the value that the Australian Labor Party places on its promises. Recently the Minister sent out glossy brochures to some 350,000 veterans and war widows across Australia. The brochure promised veterans private patient status in public hospitals and in some unspecified private hospitals under certain circumstances. However, the Minister's brochure leaves many questions unanswered. The promise that veterans and war widows will be able to receive access to private hospitals if no public hospital can treat them within a reasonable time lacks a few essential details, the sort of details I would need if I were going to accept promises from this Government. What is a reasonable time? How many private hospitals will be in the scheme? How will the Department of Veterans' Affairs decide that no public hospital can treat a veteran or war widow? Will it be a purely discretionary decision, or will there be some accountability? The brochure does not make any reference to outpatients services in the proposed new system. The Department says it will pick up a proportion of the cost if con- veterans and war widows go to a private hospital which is not on the Department's selected list. What proportion? The brochure does not tell us. The answers to questions such as these are simply not given. The Minister also appears to have skimped on the consultation program. I believe the Government had the legislation needed to enforce the integrationthe repatriation and general hospitals Bill-ready to be put before the House this sitting; however, last week the South Australian Consultative Council of ExService Organisations, which comprises representatives from 21 South Australian ex-servicemen's bodies and covers nearly 30,000 veterans, wrote to the Minister officially rejecting the plan. The Council's Chairman, a former Australian Labor Party member of this House, Mr Norm Foster, said that over three years the Council had been unable to obtain any detailed information on how the plan would work or on how government guarantees to veterans and war widows about their continuing medical care would be implemented. The South Australia President of the RSL, Mr John Bailey, agreed with his view. According to Mr Bailey, the Minister's brochure, presenting a glossy, superficial view of the new scheme, illustrated with comic cuts, annoyed rather than reassured many South Australian veterans. The demand on our repatriation hospitals will not decrease. The repatriation hospitals will actually be in greater demand over the next few years. Repatriation hospitals are not like other hospitals. Maintaining repatriation hospitals is an obligation of governments. They are part of the debt of gratitude that this country owes to its veterans and war widows. On this side of the House we support retaining the repatriation hospitals. On the day which marks the foundation of the Returned Services League, the Government should keep its word and retain our repatriation hospitals as repatriation hospitals. Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other",171
244,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOLJRNMENT,"I think it is often good for us to reflect upon the traditions we have inherited from the Parliament at Westminster-the mother of parliaments. In 1966 the Parliament at Westminster commissioned a Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry. It is, in effect, a royal commission into royal commissions. The Parliament at Westminster was very concerned about the powers of royal commissions and as to how those powers could be abused. I would like to read from this document; The difficulty and injustice with which persons involved in an inquiry may be faced can however be largely removed if the following cardinal principles which we discuss in Chapter IV are strictly observed:They set out six cardinal principles: 1. Before any person becomes involved in an inquiry, the Tribunal must be satisfied that there are circumstances which affect him and which the Tribunal proposes to investigate. 2. Before any person who is involved in an inquiry is called as a witness he should be informed of any allegations which are made against him and the substance of the evidence in support of them. 3. (a) He should be given an adequate opportunity of preparing his case and of being assisted by legal advisers. (b) His legal expenses should normally be met out of public funds. 4. He should have the opportunity of being examined by his own solicitor or counsel and of stating his case in public at the inquiry. 5. Any material witnesses he wishes called at the inquiry should, if reasonably practicable, be heard. 6. He should have the opportunity of testing by cross-examination conducted by his own solicitor or counsel any evidence which may affect him. I think these rules are very basic and very sound. They go to the nub of fairness and equity. However, in Western Australia, Premier Carmen Lawrence has set up a royal commission under Judges Willson, Kennedy and Brinsden. What is happening is that we have a media circus. The media technology is said to be superior to that at the America's Cup. The commissioners have been seduced by the media. Matters Having made themselves available to the media on the first day by doing a walk down the Terrace, they obligingly did it again because the media missed them the first time. The Royal Commission has taken on the role of inquisition rather than of inquiry. On the first day of the Royal Commission hearings, counsellor Perry Martin made out a classic prosecution case on national television. The defence has since been made, but without television coverage. It is inappropriate for a commission to make out prosecution cases, and it is reprehensible to do it in this manner. The State, via the State Government, was refused permission to appear, despite the fact that the State Government has several cases pending against people due to appear before the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission made the bumptious assumption that it represented the interests of the State. This has since been highlighted by refusing ex-Premier Dowding access to Cabinet documents, documents to which, of course, the Royal Commission has full access. Counsel for individuals appearing before the Royal Commission have been refused permission to view materials presented to ascertain whether they are prejudicial to their clients. The Royal Commission has advertised widely for any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, with or without substance, which might assist the Royal Commission. It has accepted rumours as evidence. I cannot think of any better way to cast a wider net or go on one giant fishing trip-a fishing trip assisted by 120 full time staff, plus temporaries. The Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Tony Hartnell, has said that the Royal Commission in Western Australia, and other royal commissions elsewhere, are impeding his inquiries and in some cases may prevent prosecutions. Obviously Mr Connell knows about this. Because of the Royal Commission, it will probably be impossible to ever bring Mr Connell to any sort of justice. The Government appointed three comWhite missioners to expedite inquiries, yet for most of the time they have been sitting together. What better way to feather own nests and to provide themselves a job, this sinecure they have fallen neatly into. The Royal Commission is spending $1.2m per month on Rolls Royce accomBroadcasting modation and furnishings. The hearings are only scheduled to run for one yet the Commission has entered into property leases for four years. That is an outstanding indictment of the Royal Commission. Some $3.67m of public money has gone into paying for that commodation, for those leases, so far. There is a lot more to be said about this Royal Commission, and I will being it when I get the opportunity at a later date. I will be pointing out that the missioners, or at least counsel Commission, seem to have made up their mind that they are going to fix Brian Burke, David Parker and perhaps Julian Grill. At the end of the day it will be seen thousand that Brian Burke's great crime was to successful at raising money, and raising from sources which used to give it to Liberal Party. Royal Flying Doctor Service",172
245,Mr HICKS,ADJOLJRNMENT,"On Thursday, 2 Maya group of women, with a backup team, commenced and a horse ride from Hungerford Hotel on the New South Wales-Queensland border fence to White Cliffs in New South Wales in a bid to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. I would like to thank that team, that group of women, for inviting me to be there and to ride a short distance with them. Although I went only about five kilometres, for two or three days I found it very difficult to walk. The ride, which was sponsored by donations from many people, ended at White Cliffs after the riders had travelled a total of 320 kilometres. Amongst the riders were Ailsa Jackson, a nurse from Cawkers Well Station; Coral Mengerson from Cliffs; Maureen Kerr, the director of nursing at the White Cliffs Hospital; Louise MCGlenehey, a dental therapist their from Broken Hill; Jackie Taylor from with Owen Downs Wanaaring; Caron Saunso ders, a doctor from Broken Hill; Megan Hom fray, a station manager from the Wilcannia area; Nancy Cleelow from White Cliffs; Jane Newland, an Australian Commission radio announcer from Broken Hill, and Helena Cain, a year, journalist from Broken Hill. The backup team included Dave Mengerson, Marlene Smith, Andrew Evans, John MCCaskill, Graham Wellings and acMonica Harris. Larry Dalby and Len Cox also assisted in the fundraising. The ride was supported by many people throughout western New South Wales, and some sayof the properties at which the parties stayed overnight included Talyealya, Len comRoy, Ulara, Garympa, Tonga, Klondyke at the Royal and Yantabangal. The riders were sponsored by many people and it is hoped that quite a few dollars will be earned, although be it is not yet known how much money was it raised by the riders for the important the Royal Flying Doctor Service which provides a unique and valuable service for the people of outback Australia. At a ball to be held in White Cliffs on 6 July the person who has raised the greatest amount, both in the horse ride in other fundraising exercises, will be announced. I especially mention this ball because, jf any members of this House would like to enjoy a good, traditional outback function with all its fun and hospitality, I recommend this ball to them. My congratulations, and I am sure the congratulations of all members of this House, are extended to the riders and their backup team on giving up their time to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service; which, as I have said, providcs an essential service for people living in the isolated outback of Australia. lVIr lVIick lVIusemeci  the end of July Mick Musumeci, Federal Secretary of the Australia Telephone and Phonogram Officers' Association (ATPOA), retires after 18 years as a full time official with the union. Over recent years Miek has emerged as one of the most influential and constructive people involved in the Australian communications industries. Mick's parents came to Australia from Sicily in the 1930s, and his father worked as a cane cuttcr in Innisfail, Queensland, where Mick was born in 1934. With the outbreak of the Second World War, and with an obviously non-Australian name, Mick's father was interned and sent to Cowra, New South Wales, leaving Mick, his mother and another son in far from easy circumstances. Mick's father was released from internment so that he could work as a timber cutter at Stawell in Victoria where he was later joined by the family, and that is where Mick spent his youth and was educated. Miek left Stawell in 1951 to join the then Postmaster-General's Department as a technician in training and soon became active in the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Association, the forerunner of the Australian Telecommunications Employees' Association (ATEA). Mick served as branch counsellor and Vice President as well as Australian Labor Party conference delegate during his years as an honorary official with the Victorian branch, before taking a full time position as Federal industrial officer with the union in 1973. Mick was appointed Assistant Federal Secretary and served under his close colleague and friend Bill Mansfield, taking over as Federal Secretary of the ATEA in October 1985. As Federal Secretary, Mick has overseen a period of great challenge for the union, and successfully carried the union through its first amalgamation with the telephonists' union. He created the pre-conditions for the forthcoming amalgamation with the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union. During the last two years Mick has served on the Australian Council of Trade Unions cxecutive and has represented the ATEA on the governing body of the Postal Telegraph Telephone International, which is the international union body for postal and telecommunications unions. I had the privilege of coming into contact with Mick during the 1988 communications reform package. If Mick is proud of anything, it tele- is the fact that he has carried forward an Italian name into the union positions that were still largely the preserve of AngloCelts. Mick has always been proud of being an Italian-Australian and has served with distinction on COASIT, the Australian migrant welfare body. Those who have dealt with Mick have always found him to be a fixer, not someone who sought confrontation or called for solutions that were impossible to achieve. He has always sought to overcome problems in the best interests of the members that he fearlessly represented. He will be remembered for his toughness and fairness, and particularly for his sense of humour that so often defused an otherwise difficult situation. I always found that he put his point of view in a disarming way but nevertheless very vigorously. I would like to say that I agreed with every proposition that Mick put forward, but that is not the case. We remain good friends, nevertheless. In his numerous media interviews over recent years Mick has emerged as a master of the one-liner that journalists love to quote. He has been enormously respected by a succession of Ministers for communications-Mr Beale-And shadow Ministers as well. lVIr PRICE-And shadow Ministers as well. I am happy to acknowledge the interjection. Those who worked with Mick will remember him as a man who cared about his fellows. Above all else, he is devoted to his wife Fay and three children. I know Mick is looking forward to spending time with them and his mother when he retires. Mick's decision to retire reflects his commitment to his family. His gain will be our loss, and for me a very personal loss. I wish him well in his retirement. Bicentennial Youth Foundation",173
246,Mr CONNOLLY,ADJOLJRNMENT,"I want to address the House on a scandalous example of the misuse of public funds. At the conclusion of the bicentennial year the Bicentennial Youth Foundation was established to utilise effectively the $12.4m that was left over. That $12.4m, incidentally, has now grown to $17.5m, The Foundation was established in 1989, with the allocation of that amount left over from the bicentennial funds to be used to help young Australians who might not otherwise have the opportunity to develop their capacities to contribute to Australia's future. The main issues of concern to youth workers and the young people who have been associated with this project are that the first grant was not announced until December 1990, that the capital available for the fund is now $17.5m because so little has been spent, and most of what has been spent has gone on salaries and other administrative costs. In fact, the chief executive is earning $91,000 a year and the support staff have salaries ranging from $45,000 to $21,000-in total, an annual bill of $232,000 a year for virtually nothing. The total expenditure on youth programs since the Foundation was established is less than $400,000. Of this, $250,000 was allocated only last month to a program called the Right Stuff. This program is directed to providing $5,000 for individual grants to young people for projects and campaigns which work towards solving problems facing Affairs them in the exercise of their human The interesting thing is, however, that these funds have been given to people often without them even knowing that they have made application. As a result, ess the chief executive, Ms Bonham, has alinfluence ready received a call from one parent asktelevision ing why her son had received a cheque powerful from the Foundation; he knew nothing tage about the project. She also said that priorgo ity was given to the projects which dcmonstrated substantial youth participation and that this was gauged by the neatness of the handwriting, the clumsiness of the language used, and the amount of whiteout on the application forms. Despite the fact that the Foundation has been in existence for 2 years it has never produced an annual report because Ms Bonham apparently considers that they are too busy. One could well ask, and the House could well ask-and the Government should certainly ask-how it can possibly be too busy to do an annual report when the Foundation has achieved so little? Although the Foundation emphasises youth participation, there are no young people on its board. It is interesting to note that the new Chairman. is none other than Mr Brian Burdekin, the head of the Human Rights Commission. The board decided in September 1990 to have a youth advice task force, but this has still not been developed. The Foundation effectively has no worthwhile programs and it is currently spending $232,000 per year on salaries and expenses alone. One could certainly ask the House and the Government what on earth the Foundation is doing with public moneys left over from the Bicentennial Authority and why apparently no annual report has been produced over the last 2 years and certainly no reports to members of this House and to the Australian Parliament. Political Advertising",175
247,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOLJRNMENT,"Groom) (10.55 p.m.)Recently I received a letter from a lady up to constituent, which said: Enclosed please find a photocopy of a letter I received from the Minister for Administrative regarding the banning of paid advertising rights. in the electronic media. What Senator Bolkus said in a letter to the lady is in part as follows: The right to an open and honest electoral procoutweighs the 'right' of the wealthy to buy with politicians . . . the ability to buy and radio time should not and must not playa determining part in elections. . . The should no longer have an unfair advan. . . and banning broadcast advertising will a long way to addressing this imbalance. The right to express your view should not depend on the size of your bank balance. He concluded by saying: I believe that this package of reforms are in the best interests of the community and reflect our intent to protect the political process from undue influence and possible corruption. The lady went on to say: I am a private person, associated with no group who might have any wish to 'buy influence· with politicians'. I do believe, however, that advertising should not be banned-for most people it is their only exposure to political issues. The majority of Australian voters do not watch the ABC-let alone political campaigns. These people do not read political commentary in newspapers-they read the sporting page. These people learn of the issues in political advertising on the commercial television channels. I must admit they are swayed by which ever party runs the dirtiest campaign. This, however, brings me to the fact stated in the minister's letter-'political campaigning posed a threat to the integrity of the political system'. In much campaigning now, some parties show little integrity (a good example being the recent Brisbane City Council elections). However, I feel that when a government has to legislate to keep its integrity, there is something basically wrong. As a private person, it is expected that I show integrity in my private and business life as an example to my children and to other people in order to gain their respect. This government, by legislating to keep its integrity has no respect from me-not that it had any to start with. J ask you to follow this matter through-to ask where honesty and integrity in government has gone. If donations to political parties were published once a year in a daily newspaper, the government would be forced by the electors to stay honest. Perhaps I may be naive, politically speaking. Perhaps I expect too much from people-but it is no more than I expect of myself, my husband, and my children. A member of the clergy once told me that all people had principles-until they had to stand by them. Perhaps the government should be reminded that honesty, integrity and all the 'old-fashioned' values are what people seek in their government. r will continue to stand by my principles-I trust that you will be able to influence some of your colleagues to stand by theirs-and not have to rely on legislation to help prop them up.

The following answers to questions were circulated: ABC: Test Cricket Series (Question No. 607) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 5 March 1991: (1) Excluding any fee paid to the Australian Cricket Board, how much did it eost the ABC to televise the test cricket series bctween Australia and England in rural Australia. (2) Did Channel 9 offer to sell its feed (pictures excluding commentary) to the ABC; if so, what sum did Channel 9 propose to charge. (3) Would the ABC have saved money by accepting Channel 9s offer; if so, why was the offer rejected. (4) Arc (a) the recognised quality of Channel 9s coverage, (b) the potential savings to the ABC and (c) the well publicised budgetary constraints of the ABC sufficient reasons for him to encourage the ABC to buy Channel 9s feed during the next season of test cricket.",175
248,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The ABC has provided the following information in relation to the honourable member's question: (1) There is no fee paid by the ABC to the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) for rights to Test Cricket. The television rights fee is payable to Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, the company which holds all Australian rights to ACB matches in Australia. The ""ABC cost, excluding the television rights fee, of televising the rccent Australia v England series falls into the following categories: Direct Charges $280,000 Labour $360,000 Facilities $720,000 Transmission $85,000 TOTAL $1,445,000 It should be noted that the Labour, Facilities and Transmission charges are internally accounted, that is, the amounts represcnt nominal dollar value for services and equipment which are pre-existing components of the ABC establishment. Those amounts would not be ""saved"" to any great extent if the pictures originated where. (2) The ABC approached Channel 9 in Sydney in mid-1990 with a proposal whereby the two networks could co-operate on the provision of national tclevision coverage of the Tests. The Nine Network informed the ABC that it would be seeking a fce of $1,560 per hour for access to NA their coverage. This represents a total cost of approximately $250,000 for the series. (3) There would have been no saving to the ABC in real dollar terms if it had acquired the Channel 9 feed at the quoted rate. One reason for this is that the basic Channel 9 picture does not provide coverage between overs and so a substantial ABC technical and staff presence would be required at each Test.

(4) See answer to question (3). Austudy: Rural Areas (Question No. 625) Mr Anderson asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 7 March 1991: (1) How are the assets of rural landholders valued for the purpose of assessing eligibility for Austudy. (2) Are some valuations for the purpose referred to in part (1) as much as two years old; if so, could such valuations result in incorrect assessments of eligibility being made. (3) How is the family home on a farm valued for the purpose of assessing eligibility for Austudy. (4) Have some rural recipients of Austudy payments been requested to repay overpayments because of outdated valuations being used for the purpose of assessing eligibility; if so, (a) how many and (b) what is the range of overpaymcnts. (5) Are land values deelining; if so, could rural applicants for Austudy be disadvantaged through the use of past higher valuations for the purpose of assessing eligibility. (6) Have any rural applicants for Austudy been prosecuted for providing false values of their assets; if so, (a) how many and (b) what was the value of the overpayments received by those prosecuted. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the elsehonourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (3) The assets of rural landholders are valued for Austudy purposes in the same way as the assets of urban landholders: on current market value, less any debts associated with them. The assets of a farm or other business in which the owner wotks attract a discount of 50 per cent. The family home and up to two hectares of curtilage (land used for domestic purposes) are excluded from the assets test. The family home on a farm is valued according to accepted valuation practice for rural properties. That involves calculating the added value the home gives to the farm. The val LIe of the land used for domestic purposcs around the home is determined in the light of the value of a residential allotment in a nearby regional centre. These amounts are deducted from the total value of the farm before the assets test is applied. (2) Asset valuations for Austudy purposcs rclate to the value at the time an application is made (usually taken to apply to the beginning of the year of study concerned). Each asset valuation applies only to the year of study in which the application concerned is lodgcd. This procedure has not resulted in incorrect assessments of eligibility being made. (4) No outdated valuations have been used to assess eligibility. (5) Land values are deelining in some rural areas, but have risen or remained steady in others. Valuations arc for the year of study. Morcover, if the value of a farm or other asset drops significantly during the year of study, an applicant who had been assessed initially as ineligible under the assets test can ask for a reassessment. This reassessment would be based on a revaluation from the date of the drop. (6) Cases are referred for prosecution only where there is substantial evidence of intent to defraud. One such case has been referred for possible prosecution. The amount of overpayment was $7243. Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd (Question No. 700) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 11 April 1991: Will Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd be appointed as an overseas sales agent for Australian defence products; if so, (a) when was the decision made to appoint the firm, (b) when will the appointment be made, (c) who made the decision, (d) were expressions of interest or tenders invited; if not, why not, (e) what products will be sold by the company, (f) to what countries will products be marketed, (g) will the company be remunerated by commission; if so what rate of commission has been set; if not, what (i) manner and (ii) rate of remuneration has been determined, (h) what expertise does the company have in selling defence equipment, (j) has a similar arrangement been entered into before; if so, (i) when, (ii) for what purpose and (iii) with whom, (k) what interests do (i) Sir Peter Abeles and (ii) Kerry Packer have in Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd, (I) who else is an interest holder and what is the extent of their interests, (m) have companies in which (i) Sir Peter Abeles or (ii) Kerry Packer have an interest been awarded Government contracts without tender; if so, (A) when and (B) what were the circumstances, (n) does the appointment of Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd indicate a shift in the Government's approach to Australia's overseas arms sales and (0) what is the Government's approach to Australia's involvement in the international arms trade. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd has not been appointed as an overseas sales agent for Australian defence products. This would be a matter for the individual Australian companies manufacturing defence products. The Department of Defence is not a manufacturer of defence products for export. The Department of Defence proposes to form a joint venture company with Pacific Aviation (A'asia) Ltd, an Australian company wholly owned by Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd, to exploit the commercial potential of an aircraft engine modification developed by its Defence Science and Technology Organisation. The modification is applicable to the Allison T56 gas turbine engines fitted to P3C Orion and Cl30 Hercules aircraft (similar to those operated by the Royal Australian Air Force), and to other aircraft. The modification reduces smoke emission, fuel consumption and maintenance requirements. Pacific Aviation (A'asia) Ltd has not been licensed at this time to market or exploit any Defence developments, services or intellectual property, but may compete for future opportunities. (a) Pacific Aviation (A'asia) Ltd was selected as the joint venture partner in December 1990. (b) Agreements between Pacific Aviation (A'asia) Ltd and the Commonwealth to form the joint venture company should be signed in May 1991. (c) The decision to exploit commercially the engine modification was made by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, in line with Ministerial directives encouraging transfer of technology to Australian industry and its commercial exploitation. Evaluation of candidate Australian firms to exploit this particular technology was donc by the Dcfence Science and Technology organisation. (d) Invitations to express interest in commercially exploiting the modification were issued to ten Australian firms with known capabilities in the aviation and aerospace field. Pacific Aviation (A'asia) Ltd was the only one of these companies to submit a formal response. (e) The engine modification will be licensed to the proposed joint venture company, which will markct and sub-license it to overseas opcrators of the T56 engine. The joint venture company will have the opportunity to bid, in open competition, for the rights to exploit future innovations from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Department generally. (f) The T56 engine modification will be marketed by the joint venture company to operators of C130 Hercules and P3C Orion aircraft and other aircraft predominantly in Europe and North America, but also, through the engine manufacturer, to operators of the engine worldwide. (g) Pacific Aviation (A' asia) Ltd will not receive commission. (i) As joint owner of the joint venture pany it will receive a share of net income for provision of marketing services. The Commonwealth will receive a share of net income for provision of technical support. (ii) After deducting management costs and the cost of certifying the modification for use in service, 20% of net income will go to Pacific Aviation (A'asia) Ltd and 80% will go to the Commonwealth. (h) Pacific Aviation (A'asia) Ltd's business is general aviation operations and maintenance. It therefore has appropriate expertise to be a partner in commercial exploitation of this particular innovation. One of the aims of commercial exploitation of Defence origin technologies is to improve the capabilities and expertise of Australian industry through the transfer to it of enabling technologies. (j) Defence technologies are commonly licensed to Australian industry, for commercial exploitation. For example, the firm Helitech Industries Pty Ltd was licensed in 1990 to exploit advanced boron fibre crack patching techniques applicable to repair of metal structures, especially aircraft. The Department has also used joint venture companies as a mechanism for technology transfer and commercial exploitation of Defence technologies. An example is CMTEK Pty Ltd, a joint venture set up in 1988 with BHP Venture Investments Pty Ltd and Innovation Management Pty Ltd to develop cadmium mercury telluride materials for infrared sensor applications, with the backing of a Government Industry Research and Development grant. (k) Pacific Aviation (A' asia) Ltd, the joint venture company partner, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd. According to the records of the National Companies and Securities Commission, seven million issued shares of Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd are held in equal amounts (viz 3.5 million each) by Consolidated Press Holdings Limited and Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd. (1) There are no other shareholders in Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd, however the assets of the company are subject to a fixed and floating charge to the Commonwealth Bank. (m) Details of all of the companies in which Sir Peter Abeles and Mr Kerry Packer have an interest are not readily available to the Department of Defence. Details of contracts awarded by the Defence Contracting Organisation to Pacific Aviation (A' asia) Ltd, Consolidated Press Holdings Limited and Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd on the basis of confined tenders are provided below. The Department does not have access to information concerning contracts arranged by other Commonwealth decom- partments. In addition, smaller value and less complex contracts may have been placed directly on these companies by user areas of the Department of Defence; however, there is no centralised database of this information.

(a) It provides administrative support equal to 14 February 1991 about 0.1 person years which includes appointment of board members, tabling of reports, policy-related matters, budget - related matters, payments relating to the Australian Time Assigncompanies on the basis that ment Committee and payments to the Board. they were the only ones capable of meeting the re- (b) The AA TB will receive $250 000 over the quirement. period 1991 to 1993 from an Australian Research Council Research Infrastructure Cooperative Grant for enhancement of the Anglo-Australian telescope. (3) The Australian time on the Anglo-Australian Telescope is mainly taken up by researchers from Australian universities. In 1989-90 the Australian National University's Mt Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories received 42% of the Australian time on the telescope with other Australian universities receiving 32°It,. The CSIRO Division of Astrophysics reccivcd about 5%. The Chair of the AATB is Dr RH Fratcr, Dircctor, Institute of Information Science and Engincering, CSIRO. (4) The Department's science related activities are included in the Education, Employment and Training portfolio because they rclatc to science education at school, TAFE or highcr cducation or because they relate to rcsearch or rcsearch training undertaken by highcr cducation institutions. At the higher education levcl the Dcpartment provides support for rcscarch infrastructurc and research training though institution's operating grants and supports the rcscarch undcrtaken at the Institute of Advanced Studics at the Australian National University. Through the Australian Research Council programs, the Department provides research grants, research infrastructure support, research scholarships and fcllowships and provides funding for special research ccntrcs and key centres of teaching and research. Total support for research and research training providcd through the Department is in cxcess of $700 million per annum. (5) Consideration was givcn to the most appropriate location from both a policy and an administrative perspective of certain science rclated programs administered by the former Department of Science. Those considerations are reflected in the Administrative Arrangements Orders issued in July 1987. (6) ""Science"" is inextricably an essential clcment of the education and rescarch policies for which this portfolio is responsiblc. Bureau of Meteorology (Question No. 759) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) Does the Bureau of Meteorology suffer from any (a) perceived or (b) real difficulties in respect of the condition or future effectiveness of its equipment or other infrastructure. (2) Have any such difficulties been investigated; if so, (a) in what areas and (b) in what items of equipment or infrastructure do they exist. (3) In what ways (a) does or (b) could such difficulties affect the Bureau's activities, including research. (4) What interaction takes place between the Bureau and the CSIRO's Division of Atmospheric Physics. (5) Where do the Bureau's and the Division's acti vities overlap. (6) Has the potential for greater collaboration between the Bureau and the Division been examined; if not, will it be examined. (7) Is there scope for more collaboration in terms of equipment sharing and joint research projects; if so, in what areas.",177
249,Mrs KELLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) Yes. (2) Yes, the matter has been under virtually constant review since the late 1970s. (a) The Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) completed a major independent revicw of the Bureau's equipment needs in 19R2 which led to the formal initiation of a reequipment program for the Bureau. The program was accelerated in 1986-87 following a review of progress by ASTEC in 1985. Since then, there have been further external reviews of progress of the program (e.g. Annual Reports of the Meteorology Policy Committee to Parliament, and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure's Inquiry into Meteorological Scrvices in 1987). Another formal internal review of progress with the program is scheduled for late 1991 under the provisions of Department of Finance's Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP). (b) The purpose of this re-equipment program is to rcdress a major rundown of the Bureau's basic equipment (observations and communications networks, computers, radars etc) which became accentuated during the 1970s due to protracted funding restrictions and major changes in technological capability. (3) (a) Outdated equipment limits the efficiency and effectiveness of the Bureau through highcr operating costs (e.g. maintenance and consumables) than would otherwise be the case and an inability to take full advantage of technological capabilities in terms of improved services. (b) Old technology and inadequate resources in the Bureau's observational networks are still placing significant limits on the quality of the national climate record, and with it the ability to conduct research on a variety of climate change issues. (4) Interaction between the Bureau and the CSIRO Division of Atmosphcric Rcscarch (DAR-formcrly Division of Atmospheric Physics) is primarily on meteorological research issues. There is frequent interaction at the individual scicntist level, joint review meetings of scientific programs and occasional joint research projccts. (5) Thcre is a formally agrced division of responsibility between the rescarch activities of the Bureau and those of CSIRO. This division is aimed at ensuring that the respective programs ren;tain complementary. (6) Yes. The potential to collaborate has been examined by the Bureau and CSIRO most recently in the context of the modelling of future climates under the influence of increased greenhouse gases. (7) The scope for added collaboration is not large because of the separate and complementary roles of the Bureau and CSIRO in meteorological research. The organisations already jointly participate in some major research projects and field programs. ANU Centre for Mathematical Analysis (Question No. 784) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: . (1) What is the extent of the grant made to the Australian National University's Centre for Mathematical Analysis. (2) Over what period will the grant be effective. (3) Which individuals conducted the interviews as a preliminary evaluation of the Centre's status. (4) What was the status of the individuals referred to in part (3) when interviews were conducted. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Over $4.5 million as a Special Research Centre and $440,000 subsequently. (2) The Centre for Mathematical Analysis was funded by the Commonwealth as a Special Research Centre for a maximum period of nine years, from 1982 to 1990. Transitional funding of $440,000 will be provided over three years from 1991 to assist the researchers at the Centre to continue their work. (3) During the 1990 selection process for new Special Research Centres, interviews were conducted with the principal researchers at the Centre in connection with the Centre's application for continuing support. The selection panel members were Dr D Beanland, Professor M Brennan and Professor A Street (Director of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology; the then Head, Department of Physics, University of Sydney and Deputy Chair of the Higher Education Council; and Professor of Mathematics, University of Queensland, respectively). (4) When interviews were conducted the individuals referred to in (3) were Ministerially-appointed members of the Institutional Grants Committee, an advisory body to the Australian Research Council with responsibility for the Special Research Centres program. Passenger Motor Vehicle Industry (Question No. 787)",181
250,Mr MCARTHUR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) Are unemployed former employees of the passenger motor vehicle industry being channelled into retraining programs to conceal massive unemployment in the industry while precluding other equally deserving unemployed persons from retraining. (2) Are the Government's policies with respect to the passenger motor vehicle industry causing further unemployment in motor vehicle support industries. (3) Has the majority of Labour Adjustment Training Arrangements (LATA) funding of grants to enable unemployed persons to become accredited to work in the aircraft industry been redirected to the retraining of unemployed former employees of the passenger motor vehicle industry; if so, (a) why and (b) are unemployed persons from the various motor vehicle industries being denied the opportunity to become aircraft accredited and seek employment with AeroSpace Technologies of Australia. (4) Is LATA funding for retraining in the aerospace industry being denied to unemployed workers from industries other than the passenger motor vehicle industry; if so, why. (5) Has the Commonwealth Employment Service been directed to give preference to persons recently retrenched from the passenger motor vehicle industry when recommending for vacancies; if so, why. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the Prime Minister's Economic Statement of 12 March 1991, a major package of assistance to retrenchees from the passenger motor vehicle (PMV) industry was announced. The Passenger Motor Vehicle Labour Adjustment Package (PMV LAP) is designed to assist those individuals who are retrenched from the PMV industry by providing retraining and employment opportunities. The PMV LAP, however, does not preclude other unemployed persons from retraining as the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) already provides a comprehensive range of assistance measures for its other clients. (2) No, any unemployment in the motor vehicle support industries can be attributed to the current economic downturn. Retrenchees from PMV component manufacturers are eligible for assistance under the PMV LAP. (3) The Labour Adjustment Training Arrangements (LATA) program is an assistance program which allows retrenchees from the PMV industry to undertake formal vocational training. LATA has been available to retrenchees for the PMV industry since May 1984, but as of 1 February 1991, has been replaced by the PMV LAP. Both LATA and the PMV LAP are administered by the Office of Labour Market Adjustment (OLMA). LATA funding has not been redirected to allow PMV retrenchees to become accredited to work in the aircraft industry. A separately funded OLMA package of assistance to the Geelong area enabled 94 local jobseekers to undertake a course for placement at the AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Aircraft Services (ASTAAS). Of the 94 participants, 64 (68%) were from the PMV industry and component part manufacturers. (4) No, 30 (32%) participants on the retraining course for ASTAAS are from industries other than PMV. (5) No, the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) has not been directed to give preference to persons recently retrenched from the passenger motor vehicle industry when filling vacancies. The CES endeavours to fill its vacancies with the most suitable applicants according to employer needs. Rockin Robin (Question No. 792) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) Has a full report on the loss of the vessel Rockin Robin and its crew been prepared by the Department of Transport and Communications; if so, does the report cover the activities of the Federal Sea Safety Centre and the Air Search and Rescue units; if not, why not. (2) When will the report be presented to Parliament.",182
251,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes; (2) The report was presented to the House of Representatives on 18 October 1990. SARSAT Program (Question No. 793) Mr JulJ asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) What arrangements have been made for Australia to join the SARSAT program. (2) When will the system be fully available for use in Australia. . (3) What is the cost of joining SARSAT. (4) What costs would be borne by aviation and maintenance operators in Australia to use SARSAT facilities.",183
252,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Executive Council approval has been given for Australia to join the COSP AS/SARSAT system as a designated Ground Segment Provider. (2) The system has been fully available for use in Australia since October 1989. A Local User terminal located at Alice Springs is connected by computer to the control unit in the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Canberra. (3) The cost of joining COSPAS/SARSAT as a Ground Segment Provider is US$10,000 per annum. (4) The only costs associated with the use of the system are the costs of fitting and maintenance of a satellite compatible Electronic Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) for maritime use and Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) for aviation use. Vietnam Veterans (Question No. 836) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 16 May 1991: (1) Has his attention been drawn to concerns expressed by the National Office of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia about changes in the level of counselling available to veterans. (2) Has he or his Department reneged on promises made to Vietnam veterans; if not, what is the situation. Mr Humphreys-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) No. We have always promised that there will be an appropriate level of staffing. In the period from 1988 until 1990 the base level of staffing of the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service was increased from 35.2 to 49. This included an additional 10 positions to carry out outreach activities for the service. In August 1990 the staffing level of the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Servide was reduced to 47. This reduction was comparable in percentage terms to the average reduction applied across the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I am prepared to examine any urgent proposals for additional resources that may be put forward by the Counselling Service.",183
