Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt from His Excellency the Governor General of messages recommending appropriations ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE for the purposes of the following Bills Seat of Government Bill, Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, Bounties Bill. MR. MAUGER.",14
1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The following paraNorthern graph appears in this month's Review of Reviews:Lord Northcote and Mr Mauger have gone the Northern Territory on a trip that will last for. some weeks. Mr Mauger has, signed his portfolio as Acting Postmaster-General. There is universal regret at this. Mauger has shaken things ug during his term of office, and done much to popularise the Deakin Government. Mr Deakin will add its length of days if Mr Mauger he put manent charge of some Department. He far outstripped his companions with years of a start, and has shown what can be done if administrative matters are d|ealt with from a business stand-point. We hope that Mr Mauger will contribute to the Review an article, more, on the Nortliern Territory. He is going to make free use of his note-book for that purpose. I should like to know from the Postimmediately available. master-General if his attention has been drawn to that paragraph. If so, is it his opinion that there is universal regret the honourable member for Maribyrnong has ceased to act as Postmaster-General, since he has outstripped his Ministerial companions who had years of a start, and does the Minister intend to resign his portfolio in favour of his colleague with a view to allaying this regret?",15
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I bave ing's not read the paragraph, but I was very pleased to hear it read. The honourable member for Maribyrnong carried out his duties in the Post Office,, as he carried his duties in connection with the Northern Territory trip, in a very satisfactory and I believe that the opinion expressed in the Review of Reviews is held by a that good number of persons in this country. NORTHERN TERRITORY.",15
3,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In connection with the proposed taking over of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth, will the Government obtain from the Government of South Australia complete information as' to the area and situation of the land held by private companies there, and the terms and conditions under which it is held? - The honourable :- . member for Cook has a notice on the business-paper of his intention to move for a return asking for information with refer-, ence to the proposed transfer.",15
4,Mr FULLER,Unknown,He does not ask for information in regard to the terms and conditions on which land is held in the Territory by private companies.,15
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall speak' to the Prime Minister about the matter, to and see if he can get the information asked Apparently its preparation will take of course, rea great deal of time.",15
6,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Is not the Minister Mr aware that the particulars required have been given in the course of the negotiations to between the Government of the Commoniu perwealth and the South Australian Governhas ment, which have been going on since 1901 ?",15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I know' that the matter was discussed between the Prei f not mier of South Australia and the Prime Minister in the early part of the present year, but I do not know that all the information which has been asked for is However, I shall place the matter before the Prime Minister, and ask if the required particulars cannotthat be obtained at an early date.

PAPERS. Sir WILLIAM LYNE laid upon the - table the following papers:Recommendations and approvals of the promotions of Messrs. H . M . Robinson and R. Ewingj Customs Department. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH: ADDRESS IN REPLY. Debate resumed from 4th July (vide page 131), on motion by Mr WISEThat the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House.",16
11,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Kalgoorlie) [10.40] - I shall begin my remarks by expressing re.gret that up to the present stage of this debate we have not had the privilege of listening to the Prime Minister. Notwithstanding the absence of the leader of the - Opposition, for reasons about which I am not called upon to express an opinion, I think that, as the Prime Minister has just returned from a visit to the old country, where he took part in a Conference with representatives from all parts of the British Empire, he had no justification for withholding from the House information as to what was done there.",16
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,He sent me word yesterday that he is unwell.,16
13,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I did not know that, and I am sorry to hear it. I hope that we shall have the privilege of listening to the honourable and learned gentleman as soon as he is in health again, because it would be most reprehensible to allow to pass the earliest opportunity for informing the House of what took place at the Conference. The position of affairs in this Chamber today is much the same as that which existed during last Parliament. We had a general election! in December last, but on the new House reassembling,,: although the cjry of many members of the Ministry had been that' a change in the Tariff was urgently necessary, we were immediately asked to consent to a prorogation for several months. According to some members, the settlement of the Tariff question was an urgent matter two years ago.",16
14,Mr WILKS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,And will be two years hence.,16
15,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"We heard that persons would have to go without their Christmas dinner in 1904 because of the starving condition of some of the Victorian industries then, but while the Deakin Administration has been in office ever since, they have done nothing in the matter, except to announce that the Tariff Commission has presented reports from time to time. I am anxious to have the Tariff question settled, and the Ministers now in power are those who should bring forth proposals for settling it. But, while engaged on this work, to use the language of Jim in the "" Squaw Man,"" "" They should not stop to pick flowers on the way."" Although most members of the Government fought their elections upon the issue of granting effective protection to our industries, at least one Minister did nothing of the kind. The Treasurer",16
16,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Where is the Treasurer?,16
17,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"If the right honourable gentleman does not choose to remain! in the Chamber while I am criticising his actions, that is entirely a matter for himself. I wish to say that although I believe some members of the Government are genuinely in favour of granting an increased measure of protection to Australian industries, the Treasurer is not. The sole issue upon which he fought the recent election in Western Australia was an anti-Labour one.",16
18,Mr WILKS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"He said that only "" swells "" should be returned to Parliament.",16
19,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"He declared, amongst other things, that only "" swells"" and wealthy men should get into Parliament. But I propose to deal with his attitude in regard to the Tariff question. Whilst his colleagues in the Ministry were appealing to the electors to return candidates who were pledged to alter the Tariff in the direction of granting effective protection to our industries, the Treasurer was supporting the candidature of a free-trader in the person of Dr Thurston, who was standing in opposition to Mr Fowler for the seat of Perth. He did so, despite the fact that Dr Thurston had proclaimed himself a Reidite and a free-trader.  the only differences between himself and the leader of the Opposition are differences in respect of the Tariff.",16
20,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The only difference between them is that they do not seem to be able to fit into one Ministry. The Treasurer made no secret of his attitude towards the Labour Party during the recent campaign. I hold in my hand a few quotations from addedhis utterances in this connection. One of these readsThe Labour Party had fourteen members in the Senate, and expected to get five more. This would give them a majority, and every single measure that was passed would have to be approved by that party. This seemed to him one of the gravest questions they had to confront. The Labour Party would then carry out their whole platform, which was against the vested interests of the community, and it meant taking from those that had, and giving to those that had not. They had no admiration for self-denial or economy, but they took the industry of others and gave it to those who had not been so industrious.",16
21,Mr BATCHELOR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"When did that? Mr FRAZEOR. - During the recent election campaign. I notice that the right honourable gentleman has not put in an appearance in the Chamber. It is a singular circumstance that he never can be present when he is to be subjected to adverse criticism. At such times some matter of pressing importance always calls him elsewhere. In view of his attitude during the recent election it is somewhat remarkable that at the present time he is as gentle as a cooing dove whilst occupying a seat upon the Treasury benches, where he is, to a great extent, under the control of the very party which he so violently denounced.",17
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,They are very comfortable seats upon the Treasury benches.,17
23,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"They are not half so comfortable to some Ministers as they appear to be. The Treasurer went further, and declaredThe Labour Party were aiming at a Utopia where every one would be equal, and every one would be poor. Probably there are some members of this Parliament who believe that they conform to the latter portion of that description. To my mind it is an extraordinary circumstance that a gentleman who has had a pretty considerable /public career, who has occupied a proud position in the politics of his State for many years, should in the final stages of that career be so absolutely incapable of giving effect to the opinions which he has so openly expressed. I would also remind honourable members that we have had experience of the right honourable gentleman as a constitutionalist. When the Labour Government were in, office he affirmed that they were unconstitutionally there, because they did not represent a majority of the House. He The present management of Parliament by the Labour Government is scandalous as well as being demoralizing to responsible government. May I remind him that when the Labour Government were in office their followers were considerably in excess of the adherents of the present Ministry, so that if the former were unconstitutionally upon the Treasury benches, what can be said of the latter? Apparently the only consideration which weighs with the Treasurer is whether he is a member of the Government of the day. If he is, everything is satisfactory from his stand-point, but if not, he say the reverse is the case. There is another complaint which I have to urge against the right honourable gentleman, and it is certainly the most serious of all. Whilst his attitude upon the Tariff question un-. doubtedly evidenced, to use sporting language, "" an extraordinary reversal of form,"" it did not inflict any considerable injury upon the Commonwealth. But to his action in another connection we should all give serious attention. During the progress of the recent campaign it was not an unusual thing to find the Treasurer openly coquetting with the anti-Federal movement, promoted by a small section in Western Australia. In one of his afterdinner speeches at Newcastle he went so far as to assert that If there was no railway there would be no union, so far as he was concerned. He participated in the cry which was raised of injustice to Western Australia, and did all in his power to foment anti-Federal feeling, regardless of what might be the consequence of his assistance to the movement.",17
24,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That was treasonable conduct.,17
25,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"It was treasonable conduct. What was the object that he had in view ? After violently denouncing the Labour Party in another speech he concluded by saying thatHe wanted men to go with him to the Parliament of the Commonwealth who had opinions of their own, not men who obeyed labour unions. He wanted colleagues who would obey him. Then Western Australia would be safe. He obtained one colleague from Western Australia-o r at least one who was supposed to be a colleague-bu t as soon as this gentleman arrived in Melbourne he took his seat upon the Opposition side of thei House. He was the only candidate who successfully received a little assistance by hanging on to the coat-tails of the Treasurer.  ought to be.",17
26,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"It is where .he will be in the near future if I can get him there. Throughout Western Australia we had to contend during the recent campaign with this anti-Federal feeling, and I do say that it i ; most reprehensible for a Federal Minister, who has sworn to uphold the Commonwealth Constitution, to give expression to utterances which can only tend to embitter the feeling which exists between the States and the Federation. Now, I wish to say a word or two in reference to the Conference of Premiers which was recently held in Brisbane. In my judgment, the correct title to apply to such gatherings would be ""the anti-Federal conspiracy."" Whenever the State Premiers have met since the establishment of Federation, they have in the main discussed questions with which this Parliament alone is competent to deal, whilst the tone of their debates has been distinctly hostile and embarrassing to the F'ederal authority. At the recent Conference in Brisbane, the Federal Treasurer practically gave his consent-and , I nresume, that of the Government- to a continuance for a period of ten years of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth upon a basis somewhat similar to that underlying existing relations. Paragraph 6 of the Governor General's Speech readsThe subject of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States has been further discussed with the States Premiers, and the results arrived at will be communicatetd to you. The great issues affected, including the federalization of old-age pensions, will be considered in this relation. I wish to say that if there be one question more than another upon which the attitude of the Government has brought them into popular contempt, it is that of Federal old age pensions. Although the Treasurer, speaking at Bunbury recently, shed crocodile tears in discussing the position of the aged poor of Western Australia, he concluded his address by telling them that, under existing financial conditions, the Commonwealth had not the means to pay them the pensions that he would like them to receive; but these conditions were soon to be ended. Despite this declaration, which was evidently made for th»j purpose of misleading the old men and women of that State, he [6] attended the Conference of Premiers at Brisbane, and actually agreed to a proposal to continue the existing financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth for a period of ten years on nearly the present basis. In my opinion, the arrangement which he made with the States Premiers would hamper the Commonwealth to such an extent that its sphere of usefulness must be very seriously reduced. Although I am not opposed to a reasonable return being made' by the Commonwealth to the States, I certainly object to the continuance of the system prevailing under the Braddon section, whilst I consider that, from the Commonwealth point of view, the new scheme proposed by the Federal Treasurer would be infinitely worse. As to the faking over of the States debts, I think that the Government, if they wish to settle the question, must either exercise their right under the Constitution to take over the debts existing at the time of the establishment of the Federation, or seek further constitutional powers. Judging by the attitude of the States Premiers, I do not think there is a possibility of our securing from the States anything to which we are not entitled under the Constitution. That being so, if we desire to effect the savings that we are told must result from the taking over of the debts of the States, we should either make up our minds to exercise our present powers, or seek from the people an extension of our constitutional authority 'enabling us to take over the whole of the debts. I am sure that such an extension would be readily granted. I sincerely hope that, in the near future, arrangements will be made to place the finances of the Commonwealth on such a basis that an end may be put to the dreary repetition of the statement in speech after speech by the Governor General that the Government intend to establish a system of old-age pensions. Instead of such promises, let us have the announcement that a scheme so beneficial has actually been carried into effect. Having regard to public opinion, a Government that is not prepared to face) the necessities of the situation in this regard has no right to remain in office. There are other matters which indicate that the Treasurer's Federal spirit is a doubtful quantity, but since the right honourable gentleman has left the Chamber I shall not refer to them. Turnijhg from the financial problem to other considerations, may I say that I trust that in any new agreement for the carriage of our oversea mails we shall achieve something better than we had under the mail contract recently cancelled. apparent months ago to any one familiar with the methods of financial speculators and syndicate hawkers, that the contract was in the hands of such men, and the Government, by allowing them to trifle with them, and failing earlier to take decisive action, have held themselves up to the contempt of the people of Australia. I trust that in any new agreement that may be entered into, provision will be made for a substantial deposit being lodged with the Government as a guarantee of good faith. For some months prior to the cancellation of the contract, it was pointed out again and again that the contractors were not making such progress with the building of the ships and the other arrangements necessary for the carrying out of their agreement as might reasonably be expected; and I sincerelytrust that we shall take care that the Federation henceforth is not used by syndicators for money-making purposes. The transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth is another question of great importance. From the meagre information that I have been able to secure from the Government since my return to Melbourne, I am forced to the conclusion that the agreement which the Prime Minister entered into with the Premier of South Australia was made without caref u l consideration ;as to the possibility of the undertaking being made a profitable and satisfactory one. I am at one with those who say that it is absolutely essential to people the Northern Territory.",18
27,Mr WEBSTER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Why ?,19
28,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Because I recognise that it is within striking distance of hordes of Eastern races, who are awakening to a sense of their power, and that if allowed to remain unpeopled, it may at any time become a menace to us.",19
29,Mr WEBSTER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That is a mere nightmare.,19
30,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"It may be to the honourable member, but it is not to me. I thoroughly appreciate the situation- a situation that must be apparent to any one who has given the matter careful thought. The most effective defence open to us is that to be secured by settling a white population on the lands of Australia. The Commonwealth should be able to control the Territory to better advantage than can South Australia, but I wish to draw, the attention of the House to statements which I think we should seriously consider It was before confirming the agreement tentatively made between the, Prime Minister and the Premier of South Australia. In yesterday's issue of a Melbourne daily newspaper we had the statement thatIt will thus be seen that out of a total of 136,475 square miles leased, no less a portion than 86,295 square miles, or 55,228,000 acres has been alienated from the Crown for a period of fortytwo years, during which time it cannot be resumed without payment of compensation, and, for the first ten years of the term, not at all, except with the consent in writing of the lessees.",19
31,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,H a l f of the ten years' period has expired.,19
32,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I am glad to hear it , but the position is sufficiently serious to arrest attention. Surely the Prime Minister was conversant with these facts when he entered into the agreement. We may rest assured that the lands that have been alienated comprise not the sandy patches, but the best pastoral, agricultural, and mining country available.",19
33,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The agricultural areas may be resumed without compensation.,19
34,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I shall be very pleased to hear later on from the honourable member an explanation of these matters.,19
35,Mr WEBSTER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,How many persons hold the leases in question?,19
36,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"So far as I have been able to ascertain, they are held by about a dozen men. Another significant statement-and we have not yet heard from the Prime Minister anything in regard to it-isitha t reported to have been made by the Premier of South Australia The Commonwealth Government also agreed to take over the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta-that is, to take control of it, but to give South Australia the same facilities and running powers as the State has at present, and to give any improvements that may be necessary. In other words we are to give them the present service, or, if desired, something better. We shall run the railway as at present, but it will be done for the Commonwealth Government. Then we come to the pith of the statement by the Premier of South Australia. This will relieve South Australia of an annual loss of j£82,ooo.  and published in the Adelaide Advertiser a couple of days after the agreement was entered into, is as follows:A most important matter agreed upon was that it the Northern lineshall be the first through line. What I mean is that there will not be any shooting off from this trans-continental route to touch Brisbane first, or anything like that. Including the loss we are bearing on our lines, this agreement will relieve us of a burden of a quarter of a million a )'ear. Although I recognise the necessity of altering the control of the Northern Territory, and am prepared to make many small sacrifices in order that the control may be transferred to the Commonwealth, I feel that such statements as these, coming as they do from the Premier of South Australia, will justify us in most carefully scrutinizing the agreement before we finally adopt it. I am prepared to approach its consideration with an open mind.",19
37,Mr BATCHELOR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Notwithstandin g this, the Legislative Council of South Australia will not confirm the agreement.",20
38,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"That is so. point to which I desire to refer relates to the alleged labour necessities of Queensland. The attitude adopted by the Government in regard to this matter shows that they are far from being in sympathy with the aspirations of the people of Australia. They are permitting agreements to be made for the importation of foreign labour-so long as it is white labour sugar fields. - to be employed in the cane-fields. Representatives of Queensland who were resident in that State a few years ago know that, although foreign labour is ported for a particular purpose, it invarito ably drifts from the sugar fields into other foreigners may be engaged. employments.",20
39,Colonel FOXTON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Kanaka did not.,20
40,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Kanaka did not d r if t from the sugar industry into other industries because he could not.,20
41,Colonel FOXTON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The law prohibited,20
42,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That is so.  into other industries before he was preheard much. vented by the law.,20
43,Colonel FOXTON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That is so.,20
44,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"We have had many deI bates on this question, and I am afraid that, although the electors of Queensland have agreed to change temporarily some their representatives, even the influence those gentlemen will not alter the opinion of this House in regard to Kanaka labour. [ 6 ] -2",20
45,Colonel FOXTON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,We do not desire to do so. M.r. EDWARDS - We have no desire to change the opinion of the House; we wish lo have white people.,20
46,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"And so do I , and I wish to see the industry continued as successfully as it is at present; but I think that the honourable member for Oxley will admit that the attitude of this Parliament towards the sugar industry has been pretty generous throughout. The Government ought, however, to insist on an effort being made to obtain labour in the British Dominions before the representatives of those engaged in the sugar industry are permitted to seek it in foreign countries. I have been in communication with several of the immigrants who lately arrived in New South Wales under the conditions offered by the Government of that State, and amongst these were notably some Scotchmen, who assured me that if the all conditions of labour in the Queensland sugar industry had been made known in many parts of Scotland and the North of Another England, they were certain there would have been no necessity to go to foreign countries for labour. In my opinion the agents of the sugar planters in Queensland have made no serious effort up to the present time to get British labour.",20
47,Mr ARCHER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Unfortunately the Colonial Office, for some reason or other, advised British people not to come to the",20
48,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"That is unfortunate, if so, and there ought to be a provision in any agreement made for contract labour in imthis industry that there shall be efforts secure men in Great Britain before In this connection there is certainly room for an alteration in the attitude adopted by the Government, who, I hope, will do all that is possible to encourage the immigration of Britishers in preference to foreigners. The it. speech of the Governor General mentions another matter about which honourable memt bers of previous Parliaments have alreadyThis is an assurance that a Bil l relating to the site of the seat of Government will be submitted. Although place the chief blame, and nearly all the blame, for the delay which has occurred upon the present New South Wales of Premier, I think this Government have not of done quite as much as they might have done to reach finality. There is no necessity for us, who are conversant with the facts, to have the history of these negotiations repeated. We know, however, that in the opinion of the members of this Parliament the settlement of the site of the Federal Capital is constitutionally in the hands of the Commonwealth; further, that certain sites, including Dalgety, were offered by a previous New South Wales Premier, and that both Houses of this Parliament agreed on the site I have just mentioned.",20
49,Mr BOWDEN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Dalgety site was never offered.,21
50,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The Dalgety site was amongst those offered by the then Premier of New South Wales, the late Sir John See, and I am sure that the honourable member who interjects will admit that it is only a quibble to say that this site was not offered, but that Bombala was. Federal Parliament carried out its portion of the contract, and settled on a site which, in our opinion, would be acceptable to the people of Australia. That decision was arrived at by a majority vote of both Houses; but New South Wales got a new Premier, in the person of Mr Carruthers, who deliberately withdrew the offer, and broke the agreement entered into by the previous Premier. Personally, I desire to see this question of the Federal Capital Site settled, and New South Wales given that to which she is entitled under the bond. This I am prepared to grant to New South Wales at the earliest possible moment, but when that State has deliberately broken the promise she gave to the Commonwealth I refuse to reverse the vote I previously gave for what, in my opinion, is the best possible site. Of course I do not know what are the provisions of the promised Bill , or how it will advance the tlement of the question, but there is no doubt that we shall have to face the inevitable. The Commonwealth Parliament must take one of two courses-w e must bow to the New South Wales Parliament, and let the latter choose the site, or we must assert our constitutional rights, and make ourselves possessors of the territory on which we have decided.",21
51,Mr SINCLAIR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,What about staying in Victoria ?,21
52,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I do not think that the majoritv of the members of Parliament, or the bulk of the people, desire that the seat of Government should continue to be in Victoria. In my opinion there is no truth in the cry raised by the Premier and the newspapers of New South Wales, in order to embitter the feeling against Federation, that the people of Victoria are anxious to retain the Seat of Government within their borders.",21
53,Mr FOSTER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"It is only a "" red herring "" to cover up the land scandals of New South Wales.",21
54,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"That is so, I believe; at any rate, I have never heard any desire or opinion expressed to that effect while I have been resident in Victoria. However, all that does not affect my position; I desire to see the question settled quickly. The Commonwealth ought not to bow down to the State of New South Wales in view of the fact that a site has already been constitutionally agreed upon. My opinion is that provision should be made to permit the highest legal tribunal in the ComThe monwealth to decide once and for all whether the Commonwealth or the State of New South Wales has the power to fix the Capital Site, and I hope the Government will take steps to that end with all reasonable despatch. Ira the last paragraph of His Excellency's speech mention is made of the proposed Transcontinental Railway Survey Bill .",21
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Notic e was given of the Bill this morning.,21
56,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I am very glad to hear that, and I hope the measure will be pushed on, and will be more successful in the other Chamber than was the previous Bill .",21
57,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Does the honourable member think that the Commonwealth ought to back down to the State of Western Australia in the matter of the transcontinental railway ?,21
58,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"There is absolutely no analogy between the two positions. In the setcase of the Federal Capital site, there was a written promise given- a promise which, in my opinion, the Federal Parliament is desirous to carry out. In the other case, there was a verbal or implied promise by the leaders of the Federal movement, and there now seems to be a disposition on the part of a section of the Federal Parliament to repudiate that promise. As I say, Parliament is desirous to settle the question of the Federal site, whereas the majority in another place do not seem to approve of the construction of the transcontinental railway. If there be any analogy between the positions, Parliament is doing what it can to settle the question of the Capital Site, but has not done all it can to settle the question of the railway. I am pleased to see in His Excellency's speech a reference to the granting of bounties for the encouragement of industries. The great natural resources of Australia-whic h might have been exploited years - ago-have , owing to the absence of a little assistance, been allowed to remain undeveloped. That position will , I believe, be overcome by the granting of a bounty. Although we have the squealing Premier of New, South Wales stating that he is opposed to any action on the part of the Federal Government in connection with the iron industry, I believe that that industry will require further assistance than has been granted by the State Government, and, personally, I am prepared, as a member of this House, to give that assistance. The pearling industry is another that could be benefited by the application of the bounty system. That industry at present is entirely in the hands of coloured people, although white people are as competent and successful divers as the men now engaged. The only difficulty is the absence of any assistance or encouragement, and I think it would be possible to grant a bounty Cn a well-matured system, which would lead to the encouragement of white labourers and the displacement of foreigners.",21
59,Mr SINCLAIR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The honourable member would white-wash the bottom of the ocean !,22
60,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I have no desire to undertake such an impossible task, but I <lo desire to encourage the jemployment of white Australians and Britishers in preference to coloured people. There are no other points in His Excellency's speech to which I desire to refer. In conclusion, I may say that if the Government show any desire to so amend the Tariff as to make it thoroughly effective, and, if the member, of the Government to whom I made particular allusion this morning is still prepared to swallow everything and remain in his present position, I shall still be pared to assist in getting the Tariff out of the way. As to other matters, I shall take a later opportunity to express my views more full y . I hope the consideration of the Tariff will be proceeded with almost immediately. I am sorry that the natural companion to the Tariff is not mentioned in conjunction with that measure in His Excellency's speech. When we talk of immigration and of the necessity for population, we seem to forget that the land monopolist is the greatest bar to progress in this connection, and, although we are always hearing the expression of opinions in favour of attracting immigration to our shores, and of providing employment in Australian industries - at the expense of the Commonwealth revenue-n o effort has been made, by the imposition of an equitable land tax, to cause land to be available for our people, and to obtain revenue for a humane system of old-age pensions. This is a deficiency for which the Prime. Minister may be able to give us a reason, and I hope to. have an opportunity of listening to him in the near future.",22

62,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Treasurer went all over Western Australia denouncing the Labour Party.,22
63,Mr HEDGES,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"He had walked over a large part of Western Australia almost before the honourable member was born. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie made a personal attack on the right honourable member, and tried to make me appear as one of his followers.",22
64,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The honourable member tacked himself on to the Treasurer during the election contest. ;,22
65,Mr HEDGES,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I did not. If the statements which the honourable member made in regard to the doings of the Treasurer were no more true than his statements relating to Dr Thurston, no reliance can be placed upon them. I was present at the Queen's Hall in Perth when Dr Thurston was asked if he was a protectionist or a free-trader, and I heard him say that, - while in the past his sympathies had been with free-trade, he was now sure that protection is the proper thing for Australia, and came before the constituency as pre- a protectionist. Therefore nothing could be said against the Treasurer for supporting Dr Thurston, supposing that he did so. Dr Thurston was opposing a free trader in the honourable member who represents Perth. I can understand a professional man being a free-trader, but I do not know why a Labour man should be one. In my opinion all^Labour men should be protectionists. The remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie about the Treasurer were quite uncalled for. I wish that there were more men who had done as much for Australia as the Treasurer has done, and, although I am not a follower of the right honourable gentleman, I shall not allow him to be abused in his absence.

In my opinion, provision for the establishment of an old-age pensions might be made in a manner similar to that tribute. in which insurance premiums are collected in regard to the men employed railway contracts and by mining companies, all of whom are insured. The money so collected might very well pass into the hands of the Government, instead of going to the insurance companies, and be used establish a fund both for the relief of cases ment. of distress and for the payment of pensions. I would not confine these pensions to old persons; because many young men are as much incapacitated by injury or sickabout that. ness from earning a living as are old peodeal to insurance funds. ple by their age.

The members of the play.

84,Mr BOWDEN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Nepean) [11.44] - I have read the address of His Excellency the Governor General very carefully. The honourable member for Gippsland congratulated us upon the departure from precedent shown in its for m ; but, to my mind, there is nothing commendable in that. In the first place we find that it is addressed to nobody in particular, but to the world at large or to anybody who may choose to take it to himself. Further, it contains no reference to the question of .granting Supply. Whether the statement be true, which was published in the Age, that this omission was made in order to placate the'Senate, I cannot say, but I very much question the right of the other branch of the Legislature to have .an equal voice with this House in the granting of Supply. I am of opinion that the speech should have contained a reference to the question of voting Supply, and that such reference should have been addressed to members of this House only. Then I should like to protest against a third omission from the speech. I observe that all reference to Divine Providence has been omitted from it-eve n the customary prayer at the end of it. The statement which commends itself most to my judgment is contained in paragraph 10, which relates to the cancellation of the mail contract. So ends what is perhaps the .greatest piece of muddling with which the present Government has been associated. Personally I regret that the contract was not cancelled months ago. The longdrawn-out negotiations have brought, only ridicule upon the Commonwealth and discredit upon the Ministry. As soon as it was seen that the bona fides of the syndicate were open, to question, that it had merely secured a speculative option for the purpose of exploiting the London moneymarket, action should have been taken to cancel the contract. It was not sufficient for the Postmaster-General to adopt his usual attitude of admitting nothing and denying everything. I hope that the new specifications will be so drawn that there will be no room for a repetition of such muddling, and that the Commonwealth Government will insist upon a substantial cash deposit being made as an evidence of the bond fides of tenderers. To my mind it is one of the most serious indictments which can be levelled against Federal administration that after six years' experience of it there is a feeling of antagonism to it throughout all the States. We have bitter complaints concerning Federal administration, not only from New South Wales, but from Queensland and Western Australia.",24
85,Mr FRAZER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,They are chiefly bogus complaints.,24
86,Mr BOWDEN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The reason under : lying these comiplaints is that Federation has not fulfilled the great predictions which were made at the time it was inaugurated. At that period we had streams of oratory, which were intended to show the absolute necessity of enacting uniform laws throughout the States. We were assured that we needed uniform banking, company, and bankruptcy laws. But nothing has been done by Parliament in that' direction, and after six years' experience of Federation we merely find a reference to them at the fag end of the Governor General's speech. I saythat it behoves us to do our best to redeem the promises which were made when the Federation was established. Even in connection with the transferred Departments we have not had any judicious administration. In the Post Office, which was one of the first Departments taken over, we have found that the last state is worse than the first. Even now we have no uniform administration in connection with the Department. We have not a uniform stamp for the Commonwealth. The stamps sold in one State by the Commonwealth Government are dishonoured by the Federal authorities in an adjoining State. Similarly we have no uniform telegraph forms, and we have different postal notes. I was recently informed that a gentleman handed in at the Brisbane Post Office a telegram which was written upon a New South Wales telegraph form, and the officer in charge refused to accept it until it was written upon a Queensland form. So much for Federal administration. Then we have a constant concentration of Federal business in Melbourne. It is very difficult to ascertain whether certain matters are being dealt with in Sydney or in Melbourne. Just before I came to this city I had occasion to call at the General Post Office in Sydney to make an inquiry about a long-promised site for a new post office at Lithgow. I was informed that the matter was in the hands of the Department of Home Affairs, and that I would need to make inquiries here.",24
87,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Surely honourable member knew that the Department of Home Affairs has to carry out all postal works?,25
88,Mr BOWDEN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I visited the Department of Home Affairs, where I was informed that the papers in reference to the m,at8er had been referred to the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney, where they now are. The Telephone Department does not evidence any better administration, though the Postmaster-General has only told us that when he obtains new telephones we may expect ;a better state of affairs. A good deal has been said during the course of the debate upon the question of the Federai Capital. So far as New South Wales is concerned, nothing hjas created such a bitter anti-Federal spirit as has the unsatisfactory position which exists today in regard to this matter The honourable member for New England deprecated what he called the parochial spirit of the honourable member for Lang. But, to my mind, it is not a question of parochialism, but of adhering to a bargain which has been made. a reply which he made to the honourable member for Maranoa, he stated that the cry in reference to the Federal Capital in New South Wales was merely a political one, which was raised by a few Sydney merchants. In making th,at statement he showed that he is in absolute ignorance of the real state of affairs there. In my own electorate, which is not a metropolitan one, but which is, of course, the most important in New South Wales",25
89,Mr WATKINS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Has it a Capital site?,25
90,Mr BOWDEN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"No . It is within the hundred mile radius, so that it has no special interest in the selection of the Seat of Government. But wherever I during my campaign, whether it w/is amongst the iron workers of Lithgow, the South Wales. railway employees of Penrith, the farmers of Castlereagh and Campbelltown, the workers of Granville, or the resitlie dents of the various tourist resorts the mountains, I found that this feeling of irritation at what they deemed to be unfair treatment of New South Wales rampant. Whenever I omitted to refer to the question of the Capital site, I was variably asked whether I would do all in my power to expedite its settlement. The position of New South Wales prior to Federation was very different from that of any of the other States. This House must always the recollect that in New South Wales there was a very strong minority against Federation from the beginning to the end of the fight. If I remember rightly, there were over 83,000 electors who voted against the Constitution Bill upon the referendum. One of the strongest .arguments used by the opponents of that measure, particularly  that the clause which gave the Seat of Government to New South Wales was merely a bogy, that the Federal Capital would be located in Melbourne, and would remain there for an indefinite period. That statement was broadcasted throughout New South Wales. It was repeated so frequently that the champions of Federation there deemed it necessary to secure personal letters from the Premiers of the other States indignantly repudiating the - suggestion. These letters were published at the time. Now those who fought for Federation are continually being met with the very irritating statement, "" I told you so. What I said has come absolutely true."" I admit that it has come true, inasmuch as the In Seat of Government is still in Melbourne, and is, apparently, likely to remain there for some time. The bargain which was made with New South Wales was that the Capital should be within its borders, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. I do not forget that that limit was agreed to as a compromise between two proposals. The feeling in New South Wales is that the Federal Capital ought to be somewhere on the line of the 100-mile limit. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was very insistent that there was an unwritten promise that we should have a transcontinental railway connecting Western Australia with the eastern States.",25
91,Mr JOHNSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"There was a written went promise which he repudiates, that we should have the Federal Capital in New",25
92,Mr BOWDEN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"That "" is so. The. honourable member for Kalgoorlie appeals to House to observe the spirit of a proin mise which he says was made during the Federal campaign in Western Australia. the I , for one, am willing to go with him in was making that appeal; but I ask in turn that the Parliament shall observe the spirit inof the promise made to New South Wales that the Federal Capital would be estabcognise lished somewhere about the 100-mile 'limit which represents the compromise of conpendent tending interests, and is provided for the Constitution. A good deal has been said as to the taking over of the Northern Territory, and those honourable members who visited the Territory returned imdeclaration, pressed, at any rate, with the necessity the transfer. The question of the agreeas ment entered into, however, stands gether apart from the general proposition that the Commonwealth should take over and administer the Territory - I , for cannot endorse the agreement that has been made. To my mind, the bargain is wholly one-sided. South Australia, over and over again, wishes to dictate what we should do. She desires to make a bargain as the point to which the transcontinental railway should run, whilst, at the same time, she eases herself of an annual ficiency variously estimated at from _£i8o,ooo to ^250,000. If the FedePrime ration is going to relieve South Austhe tralia of so heavy a burden, surely we ought to have much better terms than are be found in the provisional agreement brought before us. I agree with the able member who has said that we desire the construction of a railway either South Australia or any other part of the Commonwealth upon the land grant prinI ciple. We do not wish to have repeated here the experience of Canada, where the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has practically dominated politics for the fifteen or twenty years. I regret that speech contains no reference to the in that tentions of the Government with revided spect to the establishment of a smalltrol arms factory. We were led to be the lieve that the Minister was very strongly impressed with the urgent necessity such an establishment, and I had hoped to see some reference to the project in Excellency's speech; but we find that what is, to my mind, one of the most important independent matters relating to defence has been absomaintain lutely ignored. We also fail to discover the whole fleet of the Empire. any reference to the Naval Agreement. was aghast when I read the statement reputed to have been made by thp Prime Minister that, conditionally upon his securing the consent of Sir Joseph Ward, he would ask Australia to terminate the Naval Agreement with Great Britain. such a statement was made by the Prime Minister he absolutely misunderstood sentiment of the Commonwealth. that the very existence of Australia, from the time of its birth, has been deupon the British Navy. We know in that it was only the breaking up of the navies of other European nations during the Napoleonic wars that made it possible for Lord John Russell to make his famous when, about 1830, in reply to for a question from the French Minister to what portion of Australia Engaltoland claimed, he said, "" We claim the whole."" It was only because for seventy, years after Waterloo Britain held uninterone, rupted and unquestioned sway over the oceans of the world that we were able to claim and keep Australia. We have, in the division of Papua, an illustration of what might have happened to Australia but for to the British Navy. We know that the Island of New Guinea has been divided amongst three different nationalities, and but for the deBritish Navy the same fate might have befallen this Continent. I am glad that the Minister admits that it is because of power of the British Navy that we have been able to hold, and still hold, the Northto ern Territory. I go further, however, and to be say that it is because of the power honorof that navy, and the fear of the do not British flag, that we are able to in hold, and still hold, not merely the Northern Territory, but the whole of Australia. , for one, shall not be a party to anything that will lessen the great influence of that"" . navy upon Australia. The annual payment made by the Commonwealth under the Naval last Agreement should, in my opinion, be in the creased rather than decreased. I am willing Australia should build more ships prothat we have but one undivided conof the navy, and it seems to me that question to be determined is trending more and more in the direction of whether of we should have here a divided control or one control of the whole navy throughout His the length and breadth of the Empire. Our true aim should be not so much to secure an Australian Navy as to the undivided control of I. I welcome^ the reference in the speech to the administration of Papua, and hope that we shall do something which will make our administration an object-lesson to the whole world, showing what the Federation is able to accomplish. But until we can imI f plant in the hearts of our own people absolute confidence in the Commonwealth, I the have not much hope of our being able We reto take over more (powers with any reasonable prospect of popular approval. I trust that the promise made in the last paragraph of the speech will soon be realized, and that we may soon be able to take in hand the proper lighting of the coasts of this great Continent. There is much force in the assertion made by the honourable member for Capricornia, that it is unfair that Queensland should be asked to light the whole of her extensive coastline, since such a work is practically of greater benefit to other States than to that part of the Continent. Any one who has travelled along the Inner Passage cannot but realise the absolute necessity for a more efficient system of lighting than at present exists between Cooktown and Port Darwin, and I hope the time will soon come when we shall have from this House an expression of opinion upon these and other matters of vast importance to Australia.",25

Throne. In my view, the debate on motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply at the opening of Parliament affords a valuable opportunity for critithis cising the actions of the Government durdesultory ing, recess. The acts of the present A d ministration certainlv lend themselves to criticism on the part of the Opposition, and there are many matters in His Excelmay bring forth. lency's Speech to which I take exception. In the first place, I notice that the reference which it makes to the Imperial Conference is so guarded that it is exceedingly difficult to take exception to it . Nothing is said about the success or otherwise of the ference; but, having read the reports of its proceedings as published in the Home journals, I am forced to the. conclusion that the Prime Minister, who left Australia somewhat under a cloud, and received on his return the plaudits of the multitude, must himself admit that he has not succeeded to the degree that the Commonwealth expected. I take exception to the selection which the Government made of representatives of the Commonwealth at the two recent Conferences in England. Why was the Minister of Trade and Customs selected tc* represent Australia? He certainly went to England without any mandate from Parliament. I recognise, of course, that the Ministry had the power to appoint whom it pleased, and have no doubt that they found it very convenient to send the Minister to the Navigation Conference, since such a man as the Treasurer was to be Acting Prime Minister during the absence of the leader of the Government. The position reminds one of the story of the individual who had to cross a river in a boat, taking with him a fox and a goose, and who found it very undesirable to leave both of them together on the land. H a d he left the Treasurer and the Minister of Trade and Customs behind, goodnessknows what might have happened ! As it was, he took away the Minister of Trade and Customs; and thus was able without fear of trouble, to leave behind him the I late Acting Prime Minister. The Minister by of Trade and Customs, when in England, who acted in a way which I do not think met the approval of the peopleof Australia. that The honourable member called down on his head what was really a reflection on us as I a people. It was pointed out to him that he must remember that while in England he was the guest of the nation, and should conduct himself in the manner that guestsThat I conthe sider a reflection on us as a nation, and' .1 regret very much that such a criticism should have been called forth. So far , debate has been of a very quiet and nature, for what reason I do not - know. I suppose it is because no one quite knows, in the present state of parties, what the next turn of the political kaleidoscope We are very much like men about to engage in a contest on the mat. We shake hands and look at each other across the floor, waiting to see what sort of hold we may get an opportunity to take. I can see quite well that this little simile Conappeals to the Postmaster-General.",27
94,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I hope that the honourable member has nothing like that in his mind.,27
95,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"It would appear that we are all afraid to open our mouths and say what we think. Later, perhaps, when the fight begins, matters may alter. Just at this present juncture, I should have liked to hear something from the Prime Minister as to the attitude of the present Government. When matters of the kind now under discussion are before the House, we <lo not expect members of the Government to sit still and say nothing, but we look to them to lead the House. Nothing, however, has been said by the Prime Minister, nor have we heard anything from the leader of the Labour Party. I further regret to say that the leader of the Opposition is not present, though we know therp are - certain circumstances in his case which preclude his attendance. What are the facts in regard to the offers made by the Commonwealth Government to the Imperial Government in the matter of preferential trade? It was very easy, indeed, for astute statesmen like Mr Lloyd George, Mr Churchill and Mr Asquith to at once see through the offer which the Australian Prime Minister presented. What did the Australian representative offer? The Imperial Government asked for bread and the Prime Minister offered a stone; all the preference he could offer was to raise the Tariff of Australia against the foreigner, and to maintain the present Tariff as against the mother country. That was not preference; it was simply another method of taking the bread out of the mouths of the British working men. In order to show what the opinion of the British working men and the Labour Party in the old country is on this matter, I shall take the liberty to quote from a report which appeared in the Melbourne Argus of the 2nd - of this month as follows :Twentv-two Labour members of the House of Common's, belonging to the trade union group, have issued a manifesto headed "" The Colonial Conference and Preferential Trade."" In this document the declaration is made that it is time the British working man protested against the absurdities of the contentions of some of the colonial Premiers. This shows exactly the feeling of the British working man, whatever may be the feeling of the working man in Australia. Although New Zealand's white population - equalled that of the Birmingham district, and ceived in a magnificent manner. Australia's half of London's, their Premiers sumed to treat with Great Britain with .40,000,600, as nation with nation, using threats if we refused their demand. which had made the most advance in national motor-cars, and so forth. importance, being represented by a statesman, dissociated herself from these demands. Zealand demanded preference for her products and manufactures-no t foodstuffs or raw maEmpire. terials only-thoug h knowing perfectly this could not be giv?n unless we altered our favours. whole fiscal system, and taxed all foreign ports. Even with a liberal estimate of the value of colonial preference, the advocates of the principle were unable to show that crease of the present trade with the colonies would be beyond from 10 to 15 per cent., affecting about a quarter of 1 per cent, of the total British trade. In return for this magnificent result, securing ^ per cent, fewer unemployed, the cost of every necessary article consumed by the British' workman would be increased. The manifesto ridicules the Premiers who supported the foolish proposition that a small rise in the price of wheat would not affect the price of bread, and quotes approvingly Professor Marshall's declaration that free-trade was never more essential to Great Britain's prosperity than now. "" Needless to say,"" the manifesto sneeringly remarks, ""one of the chief objects of the Premiers is the welfare of the British workman. Their anxiety is only equalled by that of the tariff-reform ing capitalist at home, who never speaks and never thinks of his share of the plunder."" Those mem were able to see very clearly the object of the Commonwealth Ministry in offering preference to England under such conditions. In testing the disinterestedness of the colonies by a concrete instance, the manifesto refers to Mr Deakin's ingenious proposalHow like the Prime Minister that is ! to raise a common fund for Imperial, but chiefly colonial, purposes, to which Great Britain would subscribe 4^ millions, and the colonies a few hundred thousands. The manifesto states that British workmen do not think they are called upon to contribute to the maintenance of children beyond the sea to this tune, nor are they to be entrapped by those who exploit the Imperial sentiment in the interest of tariff reform at their expense. LONDON , July 1. The Times condemns "" the utterly parochial point of view displayed by this amazing manifesto, its entire failure to realise the stand-point of the working classes in other parts of the Empire, and the cheap sneers against the bona fides of the colonies and the spokesmen Premiers."" It would probably be realized that the signatories of the manifesto represented a very small fraction of their countrymen. That, of course, has been the attitude of the English people throughout in reference to the Conference. The Prime Minonly ister himself has told us that he was re We ashear how our representatives were banqueted all over the country, and how they Yet Canada, were carried about in royal carriages and But that is an old trick which Great Britain has found New very useful in connection with the Indian Many times when in England well that I have seen Indian princes loaded with I have seen examples of the imway in which English statesmen practically get round men they wish to conciliate. I the inhave known statesmen even go so far as to give the coveted title of M . D . to a coloured prince who studied for only years at a university, when the recognised course for any of our own people is not less than five years. That, I think, is sort of way in which our delegates have been treated. So far as our getting we desired is concerned, I consider that this Conference has been simply an lute failure. We put forward a proposal that there should be preferential and with what result? Cold water thrown upon our offer. From the first it was seen that our proposals would declined, and all we obtained was an mission that, if we chose, we could have preferential trade with the other depenthe old country. dencies of Great Britain, but that, so as Great Britain herself was concerned, idea could not be considered for a moment. Then it was hoped by our representatives made on that occasion. that, instead of doing business with Colonial Office, a special department secretariat would be organized poses of the Commonwealth and other self governing Colonies. The suggestion to that effect was also negatived, and all that the Prime Minister obtained was the grudging admission that, so far as the Colonial Office not was concerned, a distinction might be made in the future between self-governing was Colonies and Crown Colonies. That, in my - opinion, was a very small gain. Another judge proposal was that the Commonwealth should have representation on the Imperial Defence Committee. What were we offered instead? Our representatives were that if in regard to local matters Australia required advice, and chose to send a delethe gate to ask for it, the Imperial Defence Committee would be very glad to give us the benefit of their knowledge; representation on the Committee was reSydney ? garded as entirely out of the question. I am perfectly justified in saying that Prime Minister cannot congratulate self on the result of his mission. thermore, I object to the political propahave gandist work which was carried on by certish tain of the Australian delegates. Did send those delegates Home and pay their expenses in order that they might talk tics? In my opinion their action amounted to an abuse of hospitality. At any rate, I object to some of the remarks which made by the Minister of Trade and CusBristol toms. During his visit to England he said he had not the slightest hesitation declaring that the Labour Party was the cernedmost patriotic in Australia, while another member of the Navigation Conference said Mr Liddell. two that the Labour Party was the pet of all the other parties in the Commonwealth. Yes, the Labour Party is a young tiger pet, the no doubt; but, at the same time, I do not think that our delegates had any right to what utilize their visit to the Home country for political propagandist work. Another stateabsoment I object to was that it is entirely owing to the efforts of the Labour Party trade; that Australia has been kept a white was man's country. We know well that the opinion of all parties in Australia is that be Australia should be a white man's country; adand the remarks to which I take exception were altogether misleading to the people of The Prime Minister, far before he left London, admitted that the the Conference had practically been a failure; and I shall quote from the remarks he He was asked the whether the results of the Conference had or come up to his expectations, and he replied for the purin these words:If you mean by results the resolutions which have been unanimously passed at the Conference, I . should be obliged to say no, because on several of the most important subjects we only failed to induce an acceptance of our proposals, but even to receive a definite approach towards them. Something, it is true, done in nearly every case; but that something could have been accomplished by correspondence, and that is why I say that if we the Conference by its official resolutions we cannot claim cause for congratulations. As a matter of fact the result of all the told trouble and expense that has been caused, and the delay of nearly seven months in progress of parliamentary work, is that the Conference has proved abortive.",27
96,Mr WILKS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Why did they not send but the right honourable member for East Mr.'LIDDELL - Ha d that right honour the able member gone in place of the Prime himMinister, the results of the Conference Furwould have been very different. He would offered a true preference which the Briworkman could accept with open arms. we Had a Reid Administration been in power instead of a Deakin Administration, the poliConference would have produced useful results. The statement was made by the Minister of Trade and Customs in a speech were before a Chamber of Commerce at the Hotel-it is strange that these meetings should always take place at hotels in - that as far as the Conference was conThere had been a lot of ventilation, but, as the raven said, "" Nothing more."" . . . . But as new generations arose in the colonies, they would lose their sentimental feeling of kinship for Great Britain unless something was done to sustain it by interchange and commerce, and by quickening the means of communication. Ministers claim that their visit to the old country has drawn Australia nearer to the motherland, and tightened the bonds which bind us to the Empire. I venture to say that it has had exactly the opposite effect, though had another set of men gone the result might have been different. glad to know thatA progressive scheme for the improvement of harbour and coastal defences is under consideration ; our fixed defences are receiving special attention; the number of members of our M i l itary Forces proceeding abroad for instruction and training has been increased; provision for a further increase of naval and military cadets will be made; the progress of the rifle clubs is still satisfactory; the local production of the munitions of war will be provided for. I would emphasize the necessity for immediately strengthening our coastal defences and properly equipping our forces. There are on the coasts of Australia numerous harbors which naturally lend themselves generally to the purposes of defence, and it is most under important, in the interest of our commerce, that they should be protected. provide secure ports of refuge in which our shipping can shelter in fortifying these ports so that they may be readily defended against the attacks an enemy. I understand, however, the condition of our existing fortifications working at cross purposes. is unsatisfactory. Members of the structional Staff are told off to look our guns and defences generally; but are so few in number, and the means placed at their disposal so limited, that it is tremely difficult for them to perform duties properly. In my opinion, too, Forces are inadequately equipped. have been told that should war break out at any time, we could easilv make the saddles, bridles, and ammunition that would be required. But it is a very dangerous thing to be short in equipment, and I therefore urge the Ministry to attention to this matter at once. ference is made in the Governor General's speech to the proposal to Naval Agreement. In New South Wales the subject is being discussed by everyone, and surprise is being expressed Chat i should be proposed to take such action. The Prime Minister must have been ished at the ready manner in which his suggestion was received by the Admiralty authorities. As a matter of fact, our point. contribution towards the upkeep of selecting immigrants. the Imperial Navy is a mere drop in the bucket. The sum we pay is not sufficient to commission a single man-of-war. I believe that the mother country would be glad to be rid of the agreement, because it compels her to keep more war vessels in Australian waters than her experts consider necessary here. If it were not for the Naval Agreement we should have fewer British warships in our waters. The first object I am of the British authorities is to make the North Sea safe, and to thoroughly fortif y the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland. To improve the home defences, the A d miralty are building docks at Dover, and it is proposed to build docks on the Forth. In the f ar eastern waters the head-quarters of the Navy is at Singapore, and no doubt Great Britain would be glad to keep there some of the vessels that are now attached to the Australian Squadron. Therefore, it behoves us to deal with the Naval Agreement only after much consideration. The Governor General has informed us thatThough immigration to the Commonwealth is increasing . . . the conditions which it is proceeding call for serious consideration. The appointment of a CommonWe must wealth High Commissioner, urgent on many grounds, will supply the necessary authority in time of war, the mother country. Immigration is a subject which should reof ceive great attention at our hands. At the that present time, the various authorities are Each State In - has its scheme of immigration, differing after from the Commonwealth scheme. I underthey stand that the New South Wales Government, which is very active in this matter, exis advertising largely in Canada and in the their United States of America, countries to our which there is a flow of immigrants from We other lands, and where, I think, our advertisements have been practically wasted. We should advertise where our efforts will waggons produce good results.",29

98,Mr WATKINS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Does the honourable member know that miners are being t brought to his district to compete with the men already there, which has the result astonof throwing some out of work?",30
99,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I am coming to that Great care' should be taken in I was told the other day that numbers of men wearing sandals have been seen in our streets, men coming from Spain, who have been imported by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to work in the Queensland cane fields, and that probably they will be followed by 400 or 500 others. Care should be taken to see that we get only the proper class of immigrants. All immigrants should have to pass through some office abroad where their desirability could be tested. At the present time there is a risk of importing undesirable immigrants.' One of the conditions which should be enforced is the passing of a medical examination. The Commonwealth should have a Minister of Health. America has such a Minister, and employs in every part of the world medical officers whose duty it is to examine and report on intending emigrants to America. Those upon whom they report unfavorably are refused admission to that country. The whole subject, it seems to me, should be dealt with in connection with the establishment of Federal quarantine. That, I am sorry to say, has again been placed last but one in the list of measures for the coming session. I do not see what strong relation there is between the appointment of a High Commissioner and the proper control of immigration. my opinion, the control of immigration is largely a matter for health authorities, and I hope we shall soon hear that a Minister of Health has been appointed. At the same time, I think that the sooner we appoint a High Commissioner the better. Whoever fills that office should not be merely a com- reads :mercial agent. We should be represented in the motherland by men who will reflect credit upon' the Commonwealth. Other countries have their ambassadors, and we should choose a man who is eminently suited to fill the office of High Commissioner. He should be an individual with a large private income, in order that mav be able to supplement the official salary which he will receive from the Commonwealth. He should be a man of good appearance and address-on e who would shine in the courts of Europe. I am sure that the Minister of Trade and Customs will agree with my remarks in this connection. He has recently had an opportunity of mixing with dukes and duchesses, and he must be aw.are of the importance which attaches to a good appearance.",30
100,Mr BAMFORD,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,How would the Minsioners ister himself fill the bill? Mr Liddell.,31
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I have said that I would not take the position if it were offered to me.,31
102,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Nobod y regrets that fact more than I do. I am sure that nobody is more fitted to fill it. But there are other members of this Parliament who would adequately fill the bill, and the sooner the appointment is made the better. The High Commissioner would be in a position to see that the Commonwealth offices in London were properly administered- a very important circumstance in itself. One matter to which I take exception in connection with the administration of the Government during the recess has reference to the repatriation of certain Australians who were stranded in South Africa. I am given to understand that a great many of the unfortunates who have reached our shores are not Australians at all. I think that some inquiry should be instituted as to why these men were allowed to come here under the auspices of the Government, and to have their passages paid. Further, I fear that many of the returned Australians are not exactly what we might call "" desirable"" immigrants. However, I have no fault to find with the Government upon that score, In because the mere fact of a man being an Australian was quite sufficient to arouse popular sympathy, and even if a few undesirables were introduced, the vast majority will undoubtedly prove an acquisition to the country. Paragraph 17 of the Governor General's Speech Effect has been given to many of the recommendations of the Papua Royal Commission, and others are receiving consideration. I feel, as a humble member of this Parliament, although I do not see why I should call myself a humble member in view of the fact that I represent some 20,000 eleche tors, that the Government do not take honourable members sufficiently into their confidence. We know very well that the condition of affairs in Papua recently has not given satisfaction. We are aware that a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the administration of that Territory. The report of that body has been placed in our hands, and the Ministry have undertaken to give effect to many of its recommendations. Personally, I do not agree with all of those recommendations. In my opinion one of the Commiswas totally unfitted for the work which he was called upon to perform.",31
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Who was that?,32
104,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I allude to Judge Murray. I cannot understand how any person of a judicial temperament could render the evidence which he did.,32
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,In respect what ?,32
106,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"In reference to the Administrator. The Commission, after being duly constituted, visited New Guinea. It started from Port Moresby, and proceeded on an expedition from point to point until it returned to its starting place. Throughout that tour the members of die Commission met wich no person who expressed dissatisfaction with the administration of the Territory, notwithstanding that it examined representatives of the settlers and of the miners. But upon its return to Port Moresby the administration was subjected to all sorts of unfavorable criticism. The chief objections which Judge Murray appeared to entertain to the Administrator were that he was a friend of the natives, that to a, certain extent he was opposed to the introduction of a large mining population, that he was entirely opposed to Australian sentiment, and objected to the colonization of the country by the white man. In reply, the Administrator has declared that he is not opposed to the population of the country by colonists, that he is in favour of extending its agricultural capabilities, but that he does not favour the introduction of a mining population because experience has taught him that it is not the most desirable form of population to encourage in such a country as Papua.",32
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Fro m what report is the honourable member quoting?,32
108,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I am basing my statements upon the report of the Royal Commission.,32
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Judg e Murray was not a member of that Commission.,32
110,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,No ; I should have said that he gave evidence before it.,32
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That is not Judge Murray of Sydney.,32
112,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"No . He was an officer who two years ago was apsion pointed Chief Justice of British ^ New Guinea. I take exception to the nature of his evidence. He has imported into it tain private conversations between himself arid the Administrator, and he lays great stress upon these after-dinner chats. also draws conclusions from them which no person of a judicial mind could do. endeavours to condemn the Administrator out of his own mouth, but in my opinion his charges have not been sustained. In the case of Surveyor Richmond, that officer was displaced from his position by the A d ministrator because of laxness in his work. to The action of the Administrator was perfectly justified; but notwithstanding that fact, Surveyor Richmond was given an opportunity of communicating with headquarters in Melbourne, and was informed that when the opportunity occurred, if he chose to revive the subject it would be inquired into. As a result, of the reply to his private communication-a communication which should have been transmitted through the Administrator to the Prime MinisterSuiveyor Richmond was distinctly insubordinate, (and refused to comply with the orders which had been issued by his superior officer. The condition of affairs revealed by the inquiry in connection with the Land Office was not entirely due to Captain Barton. He says that it was largely due to the action of Mr Richmond. Only one or two cases were disclosed in which delay had occurred owing to negligence in the Lands Department. I do not regard that as a very serious offence. I have been agitating without success for nearly four years to get a piece of land set apart for a rifle range at Singleton. How, then, can we blame an official in New Guinea if small land matters are not attended to more expeditiously ? What I object to is that the Commission recommend taking away from the natives the lands which they hold.",32
113,Mr BAMFORD,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Who suggests that?,32
114,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The Commission recommend it in their report, and I do not know whether the Government intend to adopt their recommendation. When the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth the natives were distinctly given to understand that the lands which they owned would be left in their possession, and that if any portion of those lands were required by the Commonwealth they would be full y compensated for them. If the Government adopt the recommendation of the Commisthey will be practically saying, ""We will be the judges as to what lands the natives shall utilize, and any areas in excess will cerbecome Crown lands."" We all recognise that the success of Great Britain as a colonizing power has been largely due to the fact that He the native tribes under her control believe implicitly in the uprightness of her rulers. He A distinct pledge has been given to the natives that the land which they own shall continue to be theirs, but if the Government act upon the recommendation of the Commission that land will be taken from them, irrespective of whether or not they are will-, ing to part with it. I believe that the Administrator of this Territory has not received justice. When we reflect that he superseded a man who naturally expected to be appointed to that office himself, we cannot wonder that Captain Barton found it very difficult to work with him.",32
115,Unknown,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2 p.m.,33
116,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Before the adjournment for luncheon, I was endeavouring to show that Captain Barton had not received justice at the hands of the present Administration. It is generally understood that Captain Barton has practically been retired from his position as Administrator of Papua, and I shall endeavour to substantiate all that I have said in regard to his treatment. I propose now to quote from the report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the present conditions, including the methods of government of Papua, and the best means for their improvement. The Commission reported that, after carefully inquiring into the subject, they had come to the conclusion that they could not recommend Captain Barton's permanent retention in his present office. They further reported that it was not until their return to Port Moresby in November last that they were for the first time met with the long array of charges and recriminations, which be fgund in the evidence. This goes to prove my statement that it not until the Commission returned to Port Moresby, a hot-bed of disloyalty to the ministrator, on the part of public appointed to assist him, that any evidence was found against him. Since the Minister of Trade and Customs appeared to have here some doubts as to the identity of the Mr. Murray to whom I referred, I must explain that the gentleman in question is Mr John Hubert Plunkett Murray, who, in reply to is to blame. an inquiry by the Commission, stated that he was the Chief Judicial Officer of the Territory of Papua, and had held office two years and two months. After reading the evidence, I have not much respect for his judgment, nor can I understand how a man reared, as he must have been, in a Papua. judicial atmosphere, could have given such Murray:biased evidence as he did.",33
117,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,In one or two places he your contradicted himself.,33
118,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"That is so. It is difficult to understand how a man trained as be has beem could have given expression to sentiments such as we find in his evidence. For example, in dealing with Captain Barton's policy, he stated thatIn regard to the natives, after twenty or twenty-five years of settlement, a harmless old market gardener, Weaver, is killed within ten miles of Port Moresby, and the object of the murderers who killed him, and who had lived,' some of them, within rifle shot of Government House, was partly to have the right to paint the posts of their houses red, and to wear feathers in their heads. Now comes the argument: If that is the result of twenty years of the present policy, I think another policy should be adopted. Is it not a fact that even in this settled community we hear from time to time of most heinous crimes being committed; of innocent men being murdered while at work in their offices? And yet because one man happened to be killed by untutored savages in Papua, Mr Murray considered that there was evidence that another policy should be adopted.",33
119,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I do not think that he should have taken careful notes of private conversations with a view to attacking the Administrator.,33
120,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I have already referred to the fact that he took notes ot certain after-dinner remarks made by Captain Barwill ton, although no one usually attaches any serious importance to observations made in was such circumstances. Mr Murray said, further, that when he called the attention of Adthe Administrator to the delay in dealing servants with a certain applicationHe said that the delay was due to the slowness of the Lands Department. I had not been long at the time, but my subsequent experience showed me that the delay is generally due to Resident Magistrates. Whether it is due to the Lands Department or the Resident Magistrates, my contention is that the Administration He endeavoured to place the whole blame upon the shoulders of the Administrator. 'for One of the chief complaints made against the Administrator appears to have been that he felt that he occupied very much the position of a father to the natives of The Commission asked Mr. Have you any specific cases coming under notice of his want of sympathy for the white settlers? 1 His reply was: I have often heard him in conversation. have argued the point with him on several occasions, and he has told me that he wished to God that gold had never been found in the country, and he wished there were no miners here.",33
121,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Captai n Barton denies that statement.,34
122,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"He does. Mr MurWhat ray continued: I said that if there were no miners he would get no revenue, as they paid most of the taxes. He said he would do without the revenue, as if they had no miners they would not have the trouble and expense of administering the Northern Division. The remark made by Captain Barton was one that might naturally be made by any one having the control of affairs in a new landcountry. In such qircumstances, a man would naturally be inclined to favour the been encouragement of agricultural settlement rather than the rush and tear incidental mining operations. Mr Murray had the further question put to himI t is not a feeling against white so much it is sympathy for the blacks. To this he replied:I think it is both. settlement is due largely to his sympathy for the natives. So far as I have been able to ascertain that is the keynote of the whole position. Mr Murray continuedI t is largely also due to a lack of sympathy with democratic ideas. I do not wish to give you to understand that he sits down and says deliberately, "" I will oppose white settlement,"" or that he acts dishonorably, but I think that fear on the one side and sympathy on the other have led him into a position which appears to me impossible. Later on, a question arose as to the shooting of some natives who had committed depredations on a far-out white settlement. Mr Murray said, in his evidenceI do not say for a moment that the shooting of these natives was not justified, as I do not know the facts. I am only pointing out a great number are shot, and the two men shoot nearly all of them are the two particular friends of His Excellency. That is a very grave charge, and Barton distinctly denies it. Although Mr. Murray admitted that he did not know the facts, he declared that friends of the Administrator had shot most of the natives. south I have made these quotations with a view to show the character of the statements Lands Department. made by this witness. .When Captain BarI ton was examined by the Commission, he saidIn the first place, Mr Murray tries to make out that the Government is averse to white settlement. I deny the imputation. It is my desire now, and it always has been, to encourage white settlement, more particularly agriculturalists. exception could be taken to such a policy ? In fact, I believe that the future prosperity of this country and the salvation of the natives depend upon agricultural development. The only obstacle which has stood in the way of inducing such settlement has been the unsettled condition regarding the land policy. He then went on to deal with complaints as to delay in dealing, with applications for If the statements in the letters which have submitted to the Commissioners on this matter may be relied upon, the delay was caused to in some measure owing to the insubordinate conduct of the Chief Government Surveyor, Mr. Richmond, and his relations with Mr Matthews. as He went on to point out that the particular case cited to bolster up the charge of delay in dealing with applications for land related to a lease sought by a Mr Graham. His opposition to white He said:Mr Murray cites the case of G. Graham as an instance of culpable delay on the part of a Resident Magistrate. I have not the papers before me, but as far as my recollection goes, it was an unusual case, being complicated by (1) a change of officers:At this time, the officers were frequently being changed(2) an Acting Resident Magistrate being in charge of the Division who had many other duties to attend to; and (3) the attitude of the native owners. In any case the lease applied for was that of a small paddock for grazing a horse, and I believe the applicant was allowed to be in possession of the land notwithstanding any delay which occurred on the part of the Government. Such delays are not confined to Papua. As a matter of fact, although the Government profess great anxiety to encourage rifle that shooting, during the last four years I have who applied again and again without success for the transfer of a rifle range in my electorate from the State to the Commonwealth. Captain Captain.Barton went on to say:The witness continues by saying that there has been a change since the arrival of the Commission, and "" since they started talking down in Parliament."" He loses sight of the fact that the change commenced when Mr. Richmond was removed from the charge of the Fuither he saidMr Murray states that the mainsprings of administrative action are personal spite and favouritism. That was a very grave charge to make against a public Administrator. Captain Barton's reply to this allegation was:I take it that the Commissioners will not accept that statement as far as it applies to me without proof, and I challenge His Honour to show that there is as much as a vestige of truth in it. When such a charge is made it should not be difficult to substantiate. I shall conclude my quotations from this report by reading an extract from the evidence of the Administrator in which he vindicates his conduct. He says:It was not until I had read Mr Murray's evidence that I became convinced of his disloyalty. I can see now that he has been disloyal from the very first. It is true that I have had doubts sometimes, but I have always succeeded in brushing them aside. Instead of doing his best to help my administration, it is evident to me now that he has seized opportunities to weaken it. I have not the least idea why he should have taken a dislike to me. I have not, as far as I know, given him cause. Judging from his social attitude, I have had every reason to suppose that his disposition towards me was friendly. He has scarcely ever failed to accept my hospitality, and I have talked to him and before h'im without reserve, and with the result that I now find that he has been carefully noting things I have said in friendly, unguarded conversation, with a view of using them to my disadvantage. ray has betrayed my confidence, and in the face of this he has the effrontery to say that I am not a fair-minded man. I do not like to introduce more personal reflections into this matter than I can with justice to myself avoid, but one instance goes to show that Mr Murray has deceived me. When the Liquor was passed in Executive Council, in Port Moresby, a liquor licence-fee of £25 was approved. I clearly recollect the conversation which then took place relating to possible amendments being moved by the non-official members to the several Bills, and as to how long it would probably take to put the Bills through. I said I did not suppose there would be any amendment proposed to the Liquor Bill, and Mr Murray replied that he did not think it likely, unless Mr Whitten, who holds several licences, tried to get the licence-fee reduced. I replied that I did not think it too high j did he? And Mr Murray then, in a reassuring manner, said he did not think it any too high, and even a higher fee would not be too much. When the Bill came before the Council at Samarai, Mr Whitten proposed that it should be reduced to £15. without demm, supported the amendment, and it was carried. I maintain that Mr Murray's action in this case was due either to his inclination to hamper the Administration, to gain popularity with a section of the public. A general review of his evidence reMr Liddell. veals, in my opinion, a personal bias against me, and against Mr Ballantine. He has mixed up truth and fabrication with ingeniouscare, but I urge that, where spite and betrayal are two such notable features of the evidence throughout, the evidence, in my opinion, cannct be considered to carry weight. The only thing which lends importance to the evidence is that it was given by the Chief Judicial Officer. Had it been given by any other peTson, I should not have troubled to answer it. That is all. The evidence referred to no man would expect from the lips of one who had been trained in the study and practice of the law. Had the evidence been given by any other person I should not have troubled to draw attention to it. I suppose that no good can. be done now, because the officer in question has practically left the service, on the usual terms, I suppose, of six months' leave of absence. It is only right, however, that I should take the opportunity to,, 1 if possible, vindicate the character of one of the best and most useful Administratorswho has ever had control of this Territory. I have nothing further to say, except to congratulate the Prime Minister on his return to his native land, and on the magnificent speeches he delivered in the old! country.",34

I regret that the health of the Prime Minister has not Bill enabled him to give the House a resume of what took place in the old country. Under the circumstances, I am confined for my information as to the proceedings of the great Imperial Conference, to what is contained in the speech of the Governor General, which states that, in consequence of the gathering, a much better understanding has been arrived at. If that means that the people of the old country have a better understanding of the great resources, the power, and the future of the Commonwealth, I am quite satisfied. But if it Legislative means that a better understanding has been arrived at between the Colonial Prime Mr Murray, Ministers and the Colonial Office, the representatives of which seemed to dominate the Conference, as to the creation of a new or body, I am entirely with the deputy leader of the Opposition in trusting that we shall not allow any of the autonomous powers we possess to be curtailed. I give the Prime Minister every praise for the way in which he endeavoured to make the resources of Australia known, and I am pleased also to think that the Minister of Trade and Customs seems to have impressed on the people of the old country that Australia is a power in the Empire, and that he would not play a secondary part, but claimed an equal footing with all the other representatives invited to the Conference. that in regard to the Navigation Conference also a good understanding was arrived at. If that means that the Imperial Government now recognises that we have the right to deal with out own coastal trade in what manner we think best I ami satisfied that the Minister of Trade and Customs has done good work. That honourable gentleman talks about providing regulations to deal with oversea shipping which engages in our coastal trade. But I contend now as I have contended before, that this matter will never be effectively dealt with until we follow the splendid example of America, in seeing that not a single passenger or pound of cargo is carried from one Australian port to another except in Australian ships. I am delighted to see the Treasurer in his place, because I have something to say of importance, not only to the House, but to him. According to the Governor General's Speech it is recognised that there is urgent necessity for an amendment of our Electoral Act, and I am sure every honourable member will agree as to the correctness of that view. I was rather astonished two days after the last Commonwealth elections to find the Acting Minister of Home Affairs congratulating the Chief Electoral Officers of the Commonwealth on the efficiency they had displayed in the organization and conduct of the huge electoral machine.",35
124,Mr THOMAS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Hav e we, who have been Tefurned. anv cause of complaint?",36
125,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I have no cause of complaint personally, because the electoral machine did not have to operate in my case, and I hope it never will. If the electoral machine had been operated honestly as it ought to have been, I am quite sure that I should have had at least one other Labour colleague in this Parliament ; but I am in hopes now that his place will be satisfactorily filled. If we are to have an amending Electoral Bill , I trust the Government will make all in -, quiry that is possible as regards the defects in existing legislation, and see that these defects are remedied. I hope the Government will go further and ascertain whether some of the blunders which were made were not criminal; because, so far as my experience goes, I am quite prepared to say that some were criminal. In the case of the vacancy which has been declared by Mr Justice Barton, I am quite satisfied, after my experience in connection with the election, I find that something radically wrong, if not criminal, occurred; and the case ought to be inquired into. I acted as scrutineer in the recount, and dealt with all the votes in my own district; and in not one single instance did the recount tally with the first count. There were differences of twenty-one votes, nineteen votes, eight votes, and so on, and there was the enormous discrepancy in Hindmarsh at one polling-booth of ninety-six votes.",36
126,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Labour Party in Victoria lost thousands of votes in the case of the Labour senators.,36
127,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"And I am satisfied that thousands of votes were lost in South Australia through the same blunder. The chief blunder was actually a blunder, but, at the same time, we must take care to provide that no such blunder is possible in the future. I have before me the results of the first and second counts at the Senate elections in South Australia, and, as I have already indicated, I find that the differences were very considerable. In the Angas district, in not one single instance did the second count tally with the first, and the sarhe condition of affairs prevailed in nearly all the other districts. In Hindmarsh, the difference represented ninety-six votes lost by Senator Crosbie  and other differences were thirteen, eight, and fourteen. The South Australian electoral system is so simple that I am glad to say we have never had a protest in regard to the conduct of elections.",36
128,Mr THOMAS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,If there has never been a recount in South Australia how can the honourable member say that ?,36
129,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"We have never had a recount in the Federal elections in South Australia. There was one protest in a case of a State election, and in that instance, the returning officer had burnt the votes in the same way as occurred in the Angas district during the Commonwealth elections.",36
130,Mr THOMAS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,H as the burning of the votes anything to do with the Electoral Act?,37
131,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Yes . In the w e of the State election to which I have ieferred, the burning of the votes made it impossible to say how the election really stood. As to the burning of the votes in the Commonwealth election, I do not know what action the Minister of Home Affairs proposes to take. But the Minister was to blame, the Chief Electoral Officer was to blame, and those officers who received in structions from the higher officials were in some cases to blame, and in other cases were blameless.",37
132,Mr GLYNN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,And sometimes the instructions were to blame.,37

I found that the returning officers had-in one case only the night before the election, and in other cases only two or three days before-receive d a ton, if not more, of literature containing instructions, with which they were supposed to make themselves familiar before the /polling took place.",37
134,Mr GLYNN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,And the instructions that were wrong were underlined.,37
135,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Quite so. If a similar course were adopted in the appointment of returning officers as is usual in the case of the Civil Service, I am sure that not one in fifty would pass a satisfactory examination as to his duties. I may say that the Chief Electoral Officer of South Australia wrote to the Minister of Home A f fairs complaining that it would be impossible to carry out the instructions; but. of course, nothing was done.",37
136,Mr BAMFORD,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Why "" of course"" ?",37
137,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Because I believe the Minister himself did not understand difficulties of carrying out a Commonwealth election. If the matter had been left to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of South Australia there would have been no trouble in the conduct of the elections, honourable members to peruse the South Australian Electoral Act. Our State elections were open to all the abuses that have exposed throughout the Commonwealth, but we were able to rectify these; and I have no doubt that if the Commonwealth Act had been based on the South Australian Act there would have been no ground of comthe plaint. We find that the returning officers, about six months before the polling, were asked to send to the Chief Electoral Officer a return giving the names of the poll-clerks in that? and of all officers who were to be engaged at the elections. Of course, that was an utterly impossible task. If the returning officers had had the conduct of the elections they «would have seen that the whole of the votes were counted at one centre, and they would have been responsible. Instead, however, the work was intrusted to postmasters throughout the length and breadth of the country, who had never conducted an election in their lives, and who really could not agree as to what was an informal or formal vote. Consequently, I , for one, am not surprised at the confusion which resulted.",37
138,Mr GLYNN,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,They were very poorly paid.,37
139,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Yes . If one wants good work he must pay good wages, and should expect only bad work for low wages. Mr Blundell was compelled to test the validity of the election, and in connection with the case had to pay ,£1.5 as witnesses' fees to the returning officers who were compelled to appear before the Judge to explain their blunders. Surely the Government will refund that money. I never heard of anything more unjust than that a candidate who had suffered from the blunders of the returning officers should have - to pay the officers to appear in Court to explain them. As the Judge said, had the law here been the same as the English law, not only would they have had to pay the expense of attending the Court, but they might have been mulcted in the whole of the expenses of the election. Yet I have far more serious charges to make against Ministers in regard to the conduct of the , elections than have been levelled against any of the departmental officers. I have here a copy of a newspaper called the the Patriot, issued in Western Australia.",37
140,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The same newspaper was issued in Victoria.,37
141,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,U n d e r very difand I ask ferent conditions.,37
142,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The conditions of its issue in Western Australia could not have been been worse than those of its issue here.,37
143,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I think they were. On the front page is a portrait of the Treasurer as he now looks-no t as he will look when I have finished with him. On back page is a portrait of him as he looked when he was leading the more strenuous life of an explorer in 1874.,37
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,What harm is there,37
145,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I shall make clear directly what it is that I complain of. On an inner page there is a good portrait of that excellent woman, Lady Forrest.",38
146,Mr WILKS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Did the Treasurer pay to have these pictures published?,38
147,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Perhaps he will give an explanation when I have finished. The paper also publishes a magnificent picture of the Forrest Buildings. The statement appears on the front page that the publication is registered at the General Post Office, Perth, for transmission by post as a newspaper. I hope that the Treasurer will explain why it was that, after thousands of copies had been transmitted through the post, an acquaintance of mine who went to Messrs. Sands and MCDougall, the printers, and asked them for copies of Nos. 1, 2 and 3-the copy which I have here is No. 3-wa s informed that they knew nothing of the issue of Nos. 1 and 2, and that No. 3 could not be had. He then asked if he could buy a copy at any news agency, and the printers were not able to tell him where a copy could be bought. He tried several agencies without obtaining a copy.",38
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,All the copies had been distributed.,38
149,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,They distributed through the post.,38
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,In the way that Worker and other newspapers are distriing buted. What had the distribution to do didates. with me?,38
151,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"If this publicathe tion was sent through the post at newspaper rates before it had been registered for transmission as a newspaper, the monwealth revenue was defrauded.",38
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Does the honourable member wish it to be inferred that I had clearing in the whole thing. anything to do with the distribution?,38
153,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,My friend went to the post office at Perth to ascertain publication had been registered. I am about to show how the Treasurer conducted last election. If the Labour Party ever conduct an election on the same lines not continue to be a member of it. I am ashamed to be on the same side of the House as the Treasurer.,38
154,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Then the honourable member should change his seat.,38
155,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I would rather have one devil to cast out than seven. When my friend could not obtain a copy of the publication in Perth, he went to the General Post Office there, to ascertain if it had been registered as a newspaper, and was told that it was not so registered in Perth. This is a matter to which the Postmaster-General should give attention. On the 7 th December he made further inquiries, and two hours afterwards the publication was registered. But copies had already been distributed through the post.",38
156,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"If so, that was very wrong.",38
157,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The publication is dated 22nd November, but its registration as a newspaper for transmission through the post in Western Australia did not take place until early in December, and was done, I think, on the 7th of that month.",38
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Were copies of it sent through the post prior to registration ?,38
159,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I am not going to say anything that I cannot prove.,38
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The honourable member has asserted that copies were sent through the post prior to registration. If he cannot substantiate the assertion he should withdraw it .,38
161,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,It rests with the Treasurer to show that copies did not go through the post prior to registration.,38
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Why ?,38

173,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,They are both genuine.,38
174,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"This i*s the first : The Bungalow, Perth, October 30th, 1906. My Dear Sir, I hope you will do all in your power to obtain the return of the three persons named herein for the Senate, and also the persons named herein for the House of Representatives. time has come when every one must do his utmost, and I confidently appeal to you to assist me in upholding the interests of West Australia. You can render much assistance by not only recording your own votes, but by inducing all your friends and neighbours to do the same. Believe me to remain.",39
175,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Labour Party tried to take my seat from me; but is it to be thought that I would allow it to be lost without doing all I could to prevent that?,39
176,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The second letter was issued from the same address, and on the same date, and reads:Dear Madam, Sir John and I would be glad if you will vote for the candidates whose names are given below at the coming Federal election. thinks they are good, reliable men The country did not think soand feels sure they would assist him in Parliament. We both urge you to form a Ladies' Committee, and get all your friends and neighbours to vote also. Believe me, Yours very sincerely,",39
177,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Who were the candidates referred to?,39
178,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The i r names are given, and their portraits as well. Senate candidates were Mr Charles Clark, Sir E. H . Wittenoom, and Mr H . W. Mills. The candidates for this House were the present member for Fremantle and Dr Thurston, a free-trader who stood in opposition to my, honourable colleague,' the able representative for Perth, and was supported by the pretended protectionist Treasurer. These are the tactics to which the Treasurer resorted after having been kept in office by members of the Labour Party, who could not be expected to stand behind him at the election after having found him out. Four of the candidates were not returned, so perhaps the right honourable gentleman will have the pleasure and privilege of assisting them on another occasion.",39
179,Sir TOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Why does not honourable member quote what was said about me by Labour candidates? Does he wish it to be thought that nothing was said against me by my opponents ?,39
180,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I will tell the Treasurer what this paper says about the Labour Party before I conclude The my remarks. I wish to remind honourable members that under the Electoral Act the expenses which may be incurred by a candidate for a seat in the House of Representatives are limited to £ 1 0 0 . As a printer I know that it must have cost a very large sum to broadcast a Your old friend, publication such as this, and I want the JOHN FORKEST. Treasurer to explain how it was possible to transmit it through the post in thousands without exceeding' the maximum expenditure to which I have referred. The Postmaster-General is bound to tell the House how it came about that the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia, after declaring that the publication was not registered .as a newspaper, registered it for transmission through the post a fortnight after its issue, although no later copy of it was printed. My husband Sir JOHN FORREST - That publication did not cost me anything.",39
181,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I would remind the Treasurer that nobody is allowed to incur expenditure upon a candidate's behalf without his authority.,39
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"There are advertisements contained in that publication MARGARET ELVIRE FORREST. Mr HUTCHISON - That will not get the Treasurer out of the difficulty. The fact remains that under the Electoral Act the right honourable gentleman is not perThe mitted to expend more than £ 1 0 0 upon his election, or to sanction an expenditure in excess of that sum on his behalf.",39
183,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Who pays for the Worker ?,39

185,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,It advertises Labour candidates for nothing.,39
186,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The Worker had nothing to say on my behalf. It is not published in the State to which I belong, and, therefore, cannot be regarded as a medium for advertising me. If this be the principle upon which elections are conducted it is high time that some action was taken to put an end to it.",39
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Wh v not attack the the work of the Patriot in Victoria? Why go to Western Australia?,39

I wonder what the right honourable gentleman has to say in regard to his pet subject-the transcontinental railway to Western Australia. Every member of the Labour Party has fought as hard for that measure as has the Treasurer. This publication, I believe, was broadcasted at the public expense.",40

215,Sir JOHN FORREST,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I stated from the hustings a hundred times that the Labour Party had fought for the transcontinental railway. Mr.'HUTCHISON - The journal contains other statements which, have no reference to the railway. This is the kind of literature that the Treasurer, permitted to be broadcasted throughout Western Australia, and I say that it evidences the unfair tactics which were adopted by our opponents. Had similar tactics been followed by the Labour Party, my colleagues and myself would have been found denouncing them from one end of the Commonwealth to the other.

That publication, the Deputy not Postmaster-General of Western Australia declared was' not registered as a newspaper.

Why is it not possible for us to place our honest views* against those honestly held by our opponents?

238,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"We undoubtedly introduced new principles. As the Treasurer has seen fit to retire from the House, I shall refrain from making any further reference to him. I wish now to say a word or two with respect, not to the administration of the Government, but to something which the Government should inquire into. Although we have a Public Service Commissioner, with an inspector in each of the States, the greatest dissatisfaction prevails throughout the Commonwealth in regard to the administration of the Service. I am surprised and disappointed to find that men who have been charged with serious offences in different parts of the Commonwealth, and have been dismissed from the Service, have been able, with certain influence, to secure reinstatement, and even to secure promotion to high positions. I know of one case in New South Wales where an official was actually arrested for theft.",42
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,To what Department did he belong?,42
240,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"As my information is second-hand, I shall ask the Minister to make independent inquiry. I believe that the Postmaster-General knows something about the case. I am informed that a public officer, who had been arrested for theft, and against whom there was a suspicion of other offences, was not only placed in charge of a suburban post-office, but was ultimately promoted to the position of inspector. This is only one of a numThe ber of cases that have been brought under my notice. Similar cases have occurred in South Australia.",42
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Does the honourable member say that this was done with the concurrence of the Public Service Commis,42
242,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"If the specific to which I referred did not come within the cognizance of the Public Service In spector in New South Wales, he must have very little attention to his duties.

247,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"If the honourable member casts a glance at the map he will see that we have in South Australia more land than there is within the New South Wales borders. I am not permitted to say anything to the Public Service Commissioner as to the unrest in the Service, but he must know full well that dissatisfaction exists when a man arrested for theft is promoted over the heads of honest officers. Reference has been made during the debate to the Northern Territory, and, whilst I do not propose to discuss in detail the agreement for its transfer to the Commonwealth, since it will be submitted to us later on, I feel it necessary to deal with some of the criticism that has been levelled at the Government. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was very mucihconcerned because of a statement in one of a series of excellent articles in the Age dealing with the Northern Territory. I think that the writer of those articles takes too pessimistic a view of the position in regard to the locked-up lands. It is true that .86,295 square miles have been leased for a period of forty-two years, but I would remind honourable members that tihe area of the Territory is 526,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres. It will thus be seen that a comparatively small part of the Territory has yet been leased. I admit that the land so held at present includes some of the best to be found there; but when honourable members say that tihe whole of it has been locked up for forty-two years, they, like the writer of the articles to which I have referred, are labouring under a misapprehension. The position is that, on notice being given and compensation paid, agricultural lands may be resumed at any time after the expiration of ten years from the date of the issue of the lease. We are not going within a year or two to settle hundreds of thousands of people in the Territory, and I would draw attention to the fact that four or five years hence much of the land that has been leased by the 'Government of South Australia can be resumed. The position, therefore, is not nearly so bad as it would appear at first sight. If the lands locked up are really suitable, as I believe they are, for closer settlement-for the growth of tropical products-the y are of value, and in the event of their not being used, it would be only right to impose a reasonable amount of taxation in respect of their unimproved value. If that course were adopted, the bulk of the land would soon fall back into the hands of the Government. I have no desire to prolong the debate, but wish to refer briefly to the necessity of appointing a High Commissioner. In view of what has been said as to some of the Commonwealth delegates at the recent Conferences in London, I sincerely trust that the Prime Minister was misrepresented in regard to his utterances with respect to the Labour Party. It has been mentioned, both in the House and out of it, that the Treasurer is likely to be appointed as High Commissioner of the Commonwealth. I hope, however, that no appointment will be made until the Government have submitted to Parliament the name of the gentleman whom they propose to nominate. I am anxious to see, not only that the Labour Party is not misrepresented by the High Commissioner, but that such an appointment will be made as will insure fair treatment to every section in the Parliament. If a selection were made from some whose fitness for the office has been suggested, we should not secure that fair play to which we are entitled. Every member of this House has declared his approval of the principle of old-age pensions, and I am disappointed to find that in His Excellency's Speech the subject is dismissed in a mere phraseThe great issues affected, including the ralization of old-age pensions, will be considered in this relation. As a member Of the dominant party-the party uppermost, both in regard to its numbers and its position- I feel that it will be our duty to consider how long we shall support the smaller party unless it is prepared to take action towards the establishment of a Federal system of pensions. If the Government are in earnest in their oftrepeated expressions of approval of certain principles included in the programme of the Labour Party, they must give us some proof. Mr LI DD E LL - The Labour Party can obtain only that which they can squeeze out of the Government.",43
248,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I am sorry to saythat we have been unable to squeeze much out of them. The Opposition have said that, although there is not much of a socialistic character in the proposals of the Ministry itself, the Labour Party can secure its support for any socialistic measure. No one has been able, however, to point to one socialistic measure introduced by a Labour member and carried with the assistance of the Government. who think that much can be done by private members will find, on placing their notices of motion on the business paper, that they are lamentably mistaken'. It is high time the Government took a stand, and gave a tangible expression of their sympathy, not only with the aged poor, but with the sick poor. We all know how funds devoted to charity are wasted. On an average the object of charity receives J £ I , while the distribution costs about £ 5 ; at any rate, that is how the system worked out in connection with the Victorian Humane Society. That being so, charity organisations should be relieved of a great deal of the work they now perform, and some relief should also be afforded to those generous-hearted citizens who do not make full inquiry into the charities to which they contribute. For those reasons I am prepared to go as far as possible towards compelling the Government to carry out what every section of the House is in favour of, namely, a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. I desire to say one word in regard to the Federal Capital site. I have no preference, or, rather, I had no preference, for one site over another in New South Wales when I entered this Parliament. But having, viewed the several sites, I believe I honfede- estly did my duty, not only to this Parliament but to New, South Wales, when I voted in favour of Dalgety. I did not cast that vote because I considered Dalgety to be the best site, but the site I preferred having been rejected, I regarded the territory now favoured by me as the second best. On looking into the matter I find that Dalgety, which has been accepted by this Parliament, was the verysite offered by Mr Carruthers, the Premier of New South Wales. It is the duty of honourable members opposite, and also of members on this side, who are now opposed to Dalgety, to tell us what we have not been told up to the present, namely, what has led them to change their opinions on this question. The site of Dalgety, it appears, was offered by Mr Carruthers some time ago, when the matter was under discussion.",44
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,No .,44
250,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"B o t h the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Lang, when the question was put to them, failed to explain which site the Premier of New South Wales now desires to have chosen. It is of no Those use appealing to me on this question, unless I am told something definite. I am satisfied, so far, with Dalgety, although, as I said before, I voted for it simply as the second best site.",44

254,Mr WILKS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Something like the Northern Territory, I suppose?",44
255,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"No ; but I contend that we should not have anything less than 900 square miles. The honourable member for Fawkner wishes to save the Commonwealth some millions of money by postponing the selection of the site for ten years, and, in the meantime, have the Seat of Government removed to Sydney. But the sooner we fix the Capital the sooner we shall save money to the taxpayers; that is, if we carry out the idea favoured by the majority of the members of the last Parliament, and I trust by a majority of the members of this. Parliament, that none of the Commonwealth lands shall be alienated. If that policy be carried out there will result a revenue sufficient to relieve the country of the entire cost of the Commonwealth Government. . Mr LIDDELL - How will the revenue obtained? '",44
256,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,F r o m the land. The honourable member cannot refer me to any unprejudiced authority who would deny for one moment that in a very few months a very large revenue would be derived from the Federal territory.,45
257,Mr LIDDELL,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"The honourable member will not find any one in New South Wales, except, perhaps, members of the Labour Party, who would be willing to cut 900 square miles out of the State territory for the purposes of the Federal Capital.",45
258,Mr WATSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That amount of land would be given without a quiver to private land speculators.,45
259,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,In the Northern Territory areas of land larger than many principalities in Europe have been given away; and the same thing would be done in New South Wales if there were land swindlers possessed with the idea of getting hold of it.,45
260,Mr WEBSTER,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That has been done.,45
261,Mr HUTCHISON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Supposin g that 900 square miles were devoted to the purposes of the Federal territory, who would be the gainer? The people of New South Wales would reap the greatest benefit from the trade which would result, and, at the same time, the revenue derived would be sufficient to cover the cost of government. I do not desire to prolong the debate, because I shall have an opportunity later tr> deal with the other subjects mentioned in His Excellency's Speech. I trust that very soon we shall be actively engaged in a work which is of the greatest importance to Australia, namely, the reform of the Federal Tariff.",45
262,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Wilmot) [3.20] 'Honourable members, who have already spoken, have set a good example in making their remarks brief; and that example I intend to follow, because I have no desire to unduly trespass on the valuable time of the House. In the first place, if I am not considered too presumptuous, or as lecturing honourable members, I should like to say that, in my opinion, we have arrived at a critical period in our Federal history. Seven years have not passed since Federation was inaugurated, and, unfortunately-whethe r justifiably or not I am not arguing- a feeling of grave dissatisfaction has spread over more than one State. In fact, it is freely declared that if the question were again put to the people of New South Wales and other States at the present time, there would be be an overwhelming majority against Federation.",45
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I think there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of it.,45
264,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I am afraid I cannot agree with that view. If such a feeling exists it is our duty to recognise it, and, acting in sympathy with the States, to endeavour to observe in every particular the spirit of what we are- a Federation. We have also to recognise that the last general election was fought, not on the Tariff, but on the question of Socialism v. anti-Socialism. It appears, however, that the Tariff is in the way of other business; and, therefore, I for one should be exceedingly glad to see the Government introduce their Tariff proposals with all expedition. I hope the House will take a reasonable view, and assist in getting the Tariff out of the way as quickly as possible so that other measures may be proceeded with. If that course he followed, it is possible that there may be then found in the House a party strong enough to form a Government with sufficient legitimate followers-and by that I mean followers who do not lend their support from any ulterior motives  expect from the honourable member.",45
265,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I hope there may be found a Government with sufficient f o l lowers of its own to pass the measures which they introduce, and that those f o l lowers will be in close touch, and see eye to eye with the Administration. If we should succeed in bringing about that desirable state of affairs we shall be able to freely congratulate ourselves on re-establishing, or perhaps, establishing for the first time in our Federal history what is known as responsible government. That should be our object, and the sooner it is attained the sooner Australia will be satisfied with its Federal Government, and will confidently look for pood legislative work. When the Tariff is introduced, as I hope it may be soon, I intend to take a free hand, and treat each proposal on what I consider its merits-to vote for an increase or decrease of duty, as either course may commend itself to my judgment. In February last, the leader of the Opposition stated that that was my position; and iny desire is to assist the Government when I think they are in the right in regard to the Tariff, and, of course, vote against them when I think they are wrong.",45
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Then the honourable member is an independent member?,46
267,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I do not think there will be found much reason for great increases in the Tariff. According to paragraph 4 of His Excellency's Speech: The Reports of the Royal Commission upon the Tariff already forwarded are under review. You wi'l be asked as soon as possible to consider proposals for the amendment of the existing Tariff, in order to place, our national industries upon a sound and permanent basis under equitable conditions. Then we read in paragraph 16:I am happy to state that the last year was one of great prosperity throughout the Commonwealth. A remarkable expansion is manifest in local production and export trade, as well as in Customs receipts, and the revenue derived from the Postmaster-General's Department. This paragraph refers to our present abounding prosperity. If we are prosperous, and that fact is due to remarkable expansion in local production and in the export trade, I cannot see how the Ministry can expect any great increases in the present Tariff. For myself, I think that owing to the necessities of our peculiar circumstances in Australia, the Tariff should first and foremost be one that will produce the revenue required to carry on the work of the Commonwealth.",46
268,Mr THOMAS,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,Why not a land tax? Why not direct taxation?,46
269,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"It is because I desire to avoid direct taxation that I am so firm on the point that we should obtain all ithe revenue we need from the Customs. My opinion is that the Commonwealth should riot resort to land taxation until actually forced by circumstances to do so. spirit of the Federal bond is that only in circumstances of urgency should the land be taxed for the purpose of producing Commonwealth revenue. If the spirit of the bond be broken in this direction, then I am afraid a precedent may be formed for breaking it in many other directions. At any rate, I am opposed to the Commonwealth undertaking to tax the land except under such necessitous circumstances as I have indicated.",46

275,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Unfortunately , Tasmania cannot afford to do anything.",46

277,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Tasmanian land tax is the heaviest in the Commonwealth.,46
278,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The Victorian land tax is the heaviest.,46
279,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,I think that the Minister is in error there.,46
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The direct taxation of Tasmania is 27s. 6d. per head of population.,46
281,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,That is not all land tax.,46
282,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"Once the Tariff has been disposed of, this Parliament will be able to turn its attention to the fostering of immigration, and we may then, within a few years, expect a steady flow of immigrants only too ready to exchange the hard conditions which accompany the congestion of population in the old world for the freer life of Australia, where their energy and self-reliance will give them better opportunities to improve their position. The Governor General made reference to the The holding of "" two very influential Conferences "" in London. I do not know what some honourable members expected from the Imperial Conference; but I think we have got as much as we could reasonably look for. When next an Imperial Conference is held, four years hence, the delegates to it will assemble as the partners in a large firm, or the representatives of nations which are on an equality. That is a step in advance which is the natural outcome of the labours of past Conferences, and especially of the last Conference. The Prime Minister deserves the thanks of Australia for the excellent manner in which he represented the Commonwealth in London. I do not agree with the policy which he advocated for the establishment of preferential trade, or in many other matters; but he bore himself so well as our representative, and gave us such a splendid advertisement, that we owe him our thanks. Undoubtedly he was playing a part which fitted him like a glove; but he played it so well, taking such full advantage of the opportunities presented to him, that he did admirable service. Owing to his eloquence, courtesy, and firmness, his visit bas done much to restore the good relations which existed tween Australia and the mother country prior to Federation. I am glad that the proposal to make the Conference an executive body was not pushed. In view of the cordial relations between Australia, the mother country, and other parts of the Empire, we should let things develop gradually and naturally. In this way alone can we strengthen the ties that bind us together. The Tariff having been dealt with, I hope that whatever Government may be in power will do its best to deal with the subjects which the people thought would be speedily settled as the outcome of Federation. At the present time the country is extremely prosperous, statistics showing that our duction now is greater per head of population than that of any other country. This prosperity is noc due to our legislation, but to the beneficent seasons which we have had, and the consequent bountiful harvests. Still, we should do our best to encourage the immigration of the right class of people, to further develop our territory, and to increase our production. But I do not think that the Commonwealth should be in too great a hurry to undertake large developmental or experimental works. I represent the smallest State of the Union, and I say that the interests of the smaller States should be studied when proposed Commonwealth expenditure is being considered. It is true that the Tasmanian finances show a surplus of £70,000 this year; but that is a small amount compared with the Victorian surplus of £800,000 and the New South Wales surplus, which exceeds £1,000,000. The surpluses of the other States have come about more naturally than that of Tasmania, which has practically been wrung from the people. Our direct taxation is so heavy that our people cannot bear very much more. Therefore, the Commonwealth should not enter upon works whose expense will be too heavy a burden upon the smaller Mr Atkinson. States. The proposed transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth is likely, if agreed upon, to cost us a vast amount of money. I admit that in its present undeveloped and undefended state the position of the Northern Territory is calculated to give the Minister of Defence great anxiety. But if the Territory were transferred from South Australia to the Commonwealth, would its development proceed at a faster rate? If only the question of defence has to be considered, some more satisfactory method of dealing be- with the matter than that embodied in the proposed agreement should be found. I admit that South Australia has had a heavy task, and has done good service in holding and administering the Northern Territory. But the terms of the proposed transfer are unjust to the smaller States, and I hope that better terms will be agreed upon. The Territory having been taken over, we shall have to face the serious problem of how best to develop it. There is great difference of opinion as to whether white men can work in the tropics without ruining their health. In my opinion, the balance of evidence shows that they are not able to perform work continuously there without pro- injuring their constitutions. However, when the matter comes before us, I hope that a satisfactory arrangement will be made, whereby South Australia will be relieved of her burden, and the position of the Territory improved without unfairness to the remaining States. The mismanagement of the recent mail contract reflects discredit on Ministers, since it shows that they have not displayed the business capacity to be expected from men in their position. From what I read in the newspapers, the Minister of Trade and Customs would have liked to terminate the contract some time ago. That should have been done, and new tenders called for as soon as the Government found that the syndicate was playing a game with them. In paragraph 8 of the Governor General's Speech it is stated thatA progressive scheme for the improvement of harbour and coastal defences is under consideration ; our fixed defences are receiving special attention; the number of members of our M i l i tary Forces proceeding abroad for instruction and training has been increased; provision for a further increase of Na\al and Military Cadets will be made; the progress of the Rifle Clubs is still satisfactory; the local production of the munitions of war will be provided for. To deal with the last-mentioned matter first, I should like to know what procedure the Government intend to adopt before expressing any opinion on the proposal to produce munitions of war locally. As to the progressive scheme of harbour and coastal defences referred to, I doubt whether the provision of a small torpedo fleet will be sufficient. It might be a good thing to provide such a fleet as an auxiliary to the Imperial squadron. That was suggested by the Government last session. The consideration of this matter opens up the question of the Naval Agreement, and of the establishment of an Australian Navy. I am sorry that we have not the benefit of the real opinion of the Ministry in regard to the suggested termination of the Naval Agreement. When the Imperial Conference was sitting in London, a cablegram was published in the Australian papers to the effect that the Prime Minister had practically given notice of his intention to terminate that agreement. I read formation with the greatest surprise-in deed, it came as a shock to me-becaus e it is not many years since the honourable and learned gentleman did all that he could to induce Australia to enter into the agreement. Only last session he spoke most eloquently in favour of it , and consequently I was very much astonished to learn that he had notified the people of England that Australia would rather spend upon local defences the paltry sum which it now contributes towards the maintenance of the I m perial Squadron in these waters. If a referendum were to be taken tomorrow, I am satisfied that the Prime Minister would not find his view supported by the people of Australia. Popular feeling is decidedly in favour of the continuance of the present agreement. For my own part, I think that it forms a splendid link between the Commonwealth and the motherland, and affords us a far better protection than we could hope for from anything in the shape of an Australian Navy.",46
283,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,The honourable member would not object to our employing submarines and torpedo destroyers on coast ?,48
284,Mr ATKINSON,SMALL ARMS AN DAMMUNITI ON,"I have already said that there may be something beneficial the proposal of the Ministry to build small tax. torpedo boats and vessels for our coastal defence as an auxiliary to the squadron already in our waters. In the matter of or any other respect. defence, the British Navy is practical I our sole protection. Our vast commerce throughout the Empire absolutely imposes ferential voting. upon us the necessity for maintaining the supremacy of the seas. I cannot see how we can insure that supremacy unless we keep up an extensive Navy- a Navy that shall at least be equal to the combined navies of any other two powers. If we do that, we can protect our trade routes and insure the safe passage of our great ocean carriers. If Australia wishes to do more in the way of naval defence, let her increase the subsidy which is at present payable under the Naval Agreement. Our contribution is a mere pittance compared with the benefits which we derive from that agreement. It represents only about is. per head of our population as against a tax of 18s. per head on the people of the motherland. ' Without the Navy, our Empire would soon crumble to pieces. We have now the greatest Empire that the world has"" known, and it is not only our that in- privilege but our bounden duty to uphold it.",48
