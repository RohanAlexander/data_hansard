CUSTOMS TARIFF (BRITISH PREFERENCE) BILL. Mr SPEAKER announced the receipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General, intimating that he had reserved the Customs Tariff (British Preference) Bill for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure.",13
1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is it true, as reported, that the Government have ceased to collect duties under the British preference schedule, and are returning the money already collected?",13
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes. The Customs Tariff (British Preference) Bill having been reserved for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure, there is no authority under which to continue to collect them. CASE OF CAPTAIN CROUCH.",14
3,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"As some little time is likely to elapse between the prorogation of this Parliament, and the assembling of the next, I wish to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council, whether in that interval the Minister of Defence is likelv to have an opportunity to peruse the papers relating to what is known as the Crouch Surrender Case, so that they may be laid on the table within a reasonable time after the meeting of Parliament ?",14
4,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The Minister of Defence has stated that he wishes to let sleeping dogs lie, and I think that they might well be allowed to lie during the interval to which the honourable member refers.",14
5,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the Estimates of the Department of Home Affairs provide ""for the salaries of two medical officers, will the Minister in charge of that Department see whether it is not possible to have the honourable member for Lang subjected to medical observation? MILITARY RETIRING ALLOWANCE.",14
6,Mr SKENE,Unknown,I understand that special consideration is to be extended to an officer who is retiring from the Defence Force on account of ill-health: but does the Prime Minister think that his case is the only one that should receive attention?,14
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Quite the contrary. My honourable colleague, when referring to the case of Captain Anderson, must have had in mind a list containing the names of a number of officers similarly situated, which has been before him for some time. Captain Anderson's case is a very hard one, because it was owing to the paralysis from which he suffers, brought about by conditions to which he was subjected while discharging his duties as a soldier, that he was incapable of applying for the gratuity which would otherwise have been granted. It is proposed to deal with this and with other outstanding cases.",14
8,Mr SKENE,Unknown,Includin g that of Colonel Price?,14
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes . Colonel Price has a very strong claim to consideration, [224] because a Military Board awarded him a specific sum for injuries on service. The intention is to deal with the cases of Captain Anderson, Colonel Price, and of any other officer who can substantiate a similar claim in the same convincing way. BRITISH IiNTFLUENCE INTH E PACIFIC.",14
10,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"As considerable concern exists regarding the maintenance of British influence in the Pacific, can the Prime Minister inform the House as to the position of affairs in the New Hebrides, and assure us that the subject will receive his close attention during the recess?",14
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Referenc e will be made to this important subject in the speech to be delivered by His Majesty's representative this afternoon. I could wish that it bore another complexion; but it is not due to want of representations from this side that a more favourable report is not given. NA QUEENSLAND.,14
12,Mr MAHON,JAPANESE PREFERENCE TO,"In today's issue of a newspaper published in Melbourne there is a statement to the effect that Queensland has secured for some of her products preferential treatment from the Japanese Government. Has the Prime Minister any information on the subject with which he can favour the House? I should like to know whether the Queensland representative in the East is vested with Commonwealth authority? If so, and he has obtained this preferential treatment for his State at the expense of the other States, will the Prime Minister withdraw his authority to act on behalf of the Commonwealth""?",14
13,Mr DEAKIN,JAPANESE PREFERENCE TO,"The Queensland treaty with Japan dates from the nineties, and was therefore in force before our Union. The concessions made to Japan up to that time then ceased, and have not since been granted. Assuming the newspaper statement to be correct, it can only mean that the Japanese Government extends to Queensland, as an act of grace, concessions for which it has not received any return since the establishment of the Commonwealth. If so, that is a matter not within our control. The Queensland representative in the East, like the representatives of the other States there, is authorized to issue certificates to merchants or bond fide visitors who desire to come to Australia, so that our immigration laws may not be evaded.",14
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JAPANESE PREFERENCE TO,Is it possible for one State to enjoy concessions which are not given to the others?,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,JAPANESE PREFERENCE TO,"It is not possible one State to grant concessions; but, other country likes to grant concessions any State, the Commonwealth cannot conwork trol its gifts.",15
16,Mr MAHON,JAPANESE PREFERENCE TO,But we should not confor nive at such an arrangement.,15
17,Mr DEAKIN,JAPANESE PREFERENCE TO,We are not associated deeplv regret. with it. I am not yet sure that there to be such an arrangement.,15
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JAPANESE PREFERENCE TO,Surely we have right to see that all the States receive equal that initial mistake. treatment. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. APPOINTMENTS TO THE HIGH COURT : REto his opponents. NA NEW MINISTER : RETIRING MEMBERS.,15

20,Mr MALONEY,ARRANGEMENT OF MINISTERIAL OFFICES,That is very generous.,15
21,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT OF MINISTERIAL OFFICES,"On e or two sentences conmore in regard to the members of the surLabour Party, who during this session have f assisted us, not as direct followers of the Government, but under a resolution to give us their general support. Although indivicondual members of that party have at times be been strongly in opposition to us, and the In party as a whole has on occasion exercised its undoubted right to question the wisdom of our policy, their undertaking of general support has been amply and generously f u l filled. Of the leader of that party, no terms ore too high in which to express my sense of the strictly constitutional manner in which he has refrained at all times from even offering a suggestion that might appear to be intended to interfere with the responsibilities of the Government in any respect. This House, but not the Commonwealth, will lose two other members, who have occupied places of distinction in this Chamber. The highest eulogy their colleagues can pass upon them is conveyed by the appointments which they have offered to them. I venture to believe that their retirement will be a loss to this House and a greater loss still to the partu to which they belong.
