1,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether, in view of the hardship which is caused throughout Australia by some of the provisions of the Defence Act relating to cadets, he can say when the Government intends to in troduce an amending Bill to"" allow the sons of widows who are the sole support of their mothers exemption from d r ill !",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall be glad if the honourable member wil l give notice of the question; I am not prepared to answer it at once. It raises a series of very important considerations, and will require to be looked into most carefully. NA ELECTIONS.",12
3,Mr KELLY,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Some time ago the honourable member for Maribyrnong asked me a question regarding the payment made to officers of the police force for services rendered during the recent election. The Chief Electoral Officer reportsIn connection with the elections in 1910, the police acted as doorkeepers at the larger polling booths, and those who were engaged received ios. each from the Divisional Returning Officers. In connection with the referendums, 1911, the police authorities in Victoria objected to constables acting as doorkeepers, but agreed to those who were doing ordinary police duty at the booths receiving a meal allowance of 2s. 6d. each, which was paid through the Police Department. A similar arrangement was observed in connection with the last elections. The payment of such meal allowance' has to be made through police authorities, who have not yet submitted their account, but it is expected in the next few days. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .",12
4,Mr TUDOR,POLICE AND GENERAL,I wish to know whether the Government has decided to reimburse the Government of New South Wales all the expenditure incurred in the active quarantine in that State during the recent small-pox outbreak!,12
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICE AND GENERAL,1 do not know what is being done. WESTER N ELECTRICAL COMPANY.,12
6,Mr FRAZER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I desire to make a 1913. personal explanation. In a newspaper, published in Melbourne, yesterday there is a letter signed by Mr Hungerford, the general manager of the Western Electrical Company of Australia Limited . He makes the statement that I am reported to have said that the company deliberately swindled the Commonwealth CADETS. out of £ 5 , 9 0 0, that action was taken, and that the whole amount was recovered by the Commonwealth. I say that that is absolutely true.",12
7,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,The honourable member is entitled to read the extracts in connection with a personal explanation.,12
8,Mr FRAZER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"The company deliberately swindled the Commonwealth out of £5,900. Mr. JOSEPH Coox - Surely this is not a personal explanation.",12
9,Mr FRAZER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"It is a personal explanation, because an attack has been made on me. The company kept the sum that I have mentioned in a suspense account for about five years before distributing it among its shareholders, its excuse being, when the facts were made known by its late accountant giving information to the Department, that it had not been called' on to pay - the money. The ex-Prime Minister knows that I asked him to call for a special report upon the matter from the Auditor-General, which was done. Mr Hungerford says that eventually a claim was made, which the company found to its surprise that the departmental officers were unable to substantiate in any way from their records; but, although the company was under no obligation to assist the Department, it placed its books and records at the disposal of the officials, and after they had satisfied themselves as to the amount they considered to be due, the company paid it . Those statements are quite true, but the company knew that the Minister of Trade and Customs had the power to take its books if the company had not placed them at our disposal. The Commonwealth owes the company nothing, so far as that is concerned. I certainly intended to have the books taken from the company if they were not made available to the Department. Mr Hungerford also says that if the conduct of the company had been aa I asserted, I should have, initiated a prosecution against it , and that the company would have gladly availed itself of the opportunity to have the facts publicly sifted. I tell Mr Hungerford that I took counsel's advice, and was in formed that, while there was no doubt that a criminal act had been committed, it was doubtful whether, under the circumstances, a jury could be got to convict. Mr Hungerford can take that statement with my compliments. I placed an embargo on the company, saying that I would not deal with thieves, and that it was not to be considered as a tenderer for Commonwealth supplies during my terra of office. This Government has lifted that embargo.",12
10,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I did not in tend to reply to the honourable member if he had not concluded his remarks by saying, "" This Government are to blame for lift in g it . """,13
11,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Does the Minister desire to make a personal explanation ?,13
12,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I do; but I wish to go a little further and explain the facts, and for that purpose I ask that I may be given leave to make a statement.",13
13,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"It is not in order to reply to a personal explanation, but if the Minister desires to make a statement to the House. I ask: Is it the pleasure of the House that the Postmaster-General have leave to make a statement? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",13
14,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"When tenders were called for the supply of certain goods to the Department, one of the conditions was that if there was any increase in the duty, the Department was to pay the in creased duties to the tenderer, and if there were any lowering of the duties, the tenderer was to be called upon to refund to the Department the amount of the duty overpaid.",13
15,Sir ROBERT BEST,POLICE AND GENERAL,That is in accordance with the Customs laws.,13
16,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"That is so. In this particular case the Department overlooked the fact that the Customs Act contained this provision, and did not call upon the company referred to, and nine other tenderers for the sale of goods to the Department, to refund duty overpaid. In this case the honourable thing for the firm in question would have been to have informed the Department that they had received this money in excess, but they were not legally bound to do so. In the majority of cases we have sharp business men to deal with, and they stand on their legal rights. When the Department, through the information [ l l l j - a given by the accountant who had left the employ of these people, called upon them to refund the duty overpaid, and the amount was fixed by an inspection of their books, they did refund the overpaid duty. In five other cases claims were thereupon made from other tenderers, in one instance for over £1,000, and in others for smaller sums. Some of the money has been repaid, but four companies have not yet paid up, and I have given instructions that legal proceedings be taken against them for the recovery of the overpaid duty. As a matter of fact, within the strict legal terms of the contract, it was the duty of the Department to call upon these people to refund the money.",13
17,Mr ERAZER,POLICE AND GENERAL,But they knew they were keeping it wrongfully.,13
18,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"As a strict matter of law they were entitled to retain it until they were asked to refund it . But what happened so far as the Department is concerned? When the company in question was debarred from tendering, and fresh tenders were sought from firms supplying similar goods, the best tender received was between £6,000 and £7,000 in excess of the prior tender by this company. In another case, I believe that the difference amounted to £12,000.",13
19,Mr BAMFORD,POLICE AND GENERAL,What percentage would that be ?,13
20,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"It would be 25 per cent., probably. I found that the Department would be at a loss of probably £20,000 if I had continued the embargo on these people. It is our duty in this, as in every other Department of the Public Service, to watch these matters very carefully ourselves. We call for tenders, we have a standard, and it is our duty to protect ourselves, and see that we get what we are asking for. When the embargo was taken off this firm, the prices for the goods came down something like 20 or 25 per cent. Although in the circumstances this firm probably deserved some punishment for their sharp practice, though it might be characterized otherwise as looseness on our part, I was, by removing the embargo, saving the Department in connection with two tenders alone probably £20,000. HANSARD PROOES ",13
21,Mr ROBERTS,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Will you permit me to draw attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that this morning wheu I received proofs of the Hansard report of my remarks yesterday, I found that there had been taken out of them statements made by another member, to which I had replied. The other member may, conscientiously, and in keeping with the forms, correct the report of his remarks, and his corrections, when made, may lead to the impression that my remarks have little or no sense or connection. Would it. not be possible, under the circumstances, for members to have the privilege of seeing what is interpolated into the reports of their speeches, particularly when the in terpolations are in the form of statements to which they have replied.",13
22,Mr WEBSTER,POLICE AND GENERAL,I may say that my speech is made wholly unintelligible by the omission from ib of statements that were made during the time that I was on my feet.,14
23,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,I shall make in - sir? quiries of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter in regard to the matter.,14
24,Mr FISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"May I ask you, sir, i it is a fact that you have given instructions that all your rulings are to be taken out of the proofs submitted to members ?",14
25,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Certainly . I claim the right of every honourable member of this House to see my uncorrected proofs before they are put into the hands of other honourable members. May I call attention to the danger which could arise from a wrong use of incorrect proofs, and which might affect any honourable member. If the uncorrected proofs of members' speeches are fco be put into the hands of other honourable members, there will be no sense at all in any honourable member being permitted to revise the report of his speech, to correct errors, before it appears in Hansard, and if the uncorrected report of the Speaker's remarks is to go before other honourable members, the uncorrected reports of every member's speech may also go before other members. The Speaker should not be placed under a disability under which no other honourable member suffers. If the rough and uncorrected proofs, especially of important rulings, which may contain errors, coming from the hands of the printer, are to be put into the hands of other honourable members, then neither he nor any member of the House will be safe from subsequent misrepresentation.",14
26,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,"A few mouths ago you gave a ruling with which I entirely agree. Upon that ruling I desire to ask you a question. Your ruling was to the effect that no honourable member had the right to see the uncorrected proof of another honourable member's speech. The question I desire to ask is: By what right, and by whose authority, the Hansard staff supplied you with an uncorrected proof of my utterances and replies to questions by you to me? Do you claim a right which is denied to other honourable members?",14
27,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"In the hands of the Speaker, and in the hands of the President, the whole of this question of proofs really rests. I do not get the proofs of other honourable members' speeches, except in so far as they may raise questions upon which I have to intervene.",14
28,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,"But uncorrected matter,",14
29,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Order ! I have never received uncorrected proofs of other honf orable members' speeches, nor have I ever sought to get them in the ordinary way, except where they have been included in my own proof sheets as relating to something in connection with which I have had to intervene. It would be necessary in a case of that kind for me to see what happened immediately before I intervened that I might know whether my own report was correct.",14
30,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,"You have seen uncorrected reports of my remarks.  should be careful, or he will be turned out.",14
31,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Order ! For instance, an honourable member may raise a point of order, which I have to decide. I could not possibly decide the point of order without knowing what it was. Very often an interjection, or perhaps two or three, are interpolated by other honourable members altogether. These interjections could not be excised from the proofs. When I spoke of an honourable member not having the right to have access to another honourable member's uncorrected proofs, I wanted to say that in this matter it is my duty as Speaker to safeguard every honourable member of the House from the liability of his uncorrected proofs being brought in evidence against him when he has not an opportunity himself of revising them and correcting matter which may have erroneously got in , or may have heen erroneously reported. In this connection I may say that this is particularly necessary at the present time, because I have received an intimation that the Hansard Staff find it increasingly difficult to accurately report honourable members' speeches, owing to the amount of interruptions that take place, and even their trained ears are not to be absolutely relied upon to give a f a it h f u port of what has taken place in such circumstances.",14
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I should like ask you, sir, one question: On this very important matter, have you departed from the custom of the past?",15
33,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I have not departed, so far as I am aware, from what has been the practice all the time.",15
34,Mr EISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"My proof has been altered, I understand, by the direction of Mr Speaker. If you, sir, did not do it , I hope that you will be good enough to tell us who did it , because nobody would act in such a matter without your authority.",15
35,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,So far as I am aware I have given no instruction to alter anything in the proof of what the honourable member said.,15
36,Mr EISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"No , sir, but you have taken out several rulings of your own, which has altered the position.",15
37,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"That is a different matter entirely. 1I have taken out matter of my own, but have not altered matter of the honourable member. That exactly brings me back to the point at which I started, and that is, that there is no reason why I should be placed under a disability which I would allow no other honourable member to lie under. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",15
38,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"In regard to the proceedings of last night, I find that it is not made clear in the reports in the press, and in the minds of people, that in transgressing as I did-and I admit that I transgressed- I was subject to very great provocation. I want to make that clear.",15
39,Mr THOMAS,POLICE AND GENERAL,So was I yesterday.,15
40,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"There were hurled at me epithets which would have incited any man to take the action which I did. I might, sir, draw your attention to this fact, that, although the honourable member for Melbourne Ports insisted that I should withdraw my statement before he withdrew his, after I voluntarily got up and withdrew my statement, he did not withdraw anything.",15
41,Mr TUDOR,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Yes , he did.",15
42,Mr MCDONALD,POLICE AND GENERAL,He did it first.,15
43,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports insisted that I should get up first. There were a great many epithets hurled at me from round l re- the Chamber which have never been with drawn, and one in particular imputed cowardice to me. That, I think, was to very unfair. I was even called a "" damned scoundrel,"" according to the newspapers. I object to an epithet of that sort being hurled at me, because it is very unfair. I fail to see where the imputation of cowardice could have any weight. The honourable member for Maranoa, as big a man as myself, was very persistent with his epithets.",15
44,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order ! The honourable member must not refer to that.,15
45,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,I do not like to allow a charge of cowardice to rest on me.,15
46,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,"If you want a demonstration, come upstairs.",15
47,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order !,15
48,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I would like to have that matter set at rest quietly and dispassionately. I suggest to honourable members that if they would select six of the biggest or the best men they have, and come quietly",15
49,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order !,15
50,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,Let me finish my sentence.,15
51,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order !,15
52,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Her e you are, sir, I'm on!",15
53,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order 1,15
54,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,Her e you are!,15
55,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order I,15
56,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,Her e you are 1,15
57,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order ! Will the lionorable member for Hunter be seated?,15
58,Mr CHARLTON,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I want, sir, to take a point of order.",15
59,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order 1 Will honourable members maintain order?,15
60,Mr ANSTEY,POLICE AND GENERAL,Melbourn e Ports,15
61,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Order ! Will the honourable member for Hunter be seated for a moment. Every day I have to make an appeal which it should not be necessary for the Speaker to make. My position is difficult enough ordinarily, in all conscience, as honourable members must admit. This continual interruption of the business by disorderly interjections, and by audible remarks all over the chamber, prevents me from hearing or knowing what is going on. The honourable member for Hunter, I understand, has risen to a point of order; but I have not been able to hear one word he has said on account of the interruption. This must cease, else I Bhall take other action.",15
62,Mr CHARLTON,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I desire to ask,' sir, whether the honourable member for North Sydney, under cover of a personal explanation, is justified in this deliberative Assembly in asking that six honourable members from this side should go, one after the other, to meet him, so that he oould deal with them.",16
63,Mr HOWE,POLICE AND GENERAL,That is cowardice again.,16
64,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"No . The honourable member for North Sydney, if he did say so, was certainly out of order. At the same time, I again emphasize the importance of honourable members remaining quiet so that I can hear what an honourable member is saying. Otherwise I am not able to intervene. The honourable member for North Sydney would not be in order in proceeding on those lines, because a personal explanation must relate to something in which he had been misrepresented or misunderstood, or to something that he has said which has not been made sufficiently clear.",16
65,Mr CHARLTON,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I ask, honourable member for North Sydney be called upon to withdraw the statement.",16
66,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Order ! I understand that the honourable member for North Sydney, in making a personal explanation, made some statement- I do not know what-whic h has been regarded as offensive. If he did so, I ask him to withdraw the statement.",16
67,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"On e thing I omitted, sir, in my personal explanation was to draw your attention to the aggravation to which I was subjected.",16
68,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Order ! Before the honourable member proceeds with his personal explanation, I ask him to withdraw the reflection, or something which he is stated to have said regarding other members.",16
69,Mr MCDONALD,POLICE AND GENERAL,It was a breach of the privileges of the House.,16
70,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw any sive remarks before he proceeds.,16
71,Colonel RYRIE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"V e r y well, sir, I withdraw any offensive remarks, but honourable members did not know whether I was going to ask them to come and have a cup of tea or not. My complaint, sir, is that the epithets "" hangman "" and "" executioner "" were hurled at me, and in the circumstances I think that the provocation was very great.",16
72,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I certainly understood that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports did withdraw the words he had used-that was my impression. But if the honourable member for North Sydney knew that words of an offensive character had not been withdrawn by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the time for him to draw my attention to the fact was then, and not now. The question cannot now be raised. HANSARD PROOFS.",16
73,Mr WEBSTER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I wish to ask you, sir, some questions regarding the elimination of certain remarks of yours from the proofs of other members' speeches. Firsts has such a custom been adopted by any predecessor of yours ? Second, are you aware that honourable members are allowed a certain number of copies of their proofs to be forwarded to those whom they may deem it advisable to send them to, and the proofs, mutilated as they are today, sir, that the would be totally useless and defeat the privilege which is allowed to honourable members ? Hence we are put under a disability, which I am sure you will not desire us to be under when you realise the effect of your action.",16
74,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"In regard to the first question, I do not think that in the history of this or any other Parliament there is a precedent for the proceedings which have taken place so far as the Speaker's intervention is concerned. In this case, amidst great scenes of disorder, tumult at times, the Speaker is called on suddenly to give a ruling or to interpose in relation to some matter that has come up",16
75,Mr FISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,I object.,16
76,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,W h i c h involves him objectionable making a statement.,16
77,Mr FISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,I protest against such a statement from the Chair.,16
78,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Order ! In the course of his remarks he may make a statement which, in the circumstances, offenmay not be as clear as he would have put it in a calmer atmosphere. If honourable members will look at the Hansard proof, they will see that very frequently interjections come in , and that there is sometimes an indication that in terjections are so numerous that they are not taken down, an intimation that there was disorder, or that several members were interjecting. In those circumstances it would be grossly unfair to the Speaker, - or to any other honourable member, to have uncorrected Hansard proofs circulated over the country or put in the hands of - other honourable members. Although it is the practice, and it is allowable, - orable members to have a certain number of copies of revises, it is not the practice to give them uncorrected proofs for the purpose of general circulation, unless they are satisfied that the proofs do not need - correction. There is, I understand, only one uncorrected proof in the first instance sent to an honourable member for his correction. He may correct the proof, or he may not, as he pleases, and then, on application, he is entitled to get a certain number of revises.",16
79,Mr MCDONALD,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I would like to know, sir, who authorized the sending out of the proof which I hold in my hand? This morning a proof was sent to me, and it is simply impossible to say what it means, owing to the peculiar way in which it is pasted together. There was a good - deal of interjecting on the opposite side while I was speaking, and the result was that I had to listen, and then to reply, and thus get something in . If I have not an opportunity to see what I was replying to, how can I correct the proof or say whether it is correct or not? This is the first time in the thirteen history of this Parliament that this .sort of thing has been done. would like honourable members to see this proof that I hold in my hand. The speech is. chopped off after a - couple of lines. Then there is a break, and then follows another couple - of lines, which, in their turn, are - succeeded by another break. the circumstances, it is not possible to - do anything with these proofs. my thirteen years' experience in this Parliament, I have never seen a proof like it . I wish to know upon whose authority jfchis change has been instituted.",17
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICE AND GENERAL,I should like to make some reference to this matter. I have received a similar proof.,17
81,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Order ! Is the Prime Minister about to ask a question ?,17
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Ver y well, I shall raise the question later if you will not allow me to do it now.",17
83,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"The Prime Minister will see that if I permit him to intervene when a question has been put to me, every other honourable member may claim a similar right. It is irregular to ask a series of questions in regard to the same matter. I will make inquiries into the question which has been raised, for hon- and ascertain what has been done.",17
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I wish to ask you, sir, if you will be good enough fo see that the old practice is reverted to? I confess that my proof was entirely unintelligible, and, moreover, it consisted of a series of slips cut out from somewhere and pasted on a whole sheet. It is impossible, I submit, for an honourable member to intelligently review his own speech in the absence of the matter which has preceded it . I confess I did not think over the matter at the time. I thought that perhaps the position was one peculiar to myself. I do submit that it will impose a disability upon honourable members, and will seriously impair the value of Hansard as a permanent record, if that practice be persisted in .",17
85,Mr FISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Why not regard the matter as one of privilege, and settle it now?",17
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICE AND GENERAL,"Is it not better to have the thing settled without submitting a motion in the House? My honourable friends opposite must recollect that all this trouble arises out of their seeing and making use of other people's years' proofs when they had no right to do so. I ask you, sir, to take action with a view I to remedying this matter.",17
87,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I can only say that it is my desire to meet the wishes of honourable members. I desire to safeguard their rights and privileges, and to protect them from having their uncorrected Hansard proofs brought up in Under evidence against them- a course of procedure which is against all the previous During practice of the House and of this Parliament. I do not know what has been done in regard to this particular matter, and I can only inquire into it with a view to seeing how far it has proceeded, and direct the attention of the Chief of the Hansard Staff to it .",17
88,Mr FISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I join with the Prime Minister in his desire that the old system should be reverted to. I join with himand with Mr Speaker in affirming that so far as practicable the unrevised Hansard proofs ought not to be permitted to go beyond the hands of honourable members, so long as they are white proofs, as between the member who spoke and the member who intervened",17
89,Mr GROOM,POLICE AND GENERAL,And Mr Speaker also.,18
90,Mr EISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"And Mr Speaker, too. I suggest that as they are only proofs",18
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POLICE AND GENERAL,Honourable members - have no more right to use them than they have to repeat a private conversation. It amounts to the same thing.,18
92,Mr EISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"W it h all due respect to the view which you, sir, have expressed, I suggest that any ruling which you may give, and which intervenes ill the speech of an honourable member, should be incorporated in the uncorrected Hansard proof of that honourable member. recognised by honourable members that Mr . Speaker's unrevised proofs cannot be used against him any more than a private member's unrevised proofs can be used against him. When once we have reached that sensible point we shall understand each other a great deal better.",18
93,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I shall certainly have regard to the wishes of honourable members. In the words of Mr Speaker Lenthall, "" I have neither eyes to see nor ears to hear, save only as the House shall direct.""  you, sir, to say in regard to alterations made in the form of the distribution of Hansard proofs, that you did not know who gave the instruction for those alterawhich tions ?",18
94,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"The honourable member did not rightly understand that. I am not aware that honourable members' speeches have been mutilated by the form in which the Hansard proofs distributed, and I gave no instructions regard to that matter. I have already said that I will have a consultation with as the Chief of the Hansard Staff in regard to the whole matter, and will endeavour, as far as possible, to meet the wishes of to be enforced? honourable members.",18
95,Mr TUDOR,POLICE AND GENERAL,"May I be permitted, sir, to direct your attention to a few marks which I made on Friday last, when, in the course of a seven minutes' speech, you gave seven rulings. I propose hand the proof to you, and I ask that should be returned, .because it will be an mania, 5. interesting exhibit for a museum. At the same time. I desire to know who gave the instructions that this alteration should be made in the method of distri^ buting the Hansard proofs ?",18
96,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,Before I can give a definite reply I must see the proof. If the honourable member will hand it to me. I shall be glad. Later :,18
97,Mr EISHER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I am sorry to trouble you again, Mr Speaker, but there is amongst my honourable friends some misapprehension regarding the reply which you gave in reference to the alteration of the form of distributing Hansard proofs. Are you in a position to say who gave the order to alter what had been the custom and practice up to the occurrence of a certain incident a few days ago. If you are not in a position to give us the in It should be formation, will you give the House an opportunity to investigate from where the order came ?",18
98,Mr SPEAKER,POLICE AND GENERAL,"So far as any instructions given by me are concerned, they related only to my own speeches. I have already said that I shall consult the Chief of the Hansard Staff, aud when I have done so I shall be in a position to inform the House of the matter. I shall take the earliest opportunity to consult with him . SUSPENSIO N OF - MR . MCGRATH .",18
99,Mr WEST,POLICE AND GENERAL,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the Speaker's statement earlier in the sitting, he has any objection to removing the embargo was placed on the honourable member for Ballarat yesterday? me to say TELEPHONELINESGUARANTEE .",18
100,Mr AGAR WYNNE,POLICE AND GENERAL,"On the 15th are October last the honourable member for in Corio asked the following questionW ill the Postmaster-General obtain a report to the number of country telephone lines erected in Victoria under the guarantee system on which a loss to the Department has occurred, and in respect to which the guarantees have had The honourable member for Herbert. also asked that similar information be f u r renished in regard to the other States - The desired information has now been obtained, and is as follows-Ne w South Wales, 37; to Victoria, 32; Queensland, 12; South Ausi t tralia, 4 ; Western Australia, 2 ; Tasi DEFENCE REGULATIONS.",18
101,Mr KELLY,POLICE AND GENERAL,"The honourable member for Batman recently put a question in respect of the publication of a compendium ©f the Regulations under the Defence Act. The reply is as follows: It is considered that such a course advisable at the present time in view of the fact that during the transition period of the Defence Scheme two sets of regulations have to be kept in force, the one applicable to the voluntarily enlisted men, and the other to those serving under Part XII . of the Act. Under these circumstances, Ihe regulations can hardly oe otherwise than bulky, but when it is possible to consolidate the Commonwealth Military and Universal Training Regulations it is considered that much of the difficulty pointed out by Mr. Jirennan will be overcome. A manual of offences and penalties under the - Act and regulations is, however, being prepared now. While this manual could not be considered to be a compendium of all the regulations, seeing that it only deals penalties, it is thought that same will contain a good deal of information in a concise form which should be useful.

Mr FINLAYSON - There is in this morning's newspapers a report to the effect that two postal officials have been appointed, with authority to proceed Great Britain and the United States America, to make a special investigation into telegraphic and telephonic matters.

124,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I have received the honourable member for Adelaidea letter, which reached me yesterday, but which I have not had an opportunity to The Dear Mr Speaker, During the proceedings in the House of Representatives on Friday last, two points of order were submitted for your consideration in respect of standing order 119. In each case you ruled against the point raised. I then submitted another point for your consideration, but before I had concluded my remarks you were pleased to say that my contention was "" merely another way of submitting a point upon which you had ruled, and an attempt to get behind your ruling."" Such words were a serious reflection upon my conduct and knowledge of the Standing Orders. My point was, and is, that "" a certain motion having been interrupted by standing order 119, the ' Orders of the D a y ' must then be taken in rotation unless the House otherwise orders."" I contended that it was at that moment competent for the House to order that something other than considering the Orders of the Day in rotation should be done. - Of that there can be no doubt. In the circumstances, I respectfully request that you, in equal public manner, withdraw the reflection you placed upon me. Faithfully yours, E. A. ROBERTS. I wish to explain that when I said that what the honourable member was doing-was only another way of getting a ruling already given, I did not intend' in any way to reflect upon the honourable member himself. I should be very sorry indeed to reflect intentionally honourable member. I merely used terms which I find have been used very frequently by other occupants of the Chair. I assure the honourable member, and I take this opportunity to state that I had no intention of reflecting per.sonally upon himself. Later :",20
125,Mr ROBERTS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Permi t me to thank you, sir, for reading the letter I was privileged to send you, and for your generosity in withdrawing what I deemed to be a reflection on myself. evidently omitted to mention, however, that the point of order. I raised was a good and valid one, and must stand.",21
126,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,I can assure the honourable member that I omitted nothing from his letter.,21
127,Mr ROBERTS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I do not suggest that. I claim that the point of order. I raised last week was a good and valid one, and must necessarily be upheld. The Hansard report would indicate that the point I raised could not be upheld and sustained by you; but I am confident that, after thinking the matter over, you will agree that it is a good one.",21
128,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I am afraid that that question does not arise at the present time, nor am I called upon to express an opinion as to whether the point was a good and valid one. I expressed my opinion at the time, but, unfortunately, in language which the honourable member construed to be a reflection on himself; and I now wish to disclaim any intention of the kind. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .",21
129,Mr WEBSTER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that recently a doctor and a nurse have been alleged jfco be suffering from small-pox in the quarantine area, although they are reported as vaccinated ? In view of this fact, and, therefore, of the f u t i l it y of vaccination, will the Minister now endeavour to remove the embargo on the people of Svdney? - Mr GROOM - I have not any such knowledge, but, as the honourable member states that such is the fact, I shall call for immediate inquiries in order to ascerbehind tain whether the circumstances are as he SUGAR EXCISE . upon any Mr TUDOR - Can the Minister of Trade and Customs inform us whether any of the persons who owe the Commonwealth a certain amount of money for sugar Excise have paid, and, if so, how publicly, many, and how much ?

133,Mr AGAR WYNNE,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I have a report from the Accountant with reference to the balance-sheets. That report was ready at the end of last month, but the difficulty is that the Government Printer has so much in hand that he experiences great trouble in printing the document for presentation to the House. I hope, however, to have the report ready for presentation on Friday or Tuesday next. ADJOURNMENT (Formal) NEW HEBRIDES.",21
134,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Maribyrnong) [3.35] I desire, according to notice given yesterday, to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz.: "" That in the opinion of this House the Commonwealth Government should draw the attention of the British Government to the state of affairs existing in the New Hebrides."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",21
135,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I do not intend to discuss this question at length, because, in my opinion,, very few words are necessary to show the Minister of External Affairs the necessity for a thorough in vestigation in reference to affairs as we find them in the New Hebrides at the present time. I presume that quite a number of honourable members, if not all, are in possession of certain incidents, and more than incidents, that have occurred in this very important group of islands. It appears, from general complaints, that the dual control is not at all satisfactory, at any rate to the British residents. As to the poor and unfortunate natives, while we make a boast that there are no slaves under the British flag, I am afraid that investigation into the treatment of those people in the New Hebrides would disclose the fact that a large number of persons, apparently, are engaged in what we may term the slave trade. document I have in my hand, I learnBy the Joint Convention of 1906, the New Hebrides were brought under dual control^ of Great Britain and France. (The Condominium was proclaimed in Vila on the 2nd December, igo7, and since then the British and French flags have waved side by side over the Islands.. Each Power has its own Resident Commissioner, with his administrative staff, while the administration of justice is placed in the hands of the Joint Court. This Court consists of three Judges, a President, who is nominated by the King of Spain, and a British and a French Judge. The Public Prosecutor is a Spaniard, and the Registrar is a Dutchman, as is also the Natives' Advocate. The other officials consist of an equal number of British and French. It is very evident that there has been an endeavour to enlist the services of quite a number of people belonging to different nationalities. Many startling things have been stated, but I do not propose to repeat or deal with many, in view of the fact that this deliberative assembly is part and parcel of the Empire, and I have no desire to be the means of raising complications. The New Hebrides question is a very important one to the Commonwealth. Recently one of the biggest events in the commercial and, I might say, maritime history of the world has come about. I refer to the opening of the Panama Canal. Undoubtedly, with the fleets of the various nationalities passing through that canal from one ocean to the other, the New Hebrides group of islands, situated as they are on the direct route between America and Australia, will become more and more important and of greater value to the Commonwealth. However, I am not dealing with this subject from the aspect of territorial acquisition. It has been said on fairly good authority that the British Government would be very glad to hand over their portion of the control of the islands to the Commonwealth. On the other hand, there is a statement which comes from a French source, that there is a very great desire on the part of the people of France-o r a section of them, at any rate-to obtain complete control over the whole group of islands. As I have said, I am not going to talk about the international aspect of the matter, or to discuss it from the point of the acquisition of f u r ther territory, though it is quite likely that a little later on we shall be called upon in this Parliament to discuss that important topic; but what I do say is that as the British Government are partly responsible for the manner in From a which the natives of these islands are treated, it is incumbent upon any Parliament with British instincts to take up some stand against the treatment meted out to these islanders. There is what is termed "" illegal recruiting."" I can quote many cases to show how cruelly and how dastardly some of the natives are treated, but I shall confine myself to one case, in. order not to take up the time of honourable members- In October, 19,12, a Tanna man, called Neai, proceeded against M . Debechade, of Vila, in the Joint Court, on the charge of having recruited his (Neai's) wife, without her husband's consent, about August, 1910. He protested to the captain at the time, but the only reply he received was, "" The woman in question is not reported on board my ship as a recruit. I am only going to take her to Vila to explain the missionary matter before the Government."" But the woman nevertheless was taken to Noumea. Neai went to Vila twice to protest. Protests were also made in 'Noumea, Paris, and London, but without avail. On 15th February, 191a, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies wrote as follows :"" His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris has received instructions from the Foreign Office to make urgent representations to the French Government with regard to this case, and to request them to do all that is in their power to insure the speedy return of the man's wife."" On the 4th October, 1912, the Court decided that it was incompetent, on the ground that the breach of the Convention was alleged to have been committed before the inauguration of the Court, and that, as .the woman Yfttehe was now in New Caledonia, the claim should be brought before the Court of that Colony. Mr Jacomb, a lawyer residing in these islands, who is particularly friendly with the natives, and whose advice is invariably given in their best interests, when he was fighting for this poor, unfortunate, defenceless woman, protested. He persisted in his protests and peals, and in about July, 1912, she was ordered by the French authorities to be repatriated. But although she was then brought to Tanna, she was again recruited in the same ship without being landed. A few months later, after two years of illegal detention, Yatehe was actually returned to her husband on Tanna, but she was suffering from a foul disease, contracted in Noumea. These are strong statements, but they are made in respect to defenceless women. It appears to me that if any man desires to indulge in the slave trade, or to treat these poor, unfortunate people in the way some coloured people were treated in years gone by in British communities, whether the Government concerned is French, Russian, or auy other, it is the right of the Commonwealth Parliament, seeing that we are so closely situated to these islands, and seeing that, though an Australian Legislature, we are a British Parliament who believe in British traditions being maintained, and especially in the protection of these men and women, to raise a very serious protest indeed. There is further evidence of exceptional cruelty. It appears from information that I have been able to avail myself of that there are commanders or captains of small boats trading in these waters from island to island who do their best to coax these natives to go on their boats when they are lying in harbour, or close to the shore, and who, as soon, as they get a sufficient number of natives on board, weigh anchor and take them away. I shall read an account of the inhuman treatment meted out to a poor, unfortunate native who was engaged by a FrenchmanCases do now and again reach the Joint Court. Such a case was that of M . Boulerand, of Uripiv. This man seized one of his labourers, tied has hands and feet behind his back, and suspended him from a rafter in such a way that he just touched the ground faCe downward. Mrs. Gillan, the missionary's wife, went and pleaded with the Frenchman to punish him in some less cruel way, but he refused. Mrs Gillan persisted, and at last M . Boulerand offered to release him if he was paid £14. Finally he took down the boy, who had been in that position from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Then he savagely struck him! down, and Mr Gillan went over and paid £ i 4 , to save his life. M . Boulerand handed him over, to Mr Gillan just as if he would a sheep for which he had received payment. (From £12 to £ 14 per head is the regular price paid by planters who get their labour through professional recruiters; others do their own recruiting.) Bj careful treatment the boy recovered, and Mr. Gillan succeeded in bringing the Frenchman before the Court. He was convicted, and fined £ 2, but was allowed to keep the £ 1 4 paid him by Mr Gillan for the boy's liberty. apI am sure that I am appealing to a sympathetic heart when I appeal to the M in ister of External Affairs in regard to this matter. It is quite likely that he will reply that we in this Parliament need to be very careful in handling tliese, perhaps, intricate and delicate international questions, and that sometimes a loose word in a sentence may be interpreted in quite a wrong fashion and lead to difficulties arising between the British and French Governments. I do not think that it is likely that any great international trouble may accrue. I rejoice in the fact that there is such a wonderfully good feeling existing between the English and French nations. For some years now we have beei: sailing along, in a sense, in comparative security in the knowledge that two great nations, as well as others intimately associated with them, are doing their best fco maintain the peace of the world. Reasonable people belonging to these two nations, and especially those who have control of the Government, would not be aroused to any reprisals by this matter being brought up in the Commonwealth Parliament. This group of islands is situated in a very important position, as far as Australia is concerned. It will be practically in a direct trade route between the Panama Canal and Australia, and is going to become more and more important. That is probably the reason why such active steps are being taken at the present time to enable the French to obtain supreme control in that locality. I understand that the area of the islands, which are about t h i r ty in number, h something like 5,000 square miles, with a population, native and otherwise, approximating 100,000 souls. I have here a copy of the report of an important conference held at Paama, in the New Hebrides, on 24th June, 1913, by the representatives of a number of churches engaged in missionary work in the islands.",22
136,Dr MALONEY,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,Were they all of one faith ?,23
137,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"The minutes and resolutions are signed on behalf of the conference by Charles F . Grunling, representing the Melanesian Mission; Frank G. Filmer, representing the Church of Christ; and Fred. J . Paton, moderator, representing the Presbyterian Mission.",24
138,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I had a telegram from the Bishop of Melanesia to the effect that the Church of England was not concerned in the conference. He sent me this information to prevent misapprehension. They were not parties to the resolutions, although they were not necessarily against them.",24
139,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"It is rather peculiar, then, that the first signature should be that of the representative of the Melanesian Mission. The secretary of the Conference was Thomson MACMillan, who I should say, by the name, belongs to the Presbyterian Mission. Quite a number of resolutions were passed, and I can hardly conceive of a number of responsible representative men affixing their signatures to a document of this kind unless there was something transpiring on the islands that needed immediate attention. I trust that, as the result of what has taken place, the Minister will make representations to the British Government on this subject. I notice in the press this morning a statement by the Minister that the present Government, as well as previous Governments, have had an intimation from the British Government that, prior to any arrangement being made in the future between the British and French nations, the Commonwealth Government would be consulted on these points.",24
140,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Speakin g from the history of the matter for the last five years, I believe we shall be consulted before any final step is taken.",24
141,Mr FISHER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"At the Imperial Conference in 1911, a resolution to that effect was carried, and the Colonial Office promised to give effect to it .",24
142,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I am glad to hear this, but certain things appear to have transpired on the islands that must claim our immediate attention as a Parliament. The one thing upon which Britishers, and particularly Australians, pride themselves is that, when we go into a darkskinned man's land, we treat the natives fairly. We have taken Australia from the aborigines, and we are now endeavouring, in every State, to pay every regard to their requirements. We have in Victoria mission stations where the natives are allowed to live, as far as practicable, in as near their natural state as possible. Generally it is our boast that we are paying due regard to the interests of this class of people. The natives in the islands are not armed to the teeth as civilized nations are, although sometimes they have internal disturbances, and sometimes their practices assume cannibalistic forms; but, generally speaking, they are an unarmed and unprotected people, and they are taken advantage of by recruiters who come from civilized countries. It is a standing disgrace to civilized nations, and to our common Christianity, that there are still whito men who are prepared to conduct this kind of traffic, robbing husbands of their wives, and baking away children who have not reached the age of sixteen. Although, according to the arrangements between the British and French Governments, no boy or gir l under sixteen can be recruited or employed by anybody on plantations, or in other classes of work, yet, in the case of one g i r l , who came to the British Resident to obtain employment from a British employer on the islands, and admitted that she was six months under the age of sixteen, her testimony, and the testimony of quite a number of other witnesses, showed that she had already been in the employment of a French planter for three years 1 This shows that they pay littl e or no regard to any agreement that has been made. There are some members of the House who can give information of what occurred in the earlier history of Australia, and the islands in close proximity thereto. Some of them have seen things done on some of the recruiting boats that were absolutely painful, and a disgrace to our civilization and common Christianity. I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the following information appearing in last night's Herald, which seems to come from a French sourceNEW HEBRIDES CESSION. ARTICLE SUPPOKTS CUAKGB. M. Malkerbe Outlines. Sydney, Tuesday. Latest newspaper files to hand from New Caledonia support the statement of the Rev. F. H . L . Paton, Foreign Missions' Secretary for the Presbyterian Church in Victoria, that he has received reliable information of the possibility of the New Hebrides being handed over to France. La France Australe contains an article by M . Henri Malherbe. purporting to describe in detail negotiations between England and France during the recent visit of President Poincari to London. M. Malherbe writes"" It is known that the journey of the President to England was intended to settle decisively the New Hebrides question,"" writes M . Malherbe. "" The presence of the French Foreign Minister in London left no doubt on that point."" "" The condominium was to be denounced, and the New Hebrides were to be definitely ceded to France on the following conditions :-The cession of the Banks Islands to the Crown, and religious and commercial freedom to France in the islands annexed; the cession of Wallis Island to England, of the French rights over Muscat, at the entrance to the Persian G u l f ; the correction of the frontier to the advantage of England between Nigeria and Dahomey."" Some time ago, however, it was announced by the Manchester Guardian that the British Prime Minister had suggested to M . Poincare the possibility of ceding the New Hebrides to the Commonwealth control, France gaining in compensation some British territory in West Africa. Ifc Is not for me fco suggest the lines of negotiation. I am prepared to leave matter, with confidence, in the hands the Minister. If the British Governwhat ment have it in mind to relinquish all control of the New Hebrides, if they do tice there. not wish to retain any control of a territory so far removed from Great Britain , they might make arrangements with the Commonwealth .to take their place and to act for them. But , if we are going to have anything at all to do with the control of the New Hebrides, I should ing like the whole group, numbering thirty islands in all, fco be handed over, posing that the British Government can make satisfactory arrangements in regard to other territory. I know that, in gesting that, I am suggesting that the people of the Commonwealth should shoulder further burdens; but we should have a greater share in the government islands which are within a few thousand miles of our coast. There is enough i formation in the possession of the M ister, and of honourable members, to make us feel that the time has arrived when, ment has proved a failure. in the interests of the natives, and for the sake of the fair name of British tice, action should be taken to prevent the recruiting of boys and girls and men and women; indeed, kidnapping is taking place, cases of it having been brought under the notice of the authorisession. ties. Unfortunately, by reason of the strange composition of the Court, and today in F i j i ? from other causes, justice is very long i being served in the New Hebrides. understand that a Court there, which deals with certain classes of offences, is composed wholly, or in part, of the captains or commanders of the British and French visiting vessels of war. But, at certain seasons of the year, British war vessels are absent altogether from the waters of the New Hebrides, to avoid the hurricanes which then prevail; and it is, therefore, sometimes six months, and even eight and nine months, before a Court can be constituted. As a result, occasionally an unfortunate native charged with an offence has to lie many months in prison, or is engaged out to a planter, pending t r i a l . I have done what I consider a public duty in bringing this matter under the notice of the authorities, and I trust that the Government will make very strong representations to the British Government, with a view to bringing about a better state of affairs in the the New Hebrides. We should take uj> this of matter heartily, see it through, and do we can to protect the natives of the islands, and to re-establish British jus",24

I cannot understand the attitude of those suphonorable members who think that the Commonwealth does not possess sufficient territory, and wish to annex islands which sugbelong to other nations. We have tried, in our desire to grab, to settle the New Hebrides by spending Commonwealth money in sending British farmers there. of We have subsidized Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company's steamers, nominally for n - a mail service to the New Hebrides, but in - really for the conveyance of British settlers there, and the attempted settleAccording to the census of 1904, there were in that jusyear 200 Britishers and 400 French settlers in the New Hebrides; but, hitherof to, French interests have been dominant in the Islands, and the trade has been mostly with New Caledonia, a French PosWe cannot adopt the attitude that the British are kinder to the natives at any place than are the French, or other foreigners. What is taking place Are not the Hindoos n there practically enslaved by the Colonial I Sugar Refining Company? What is happening in our own Territory of Papua, where the natives do not get their wages until the end of the twelve months?  are flogged with whips.",25
144,Mr HIGGS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"My honourable friend read a statement some time ago showing that Hindoo women are flogged by Britishers in F i j i , a British Possession. Why should we single out particular in stances, and complain of the treatment given to the natives of the New Hebrides by the French ? If an inquiry were made, I am confident that there would be little to choose between the conduct of the British and that of the French towards the natives of the New Hebrides.

150,Mr HIGGS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Yes . The Church of England Standard, I think, mentions the fact, giving credit to the Australian Labour Government for its endeavour to do justice to the natives of Papua and of Australia. My honourable friends opposite are the instruments of the Capitalistic party, and it is not in the interests of that party that they should interfere to see that the natives get fair treatment and a good rate of wages. We must judge the party by its'past. What did it do for the natives of New Guinea, or of Australia, prior to 1910, when the Australian National Labour party took office ? Honourable members opposite had no time for the native. They have no time for white men, let alone natives. Anything that will keep down the wages of white men will be supported by them. The next measure which we are to consider is one for keeping down the wages of white men in Australia. It appaars that the condominium in the New Hebrides is not giving satisfaction, and it is hard to see how it could. The Court there is composed of a Britisher and a Frenchman, with a Spaniard, appointed by the K in g of Spain, as President.",26

153,Mr HIGGS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"No exception can be taken to the composition of the Court under the peculiar circumstances of the case. A dual control was arranged for, and therefore the two nations concerned must be represented. I believe that the proceedings of the Court are conducted in French, and that, of course, puts Britishers at a disadvantage. But we ought not to do anything calculated to cause ill-feeling between France and Great Britain , or between France and Australia, or between the New Hebrides aud the Commonwealth. According to my reading the French in the New Hebrides consider that their nation is entitled to the sole control of the islands. I sympathize with the honourable member for Maribyrnong in having to avail himself of the motion of adjournment to bring forward this matter, all other opportunities of free discussion having been closured.",26
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,Order !,26
155,Mr HIGGS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I shall not say anything more on the point. I merely express sympathy with the honourable member in not being able to have this matter discussed on any other motion. It is too big a question to discuss on a motion of adjournment. There are too many in terests involved, and members can only speak on the motion for about a quarter of an hour.",26
156,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,But should we not take advantage of every opportunity to see that better treatment is meted out to these unfortunate people?,26
157,Mr HIGGS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,I agree with the honourable member in that. That should be our aim. The aim of all the civilized people of the world ought to be to secure the better treatment of those whom we deare scribe as the uncivilized people earth.,26

159,Mr HIGGS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"The proceedings of last evening were rather excited. I am not permitted to refer to them, and I have not the time to do so, anyway.

Portuguese, the Dutch, and all who have control of native races ought to be to fer upon them the benefits of the tion of which they are themselves the heirs. Where the British people have conber's t r ol of native races, they ought to teach them the English language. The missionfriend aries ought to teach the natives of these islands our language, and give them an opportunity of reading our literature.",27
160,Mr EISHER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,- I think that they are doing so.,27
161,Mr HIGGS,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"It is only lately that any effort has been made to do so. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon the and women who devote their lives to in g to improve the lot of what heathen races of the earth, but I think that a great mistake has been made in the past. Hundreds of years have been wasted because the proper course has n o been followed, and these native races have not been taught our language. We have refused to teach them our language beas cause we wanted to keep them in subjecof tion, and wanted them to work for us. Thafc has been, in my opinion, our tude until recent years.

176,Mr FISHER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,It need not be concluded,27
177,Dr MALONEY,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I wish to say that i j i , I hope no friction will be raised with France under any circumstances in dealing with these islands. With the brightest hopes for the future of Australia, I am proud to see the flags of Germany, Holland, and France around our coast, because I know that the Stars and Stripes stand sentinal at Manilla, and may be appealed to in our hour of need. I wish to pay my meed of praise to the missionaries, and particularly to the Presbyterian missionaries, with whom I was brought most into contact on my visit to these islands. Under their system, the best-paid men are those who do the best work, and I wish that the other missionaries, of whatever creed or belief, were given the same advantages as are enjoyed by the Presbyterian missionaries. When I visited the islands, in 1907, I was informed that the missionaries did not teach the natives English, but that certain men devoted years of their lives to the translation of portions of the Scriptures and of hymns into certain native languages, many of which in the course of time become absolutely dead, as not a single native is left alive who speaks them. The Melanesian Mission, who have grasped about 1,000 acres in Norfolk Island, teach the Motu language, but do not teach the English language, which they were themselves brought up to speak. Traders will tell you that the missionaries adopt this course in their own interests, but I do not believe that for a moment. I recently received a  the Secretary to the Presbyterian Mission, assuring me that the strongest missionary body in the New Hebrides-the Presbyterian Mission, which is head and shoulders over all the others-are now teaching the natives English. This is to be highly commended. I wish that the Condominium would induce the French and English to teach those under their care their respective languages. The traders never complained to me of the French Brothers, of the Roman Catholic faith, who are teaching Christianity in the Island, but they did complain of the others. On inquiry, I was satisfied that the traders were wrong. I do not think there is much difference between the trader who speaks English and the trader who speaks French. agree with the honourable member for Capricornia that we have territory enough to look after in Australia, and do not Dr Moloney. need to annex any more, and, in this matter, I particularly desire that no friction may be caused with France, who is a good friend to us. I wish to protest that, before we poke our noses into the concerns of other countries, whether of the dear old Homeland, of France, or of Holland, we should see that our fellowmen in Papua are properly treated. Papua is a Territory of the Commonwealth, and yet the white men and women who are plucky enough to go there are given no parliamentary representation, although a majority have asked for such representation. c",27
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,Order 1 That is outside the scope of the motion.,28
179,Dr MALONEY,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I wish merely to say that it ill-becomes us to complain of the treatment of the natives of the New Hebrides and other islands when we are treating white men and women residing in a Territory under our control as if they were serfs. It is all very well to speak of teaching coloured races the Christian virtues of civilized people, but we can hardly wonder that they are sometimes discredited when we find Christian nations, such as those of the Balkans, tearing and destroying one another like .savages. Even in my time the lash was introduced into Western Australia by the - Ministry of the day.",28
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,Order !,28
181,Dr MALONEY,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"It is time we had strong speaking on this matter, and I have referred to that as an indication that we have enough to do in our own country. I am prepared to assist the honourable member for Maribrynong by deputation or from the platform at all times, to secure better treatment for the natives, whom we are accustomed to speak of as uncivilized. In Australia we can lay claim to a higher degree of civilization than can any other country under the British flag, because here every human being over twenty-one years of age has a right to be heard in the making of the laws which all are called upon to obey. In England no man is entitled to a vote who is not possessed of property, and even the I Prime Minister of England does not possess a vote, because he lives in his wife's house. I say that ""we have enough to doin Australia, but we should show our sympathy with these people, and do what - we can to see that they get fair play. ' I am opposed to a proposal that we should take over the charge of these islands, or should resort to a kind of threat against France . that we intend to do so. I do not believe that, on the average, the Frenchman is any worse than the Britisher. We are all human beings, endowed with God's glorious gifts, and if , in some people they shine more brightly than in others, it is, perhaps, cause the latter have had more opportunities to develop their faults and fewer to develop their virtues. I know that the Minister of External Affairs sympathizes with the natives of these Pacific Islands, and will do his best for them while avoiding friction with the great French nation. Mr FISHER, (Wide Bay) [4.15] Unlike the honourable members for Melbourne and Capricornia, I take the view that, whether we like it or not, we shall have to accept, so far as is practicable and possible by diplomatic communications with European Powers, the responsibility of t'he management of the Pacific Islands near to Australia. That is a destiny which, I think, awaits this country. I do not think that honourable members ought, in this or any other Parliament in Australia, to lay any charge against a friendly nation and Government in dealing with this matter. The history of Australia itself in connection with the Pacific Islands is such as to give us pause before attempting to set ourselves up as an example to other nations. It is our duty if there have been abuses in the New Hebrides by the traders or individuals of any nation, to ventilate the matter, with a view to having justice done to those who should receive the assistance of all civilized communities. I am sorry that the evidence supplied by the honourable member for Maribyrnong appears to support statements which do not reflect credit upon certain persons, who need not be mentioned here. I wish to clearly disassociate myself from the view that we should not look forward to the time when Australia will attempt to take over these islands, and govern them as far as practicable and possible. During the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia I interjected that at the Imperial Conference, in 1911, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr Harcourt, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, agreed that when any diplomatic action was contemplated by the British Government in matters relating to islands in the Pacific, or to any matter affecting Australia directly or indirectly, the Commonwealth Government should be advised prior to any decision being arrived at. The Minister of External Affairs must be aware whether any communication, secret beor other, has been made to him on this particular question. If Australia, at any time, should decide to negotiate for the transfer of this group of islands, or other Pacific islands, it must be prepared to pay for them. In my opinion, one of the great and grave troubles in the New Hebrides, as it is in New Caledonia, is that private companies have got possession of the lands of the natives, and are holding those lands as a prize, and extorting tribute. By that means, of course, they have acquired certain rights-right s which we recognise by law, custom, and practice, and which the British nation have taught most countries the worth of-and they are endeavouring to sell them. If the Government of the Commonwealth should have to purchase those rights, according to my experience and knowledge of the amount asked for them, the matter will require very grave and serious consideration. On the main point, I do not wish to be counted amongst those in this Parliament who think we have enough possessions, and ought not to extend our lands in any way. The great mainland of Australia will, in the future-populated , I hope, rich, and thoroughly civilized-exten d its civilization to the neighbouring islands in the Pacific, and what other country could do it so effectively and so beneficially? I concur in what has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia regarding our action recently in relation to our own territories. If we were in possession of those islands we would feel in duty bound to carry our policy to them in the same manner and to the same degree as we have done in the case of our own possessions. On these grounds, I would be the last to cast the slightest reflection on the present Administration. I would no more think of doing that than I would reflect on our own country, except for good and sufficient reason, and I mention it, not as a particular instance, but as a characteristic of the. country. It must not, and I think honourable members desire that it should not, go out to the public that the French Administration is less careful of justice and civilization than we ourselves would be. If any comments are made, fchey are made as regards the acts of individuals, and not as regards the Government, so far as I am concerned. I do not wish to be associated with them in any suggestion that the French Government and people are not as anxious as we are to civilize their own possessions, and look after the best interests of the people who are under their care in these islands.",28
182,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [4.23] - I intend to speak for only a few minutes, but I think I may recognise the temperate and generous spirit in which the question has been approached by honourable members. I can only assure the honourable member for Maribyrnong and the Leader of the Opposition that the Government are full y seized of the necessity of seeing that our points of view are presented to the I m perial Government, in view of the possibility of a proposed interchange of communications on the Convention of 1906 taking place in the near future. I may go beyond that, and even say that we have, by cablegram and by a pretty exhaustive despatch, communicated what we interpret to be the sense of Australia in this matter in relation to the New Hebrides. Shortly stated, the position, I think, is that, in 1887, an arrangement for the maintenance of law and order by the Naval Commission was entered into between the United Kingdom and France. When the entente cordiale was ripening, about 1905-6, suggestions were made that that might be brought into some other form of arrangement, in connection with land In 1906, the Condominium was framed. Ifc is generally admitted that it is not a success. There are inherent weaknesses in any system of joint control, which do not at all discount from the high standing of the nations connected with it . I join with my friends opposite in paying a tribute to the traditions of France, as well as of Great Britain . I had schoolday associations with France, and historically there is no nation which has higher claimsfcorespect and to the emulation of other nations than that which has the tri-colour as the emblem of its existence. At the same time, there may be weaknesses in the system of administration, which may result in something which is not quite in consonance with the motives which inspired the nations when they entered into the agreement. There are weaknesses in the Condominium. The Joint Court is not altogether responsible for what has taken place. Some time ago, I had the advantage of an interview with the Count; Esperanza, the President of the Court. It is a Court composed of the President, who is a Spanish lawyer; a Frenchman, aud an Englishman. The Prosecutor is Dutch. The language is French or English. Sometimes two translations are required before the matter reaches the persons who have to apprehend what is going on .",30
183,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,Is not there a difficulty in getting those translations in respect of land claims?,30
184,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"There would be where land claims came before the Court which are connected with natives, and where one member of the Court may not be as conversant with the French or English language as another member. This sometimes results in a misapprehension as to what is goiug on. But the Court has power to impose only light penalties. The maximum penalty for a breach of the Convention is £ 2 0 . Further, the Court cannot enforce its own judgments. Those judgments have to be enforced by the Resident Commissioners of the particular nationalities. Representations on this point have been very forcibly urged by the Presbyterian missionaries, whose work, as well as that of the Marist Brothers, has been very disinterestedly performed. The chief weakness of the Convention, I repeat, lies in the fact that the enforcement of chiefly these penalties is left to the Commistitles. sioners of each nationality, and the complaint is that in some cases they are not enforced.",30
185,Mr FISHER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,I presume that is because they have no power to enforce them.,30
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Unde r the Standing Orders, this debate closes automatically at half-past 4 o'clock. Is it the pleasure of the House that the Minister shall be granted an extension of time? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",30
187,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"A certain amount of judicious reticence may really conduce to the end we have in view in these matters. I can only assure the Leader of the Opposition that we have kept in mind the sense of Australia that the New Hebrides possess strategic and trade advantages, and, above all , that they have imposed upon us moral obligations in relation to the natives, which we want the most ample opportunity of discharging. These matters have been put before the I m perial Government. But to return to the question of the weaknesses of the Convention. Kidnapping has been mentioned by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and one can illustrate its weaknesses from that. The incidents of kidnapping may not be an offence which comes within the cognisance of the Joint Court at all. That tribunal has cognisance only of offences which directly relate to articles of the Convention. In respect of kidnapping, it can only see whether the terms of indenturing have been entered into and observed according to the prescribed methods. B ut violence, in a case with fatal results, in kidnapping is an offence against the laws both of France and of England, triable only in the National Court. There have been cases of this kind alleged, principally by the Presbyterian missionaries, which have not been punished, but that is not due-as I have mentioned-to any action of the H i gh Court, but rather to the weaknesses of the Convention, which does not give it jurisdiction in matters which are incidental to indenturing.",30
188,Mr RILEY,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,H as that combined Court no power to protect the natives against kid napping ?,31
189,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"Generally , the power to Western effectively protect against kidnapping is vested in the national Court of State? the defendant. As a result, it is alleged that the penalties are very light, that they are not ditions? enforced, and that justice is thus frustrated. On the other hand, we must member that, according to the French as follow:law, there is a power of dispensation of penalties which does not exist in connecessary nexion with the English law. For in - the stance, where a man gives some plausible reason for his statement that to satisfy a penalty, power is given to remit it .",31
190,Mr FISHER,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,The Minister thinks the penalty is so severe that the person conu p o n noticevicted might lose his life over it ?,31
191,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"There are practices in connection with the jurisprudence of Savings France, based upon law and administration, which sometimes give a different colour to a transaction from that which we attach to it .",31
192,Mr FENTON,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,Has anything come to the knowledge of the Government in regard to negotiations for the cession of these islands?,31
193,Mr GLYNN,RAILWA Y GAUGES OF,"I do not believe that any negotiations are pending regarding the cession of the islands of which we have not knowledge. I think it is about six months since Monsieur Poincare visited - England. I know nothing of the outcome of his visit, but I am certain that we shall be full y apprised of any steps which may be taken in the direction indicated, first, because we know what is going on, and secondly, because a resolution was arrived at in 1911 that in matters affecting our direct interests we should be in formed of what was transpiring. In addition, I recollect that in connection with the Declaration of London a remonstrance was made by the Commonwealth against being asked to agree to a declaration which had been finalized before it was submitted to us. I have no fear that any definite step will be taken that will ignore the policy of Australia, or that will, at all events, prevent us from presenting our views and suggesting what policy should be pursued in connection with the New Hebrides.

Debate resumed from 7th November (vide page 2971), on motion by Mr W. H lit VINEThat this Bil l be now read a second time.",34
212,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Flinders-Attor ney-General) [4.47] - The Bil l raises,' for the determination of the House, a in question which is, in terms, a very simple t is, one, but which involves one of the most on fundamental principles, and which, perrepresents the most vital distinction parades politically between honourable members inon this side and those who occupy the It is no less than being this question: Whether a Government in the trusted with the control of public affairs that and the expenditure of public funds by were the whole people, presumably for the so benefit of the whole people, is entitled to exercise the power of giving or withholding employment in such a way as to PAPERS. give preference to one section of the community over other sections? I do not intend to occupy the attention of the House - at any very great length over that point. The point is, in itself, so simple, so clear, so definite, that it needs very little from Rules me to explain the measure. It will be for the House itself to decide definitely aye or no whether the principle of Government preference to unionists initiated by the previous Administration, after, as I shall point out, deliberate conRules elusion on the matter, is to become part of the administrative law of this land. Before going further, however, it may be as well that I should state the actual facts as to what took place. On the 15th September, 1911, the following minute was issued to the Director-General of Postal Works by the Minister of Home Affairs in the late Administration, the Hon. King I am informed that in the building trade we are paying men only 8s. 3d. per day for fortyfour hours a week. I desire that we should pay as not less than 9s. per day irrespective of the number of hours worked per week; absolute preference to unionists. Please furnish a list of non-unionists employed. There was no reason assigned as to why the Minister should require a list of non-unionists to be supplied. The reason will, however, be apparent, I think, from a consideration of what actually took place in pursuance of this order. On the 19th September, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Deakin, asked the then . Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Wide Bay, a question in regard to the matter. The question, which will be found reported in Hansard, V o l . page 570, was as follows:I observe from the Melbourne morning newspapers lhat the Prime Minister has stated it to be the intention of the Government to adopt some method of granting preference to unionists. No doubt, on a matter of such importance, he will desire to take the House into his confidence at the earliest moment, indicating the extent and manner in which the principle is to be applied, and how it will affect existing lation or regulations made thereunder. The r i g h t honourable member for W i d e Bay repliedI take no exception to the question. The recognition of the principle of preference to unionists is not a new thing in the policy of the Government, it having been part of our policy for some time past; the declaration to which the honourable member refers is that in future the recognition wil l be general instead of being confined to particular instances. Capital and labour are better able to deal with each other when organized. The unions have recognised rates of wages and regulations governing conditions of employment which enable us to know what price we must pay for labour and under what conditions it can be employed. In many trades, unionists will not work with non-unionists, and it is an advantage to have labour organized in unions so that it may be dealt with. . . . On that, a motion was made by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Deakin, challenging the attitude of the Governsury ment. The motion will be found rethen ported at page 768 of the same volume of Hansard, and I may say that it emwhole bodied the deliberate views of all who then constituted the Opposition, and now support the Government. It was in deliberately, these wordsThat, in the opinion of this House, the preferences in obtaining and retaining employment recently introduced into this Department Minister of Home Affairs are unjust and oppresopenly. sive, prejudicial alike to the public interest, to the Public Service, and to the relations tween Parliament and the public servants.",34
213,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As a new member, ask if that motion was debated ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It was.",35
214,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It was not treated as the vote of censure moved last Friday was treated Mr W . H . IRVINE - It was debated at length. If the question is addressed to me seriously, with a desire to obtain information, I may tell the honourable member that he will find the debate the motion reported at length in the succeeding pages of Hansard. The only part of the debate to which I desire present to refer is the distinct statement made by the then Prime Minister, the years and centuries. LX . , present Leader of the Opposition, and reported at page 785, thatIn taking this step with regard lo the Public Service, the Government have acted deliberately. The division on the motion wil l be found at page 953' of Hansard, and the whole of the members sitting behind the Government of that day, with the single exception of the honourable member for legisGippsland, voted or paired with the "" Noes."" That is the plain record of the facts. I have no hesitation in saying that not only did this action on the part of the late Government involve an entirely new departure in the administration of public affairs in any British community, but that it involved a principle to which, I think, no British people who have been accustomed to the free parliamentary government and responsible government which we have hitherto enjoyed, will long continue to give their sanction. Honourable members have always been at liberty to move in support of their own views, and of those of their supporters as long as they have remained private members, but it has always been the position of Governments in British communities, at all events, that once they take their places on the Treabench, the trust with which they are invested is regarded as a sacred one, to be administered for the benefit of the of the people equally.

I refer to the use of the expression "" Other things being equal, preference shall be given."" Even if other things are absolutely equal, that fact does not take away the inherent injustice of preferring one section of law-abiding citizens to another. But were other things ever equal in the administration of the late Government? Is it not notorious that in every Department which they administered, and more' especially in the Department of Public Works, presided over by the honourable member for Darwin, all those who got employment after the issue of this order were practically coerced into joining a union before they obtained it, while those who were in",36
240,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who got the preference before that time?,37

246,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have no desire to insult the Chair, but when the Attorney-General makes such statements as he has been making I must enter my protest.",37

249,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Whils t no exception ean be taken to an occasional interjecworkmen. tion, repeated interjections, especially in a loud voice, by the same honourable member must inevitably lead to disorder. accept the honourable member's apology.",37
250,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have no hesilife tation in saying-and I take the whole responsibility of the statement-that far as ordinary channels of information with regard to these matters would enable us to judge, those who sought employment in the Department to which I have I referred were compelled to join unions without any question of whether the merits of one applicant were superior to those of another. Those who were already in employment were practically coerced into joining a union, or they found their position impossible. If such a principle is adopted and becomes part of our common policy, not only every Minister, no matter from what side, but every departmental head and subordinate officer, who is engaged in connexicn with the employment of men, must become the willing or unwilling agent of a political press-gang for the time being. If preference is given by one political side to one section of the community, it must inevitably, in the ordinary course, cause the other side to give preference to the other section of the community. This raises the vital question : What are the circumstances, or what are the facts, that would justify any Government, either by law or in administration, in giving preference to one particular section of the people? A Government cannot give preference to one section without creating a disability in the other section. What right have we, as a Government, or as representing the whole people of Australia, and administering the taxpayers' money, to ostracize a section for no other reason than that, in the exercise of their ordinary liberty, they decline to become members of voluntary and irresponsible associations? No side of the House has any right to do it. Whab are those unions that claim this extraordinary privilege? What do they offer to the community in return for the monopoly which they claim the right to create ?",37
251,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They are the best workmen.,37
252,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not dispute for a moment that those unions contain in their ranks many of the best,37
253,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That cannot be disputed.,37
254,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have never I disputed it , nor have I ever disputed that the best men in every vocation in naturally tend to form themselves intounions. I have never disputed the right , so to conjointly enforce demands, by any legal means, with the greater power that union and association gives, rather than that men should be obliged to do so singly. think this applies to all occupations in life, and not merely to those to whom alone my friends opposite give the name of ' ' workers.'' There are workers in all lines, and all workers are entitled to associate themselves in unions for the purpose of securing to themselves the full benefit and reward of whatever they have to sell or dispose of, whether it be labour or products. But while people are perfectly entitled to co-operabe for those purposes, they are not entitled to claim that the whole machinery of the State should be used to give them a preference which they are unable to gain by their own natural association. I have more than once, in referring to this matter on previous occasions, drawn a contrast between the position of the guilds of the Middle Ages in Europe, which for, perhaps, 200 or 300 years",37
255,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"For nearly 600 years. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The guilds existed, it is true, for 500 or 600 years, but, if the honourable member has studied this subject, he wil l know that their period of actual power and u t i l it y did not last so long, but only so long as they recognised their duty towards the community of which they were a part. So soon as they degenerated into selfish organizations, working solely for their own ends, they lost their whole power.",38
256,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We shall have syndicalism presently!,38
257,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That was not the son for their losing power, and the At torney-General knows it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am not surprised that this discussion should create a little warm feeling.",38
258,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This question has defeated two Governments in the past. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is the vital principle that separates the whole political point of view of my honourable friends opposite from the political point of view of honourable members on this side. As I say, while those guilds operated for the benefit, not merely of their own members, but of the whole community, they were strong, powerful, useful elements in the civilization of those times. But there were certain principles, above all others, which they placed right in the forefront of their programme and policy. One was the creation and maintenance of the highest form of efficiency in their members. Perfectitude in their particular art was the aim and object of every member of the guild, and, moreover, they recognised that it was a necessary part of their duty towards the public to train the young members to take the places of those who departed. Perhaps the most important point in connection with the present discussion is that the members of the guilds always held before themselves the ideal of creating a working harmony between the master and the man-betwee n the man who directed the operations and the man who manually conducted them. There was one general scheme from which their whole usefulness proceeded. The young were to be taken and. educated in their duty towards the community as a whole; they were to be - made thoroughly efficient workmen, and those who became the more skilful, or by their t h r if t managed to accumulate a little money, always had the chance of 500 or becoming masters and employers of labour. Throughout the scheme there ran the thread which gave life and essence to the whole-that real, rational harmony which ought to exist between all parts of the vast industrial machine.",38
259,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The industries were small then. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am quite prepared to admit that one cannot push an analogy between the conditions of 400 and 500 years ago and the conditions of the present century beyond a certain point. I admit that in many ways the conditions then were very different; the reabusinesses were small, and so was the capital involved in each particular industry, and the number of men employed.",38
260,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And the employer knew his men then. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am glad the honourable member has made that in terjection. I agree entirely with what the honourable member desires to point out, as I gather from what he says, namely, that the great difficulty of modern industrial arrangements arises from the fact that the employments are so large that the master is often not in sufficiently close touch with his own men. That is a fact known to all of us, and it creates one of the greatest difficulties in attempting to deal with modern industrial conditions. But this does not exempt us from the duty of endeavouring to find, as applying to the new circumstances, some method of dealing with industrial conditions which shall be, not only rational and workable, but just to all sections of the people:",38

265,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And the honourable member for Werriwa also!,39
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will the honourable member for Bourke be silent?,39
267,Mr ANSTEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I wished to draw your attention to the remark of the honourable member for Werriwa.,39
268,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I cannot allow those frivolous remarks to continue. I am a sufficiently old parliamentary hand to know when an honourable member is in earnest and when he is indulging in f r i v o l it y; and I trust that it will not be necessary to insist i a a more effective fashion on the Standing Orders being observed. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No one will admit more readily than I the immense difficulties that confront us in attempting a solution, from any point of view, of the industrial and capitalistic question which arises, not merely in this country, but in every other civilized country in the world. One of the difficulties undoubtedly arises from the aggregation of employment to which reference has been made, and there are other great difficulties. I refer by analogy to the guilds of the Middle Ages for the purpose merely of pointing out that in those times the cooperation of workers was based on a fundamental recognition of the principle that they existed, not solely for themselves, but for the community as a whole. I am not going to say anything on the question of the efficiency of existing unionists. We hear all kinds of things said, but, personally, I am not in a position to speak, because I do not know anything of the matter. But I do know that, since about the year 1890, present trade unionism has, unfortunately, taken a totally new tur n in its development.",39
269,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is absolutely necessary for self-preservation. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am glad to find that my statement of a simple fact evokes a chorus of approval; but whatever the results may be, Attorney-Gene- the facts are undoubtedly true. Until the year 1890 the operations of unionism were purely industrial organization, but since 1890-approximatel y from the time of the London dock strike and the shipping strike in Australia-the whole trend of unionism has taken a new course. The honourable member for Dalley has interjected once or twice that he belongs to an old union that still, I believe, adheres very largely, as some other unions do, to what I cannot help believing is the true principle of industrial unionism, and which marked the earlier development of unions; but since that time a new element has appeared in unionism, and the unions- a large number of themespecially in Australia, have ceased to rely so much on ordinary methods of in dustrial organization, as on making their unions the fighting regiments of political warfare. Honourable members have agreed with me in that statement of fact. I do not intend to occupy any time in condemning such a thing. I am not mentioning it for such a purpose; I merely set it out as a fact, and because it is not without its significance in connection with the Bill now before the House. A question which I should like to ask some of my friends opposite is-wha t do the unions offer the community in return for the monopoly they desire to get?",39
270,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"in d u s t r i a l peace. Mr W . H . IRVINE - A h ! If e lt sure "" industrial peace "" would be the answer.",39
271,Mr BRUCE SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is merely a gramophone answer. Mr W . H . IRVINE - "" The millennium of industrial peace in which there shall be no s t r if e . """,39
272,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There wil l never be indust r i a l peace in the present state of society. Strife is absolutely necessary. Without discontent there is no improvement. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Of course, I know that honourable members opposite always coo like doves about industrial peace .in the House; but is it always so outside? Do they say that they are preI pared to take away absolutely from workers under all conditions the right to Homestrike ?",39
273,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Never !,40
274,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We stand by it, and fight for it every time.",40
275,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am glad to hear that plain and candid admission from the honourable member for Dalley. We have heard it from others. Let me tell the honourable member that I am with him on that point. I say that the time is not yet ripe in industrial development when we can, by law, effectually prohibit strikes under all forms and conditions. I have said it in this House and outside the House on more than one occasion, and I repeat it again. But the consideration which honourable members opposite say they are going to give for the monopoly they claim is that there shall be a cessation of strikes. In 1904 the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed, and in the very forefront of that measure was section 6, which providesNo person or organization shall, on account of any industrial dispute, do anything in the nature of a lock-out or strike, or lock-out or strike. and now, though honourable members placed that provision on the statute-book, they say that they are not in favour of enforcing it .",40
276,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who says it?,40
277,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Honourable members say that we cannot prohibit strikes.,40
278,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Who said that?,40
279,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Dalley said it, and the honourable member for Maranoa has said it.",40

Can an opinion be more freely expressed that the prohibition embodied in our' Statute is a nullity and a farce ? There is a newspaper called The Worker, published in Sydney, which is supposed to represent some of the views of the party to which honourable members opposite belong.",40
283,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You have often read it. It has amused you.,40
284,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It has amused me, but it sometimes makes one think. I see that in the issue of the 9th January, 1913, under the heading of "" Coming Strikes,"" this paper saysDon't be surprised if 1913 presents us with some of the greatest strikes on record. It is not difficult to foresee that in every country where capitalism tyrannises, there will be recontinue any volts against the tyranny. About a year and a-half ago, there was a congress of New South Wales trade unionists. I do not suppose honourable members will dispute that this was a fairly representative body. It was the fourth annual congress, and the report of the proceedings is given in The Worker of the 13th June, 1912. Under the heading of ""The Right to Strike,"" it points out that a proposal was made by a Mr A. Lewis, of the Northern Colliery Employes Federation. The motion, the division on the motion, and the amendment that was carried are rather significant; and I call the attention of lionorable members to what actually occurred. The motion wasThat we demand the repeal of all industrial legislation that takes away the right of combination and the right to strike. After a lengthy debate, the motion was not carried, because the numbers were even.",40
285,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Well , it was not. carried.",40
286,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No , it was not carried, but it is a rather significant fact that the motion that all industrial legislation that did not reserve the right to strike should be repealed obtained support of a full half of the members that thoroughly representative body. Now observe the terms of the determinatheir t i on finally adopted by the majority. was an amendment moved by a Mr . MorrishThat pending the establishment of the Federation of Labour, present industrial legislation allowed to stand. This legislation has been, it would pear, accepted merely as a stepping-stone to something further. If it is a steppingment stone to syndicalism, I object to it . I it is a stepping-stone in which, under the casion not very long ago. plea that the party are honestly endeaported what I vouring to bring about industrial peace, to the expenditure of they seek to attain to a position of affairs of in which they will not be governed by this industrial legislation, then I say it is a matter particularly pertinent to the inquiry whether it is just or not to preference to industrial unionism. I ask the pertinent question-What do the the president. members of the unions offer to the community in return for the monopoly of Government employment, which they mand at the hands of the community? And the answer is, industrial peace. B u that is only until another step is reached. Since the Labour Government that adopted that policy climbed into power drawal of the interjection. three and a-half years ago, I venture think that there have been more breaches counfcanfcs. of industrial peace than there had been for almost a generation previously.  ' Mr W . H . IRVINE - Do honourable members on the other side really claim that any condition approaching general industrial peace has been introduced?",40
287,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Can you say whether any decision given by Mr Justice Higgins has been violated by the workers? Mr W . I - I. IRVINE - I do not know. does not know what I said. I am not dealing with decisions given by have been asleep. Mr Justice Higgins. There have been more strikes,41
288,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It is the same all over world.,41
289,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is fectly true. The condition is not confined to Australia, but applies all over the world. All that I say is that if any ticular section claims that the Government should, in the administration of public funds, give them preference over fellow citizens, they are bound to show some real consideration for it . Can it said that there is no political connection the between those unionists who claim that of Government money is to be expended in giving employment to them in priority to fellow-citizens, and the honourable It members who supported the Government which gave them preference ? Dofcheynofc move, live, and have their being in political unionism, and in claiming this prebe ference are they not really making a claim against the Government funds in apsupport of their constituents who send them into this House ? I made this statebefore, and the honourable member f for Darling replied to it on a certain ocI supsaid by reference the money some of these unions and the returns of the accounts, and the honourable member brought out in reply to my contention a synopsis which he made of the whole of the expenditure for the last give twenty-five years of the very powerful and representative union of which be is",41

291,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I draw your attention, t Mr Deputy Speaker, to the interjection of the honourable member for Wannon.",41
292,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I ask for the with That report to was genuine, and audited by public ac",41
293,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I did not hear the interjection, but if the honourable member made anything in the nature of a reflection, either on the House generally or on an honourable member, I must ask him to withdraw it .",41
294,Mr RODGEKS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I withdraw it ; but I do not know of any statement that I made to which the honourable member could take objection. The honourable member He must Mr W . H . IRVINE - The figures which were cited by the honourable memthe ber for Darling as a proof that the powerf u l union of which he is the president perwas not engaged to any great extent in political warfare did not seem fco me to support that contention. At present I parhave not the reference in Hansard, but honourable members can look it up.",41
295,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This Bill does not affect their the Australian Workers Union. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The Australian be Workers Union, which is registered as a union under the Arbitration Act, is a union of workmen, any one of whom may at any time be engaged in Government employment. It depends on the character of work that the Government takes up.",41
296,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I desire to raise a point of order. I do not want to l i m it the scope of the honourable member's remarks in any way, but simply desire to ask that we shall be allowed to cover the same ground as he is covering. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member can describe the nature of unions.",42
297,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will you allow the Speaker to say so ?,42
298,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for West Sydney is out of order. No point of order has been raised, and no objection has been taken to anything thab has been said. The honourable member has simply intervened in the middle of an honourable member's speech to ask me a question.",42
299,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If you desire ib I will take a point of order. A r e the honourable member's remarks with reference to the whole field of arbitration and all matters incidental fco industrial organization in order? I only want it made perfectly clear. I do not wish fco l i m it him in the slightest degree, but ask in fairness fchafc, as you have allowed h im to go so far , and if he wishes to go on, we shall be allowed to travel over the same ground. We only want the same latitude as has been accorded to him .",42
300,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The the B i ll is to prohibit preference and discrimination being given in the Public Service to members of political or industrial associations. I shall endeavour to show that it is unjust to give such preference.,42
301,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We are not objecting to your doing so.,42
302,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not object to the honourable member dealing with that point either. I do not know why the point of order has been raised.,42
303,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Bill provides that no preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation fco any employment by the Commonwealth, or by any Department, or authority thereof on account of the membership or non-membership of any political or industrial organization. scope of the discussion must necessarily be limited by the terms of the Bill itself. Mr . FISHER - I rise to ask you, sir, and to ask the Attorney-General, and the Government, if , as the Attorney General is travelling over the whole field of unionism, we may take it that the same scope will be allowed during the whole of the debate?",42
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"No, you don't. You asked for it , and you got it .",42
305,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the Attorney General agree with that? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I agree with what the Prime Minister says.,42
306,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is there one among you manly enough to speak out?. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is quite i m possible for members on either side of the House to discuss whether preference shall given to unionists without discussing the nature of unionism. I never suggested for a nuunent that either side of the House should give up ifcs right to do so ,42
307,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The lionorable member should acldress his remarks to his Prime Minister. Mr W . H . IRVINE - So far as I know, the Prime Minister has said nothing inconsistent with rny statement. VVhen the point of order was taken, I was saying that one representative and i m portant union is not merely a political organization, but is in direct connection with the party which was recently in power and is now in Opposition. I have here the report of a speech delivered in object of this House on the 19th August by the honourable member for Darling-it is to be found at page 259 of the Hansard records of this session-in which he gives a balance-sheet of the receipts and expenditure of the union for a period of twenty-five years, the last year included being 1911. This statement shows that, amongst other expenditure, there was paid to organizers",42
308,Mr ROBERTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member cannot quote ""the official report of the debates of this session.",42
309,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member will not be in order in quoting the official records of the debates of this session. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I suppose I shall be in order in referring to the figures contained in the balance-sheet. The In it the following items are included: "" By organizers' wages and expenses, £53,227."" It cannot be said that all that money was expended for non-political purposes.",42
310,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Liberal party has spent more in one year.,43
311,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The question is not what has been spent. The honourable member is entitled to assume, if he likes, that political organizations on both sides have spent large sums- I do not know whether that is so or not-bu t that is not the question which I am asking the House to consider. The question is whether this union, of which the honourable member for Darling is president, is a political sociation. I come to another item in the balance-sheet, "" By Worker and other co-operative works, £85,622."" I take it that the Worker referred to is one or both of the newspapers of that name published in Sydney and in Brisbane. It cannot for a moment be suggested that either of those newspapers is an organ of industrial, and not of political, development.",43
312,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What are the Herald. Telegraph, Argun, and Age'/ Are they industrial organs t",43
313,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They are political organs as well. I am not questioning the right of the union to spend money in this way, but I say that spending it so, it cannot claim to be a purely industrial, non-political organization.",43
314,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We are rather proud of being political.,43
315,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Anothe r item in the balance-sheet is, "" By donations to other unions, £34,961 "" ; and, again, "" By political and parliamentary, £14,360."" No mail who has had any experience of public affairs can read these figures without coming to the conclusion that a very great"" portion, if not the bulk, of the money subscribed by the members of the Australian Workers ""Union has been employed for political purposes to secure the election of members to this Parliament.",43
316,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is the statement that the honourable member made a few months ago, but he cannot prove it.",43
317,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member wants proof, and I can give him only a little, but it is good as far as it goes.",43
318,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Attorney-General cannot prove against the unions of this country that they spend their funds on political purposes.,43
319,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There has been a by-election since the law was passed requiring organizations to make returns [112] of their electoral expenditure, and a good many returns have also been submitted in connection with the last general election, but they are not complete, whereas those for the Werriwa by-election, to which I refer, are complete. I am using now figures which were published in the Melbourne evening Herald, but I have taken the trouble to verify them by a reference to the original return in the possession of the Department of Home as- Affairs. I find that the total expenditure of the Labour candidate for the Werriwa division was just under £100, of which amount £62 13s. 6d. was contributed by the central branch of the Australian Workers Union, Orange. Twothirds of the expenditure of the Labour candidate during that electoral campaign was borne by the union of which the honourable member for Darling is the head.",43
320,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We are proud of being political. I have never denied it.,43
321,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I only wish that we were more political.,43
322,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am prepared to accept those admissions. If honourable members say that the unions are political, that they are their political supporters and constituents",43
323,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They are not all political.,43
324,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I believe that they are not all political, but, since 1S90, the trend of trade unionism in Australia has been for the unions to become more political than industrial. No one questions the right of the unions, if they choose, to spend their money on political purposes, but, being political associations, have they the right to claim from a Government which they helped to put into power positions for their members in the service of the country, paid out of the public funds of the country? If they have the right to do that, we on our side have the right to reward our political supporters with pnblic office at the country's expense. I shall not occupy time in discussing the matter further. The issue, as I said at the beginning, is a very simple one. It is for Parliament once, and I hope finally, to decide that no future Government in Australia shall adopt the rotten and injurious principle of rewarding its own supporters, or of holding out baits to future supporters, out of the public fuuds, - which are contributed to by the taxpayers of the whole community.",43
325,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to make a personal explanation. When the Attorney General referred to a balance-sheet which had been prepared by the honourable member for Darling, showing the application of the funds of the Australian Workers Union for a period of twenty-five years, I interjected that the statement watered down the situation. It was not my desire to reflect on the honourable member for Darling or on the balance-sheet. I merely wished it to be understood that, as the balance-sheet covered a period of a quarter of a century, instead of being confined to more recent years, in which the Labour situation has been acute, it does nob put the position as strongly as it could be put.",44
326,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Wide Bay) [ 6 . 0 ] - I presume that there will be no objection bo an adjournment of the debate.,44
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The measure is a very simple one. We can go on.,44
328,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General has also indicated that it is a very simple Bill , yet in his speech he roamed all over the world, and scanned, at least, five centuries of guild enterprise and legislation to show that what the Government propose is to preserve the individual rights of every member of ' the community. What he has shown is that there is something in the Bill about which he said nothing. In mild, gentle, and plaintive language he stated that the party on this side lives, moves, and has its being in industrial, political unionism. Mr W. H. IRVINE - In unionism.",44
329,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"We l l , I leave out the word "" industrial."" The honourable member's attack, however, was not on political unionism, but on industrial unionism. Under cover of the plea that unions have sometimes political views, he is going to destroy unionism if he can - the same unionism which was ably supported, trained, direcbed, and cared for by the Prime Minisber. honourable genbleman worked himself into a state of excitement, which was unusual for him, declaring that no Government has the right to discriminate between the employment of unionists and non-unionists in the Public Service. do not agree with him, and I think that this party disagrees with him ; but, as he is prepared to make the matter an issue for the determination of the constituencies, I say, on behalf of this party, thab we are prepared to accept his challenge, and the sooner the better. The honourable gentleman is prepared to exclude permanent and temporary employees in the Public Service of the Commonwealth from the protection of a law of this country which is afforded to unionists in the employment of private persons. What right have the Government or Parliament to enact laws prescribing the conditions and wages of labour, and the advantages to be conferred upon workmen belonging to organizations, and, while enforcing those laws upon private employers, to refuse to make the conditions provided for applicable to the employment of unionists by the State? The Attorney-General and the Government are quite inconsistent in taking up the attitude they have adopted in this Bill .  not include preference to unionists?",44
330,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is so; but does the honourable member say that because every award does not include preference fco unionists, that an award of the Federal Arbitratio n Court giving preference bo unionists should not apply if the unionists are employed in the Government service?  award should include preference to unionists.",44
331,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General conbends that unionists, if employed by the Commonwealth Government, shall not political enjoy the advantages of an award of preference granted by a Judge of the H i gh Court. The honourable member for Hume would not approve of that which the At torney-General and the Prime Minister are submitting in the terms of this Bill . The Prime Minister's followers do not agree with the principles, if they can be called principles, which are laid down in this measure. When the honourable member for Hume is free to express his own The opinions, without knowing the policy of the Government, on this matter he is frankly against them, but when we come to deal with the matter as an issue to which the Government are committed, I venture to say, from our experience of I the honourable member, that we shall find him voting docilely with the Government.  have said that, personally, my opinion is that we should not allow preference to unionists in any award.",44
332,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,""" Scab "" labour is what the honourable member wants.",45
333,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order !,45
334,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the honourable member and his friends would not allow preference to unionists in any award given by the Court established by this Parliament for that specific purpose, let me ask what is the view on 'this matter held by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the honourable members for Kooyong, Eden-Monaro, and Wimmera? All these members supported legislation to provide for conciliation and arbitration in industrial affairs. They assisted to pass measures framed with the object of enabling a Court to determine disputes that had arisen, or might arise, between employers and employees. They were members, or supporters, of the Government that passed this legislation, and are they now behind the present Government in the proposal before the House, and behind the honourable member for Hume in the view he has expressed ? Do they now propose to deprive unionists employed upon public works of the rights conferred by Federal legislation, which they assisted to pass, upon unionists employed by private citizens?",45
335,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The member's Government swept away all the safeguards of that legislation.,45
336,Mr FISHIER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"So far from sweeping away all the safeguards, we enlarged the scope of the measure, and imposed no disability upon any one.",45
337,Sir ROBEET BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,But the honourable gentleman knows very well that his Government swept those safeguards away.,45
338,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I say that we did not. We extended the principle of arbitration, and we cailed upon employers and employees alike to form themselves into organizations. We extended the scope of the law, which was passed by this Parliament, and has twice been endorsed by the people at general elections. In the course of his lengthy and carefully-prepared speech, which was, no doubt, effectively delivered, from his own point of view, by the Attorney-General, the honourable gentleman carefully dealing with persons outside governmental preference to unionists. He abstained from telling the people that these laws have been passed by the Federal Parliament to promote the organization of [ 1 1 2 ] -2 both capital and labour. The party on this side believe that there can be no hope of industrial peace, and little hope of continued industrial, political, and social progress, unless both employers and employees are organized, and in a position to present a united case to the Court. On the question of the Government managing industrial affairs, I have, from the first time. I spoke in this Parliament, contended that a Government and a Parliament are incompetent bodies to deal with industrial affairs. This Parliament wisely, in my opinion, transferred to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, with one exception, the powers and duties of Government and Parliament in fixing the rates of wages and conditions of labour. This legislation has worked exceptionally well in Australia. In the Public Service of the Commonwealth we have employed about 29,000 persons, and, I think, threesevenths of the number are casual or temporary employees. I believe the true figures are about 17,000 permanent employees and 12,238 temporary or casual employees, making a grand total of 29,238.",45
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There are a great many more than that.,45
340,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Are those figures up to date? honourable Mr FISHER - Thes e are definite figures of the number df persons in Government employment as may be seen from the last Public Service Commisr sioner's report.,45
341,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I understood the number was over 19,000 two or three years ago.",45
342,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do the Government propose in this Bill to prevent temporary employees in the service of the Government obtaining preference under an award by the Federal Arbitration Court?,45
343,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We prevent the Government giving any preference to unionists.,45
344,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Not only the Government, but any agency of the Government.. Mr W . H . IBVINE - And any agency of the Government, of course.",45
345,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I expected that the avoided Attorney-General would have made his position definite and clear in words that could be understood by every one. We are to understand that if Mr Justice Higgins, preriding over the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, established under law by this Parliament, makes an award giving preference to unionists, that award under this Bill would not be effective in securing preference to unionists who are casual employees engaged upon public works. Mr W . H . IHVINE - The right honourable gentleman means in a dispute between the Government and their casual employees ?",45
346,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes ; or even in the case of a pending dispute. Mr W . H . IKVINE - Yes , certainly; the Bill would cover that.",46
347,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The Government have introduced a Bill to enable them to ignore an award of the Arbitration Court ,46
348,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We are getting closer to what is contained in this Bill . The railway enterprises of the Commonwealth will probably involve the employment of thousands of workmen of every kind.,46
349,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why should unionists have preference in that employment?,46
350,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not asking the honourable member for Wilmo t why they should, or should not, be given preference, but I wish the public to know what the Attorney-General did not tell this House and the country, and that is, that thousands of men will be employed in the construction of the transcontinental railway who, because they will be Government employees, working under Government officials, will be deprived of the benefit of an award of preference to unionists granted by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court*. Mr W. H . IKVINE - I am not quite sure that I understood the right honourable gentleman's question. Will he give a concrete instance ?",46
351,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I can give the honourable gentleman a concrete instance. In the ordinary course of administration there will be a large number of employees engaged upon public works, under public officers of the railways and other Departments. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The gentleman means temporary employees.",46
352,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"For instance, I take the construction of the transcontinental railway. There is a large number of men employed on that work at the present time.  is a trade unionist.",46
353,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is not my point at present. They are working, not under contractors, but directly under departmental officers, and, as I read this Bill , they will be considered for all practical purposes as temporary Government employees. As the wording of the Bill prohibits any departmental officer from granting preference at all in regard to employment under his De]Dartment, even an award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will not reach these men in the employ of the Government. Mr W . H . IRVINE - If men are in the Government employment, the order for preference cannot have any effect upon them.",46
354,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I say quite off-hand that the men are in the employ of the Government. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It has no application in that case.,46
355,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What are they, then? Why is there all this shuffling by legal men as to the position of the men ? If the men are engaged by Government officers to do Government work in or under a Government Department, and are paid with Government money, surely they are in the employ of the Government?  doing the same work and paid with the same money, the men were working for a contractor, they could go to the A r b i tration Court, and get an award.",46
356,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I anticipated that point by declaring that the Bill discriminates by providing that persons working under Government officers at similar work and under like conditions shall not get the rights that belong to workmen in private employment. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I said that.,46
357,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is there an honourable member who heard that?,46
358,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Surely that is not intended.,46
359,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is the effect of the Bill . The Attorney-General caref u l l y avoided saying it in those words. I do not even say that he cunningly honourable avoided doing so, but, lawyer-like, he skilf u l l y evaded that issue. .Men in Government employment will not get an award that can be given by the Judge of the Arbitration Court to men who are working under a contractor for the Government, as the honourable member for Grey has pointed out. Is that a fair position to take up ? Mr W. H . IKVINE - I do not understand your question yet. If you refer to men who are in Government employment, this Bill will have no effect upon them. If you refer to the Government employing persons and choosing whom they shall employ-casua l or temporary employees, who are not in Government employmenti t will apply directly to them; they will get no preference.",46
360,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! I would remind the House that this is not a dialogue.,47
361,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I feel sure that, with your permission, sir, honourable members will be glad to get as full and clear a statement of the position as it is possible to obtain. The Attorney-General was not clear upon that point. He was perfectly clear on the other point. As regards the fact that the Government should not give preference to unionists directly employed by them, he took care to put the State on a pedestal. He said, in effect, ' ' When dealing with State money the Government have no right to discriminate between citizen and citizen."" In my opinion he has not looked at our own laws, in which we do discriminate. As regards the Public Service, for instance, the law provides that no youth can enter the Public Service of the Commonwealth unless he has performed his duty as a - cadet under the Defeuce Act-that is, if he is f it to serve. W hy should we discriminate between that one and another one? As regards unionists, the Attorney-General acknowledges that they are the best men. He admits that every body of able workmen will organize, and advises them to do so. He did not tell the House that, from the earliest ages, unionists have had to fight their way through the bitterest of opposition, nor did he say that unionists have organized their own societies and brought that organization to a stage which enables Courts to deal with them effectively, economically, and with advantage both to themselves and to the employers. The honourable gentleman proposes, as far as he is able, to destroy all that has been done by not allowing preference, and so preventing Government employees from getting the advantage they would get if employed privately. The Minister of Trade and Customs need not shake his head. If the Bill means anything, it means that. It is striking at the very principle of unionism.",47
362,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Surely that is not intended 1 ,47
363,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is not intended, and the Bill does not do that.",47
364,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Eden-Monaro may make that remark, but that is what the Bill says.",47
365,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Will you show how it hits unionism at all?,47
366,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"May I say to the honourable member, before we adjourn for dinner, that, in my opinion, the Bill does two particular things. First, it prevents any Ministerial grant of preference to unionists in any circumstances, and, second, it prohibits a Court established by the Commonwealth Parliament from giving preference to any Government employee of any kind whatever.",47
367,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Do you say that it prohibits preference to unionists?,47
368,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable gentleman was talking to the Attorney-General while I was speaking, and, for his information, I repeat that, in m y opinion, the Bill does two things. First, it prevents a Ministerial grant of preference to unionists, and, second, it prevents quite as effectively preference to unionists being given by law-give n honestly by a Court's decision. It prevents workmen, in Government employment from getting the benefit of that award. Does the M in ister of Trade and Customs deny that?",47
369,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That would not prevent people from .joining unions. They could still enter unions as freely as ever.,47
370,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member believe that that is a right thing?,47
371,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You used the words "" Preference being given by law to workmen in Government employment."" Y o u mean no special class, do you?",47
372,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They may be unionists or they may be workmen. If there were some workmen not unionists the Bill would apply to them. If they were unionists it would not apply. Obviously that is what it says.,47
373,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And non-unionists would get preference.,47
374,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Certainly , for the reason that they had not committed the offence of joining and being in a union.",47
375,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is their object.,47
376,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is the object of the Government.,47
377,Unknown,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 745 p.m.,47
378,Mr EISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,When the sitting was suspended I was addressing myself to the question of the scope and effect of this email measure. As far as I could ascertain from the friendly interjections of the Attorney-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs-the two legal members of the Government presentthe Attorney-General holds one view and the Minister of Trade and Customs another.,48
379,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I did not express view whatever.,48
380,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That makes my case all the stronger. The Attorney-General stated that what I put forward as a layman's opinion of the Bill was correct. The actual wording of the measure is as follows: No preference or discrimination shall for or against any person in relation ployment by the Commonwealth or by any Department or authority thereof, on account membership or non-membership of any political or industrial association. I maintain that this Bill will discriminate as between two parties of employees who may be working upon the same railway. Let \}s assume that the Government employ certain contractors to undertake a portion of the work of railway construction. The workmen who are employed by the contractors, who receive their money through a' Commonwealth Department, may-if they resort to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court which has been established under Statute-obtai n an award granting preference to unionists. ",48
381,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is obtainable, because that is the purpose of existing legislation. But what will be the effect of this Bill upon employees who are working directly under departmental officers, and who are paid by them? Being Government employees, they will not be able to share in any such award by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Do honourable members say that that is a fair proposition for the Government to bring forward? Do they contend that legislation of this kind will not discrimi'nate between unionists and non-unionists in respect of Government work? It used to be the policy of every party in this Parliament to insure that the Commonwealth Government should be the very best employer in the country. But it is not so now.",48
382,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Oh , yes.",48
383,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Fro m the time of the memorable Fusion that party has hit the toiling working classes by every possible means.,48
384,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Jus t give one illustration,48
385,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Since the present Government came into office they have done everything they could to court the smile and favour of trusts, combines, and monopolies. ",48
386,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The opportunity is not afforded us to give instances. Recently we were prepared to give instances when we were closured. To-night,, when my time is limited, honourable members opposite wish me to fritter it away by giving useless instances be made which are already known to everyto any embody. The very object for which the of his Fusion was brought into existence was to stem the rising tide of organized labour. Honourable members opposite said soquite openly. It was one of the questions on which they appealed to the country, and, largely by wilful misstatements to the electors regarding our position, they were returned to office. Tonight the Attorney-General, in a very dramatic way, exclaimed, "" This is the issue upon which we want to go to the country I "" I say, "" Go ''-and , again ""Go."" They ought not to swagger around like young children, declaring that they are going to do this,, that, and the other, and then employ every device to keep honourable members from getting to the country. The object of this Bill is to crush industrial unionism. The Attorney-General is wiser than are some honourable members sitting behind him. He took care to safeguard himself by declaring that organized labour throughout Australia was composed of the very best workmen-the most capable workmen-and he added that it was a natural law of human progress that caused the best men to band themselves together. If that be true in regard to the best men, how much more necessary is it for us to protect those who are not even unionists? In our most militant times, not only have we protected the unionists, but have fought for the non-unionists, too.",48
387,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We are doing that all the time.,48
388,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The insidious attempt which is being made to lead people to believe that unionists fight only for themselves in the Courts, and by means of legislation, is absolutely unwarranted, and has not a single fact to support it . The unionists have pioneered every piece - of legislation which has made life tolerable and worth living.  unionists "" scabs.""",49
389,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Order ! several times called honourable members to order, and I must insist upon silence being preserved. I do not propose to be - continually calling "" Order ! """,49
390,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Treasurer supported the principle in favour of which I am now speaking, and if we knew his mind, I believe it - would be found that he supports it today.",49
391,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If he were Prime Minister, we should get a fair deal.",49
392,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not wish to bring the Prime Minister into it . It is not necessary to do so. He has brought himself into it . No man ever used stronger language than he has used regarding non-unionists. No man ever paraded himself as the great pillar who would oppose non-unionists in every way more than he did. He has stated in this House that while he was in the pay of a union he took good care that no non-unionist was allowed to work with unionists. He has said that they took summary action to prevent that being done. What is he doing today ? He does not avow that he has altered his opinions by one iota. He does not confess that he thinks differently today. Indeed, he says that he is prepared to do for every one what he was prepared to do for unionists. The Bill before us will discriminate between unionists and non-unionists to the detriment of the former. The Prime Minister has stated again and again that unionists have had to submit to all the sneers and the sufferings which are the lot of pioneers. A f t e r unionists have enlightened the people, are they not - entitled to the same rights as other persons? The Attorney-General traversed the action of the late Government in saying that there should be preference to unionists in Government employ, other thiugs being equal. there not be, other things being equal? The honourable gentleman has admitted that they are the best men.",49
393,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He did not ; he referred to political unionists.,49
394,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General stated that unionists gave the best return for the money which they received. Why, then, should they not be granted a preference? But that is not the only reason. All our parliamentary and in dustrial institutions are founded upon the basis that, in modern times, it is impossible to deal with the individual. As we I have are unable to deal with the individual, it is the duty of an intelligent Parliament to do everything that it possibly can to organize capital and to organize labour.",49
395,Mr FALKINER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,And will honourable members opposite allow the unionist to vote as he thinks fit?,49
396,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes. May I encourage the honourable member by volunteering the further statement that unionists are usually sufficiently intelligent and independent to do that for themselves ?,49
397,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They cannot do it in the case of strikes.,49
398,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The r e have been fewer disastrous strikes since the advent of Federation, and under our complex system of industrial arbitration, than there ever were before.",49
399,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,-And there should be.,49
400,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And there have been less and less disasters. The outstanding feature of that legislation is to the lasting credit of the Parliament which enacted it , and of the great Judge who has primarily administered it . But most of all, is it creditable to the good sense of organized labour throughout Australia? Not one of the awards which have been given-irrespectiv e of whether unionists have approved them or not-ha s been violated by the parties concerned. What can we say of honourable members opposite ? It is but a few years since they pledged themselves to the country, and violated every pledge they had made for the sake of office. See the difference. ""Unionists stand by their awards, whether they approve of them or not, because of their respect for the law. Fusionists in politics, on the other hand, have violated every pledge that they gave to the country for the sake of gaining temporary Why should place and power, and now that they have temporarily regained office, they are seeking by every means to h it at organized labour, not directly and straightforthe wardly, but in a politically insidious indirect way. Why should we have Bill dealing with this matter drafted such terms that the Attorney-General the honourable member for Darling Downs have to consult before they can say what it means? A Government having in ranks five members of the legal profesfessor sion should certainly know the meaning of a Bill of this k in d ; and if to place it before the publio in a straightJune lastforward way, they can do so. The Attorney-General played nicely to the gallery when he said that if preference to unionHiggins) ists were given by Government edict, Australia would soon reach the labourer, position of the United States of America in the matter of the spoils to the victors. No one knows better than does the At torney-General that the American system recognises that principle. It is not principle of the spoils to unionists, but rather the principle of the spoils to the political helpers.",49
401,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,A parallel.,50
402,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The parallel is complete on the Government side of the House, because if one Labour sympathizer were appointed during our term of office, honourable members opposite immediately objected to the appointment. We appointed three, and honourable members opposite tried to rouse the whole country upon the question. Not one Labour supporter has been appointed by the present Government since they came into office, and they do not intend to appoint one. They believe in the policy of the spoils to the victors. Honourable members opposite know how to give effect to that s policy, but, like all persons of little virtue, they parade very much that which they have. When speaking of arbitration, I am disposed to ask the Government and their supporters whether they are apprehensive of the way in which the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Acts are being administered by the distinguished Justices who are called upon to deal with them ? The time has not long passed since we heard Mr Justice Higgins denounced in this Chamber because of what were considered to be his liberal judgments in favour of the unionists. The honourable member for Parkes, to do him justice, was quite ready fco, and frequently did, express his views on this question in a straightforward manner. In my opinion, the great Judge, who has been second to hold the distinguished posiand tion of President of the Conciliation and! a Arbitration Court of Australia, has done in a great deal for Australia. His judgand ments are acknowledged in every part of the world to be of the first order. Let me quote briefly whab was written of Mr . its Justice Higgins and his work by ProM . B . Hammond, of the Ohio State University, in an article published they wish in the American Economic Review in The strong expressions of opinion are due , rather to the fact that he (Mr Justice sees so clearly the fallacy in. the assumption that freedom of contract exists in reality between the individual without property, and the modern employer with the vast resources at his command. The position of an Arbitration Court Judge is by no means an enviable one. He is sure to be accused of prejudice either by employers as a class or by the employees - Mr Justice Sim, of the the New Zealand Court, is as unpopular with employees as is Mr Justice Higgins with employers, and with as little reason, for the minimum wage fixed by the New Zealand Court is from is. to 2S. per day above that thus far adhered to by Mr Justice Higgins, and Mr . Justice Sim has pushed the doctrine of preference to unionists farther than has been done by any of his predecessors or in any Court that I know of. Having read carefully all of Mr. Justice Higgins' decisions, and having discussed these matters at great length with him in conversation, I feel warranted in saying that he gives no evidence of bias, and I believe that most economists will agree with me that the principles on which he has based his judgments ' are fundamentally sound, and that he has, with relentless logic, argued his way to safe and sane conclusions. And this is what is said by ait impartial critic of the President of the Court to which we ask Parliament fco allow every employee to appeal, whether he be a State employee or not. I wish again to state my opinion in this House regarding the competency of a Government, and more particularly of a Parliament, to settle rates of wages and conditions of labour. Honourable members who have had experience of the work of dealing with the Estimates, either as Ministers or private members, will recognise that it is impossible for a body of representative men sitting here to deal with these matters in an equitable way. I have always maintained, and I maintain more and more today, that the State can trust itself fco the Courts as safely as can a private employer, and that it ought to do so. The State has no right to assume that the Government of the country is capable of fixing wages aud conditions of labour in connection with the various work that it is carrying out whilst a private employer has to go to a Court if necessary to have them fixed for him. It is quite true that, in all circumstances, the Government of the country must have the last word regarding the matter of cost. It is for the Government of the day to say ultimately whether they can provide the money, but no sane democratic people would object to employees of the State being paid the wages, and receiving the conditions prescribed by a proper tribunal appointed by this or any other Parliament. It was said by the Attorney-General that since 1890 a new phase of unionism had appeared. I do not think that that is correct. Some of my honourable friends think it is, but I believe that the political phase of unionism is at least a century old. Not long after the middle of ilast century Thomas Burt, Alexander MCDonald, and a whole array of others, came into Parliament - no t on Liberalism.",50

The workers have organized themselves into a party, instead - of returning separate individuals to speak for them in Parliament. Should the Government really object to that? Do they say that there is anything improper on the part of people who earn their money in pounds or shillings organizing for political purposes as against trusts, combines, or monopolies, or large employers-organizing themselves to return to Parliament a party to conserve their in terests? What is there in that to which the Attorney-General can object ? Nothing whatever. His complaint is rather a compliment to the organized body of workers.

It may be that the examiright, nation which the lawyer has to passnot from a literary or educational point of view-require s the exercise of less in tellect than is required of the hard working artisan who has to serve his time at his trade.

423,Mr FISHER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The unionists are prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of their fellows; otherwise, they would not be unionists. The Attorney-General has asked, What about the non-unionists? My reply is that fchey are provided for by Mr Blackwood, late president of the Victorian Employers Federation. That gentleman, in London, publicly stated that organized established a workmen's organization, which they supported, in order to look after non-unionists, not because they are the better workmen, but in order to break up unionism. That is a public statement by a gentleman who is the representative of what is called the "" squattocracy,"" and of trusts and combines. As I say, this union has been established, not for the legitimate purpose of providing its members with employment, but for the purpose of breaking up unionism. Yet the Attorney-General has the courage to come honorhere, and, with a straight face, declarethat he believes in , and would encourage,, unionism, although, as a matter of fact, his every effort, and the effort of thoseassociated with him, is fco make the lot of the unionist more miserable, dire, and difficult.

I close, as I began, by declaring that this trumpery piece of legislation-this attempt of the Government to appear as the saviours against a horde of unionists who are desirous to destroy the country-is a display of weakness and insincerity that is commoufcosuch Governments as this. The Government will continue on their way, despite anything we may say, unless political misfortune overcomes them; but if they have a spark of political manliness in them, or if they value the'traditions of our race and country, as responsible for the carrying on of the government, they will cease to make declarations, and will act.

425,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Darling Downs-Minis capital had ter of Trade and Customs) [8.20] - The Leader of the Opposition has made a number of pious declarations and general statements, but has evaded the main issue of the Bill . He has talked of everything but the principle underlying the measure. Before dealing with the Bil l itself I should like to make one or two general statements. The right honourable member says that ever since this Government, or "" Fusion,"" as he terms it , was formed, every effort has been made by us to put down the working classes and interfere with industrial - conditions. I challenged the right honourable member at the time, and I challenge him again now, to mention one act of Parliament or one act of administration - by Liberalism to the detriment of the working classes of Australia. ferentially, the right honourable gentleman told us that the Attorney-General had not made a straightforward statement. This is a most remarkable allegation. Hardly a man who has spoken on this side has, in the opinion of the Leader of the Opposition, made a straightforward or frank statement. question the right honourable member's honesty of purpose, but I object to his exclusive monopoly of self-righteousness in this Parliament. The Bill , first all, clearly and distinctly makes no attack on industrial unionism of any kind whatever; there is not a single line in it which in any way infringes on legitimate unionism. In the second place, there is nothing in the Bill , so far as the general - arbitration laws of Australia are concerned, which does an in j u r y to organizations of capital or labour formed for the purpose of those Acts. The right honourable gentleman spent most of his time in speaking as though this Bill were con1 fined solely to an attack on the arbitration laws. He forgets the most important aspect of the minute of the late Government which is assailed by this Bill . Up to 1910 our proud boast was that the only grounds to be taken into consideration for public employment were efficiency, merit, and fitness. Never was an appointment made except strictly in accordance with the principles laid - down in the Public Service Act . 1910, however, a new principle was in troduced by the Labour Government.",52
426,Sir ROBERT BEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,In 1910?,53
427,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It was in 1910, I believe. As a matter of fact, the principle had been in operation nearly nine months before it was made public by a deputation from the Trades H all in 1911, and I think I remember the honourable member for Maranoa remarking on the number of unionists who, by the operation of the rule, were already in the Public Service, and how non-unionists could not be much h u r t by it. It was about that time that the announcement was made public that, ""other things being equal,"" preference would be given to unionists. I wish honourable members to realise that the Leader of the Opposition never once during his speech attempted to defend entry into the Public Service on the ground of preference to unionists; he avoided that issue right through, although it is the vital Inpoint, and was emphasized by the Attorney-General when he remarked that it was not desirable to introduce anything of the nature of patronage into the Public Service, but that only efficiency should be considered. U p to 1910, as I say, the principle of preference was not in vogue. Names were registered I do not in the order of application, and no questions were asked as to class, creed, religion, political f a it h , or anything else. The point was, "" Are you efficient and of fit for the position; if so, then let the best man have it ? "" This Bill seeks to set aside the principle of preference clearly and distinctly. Shall the Public Service be free and open to all persons, irrespective of class, creed, or political faith , and efficiency be the basis, or shall employment be given to unionists, "" other things being equal "" ? There is the dividing issue. This is a matter to be taken out of the hands of any Executive, decided by the people, and embodied in a Statute. Henceforth, by this Bill , the Executive will know that it is the wish of the Australian people that in public employment efficiency alone shall be considered. As I have said, the Leader of the Opposition, during the whole of his remarks, did not touch on this vital principle. He never attempted to justify preference to unionists as a condition of entry to the public positions. We were told, by way of interjection, that In there has been no coercion of men into unions; and I should like to read the following extract from a letter dated 2nd A p r i l , 1913, and addressed to Mr R. L . Meeking, 2 1 A Marlton-crescent, St., KildaI have the honour to inform you that approval has been given for your appointment as Field Hand in connection with survey work in the Northern Territory, with wages at the rate of is. 5d. per hour of forty-four hours per week. This approval has been given on the understanding that you are a member of a recognised union. If you are not, it will be necessary for you to take steps to join at once, otherwise the agreement lapses. If other things were equal, why make this man become a unionist ? He ought to have been selected because he was the best man for the j o b ; but he was told that if he did not join a union his agreement would lapse. That is the way "" Preference to unionists, other things being equal,"" works out. That letter was signed by Mr Atlee H u n t , the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, and the Minister at the time was the honourable member for Barrier. I am sure, however, that that honourable gentleman was only acting on the principle that any other member of his Government would have acted. That is the way in which this operates. Of course, we must reason it out. The Labour Government gave preference to unionists. Let us examine their reasons for so doing. According to the honourable member for Wide Bay and others, we should give preference to unionists because of the splendid fight unionists have put up for industrial unionism. If men are to be appointed to the Public Service, not because they are the best men for the jobs, but because they have rendered some service to the community, why should that service to the community be confined to one object only ? If a man has performed some great religious service for the community, is that not to be recognised ? Or, if he has done great work in promoting industries in certain directions, is that to be set aside ? If to reward some service rendered to industrial unionism we may depart from the principle ' of making appointments to the Public Service on merit alone, we are entitled to depart from that principle on other grounds; but if we are not entitled to depart from it on those other grounds, then we have no right to depart from it at all. In other words, the public offices of the Commonwealth are not to be used as rewards to any one for services rendered outside to the community as a whole. The second ground advanced by the ex-Prime Minister and others was that unionists have done such splendid work in lift in g wages up. I agree with these honourable gentlemen that unionists have done splendid work in that direction.  .them ?",53
428,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I agree with the able member that no man should be penalized' because he is a unionist, I go further and say that, so far as Commonwealth is concerned, no man should be penalized on the ground that he is a non-unionist. Why should preferent ference be given in Government employpreference ment on the ground that the unionists have done such splendid work in l if up wages? The matter of Government employment is quite distinct from that of private employment. We cannot compare public employment with private employment in this matter. One of the principal reasons why preference is given to unionists in private employment is that people have been victimized, but the Government have never yet victimized unionists, so that ground cannot apply in the matter of Commonwealth employment. So when we examine the reasons we find there is not one valid ground that can be advanced for giving unionists preference over other persons in Government employment. Now, let us take the strong reasons against giving that preference to unionists. First of all, giving preference to unionists would fetter and tie the hands of the Commonwealth, and prevent us from having free selection in getting the best men. The second objection to preference to unionists is a serious one. It is that unions are becoming daily more and more political.",54
429,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is what troubles you.,54
430,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is the trouble. We were told by the honourable member for South Sydney that one reason why unionists should get preference was that it would produce industrial peace. That sounds very nice. I am sure that if Australians thought preference to unionists was.going to maintain industrial peace, and that if there would be peace all through the country if preference to unionists was given tomorrow, there would be very strong ground in having that condition granted. But let us see what the member for Darling has said in regard to industrial peace. He has made this statement;.There are only two classes in the political field, and there can be nothing but war between them until Capitalism as a social system is thrown over altogether.",54
431,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is absolutely true.,54
432,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable mempenalize ber for South Sydney, with an angelie smile, tells us that there wil l be industrial honorpeace, but the organizer of the most powerful union, the honourable member but for Darling, says that there will be no the industrial peace until the whole social system is thrown over. So we have these two leaders of unionism telling us diftales. Even where they have had to unionists, I do not think we can see that industrial peace has folt in g lowed. Have the Government servants been free from strikes in Australia? W it h a Labour Government in power, the producer suffered heavily from a strike on the railways of New South Wales. There is no guarantee in regard to the Public Service that preference to unionists will secure industrial peace. One of the most serious objections to preference to unionists is the fact admitted by honourable members that trade unions are becoming more and more political. I have a return published by the Queensland Registrar-General for 1911. It deals with small fractions only of the unionists of Australia, and it is a sample, but it shows that the expenditure from 1910 amounted to £25,428, of which £4,641 was paid away for benefits, which are the legitimate objects of unions.",54
433,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,How do you know that?,55
434,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"- I say they are. These benefits are, to my mind, legitimate objects of unions. This return is based upon those furnished by the unions, and shows that the total expenditure in Queensland on management of unions was £8,607, while no less than £12,180 was devoted to other payments, mainly assistance to other unions, legal and political expenses, and subscriptions to labour newspapers. To-day, we have a statement by honourable members opposite that these unions are becoming political. If I desire to join a union which is political in its objects, I am compelled to subscribe to purposes which carry out all the objects and aims of political unions.",55
435,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Not in all of them.,55
436,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,In many instances the moneys are devoted to that object,55
437,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Giv e me a typical instance.,55
438,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have several times called order. I ask honourable members to allow the Minister to occupy the short time at his disposal.,55
439,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member for Darling said, in opening a conference representative of over 100,000 workersThe amalgamation would enormously extend the influence of Labour, both industrially and politically. Unless the industrial and political movements were interwoven it was little use striving for the accomplishment of their tions. Honourable members will admit that preference to unionists is to be a permanent feature of their programme. There is to be no discretion with the Government. It must be absolute employment of unionists, other things being equal. If a man comes to a public office and asks for employment, he is to be asked, "" A r e you a member of the union or not? "" In view of the fact that unions are becoming more and more political, if he wishes to get employment in the Public Service of Australia, in respect w which employment there is a recognised union, he may have to sacrifice his conscience and political convictions before he can be employed. A condition of that sort would be the grossest violation of individual liberty that any British community has ever seen.  you were fighting your present allies, you were hanging round the coat-tails ofunionists.",55
440,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member's statement is grossly inaccurate. If I have said anything unparliamentary, I apologize, but I have always held my present views, and constantly expressed them. The honourable member should be the last to talk as he does. He forgets his own entry into the House and his present position. Never have I voted for preference in obtaining employment in any Government service, and the honourable member knows it . Let us see some of the grounds on which judicial preference has been exercised by the Courts. The Arbitration Act has not, at any time, given absolute preference to unionists. It has always been judicial preference, and' it is interesting to note how this has been exercised. I find that Mr Justice Edwards, of New Zealand, where there was judicial preference, in giving an award, saidThe claim of the union to a preference of employment in my opinion necessarily fails when it is ascertained that the union is not really representative of the greater number of the workmen employed in the trade, and the claims of the union have not resulted in any practical benefit to the bulk of the workmen. The first application for preference to unionists made before the Commonwealth tribunal was made to Mr Justice aspira- O'Connor, in the Australian Workers Union case, and the Judge saidThe granting of preference to members of the Union puts a limitation on the employer's freedom of choice in selecting hi$ workmen; it also places at a disadvantage in obtaining employment all persons exercising the same avocation who are not members of the Union. The claimants, however, have failed to put before me any reason for exercising my discretion in favour of granting preference. Mr. Reid. relying on the legal position that I was bound to make the order, has abstained from urging any argument in support of my exercising my discretion to grant it. He then goes on to deal with the political side. In those days, no preference could be given To any union that applied its funds to political purposes, and dealing with that point, Mr Justice O'Connor saysIn aid of these objects rule 48 provides for the establishment of a political fund to able on behalf of duly-pledged Labour candidates approved by the Union. There is no suggestion throughout the rules that the political ends aimed at are to be limited to the subjects set forth in the proviso to section 55. In the face of these declared objects of the .Union, it is impossible to hold that the rules of the Union do not permit the application of its funds to political purposes. Apart from any other consideration, therefore, the rules themselves make the granting of the application for preference impossible. There are two points involved there. First, 011 the general ground of preference, Mr Justice O'Connor decided that no grounds for preference were shown, and the second point was that the objects were political, and, therefore, preference had to be refused.",55
441,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Because it was prohibited by the Act.,56
442,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am telling the honourable member so, and also that, in 1910, this House had rushed through it , at express speed, an Arbitration Bill which repealed the sections relating to political objects. It was especially provided that, under the Act, preference might be given to unions, although they were political in their objects and purposes.",56
443,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Y o u do not dare to instate the old section. "" Mr GROOM - Our opposition to the present provision is just as keen as ever.",56
444,Mr ARTHUR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Why do you not repeal that part of the present Act? Mr W . H . IRVINE - We intend do so.,56
445,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There were three safeHiggins' guards against the exercise of judicial preference to unionists in the Act of 1904. Speaking from memory, they were, first, rated Seamen's that the application could not be granted until notice was published in the Gazette, and everybody had an opportunity of compage ing in and opposing it ; second, that, the opinion of the Judge, those applying for it had to represent a majority in the industry concerned; and, third , that the application could not be granted if the objects of the union were political in their character. As soon as our friends opposite got into power, they repealed the whole of those safeguards.",56
446,Mr HANNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Quite right.,56
447,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That is a matter of opinion.' I have here the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins, delivered in 1911, in the case of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, of Australia versus The Broken Hill Proprietary Combe avail- pany and others. At page 25 he saidBut I am very loath to interfere with the employer's absolute discretion in choosing his employees without the employer's consent, or, some very strong necessity. This absolute power of choice is one of the recommendations of the minimum wage system, from the employer's point of view-h e can select the best man available when he has to pav a certain rate. This freedom of choice tends to the efficiency of the industry, bracing up the men to show their powers. Moreover, I find, in this case, at present, no disposition or wish on the part of these employers to discriminate as against unionists. There is a general desire among the employers who have given evidence to be fair, ancl to get the best men lhat they can at the price. The burden of prooflies on the claimant to show that preference ought to be granted, and that burden has not yet been satisfied.",56
448,Mr RILEY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What do you object to in that statement?,56
449,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not object to it . In that case the Judge was asked to give preference to unionists, and exercised his discretion, with full power to do it. He said that it interfered with the employers' discretion, with which he was very loath to interfere, pointed out that freedom of choice tended to efficiency, and found that no discrimination had been practised, l or those three reasons he said no preference reought to be granted; but honourable members opposite did not give any discretion at all to officers employing public servants. They were bound to give preference in every case that came up before them. Preference had to be given to to unionists, other things being equal.  decision in the Brisbane case.",56
450,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I shall refer to that with pleasure. In the case of the FedeUnion of Australia against the Commonvjealth Steam-ship Owners Association and others, volume 5, 170, the Judge gives various reasons in in favour of preference, and then saysAnd there is much truth in this also. But it does not follow that an order for preference is a fit remedy. I desire to confine my remarks to the case actually before me; but, to my mind, a claimant ought to make out a very strong case before the Court could fetter the discretion of the employer in selecting his employees. The order should be shown to be clearly necessary in order to secure fair conditions for the men. Much depends on the meaning of "" other things being equal."" . . . I propose to say that the Court does not see fit to grant any order for preference to members of the organization at this stage, but the refusal is without prejudice.",56
451,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What point do you make out of that case ?,57
452,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"An application for preference was made to the Judge. 'Judge said a strong case ought to be made out before it could be granted, and decided that in that instance it ought not to be granted. Under the decree of the late Government, if men walked up to the public office the officials had no discretion; they were bound to take them on if they were unionists, other things being equal. Let us turn now to the Brisbane Tramway case, as given on page 19 of the special report. The Judge condemned the Brisbane Tramway Company for victimizing unionists. We need not traverse that point.",57
453,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You would not do that.,57
454,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is no need to do it. We will assume that the Judge was justified in finding it. I presume that, like myself, honourable members opposite have not heard the evidence, and must accept the Judge's statement of the case. He saysI f I could find any other method of protecting the members of this association from the intimidation which Mr Badger practised, I should use that method rather than do anything tending to restrict him in the choice of employees; but the law provides me with no other means. I have asked the company to undertake not to discriminate against members of this association. I have no power to make an order against such discrimination, but if the company gave me its undertaking I should be satisfied with it, and should refuse to order preference. In that case, and in those circumstances, the Judge, after full deliberation, made an order for preference. In every other «ase he refused to give preference to unionists. He gave it in this case because of victimization. The preceding Government granted absolute preference, but when we look to see how a Judge, in his judicial capacity, granted preference, we find that the only ground on which he gave it was victimization. Is there such a threat or so much fear of victimization by Governments in Australia that absolute preference should be granted in the Public Service? I hold that there is absolutely none whatever.",57
455,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What Government put preference to unionists in the Arbitration Act?,57
456,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The whole of the House did it in a matter between employer and employee. It provided for judicial preference, but it did not enact an absolute preference.  The vernment.",57
457,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I supported the Bill all through, and it was on my motion that political preference was prohibited, but the Bill was passed in 1904, and I was not in the Ministry then. I have supported, and will support, the principle of industrial legislation, but I have always protested, and will protest to the end, against the use of the powers of the Government to secure political tyranny in connection with industrial unionism. Not one reason that would hold water can be advanced in favour of preference to political unions. On the contrary, everything points to the exercise of this power as being tyrannous in its operation, cruel in its results, and utterly destructive of efficiency.",57
458,Mr ROBERTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You might give one illustration in support of that frightful charge.,57
459,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I say that that is the result. As regards the Public Service Act of Australia, passed by the first Parliament, we all rejoiced, because we believed that it put an end to political patronage.",57
460,Mr BAMTORD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,This Bill has nothing to do with the Public Service.,57
461,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member could not have read it. It does affect it , and it will' prohibit any Government from excluding men by an Executive act from application or entry to the Public Service on account of certain opinions that tliey may hold or prevent preference in employment. Political patronage has an absolutely corrupting influence on the community. When we find that unions are becoming more and more political every day, as is admitted, and that the leaders are binding them more and more to distinct principles not relating to unionism at all, but to Socialism and other things altogether outside unionism, and when we give in the public employment preference to those persons, which practically amounts to giving all possible preference on account of the political views that they hold, we are really getting back to the old system that was repealed. A striking passage occurs in May's Constitutional History of England, Volume 2, page 233, applying to a state of things which, if this policy were persisted in , would be reproduced in Australia.",57
462,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"-How many hunparticular, dreds of years ago?",58
463,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The policy of the position is always to go back to the Acts of the past for their ideas. During their with it more closely. regime some of the great principles were fought for in the past were violated by them. May saysIt has been noticed elsewhere that while the number of places held by members of Parliaof ment was being continually reduced, the patronage of the Government had been by augmented establishments and expenditure. poor But throughout these changes, patronage was the mainspring of the organization of parties. was used to promote the interests and consoliisters date the strength of that party in which distribution happened to be vested.

But without mitting any offence against the law, patronage is necessary for such a purpose. continued to be systematically used as the of rewarding past political service, and insuring future support. That passage applies admirably to the present position. This Bill strikes at evils of patronage, and if it is passed that insidious principle which honourable members opposite attempted to introduce will be destroyed.",58
464,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I suppose that passage related to the fourteenth century?,58
465,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is trying to reproduce the conditions which then prevailed. It is necessary, in to unionists in the Public Service. the interests of the public, that the people should declare most emphatically that the Public Service of Australia shall be thrown open to everybody, irrespective of class, creed, or political views. Efficiency and fitness for the duties performed should alone be the ing factors in appointments to the Public Service of Australia.",58
466,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"West Sydney) [9.0] To-day we have had an opportunity of seeing and hearing something of the second proposal by which the Government, on a date not yet definitely fixed, is to seek the opinion of the people. This purports to be a Bill dealing with preference to unionists, and we have had from the At torney-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs dissertations covering a very wide field, dealing i.n general with the conditions of labour, with the relations between employer and employee, and, in with preference of employment to unionists. The references of the AttorOpney-General to the measure were vague and meagre; his lionorable colleague dealt But. I wish to say that now, and at once-becaus e one never knows in these days what may happenthat the Bill is a sham. We were led to expect a frontal attack on the principle preference to unionists, but this general measure completely evades the issue. extended It is a mere placard, and a very one. Moreover, it is imposI t sible to conceive that the two M i nwho have spoken, both of whom beits long to the legal profession, can be ignorant of the fact that the measure is in no way necessary for the purpose for I say a emphatically, this Bill is not necessary to had prevent preference being given to persons comemployed in the Public Service. No Act At the means most, it is a mere declaratory measure. It is a prohibition, but we do not know to whom it is directed. If it is a prohibition directed to the Judiciary, it is impudent; the if directed to the Government, it is unnecessary. So much by way of preface. Let me now contrast what has been said to-night and what was said during the electoral campaign with what honourable members opposite now propose to do. During the electoral campaign they in veighed against preference to unionists generally, not merely against preference According to the Leader of the Opposition, some 29,000 persons are employed in the permanent and temporary branches of the Public Service, and there are in Australia at least 600,000 or 700,000 adult workers, to be of whom, at a moderate computation, determin300,000 are unionists.",58
467,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Fou r hundred and fift y thousand.,58
468,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I wish to be well within the mark. We have been told that unionism is an evil vitiating the very i'ountains of democratic aud representative government, threatening the fabric and its foundations throughout the length aud breadth of the Commonwealth. were told that it is a great and growing evil. Thank God, unionism is growing every day! No quarantine, nor any means known to man, can check its advance. No virus that the Government know of, no vaccine which they possess, fan hinder this movement, which began in spite of them, is going on in spite of them, and will continue to flourish long after they are in their political graves. they call unionism as we know it an evil. What, then, do they propose to do with this evil, as they call it? They ]iose to let it go on. According to' them, there are thousands and tens of thousands of non-unionists-cheerful , honest, bright, industrious citizens-wh o are striving, God knows under what difficulties, to earn their daily bread, and opposed to them is this tyrant, this Colossus of unionism, which threatens to take away their small opportunities for making a living. What <lo honourable gentlemen opposite propose to do with this terrible evil? They propose to let it go on. Unionism stretches over the whole country from Dan to Beersheba, from Bunbury to Wilson's Promontory. Ib affects every worker in the land. Yet the Government proposes to legislate in regard to only 29,000 public servants, who do not make up a twentieth part of the workers of the Commonwealth. Furthermore, of these public servants, 17,000 are complebely beyond the scope of this measure. The permanent public employees cannot be affected in any way, good, bad, or indifferenb, by bhis proposal of the Government. The measure, then, relates, if it relates to any one, to the 12,000 temporary employees of the Commonwealth. What an anti-climax! We have the country overspread with what the Liberal party considers a great in dustrial pestilence, and Ministers propose to squirt their rosewaber remedy on one out of every fifty of the sufferers. What a bold, courageous policy this is! let me cut into it a little deeper. Bill , which purports to attack the general principle of preference to unionists, in no way really affects even those at whom it is aimed, because the party opposite is pledged to abolish day labour, and to substitute contract labour. When that is done in connection with the public works of the Commonwealth, the only ground in which this little seedling We could take root disappears, and there remains no one whom the measure could affect. That is the literal truth without exaggeration. We have listened for two hours to a tirade against unionism. What shall we say of the remedy that is to be applied? We had a right to expect something; but here is nothing. , The Government propose a crusade against no living being. We have the public But declaration of Minisbers-God knows that that does not count for much - that they are pledged to the abolition pro- of day labour; and the fulfilment of that pledge rings the death knell to any preference to unionists that can be affected by the measure. So much for that point. During the elecboral campaign M in isters denounced unionism, and, in particular, political unionism. To-night the Attorney-General gave us his ideas on the subject of unionism, illumined here and there with the candid admission that he did not know much of the subject. It is a pity that he did not preface his remarks with that admission. He said that since 1890 unionism has been getting political, that it is no longer content with industrial organization, but had bent its efforts towards political action, its objective being Syndicalism. I do not expect that every man in this House should intimately concern himself with economics. It were to ask too much to require that men whose business it is to make laws should understand the warp and woof out of which they are fashioned, but I protest in the most passionate and emphatic way against this miserable exposure of my honourable friend's ignorance. What is Syndicalism ? It is the denial of the efficacy of the law, and of all political action. It is the red flag. It is sabotage. It is the pushing aside of the political machine, and the marching on to victory by force. It is, in short, the substitution of force-of direct action-for political action. The honourable and learned gentleman calmly tells us that, for years, But unionism has been getting more and more This political, its objective being Syndicalism. That is like saying that, for years, the people have been getting more Christian in profession and practice, their objective being hell! I would that I could applythat to my honourable friends opposite, wishing them a rapid journey and Godspeed. What was the position of the Government as set forth during the election and by the honourable and learned gentleman. It is opposed to unionism. According to the honourable and learned member, unionism is a thing accursed. But the honourable gentleman who leads the Government was once upon a time a unionist. Ho cannot shelter beneath the cloak of ignorance that covers his colleagues, who have seen the industrial world only from the outside. He knows what it is to earn one's living with one's hands, and by the sweat of the brow. He has gone down into the bowels of the earth to toil. He was a miner, and has rever denied his origin, being proud of it . Moreover, he has always said that he believed in unionism, and quite recently made a profession of faith, which I will read. It is to be found in the Hansard record for the 26th September, 1911, V o l . LX . , page 787I have no sort of sympathy with the man who will work alongside another man, and see that other paying every week of his life into an organization to protect his rights, and to maintain his position, whilst he himself is skulking, and deriving the benefit for which the other is paying and working. The honourable gentleman believes in industrial unionism, and even quite recently he again asserted his belief in it. He objects, so he says, only to political unionism. We have just listened to a wail from the Minister of Trade and Customs about political unionism, denies the right to men in this to freedom of opportunity to get their living. Freedom! Freedom well on the lips of these men, saturated as they are with events of the past week in this Freedom of - action and freedom speech! The little tin gods must laugh when they hear such speeches as these from such men. My honourable denounce political unionism, and why? One would imagine that the use of funds for political purposes was a crime. have we come to in this twentieth tury of civilization that we should hear political action denounced as if it were anathema? After man has been marching for 300 years steadily in one direcSfr. Hughes. tion, laying aside force and adopting more civilized weapons, when every forward step taken by the men of our racehas been in the direction of securing by political means those rights which weredenied to the people in the past, are we now to be told that to seek redress by political political means is a crime? Unionism ischarged with spending money for politipolitical cal purposes. In what more civilized, more equitable, or more proper way could money be spent than that by which civilization for these centuries has progressed ? Political purpose 1 That is the very purpose for which we are all here. It is the principle upon which democratic government rests. This community lives, breathes, and expresses itself politically. There is not an act done, or permitted to be done, unless through political means. By political means we make the laws under which we live, and nothing can be done save under the sanction of law. Yet we are told that we are pariahs, because for the last twenty years we have begun to open our eyes and spend our money, not only in a profitable, but in a proper, direction. If the charge against unionism is that it spends its money to secure reforms by political means, it needs no answer. These gentlemen talk about freedom and independence, and their onlyeffort in the direction of independence is to subsidize the so-called In dependent Workers Union, whose solitary purpose it is to do the dirty, contemptible, work of those who dare not meet unionistsface to face. That is their work for in dependence. As for their work for freewhich - dom and liberty, it is written in the imcountry perishable records of this House. Why do they denounce political purposes? sounds It is the sole cause which brings us gentlehere. It is the foundation of our the very existence. I shall tell honorHouse. able members why they object to it . of Even the Honorary Minister-the honourable member for Wentworth-no w saysthat he is not opposed to industrial friends unionism. They all now say that they believe in it . Why? Because it is a fact so patent that the blind see it . It is a fact which screams from one end of What the country to the other, so that the deaf cen- must hear it . It is something so undeniable that every man admits it , and 99 out of every 100 agree with it in moderation. When unionism was an outcast they stoned it . Now, when, in spite of their bitter opposition, it has grown powerful, they are compelled to conceal their enmity. These gentlemen opposite believe in unionism, providing unionism is content to put in its sheath the only weapon that is effective. They believe in unionism, provided it does not assert itself. Provided that unionism does not exercise its power, ib is a good thing. They counsel unionism not to use political means. But the unionist must not break the law. What is the law? It is the opinion of those who control the political machine. What does this mean? It means, if unionisbs are denied the right to combine for political purposes, that a very large proportion of the people of this country are unable to express themselves ab all, because these gentlemen arrogabe to themselves the sole right to occupy the Treasury bench. And they will grant unionism nothing it does not compel them to grant. During the centuries of the past, they have been perfectly content to divide amongst themselves: the spoils of office, but when the hewers of wood and drawers of water organized and became a force, they joined together in order to make common cause against the common enemy. Why are they opposed to political unionism ? I w i ll tell honourable members. It is cause political unionism is effective unionism. I ask my friends in this country, who yeb believe bhat political unionism is not as effective as industrial unionism alone, to nobe most carefully that, although some of the gentlemen opposite profess to believe in industrial unionism, some up to this point, and some to another, and some without reservation, the one thing upon which they are all agreed is to condemn political unionism. Why ? It is because they fear it . Political unionism means their extinction. means that between unionists and the holy of holies there stands nothing but the determination of the people themselves and the realization of their strength. My honourable friends on the other side have denounced political unionism, but what are they going to do to check it? Nothing. Though they denounce political unionism, and fear it , they have not the courage to attack it . It is a two-edged sword without a handle. They cannot catch hold of it , and they cannot use it . The Attorney-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs quoted quite a number of extracts from newspapers and books more or less remotely irrelevant to the subject under discussion. I cannot follow them, but I do not propose for a moment to allow them to persuade the people of this country that their attack upon preference to unionists is to be taken seriously. They are opposed to it , they fear it , but they fear it too much to attack it . It is to their fears, rather than to their sense of justice, that we owe this immunity. It is true that the honourable gentleman at the head of the Government may feel some embarrassment in this matter. God knows, the human mind is a singularly complex thing, and his circumstances may even embarrass the honourable gentleman. He is a unionist himself. He may feel some embarrassment in taking part in butchering unionism. One never knows. There are depbhs to which the worse of men object to descend. But however this may be, the point is that the measure now before this House is a measure on which they have elected to go to the country. It is the measure upon which they must stand or f all. It is the measure by which they will be gibbeted be- from one end of the country to the other. It is a measure which betrays at once the hollowness of their pretentions and their lack of courage. It exposes every one of their pledges, as it were, in the pillory, that decent men and women may cast their objurgations and curses upon them. Here is a Government who declare that preference to unionists is a danger and a menace to liberty, yet dare not touch it ! We are told that the Public Service ought to be free to all without distinction It of class or creed, and that public money ought not to be spent except in such a way as to secure the best men. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that one of the objections to preference to unionists was that it prevented the Commonwealth from getting the best men. I deny that most emphatically. It prevents the Commonwealth from getting the cheapest men very likely, but that it prevents the Commonwealth from getting the best men I call upon the Attorney General to deny. The honourable gentleman has admitted that the best men are always members of the unions.",59
469,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not any such thing.,62
470,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Of course the best men are in the unions.,62
471,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I made no such admission.,62
472,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable gentleman says he did not make the admission; I did not suppose he would, but I heard him say something suspiciously like it . Calm reflection has, no doubt, enabled the honourable gentleman to modify his opinion, but even if the honourable gentleman did not make that statement, I will make it for him, and I challenge him to deny it . It is the experience of all those who have to employ labour that the best men are in the unions. When we are told that preference to unionists is objectionable because it does not enable the Commonwealth to get the best men, I say that that is not in accordance with experience. But this matter has no relevance to the question before the House. The proposal prohibits the granting of preference to any employee of the Commonwealth on account of his being a unionist. Let me explain what is the law and practice at the present time in regard to this matter. The law is silent. The Government can employ unionists or non-unionists. They can give preference, or can decline to give preference, to unionists. That is the position. The practice, as initiated by the Fisher Government, was - to give ence to unionists under conditions which are set out in the answers to a series of questions put by Air. Deakin to the present Leader of the Opposition, who .was then Prime Minister. These will be found at page 634 of Hansard for 26th September, 1911. Mr . Deakin sought, in his questions^ for information in regard to the whole matter, and, shortly, the substance of the questions and answers may be thus reduced to coherent form. Mr Deakin was informed that, other qualifications being equal, preference would be given, in all cases, to unionists. Qualifications, such as ability, experience, and physical condition, would be considered. No Commonwealth law existed in regard to preference to unionists for permanent employees. As regards who was to determine the fittest, Mr . Deakin was informed that the officer charged with the duty of selection would do so. He was also informed that non-unionadmit ists appointed on the ground of greater qualifications or capacity would not be liable to be suspended or displaced in favour of unionists applying for appointment. Those were the principles on which the Fisher ""Government acted, and I appeal to every member of this House and to the people of the country to say if any exception can be taken to them. Our action was reasonable, fair, practicable, and proper. Upou those principles the Fisher Government acted. It was a preference sanctioned by law in regard to the employees of private persons. I come now to the broad, general question of preference. My honourable friend opposite spoke about preference as if he were in some doubt as to whether it should be granted or not. Just a word as to the history of preference in this country. In 1904 a Bill was introduced by the Deakin Government providing for preference. It provided practically for unqualified preference. It was subsequently modified by Mr Deakin, as the result of the defeat of the Watson Government. Preference was then confined to unions that did not use their money for political purposes. The honourable member for Darling Downs was one of those who voted against that proposal",62
473,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He denies that.,62
474,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not say that it prefer- is a matter of very great importance, but there it is. The President of the A r b i tration Court was at his discretion to grant preference, or to withhold it . The law remained in that for m t ill 1910, when the political qualification was omitted, and it was subsequently amended so that practically preference rested at the discretion of the President. That is the present law. Under that law-and it has existed practically in its present form for three years, and in its qualified form for nine years-the Judge was empowered to grant preference to every union which asked for it , and which he thought deserved it . He has granted preference to one only. I submit that there can be no better way of testing a law than by showing, as a matter of fact, how it has operated. We have the fact that, in nine years, the principle on which these gentlemen opposite have lavished all their eloquence and vehement criticism has been enforced only once. The discretion rests in the hands of a man wise, and keenly alive to circumstances. In nine years, he has never exercised the power vested in him unwisely or rashly; rather, on the other hand, has he hesitated to do what he might rightly have done. He has put the law into force once, and that was in connection with the Brisbane strike. The only occasion on which preference has been granted under any Federal law was that to the Brisbane Tramway employees, and not one member of this union has remained to enjoy it . The Brisbane Tramway Company's employees are a living proof of the readiness with which employers defy the law when it does not suit them. We hear great panegyrics about the law, and the necessity of bowing the knee to the law ; custom and precedent are thrown in our faces in this House, and we are adjured to respect authority, but the employers, like the Government, when it suits them, respect nothing. The Brisbane Tramway Company dismissed every one of their hands. The men were awarded preference; they have no employment. So for nine years, in fact, this law has done no man harm. No employer, no citizen, not one human being, has been affected by this law. Yet we hear from one end of the country to the other the honourable member for Parramatta screaming about preference to unionists like-well , like what?",62

476,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It reminds me not little of a duck-billed platypus. it at that. My honourable friend went the country denouncing preference to imionists. Preference has, in fact, been enforced in Australia under the monwealth Act, never been enjoyed by cil. one human being. How, then, could any human being be the worse for it ? I want to strip every pretext from these orable gentlemen, and show the naked thing beneath, to let the people see their hollowness and the rottenness of their did proposals. They denounce preference unionists; it has never been enforced; it has never taken effect. They denounce political unionism; yet they dare not yet they bring in this measure. touch it . Why do they not attack it preference be, as they say, a menace and a danger? Here is the law - the Arbitration (Public Service) A c Why do not our honourable friends bring in a short Bill repealing that Act? is the Commonwealth Conciliation and ister existed. Arbitration Act. Why do they not bring in a Bill repealing that Act? Let us go fco the country on these things. Then, indeed, the people would have some substance, not a miserable shadow, impalpable, vanishing as we approach, which will not permit us to grasp it . They tell us that preference to unionists is a danger, that political unionism saps the vitality of the nation; and they give us this measure, which has no relation to political unionism at all. They say that industrial unionism is a menace, and they give us this measure, which affects only 12,000 men, and every one of them they propose to remove from the scope of its operations. This is a bold, courageous policy if you l i k e ! Why are they doing it ? They are doing it for two reasons. First, because they had not the courage to act otherwise; and, second, because they are compelled to make some show, to persuade the people that they are desperately in earnest, and desperately courageous men. They propose to send this measure up to the Senate, in order, that it may be rejected. Why? The Senate has, in its time, accepted a dozen such measures in the afternoon. What human being could a measure like this hurt? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It will not hurt anybody.",63
477,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What human being would be the better for it? I do not deny a that the intention is venomous. But why I leave this miserable pretence? The Governto ment can do this thing, not in six months' time, not after a double dissolunever tion, but tomorrow morning. Let them Comsummon a meeting of the Executive CounLet the Attorney-General write a minute that in future no preference to unionists shall be granted to persons emhonployed in the Commonwealth. Mr W . H . IRVINE - We have done it .",63
478,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Well, well, well, urn, did'um, did ' u m ! In the history to of great political achievements, was there ever an achievement fit to rank on a par with this one? They have done it , and They if have abolished preference to unionists in the Commonwealth service. In the name of God, then, what is this thing- a shadow t . of a shadow. It has now not even that semblance of a foundation which it had Here when the minute of the ex-Prime M i nThe Government have Already done thatwhich they say this R ill is to give them power to do. Are we going to the electors, are we going to drag the Senate to the electors, and ask them to give us power to do something that these honourable gentlemen say they have already done? Why, sir, there are limits even to the idiocy of the human m in d ; and I truly am at a loss to understand how honourable gentlemen can have introduced such a measure as this. feel perfectly satisfied that honourable members who sit behind the Government had no conception of the scope of this measure. They imagined it really dealt a substantial blow at preference to unionists. I should be the last to complain if the Government had done that, because they have every right to assert a principle in which they believe, or to denounce one in which they do not believe. But this is not a principle; it is a pretext, is less than nothing. The Attorney-General has treated us to a dissertation about unionism. believes in unionists combining. thinks it is a very proper thing for them to do that. They can do all that they are able to do. They must not break the law, they must not use force, and, of course, they must not expect the mantle of the law to be thrown over their shoulders; whatever they can get otherwise, well and good. There only two ways in which a unionist can achieve any advantage, and both of them have, in fact, so far as the non-unionist is concerned, the same effect. unionist can only enjoy an advantage at the expense of a non-unionist by getting something which the latter would otherwise have got. How does it matter to a non-unionist that his bread and butter is taken away from him by unionists without the sanction of the law; how does it sweeten his sorrow; how does it help him the better to bear his When the Prime Minister was a miner and an active unionist, I have no doubt that he took part in several strikes and resisted the non-unionist coming to take his work. No doubt, the non-uniouist did not feel that any sweeter because there was no law at the back of the honourable member. If a man robs me, I do not mind whether he robs me under the sanction of the law or not. The fact is that he robs me, and' there is an end of Mr Hughes. it. If a man stops me from getting my living, I do not care whether he stops me under the segis of the law; it is sufficient if he stops me. If unionism is bad, it does not become any better because you throw the mantle of the law over it , nor does it become any worse. But if unionism is of that kind that the mantle of the law may not be thrown over its shoulder, it is something for which civilization has I no room; it ought to be put out. There is nothing in a civilized society which the law ought to permit if it does not approve. There is nothing it ought to permit if it does not believe it to be good and for the welfare of society. Therefore, if unionism is to be permitted at all it ought to be recognised by law. The unionist ought to have his privileges and his rights sanctioned and defined by law, or he ought not to be allowed to have any privileges and rights at all. What the Attorney-General says is that unionism is to have what it can get by force, and by force is to hold if . He That is what he says. But when force He is attempted, how does my honourable friend act? This honourable gentleman who now says, "" They can get what they can get, and hold what they can hold "" when they tried to get what they could get, and hold what they could hold, what did he do? He flew to the Legislature, passed his Coercion Act , and crushed are them out of existence. That is how he acted. There is his law. Always against 0 the unionist, and never for him. A The idea of this gentleman speaking about law and denouncing the unionist. He speaks law. Why he is a member of an organization which daily defies the law, which has trampled out of existence a law passed in this State for the protecacting tion and benefit of the people of this country. There is a law in Victoria which provides for the amalgamation of privations? the two branches of the profession, to one of which I belong. Under that law a man in this State is both a barrister and a solicitor, and is permitted to practise either branch of his profession. This law was passed in order that litigants might avail themselves of the services of a lawyer without having first to go to a solicitor. In short, it is a law which was enacted for the benefit of the people. How does my honourable friend treat it ? Why, he, who speaks of freedom and the right of any man to earn his daily bread, will crush out any man who does what the law of Victoria permits him to do. I am a unionist, and I am an official of a powerful union in this country. I have seen what unionism can do, and I say that the greatest thing ever attempted is bufc as dust compared with granite rock alongside the boycott and the defiance of the law by the Attorney-General. He is the Leader of the Bar in this State, quite apart from the position which he occupies at present. He is the leader of that section of the profession which will not con- law. sorb with a mere solicitor-this gentleman who declares that all men ought to be free to gather f r u it in Eden. opportunities to get his living ought not to be curtailed by other men. He should be able to put out his hand and gather the ripe f r u it . That is the picture which my honourable friend paints. But behind every tree in his Eden there lurks a Satan, and when an unfortunate man has put out his hand once he will never hold it out again. The honourable gentleman's association wields a more effective boycott than any trade union in Australia. I say that without any hesitation. I do not wish honourable members to run away with the idea that I am objecting to it . I am not going to sail under any false colours at a i l . I believe in preference to unionists. I merely say that it does not become the honourable gentleman to denounce unionists and preference. He claims, and enjoys, not only the preference which the law extends to him, but the preference which the law has denied him. I do not wish any person in this country to think that in anything I have said about the honourable gentleman's profession I am speaking beyond the card, because I am not. There are men who have been, and are now, in this House, and on his side of it , with whom the Attorney-General will not associate himself professionally at all. Let him deny that. Before any man in the community can become a member of the honourable member's profession, he must qualify himself. He must pass an examination. In short, he must do what the Leader of the Opposition said-h e must serve his time just as any artisan has to serve his time. Neither more nor less. The honourable member for Dalley represents an organization whose branches extend to the four corners of the eartli, and its members have fco serve about as long-perhap s a little longer - than do those who qualify for the Attorney-General's profession. But when they have become members of that organization the mantle of the law is not thrown over their shoulders as it is thrown over the shoulders of my honourable friend. They have to get what they are able to get. If they get preference, they ""get it by spending their money for political purposes, or by resorting to force and defying the That is the hard alternativeto which they are reduced. The honourable member for Flinders does His not spend his money. Although he defies the law, the law still smiles sweetly on him. Just one word more about the question of arbitration and strikes. The honourable gentleman said that thetime was not ripe for the abolition of strikes. I am sure that if Mr Essonwere here to-night, he would say that it was by a most happy chance that he heard those words falling from the lips of my honourable f r i e n d - "" The time is not yet r i p e ."" Never since the world began was there a more apposite remark than that in connection with this Government.. The time is never ripe for them. Why do they not send up a measure to the Senate which reflects the statements which they made to the electors at the last election? Why ' d o they not say, "" We are opposed to political unionism, and opposed to preference fco unionists ' ' ? The time is not yet ripe. Why do not fchey treat the private employer fairly? The time is not yet ripe. They intend fco abolish preference to unionists, because they say it does not give the Commonwealth the chance to get the best men. But they propose to allow the private employer to be submerged under this principle, which does not give them the chance to get the services of the best men. The private employers, the poor, unfortunate gentlemen whom they are here to represent, are to linger still in an inferno, whilst these gentlemen fight the sham fight up above, because the time is not yet ripe. The time will never be ripe for reform with a Government of this kind. Here is an opportunity. The time is ripe, and rotten ripe, for the people to be called upon to express an opinion in regard to this matter. When the Government denounce preference to unionists, it is conclusive proof either that they are unaware of the tendency of modern civilization, or that they w i l f u l ly shut their eyes to that which passes before the vision of every adult man and woman in the community. Every step in the evolution of mankind has been in the direction of organization and superorganization. What are the great forces which govern society today? In every department of production and distribution are there not combines of one sort and another that demand preference? Do they not insist upon it? Is there an organization of any sort that does not put in a plea for preference, and which, if strong enough, does not get it? I have not once, but half-a-dozen times, attended conferences with employers when they have made it a part of the agreement into which we entered that we would decline to work for non-union employers. I have signed such agreements on behalf of the union with which I am associated. Everybody who knows what employers are, what human nature is, knows that that is the very thing upon which they do insist. What is more, they declare amongst themselves that any person doing business with a non-union employer shall be boycotted. Here is one instance out of a hundred which I might give in proof of niy assertion. It . will be found upon page 951 of Hansard of 29th September, 1911. It has reference to the General Carters and Contractors Association of Melbourne. The agreement sets out thatMembers must .give preference to association members wherever possible when requiring teams to assist them in their work. Members must also refrain from assisting or employing non^associated carriers who are known to be working adversely to the interests of the Association. In short, the employers stand by preference just as the employees stand by it . Every organization stands by preference, and insists upon it , when it is able to do so. Preference is the natural and in evitable corollary of organization. It is universal in its application, and I say that the Commonwealth, in regard to its own employees, has as much righ t to consider a principle of this sort as it has to consider the question of a White Australia or of Protection. Let me now say a word as to why the Government should employ unionists Mr Hughes. rather than non-unionists. I will give two reasons. The first is that the most effective way of preserving industrial peace is to employ unionists rather than non-unionists. The second is that unionism having been sanctioned and recognised by law, it ought to be encouraged, and the State ought to stand out as the model employer. It ought to pay the best wages, and ought to encourage the employment of the best men. Not only that, but I say that the community recognises the principle of preference to unionists, and, having recognised it , has approved it . I will prove my statement. The Labour party has put preference to unionists before the country for years. We have never shrunk from that task. We have advocated preference in season and out of season, and when we were returned to this Parliament with an overwhelming majority behind us, we had the mandate of the people to enforce it . Mr W. H . IBVINE - And to use public money for the purpose ?",63
479,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . We had the mandate of the people to enforce it. The people gave us their mandate fco enforce the policy of a White Australia. Y e t the public would save a lot of money if they employed coloured instead of white labour. What is more, they did employ coloured labour until we entered this Parliament. Further, I will pin the Attorney-General more firmly to the wall by asking him why Protection is the law of the land. Will the honourable gentleman say that the community has not given us a mandate to purchase Australian goods rather than foreign goods, although the foreign goods may be cheaper ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hav e my honourable friends ever had a mandate fco use public money to reward their own supporters ?",66
480,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The community recognises that there are other things fco be considered besides mere money, and is prepared to pay for them. One of these things, for example, is white-grown sugar. We pay heavily for that. We pay heavily also, if you like, for Protect i o n ; but we pay for it because we haveconsidered the whole question, and believe it to be well worth paying for. We are paying for white labour too, and it would be a'bad day's work for us when we considered the money aspect of a question of that sort. There is the - matter, and there I shall leave it . Shortly put, the position is this: The Government have denounced preference to unionists, and, in particular, preference to unionists from the political side. They have denounced this in season and out of season. They have been in office five months, and have made no effort to deal with this matter. They have now introduced a measure that deals ostensibly with employees in the Government service. Ifc can deal only with temporary employees, and, accepting the computation of my honourable friend, there are 12,000 of these. According to the statement made by the Prime Minister, all these will be displaced from their positions as Government employees, and will be taken over by private contractors. That being so, preference to those persons will still be continued, although they will be no longer Government employees. The Attorney-General spoke of the use of public moneys. I want to ram home the point that the private contractor will have to pay trade union rates, that he will have to acknowledge the principle of preference to unionists, and that he will pay the wages which preference to unionists involve. The public moneys, therefore, will be well looked after in the hands of the private contractor. He will see to that ; so that this flimsy pretext, which the honourable gentleman has tried fco advance as a reason for the action of the Government-the last shred upon which he relies-ha s been torn away. This measure stands condemned from every stand-point. It does not do what it professes to do. Even if it did, it would not do anything at all in this great struggle of unionism versus non-unionism. We are here arrayed on the side of unionism, and honourable members on the Government side, say what they will , are the enemies of unionism. They dare not avow it plainly, but they stand there, the enemies of unionism; and I ask for no better vantage ground than that they shall say, "" On this question of unionism or non-unionism, and this alone, we shall go to the country."" Let it be so, and we shall see who will w in .",66
481,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Wannon) [10.4.] Before coming to the subject-matter of this debate, let me compliment the honourable member for West Sydney on having tickled very effectively the ears of every honourable member of his party. David Garrick, with all his glittering brilliancy, would not have been in it with him as a jingler of the English language. This is a question upon which the two parties in this House stand divided. The whole of the members on the Government side of the House are definitely opposed to the application of the principle of preference to unionists in the Public Sersuce of this nation. What is the design of Labour in regard to the principle of preference to unionists? In my judgment, it is the very top rung of Labour's political ladder. By design, it is for them a short cut to the Treasury bench and to their permanenfc entrenchment there. It is well, perhaps, that we should try to obtain a definite interpretation of the term "" unionist."" Who is a unionist today?",67
482,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Employer s like the honourable member are unionists.,67
483,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am referring to bhose who are approved unionists in the eyes of Labour. I listened intently to the debate on the Address-in-Reply in this Chamber, and was particularly struck by the earnestness and the candour of the honourable member for Eawkner. He spoke as a unionist, and was well qualified to do so. As a member of the Trades H all Council of this State, he has been associated for very many years with the political movements of Labour. He knows ibs ins and oubs, and has come bub recently from the highest position in the Trades H all Council to occupy a seat in this House. The honourable member left in my mind, unqualifiedly, the i m pression that today there is no difference, in the eyes of Labour, between the industrial unionist approved by them and the political Labourite. They are one and the same person. Let us come to Labour's own interpretation of the term. The Political Labour Council of Victoria controls the Labour movement in this State, and article IA of its constitution provides thatMembership shall consist of members of trade unions and of persons enrolled as members of the organization, said members to be pledged to uphold the constitution, platform, and pledges of the organization. In the same constitution it is provided thatAU members and intending members of branches must sign the platform, pledge, and constitution of the Political Labour Council. It is f u r the r p r o v i d e d that No person shall be admitted as a member unless he or she is a member of his or her respective union which is affiliated with a recognised Trades and Labour Council, provided that such person is eligible to join such affiliated provided further that any person who is a member of a trade union not affiliated with a Trades and Labour Council may apply to be admitted as a member of the Political Labour Council. Then we have the rule thatNo union shall be eligible for affiliation with the Political Labour Council unless such union is affiliated with a recognised Trades and Labour Council. During debates on industrial matters in this House several honourable members have rather trimmed on the question of the position of the industrial unionist and the political Labourite. It is within the recollection of honourable members that a union uot affiiliated with the Political Labour Council recently sought from the parliamentary Labour party recognition of their union for industrial purposes, and that recognition was denied. We are, therefore, brought definitely - down to the point-whethe r the political Labourite will admit it or not-that today, in the eyes of Labour, the industrial unionist approved by Labour and the political Labourite are one and the same. Let us look at the system .in operation. Labour says, in effect, to the unionists or the workers who promise to support them, "" Support the Political Labour - Council, and we will make the Public Service of the Commonwealth a special preserve for your employment."" Whom <loes the Public Service of this country - embrace? We have in it professional men, the Army and Navy, artisans and skilled and unskilled workmen. Are we, then, to ask the whole of the Public Service to bend the knee to, and to adopt the political doctrines of, the political Labour party, in order to obtain employment in the Service? Honourable members of the Opposition might well be candid in this matter, and say straight out that the aim of their party is to compel every member of the Public Service to support them in politics. If we have arrived at such a stage in the development of the Public Service of the nation that we are prepared to ingraft so pernicious a principle upon the legislation of this - country, then, why not hand over the whole continent to Labour, both in and - out of politics ? .",67
484,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You will have it handed over before you know. Mr Rodgers.,68
485,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Not at all. I ask any honourable member of the Opposition union; to point out to me any Labour platform, either State or Federal, that contains the plank of preference to unionists. Where is such - a plank to be found in the platform of the party? I have looked diligently and carefully through the platform, but have failed to find this principle embodied in it. We have but recently fought an election campaign, and I took great care, whilst that campaign was in progress, to come as closely in touch with the community as I could. During my short life I have set up a condition of living in which, I am pleased to be able to say, I come into close and intimate contact with all sections of the community. That being so, I have many opportunities to discuss the political situation with those who are opposed to me politically, and who do not vote with me. I have discussed honestly, fairly, and candidly, with them the planks in the platforms of both parties, and it is within my own knowledge that many who support our opponents in politics are diametrically opposed to the principle of preference to unionists; that they do not wish for it, and do not recognise it or find it embodied in the platform of the party. Who sets up the Public Service of Australia, and what is it? The Public Service has been established in order to provide public utilities common to the welfare of the whole of the people. That Service is based, and exists, upon taxation levied upon the people. Workers, and all sections of the community alike, contribute to it.",68
486,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member suggest that he is getting no value from the Service?,68
487,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not suggest anything of the kind. What I suggest is that every adult in Australia contributes his or her quota, either directly or indirectly, to the Public Service, and I want to know, then, whether the Opposition claim that a big proportion of the people of Australia, who do not believe in the doctrines of their party, and do not subscribe to the principle of preference to unionists, should continue to provide money for the Publio Service, so that it may be a special preserve for their followers, and subsidize Labour in politics, in order that effect may be given to their doctrines.  might say the same about the education systems of the different States.",68
488,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There is no analogy between the two.  sending us to Parliament.,69
489,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That may be. The prominent feature of the Labour party's advocacy of the principle of preference to unionists is that they have the conviction that it is the short cut to the Treasury bench, and to their permanent entrenchment there.",69
490,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Neve r mind the Treasury bench; we are here just now.,69
491,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And honourable members opposite seem to occupy their present position with a great deal of discomfort. At any rate, honourable members opposite seem very anxious to return to this side. We have had several definitions of the doctrine of preference. There has been, what I may call without disrespect, the O'Malley doctrine of absolute preference, and we have had that of the Leader of the Opposition, whose idea is preference, "" other things being equal."" I have not, however, heard - any interpretation of those words, "" other things being equal;"" and I ask whether anybody can say there is any sincerity in them ? When we find two men eligible for the Public Service, in connection with whom all things are equal",69
492,Mr FBAZEB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Suppos e there is a man with one leg and another man with two legs!,69
493,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is a different matter; we are now talkiug of efficiency. I can see nothing in preference except an attempt to secure a legalized means of compelling public servants to vote for Labour.  pelled to vote in a certain wayT,69
494,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A long step is taken towards it when a man is placed under pledge to vote. In all honesty and sincerity-becaus e this is a matter on which there should be no misrepresentation, but as much elucidation as possible- I ask what is meant by the article in the constitution of the Labour party which provides that the members shall be pledged to support the platform of the party. I am quite aware that it is impossible to mark a man's ballot-paper for him, but, as I say, you go a long way to compelling him to vote in a certain direction if you tell him that if he does not do so he shall not have a place in the Public Service. If that is not playing the political game "" low dowD,"" I do not know  is only a candidate who pledges himself to vote for the party. I will show the honourable member an Australian Workers Union ticket tomorrow morning, and he will find on it nothing in the shape of a pledge to vote for Labour.",69
495,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then what is the interpretation of the rule that all members, and intending members, of branches must sign the platform, pledge, and constitution of the Political Labour Council?",69
496,Mr DANKEL,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That has reference to the Political Labour League.,69
497,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Wit h which are affiliated all trade unions.,69
498,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is where the honourable member is entirely wrong.,69
499,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course, I am open to correction; but I understand that before a person can join the Political Labour Council, the union to which he belongs has to become affiliated with that council.",69
500,Mr ROBERTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There is no compulsion to come into the Political Labour party.,69
501,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I know; but if preference is desired it is asked that the unions shall become affiliated with the movement.,69
502,Mr ROBERTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What the honourable member does not seem to understand is that there are tens of thousands of unionists who are not in the Political Labour party.,69
503,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I know; and I am also aware that there are many unionists who would not touch the Labour movement with a forty-foot pole.,69

505,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is there not a Labour union in this State known as the Liberal Workers Union?,69
506,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member call that a union ?,69
507,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is an employers' union, subsidized by the employers.",69
508,Mr ROBERTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member's charge falls to the ground when he says that there are many unionists who would not touch the Labour movement with some kind of pole.,69
509,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"And these are the men whom the Labour party will not recognise in connection with the Public Service, and whom the Labour Government refuse to recognise so as to give them the advantage of the laws of the country. There is a plank in the State Labour platform about which I am much concerned, and I think it just as well to have it placed on record in Hansard. That plank is "" Equality of opportunity; the right to work. "" Plow do honourable members opposite reconcile that plank with the doctrine of preference?",69
510,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,That is easy!,70
511,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I hope that some lionorable member opposite, and I particularly call on the honourable member for Adelaide, will be able to explain this matter.",70
512,Mr ROBERTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If the honourable member will guarantee me that he has an open mind, I shall explain it to him.",70

516,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This is a question on which we hold diametrically opposite opinions, and I am not one who desires to see acrimony in this Chamber. If the honourable member for Adelaide can convince me that the principle of preference is a right principle, morally and politically, I shall subscribe to it . The Bill opens up the general principle of preference, and affords an opportunity to enter thoroughly into the industrial situation. That, however, I do not wish to do. Beyond saying, as I have said on the platform, that I take no exception whatever to either industrial or political unionism. I recognise that we, on our side, come together in order to improve our political conditions, and the conditions of our supporters, and I am prepared to concede the same right to our opponents. At the same time, I must say emphatically that I am opposed to very many of the economic and social doctrines advanced by honourable members opposite.",70
517,Mr FRAZEB,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Did the honourable member speak of improving the conditions of his supporters?,70
518,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I spoke of improving the conditions of our supporters, along with those of the whole of the taxpayers of the country. The honourable member for West Sydney expressed the opinion that there was no substance in the Bill , but I contend that the principle, even if it affects only half-a-dozen people, is a vital one; and I hope that the House will determine that, in the Public Service, there shall be equality of opportunity for all, and preference to none.",70
519,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Darling) [10.26] - We have listened with some degree of interest to the speeches of the Attorney-General and the ex-Attorney-General; and, in my opinion, the remarks of the latter practically annihilated the position of the Government. We have had an admission that the principle of no preference is already in operation; and yet, although we are told important business remains to be done in the short time at our disposal, we have this Bill introduced. Further astonishment is created by the suggestion that this is to be a great test issue in the double dissolution which the Government say they desire. But it is peculiar to go to the people for authority for something that has already been done. It is a new method to adopt a law by regulation before introducing a Bill ; and perhaps, we have not yet quite realized the value of such a method. The Minister of Trade and Customs is very innocent in his idea that this Bill , if passed, will make a change in the practical working of unionism. The only effect w i ll be to set up an inequality under the existing law in the matter of disputes which arise when men refuse to work with non-unionists. In such cases, the employees in the Commonwealth are to be denied the right to appeal to the Court for settlement. A tribunal has been set up by this Parliament for the settlement of industrial disputes and the maintenance of industrial peace; and yet it is proposed by Act of Parliament to prevent that tribunal from promoting in dustrial peace; in short, this is a measure calculated to promote in dustrial warfare, and perpetrate in justice on a number of citizens. It seems to me extraordinary for the Government to adopt such an attitude. do not intend to repeat the arguments, so clinching in their effect, of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for West Sydney. They have torn the Bill to pieces, and shown it is not needed. I wish to reply to one or two points raised by the Attorney-General in introducing the measure. He covered a big field. He went back to the days of the guilds, and wished to know why the unionists did not take up some of the good work done by those guilds. We do not ask for the power those guilds had; because men were compelled by Act of Parliament, under penalty of imprisonment, to join the guilds; but, though the guilds certainly did splendid work, I wish to make one or two quotations, by way of reply to the Attorney-General, as to the work the modern trade unions do. The Duke of A r g y l l , in the Reign of Law, says-The mere founding, for example, of a voluntary society for any given purpose evolves out of the primary elements of human character a latent force of the most powerful kind, namely, the motives, the sentiment, the feeling, the passion, as it often is, of the spirit of association. Fothergill Robinson, in the Spirit of Association, saysIt has been a pathfinder to the Legislature. It has built up systems of assurance which have received legislative sanction, and are now being absorbed and developed into a State scheme. It has befriended the arts, literature, science, cine, 'and bas rendered untold services to educa. tion. In all its expressions, from the vast federations of trade unions to the smallest gatherings of knots of enthusiasts assembled for some altruistic purpose, it has had an unmeasurable influence upon our national destiny. We shall see that by its means character has been trained and raised, a religious spirit has been manifested, discipline has been enforced, and also that the various forms of association in England have served os schools of citizenship. Tn these quotations, there is a complete answer to the Attorney-General in' regard t.o the value of trade unions, because today they have behind them that same spirit; they discipline men and make them better men. The Attorney-General in ferred that trade unions have ceased to do what some of the guilds did, and that they have ceased to see that there is efficiency in their membership; but any one in touch with the trade unions'of today knows that he is wrong - The trade unions, particularly in the Sheffield trades, and in their allied branches in Australia, do I not admit members unless they are efficient tradesmen. In regard .to the apprenticeship question, the trade unions are fighting for more efficient tradesmen, while the class wbo vote for the present Government are those who fight against it . They seek to have an unlimited number of apprentices, and to turn out the greater part of their work by apprentices, and thus not have apprentices trained properly. We recognise that the apprenticeship question is a difficult problem since the introduction of machinery. In fact, there has been a big change that has brought about the. conditions of the modern trade unions, and sharper lines of conflict, as contrasted with the old guilds. Fothergill Robinson says, speaking of the change of thingsThe new belief which gained acceptance was that the freedom of each man to purrue his own individual interests was the surest of guarantees of national prosperity and well-being. The followers of this faith, however, failed to reckon with certain weaknesses of unregensrhte human nature. .The fact that the equitable distribution of wealth was infinitely more important for the true welfare of the nation than its rapid acquisition was not realized. To-day, the Labour party stand for the more equitable distribution of wealth, for a higher standard of comfort for all, and for the abolition of all low-down conditions. We are only at the dawn of such things; but our aim in this direction is higher than the question of the individual medi- doing what he likes. Fothergill Robinson further says The ethical standard of the age was utterly unequal to support the strain which was cast upon it when machinery rendered the accumulation of Urge fortunes a new possibility. The national conscience slept while horrors and iniquities were perpetrated, which were perhaps unsurpassed in the history of industry in any country. The struggle is not over, by any means. It is interesting to find the representatives of the class largely governed by the Employers Federation admitting the importance and value of trade unionism by the introduction of a Bill which is one step in the direction of striking a blow at that very institution in our national life that makes for the improvement of individuals and the betterment of society. I ask leave to continue my speech on some future occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 10.40 p.m.",70
