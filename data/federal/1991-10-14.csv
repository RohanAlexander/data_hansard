1,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Ronald Edwards) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA",12
2,Mr HOWE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, left yesterday, 13 October, to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Zimbabwe and will return to Australia on 25 October. I will be Acting Prime Minister during that period. I also inform the House that the Treasurer, Mr Kerin, left on Friday for overseas on Government business, including meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He will return to Australia on 1 November. The Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, is Acting Treasurer. Questions normally addressed to Mr Kerin should be directed to Mr Willis. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, has been delayed and will be here shortly. NA Fairfax Group",12
3,Mr SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. He will be aware of Senator Button's claim on the Sunday program that the decision on foreign ownership in the Fairfax group would have been different if Cabinet Ministers had been allowed a free vote. Does he accept this concern? Was the confusion deliberately created to deceive members of Cabinet? Can the Acting Prime Minister assure the House that no deal has been done which would favour anyone bidder over another for the Fairfax assets?,12
4,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is my understanding that the Cabinet decision was binding; however, the discussion took place late at night and there was no formal vote, so I can understand how some Ministers may not have felt bound by the decision. However, the question at this stage is hypothetical. Caucus has indicated position. The matter that was referred to by the honourable member is in the hands of the receiver, who must decide which bid best meets his client's interests. Should that bid include foreign equity, it would be subject to consideration by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which would then make a recommendation to Treasury. The Treasurer has already indicated that he would then consult with his colleagues on the matter before making a final decision. Inflation",12
5,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Acting Treasurer. Can he advise the House what progress has been made on reducing Australia's rate of inflation? Is it intended that additional measures be taken to lock in Australia's lower inflation regime?,12
6,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has achieved substantial progress in cutting the inflation rate. The peak of 8.6 per cent in recent times was reached in March of last year. That rate has now been reduced by more than half to 3.4 per cent for the last 12 months, which is the lowest rate since March 1970, if we take out the unusual effect caused by the introduction of Medicare in 1984. Our inflation rate is now clearly less than that of our major trading partners, who average 4.3 per cent; we are effectively one per cent below that. The OECD average-excluding Turkey, which has a rate of inflation of around 70 per cent-is 4.7 per cent; we are markedly below that. Our rate is now also less than those of the traditionally low inflation developed countries, such as Japan and Germany. Of course, it is important, as the question indicates, for us to lock in that lower rate of inflation, and present policies are designed to achieve that. We have noticed that in the last half year there have been exceedingly low levels of inflation, with minus 0.1 per cent as the inflation rate for the first half of this year, and that rate may well go below 2 per cent by the end of this year. Such a rate would not indicate our underlying rate because it is affected by the unwinding of the impact of the greatly increased oil prices due to the Iraq conflict which pushed its the December quarter CPI up to 2.7 per cent and then, with the unwinding, has given us a very low rate of inflation, virtually zero, in the first half of this year. Of course, the Budget forecast is for an inflation rate through this year, from June to June, of 33/4 per cent. That is a pretty good indicator of the underlying rate of inflation. It is a rate which remains below those of our major trading partners. Of course, it is important that we are able to keep inflation at that kind of level, because it provides a sound basis for economic growth; it will enable further progress in reducing interest rates; it will maintain and, indeed, improve our international competitiveness; it will enable further progress in reducing our balance of payments current account deficit; and it will enable us to achieve the early stabilisation of our foreign debt. All of this progress, which of course is very substantial, would be lost if the Opposition were to gain office, because it has made two major commitments about the inflation outcome: firstly, it has said that it would commit to keeping inflation between zero and 2 per cent, despite the fact that no developed country in the world has inflation in this range or feels able to make such a commitment. Dr Hewson interjecting",12
7,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"None has been able to make any such commitment and none has achieved it. Secondly, the Opposition, of course, is committed to the introduction of a goods and services tax which would push inflation back into double digit levels. The fact that these two commitments are absolutely at odds-that is, a commitment, on the one hand, to zero to 2 per cent and the commitment, on the other hand, to do something which will push inflation back up into double digit levels-does not seem to faze the Opposition too much. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition rationalises this apparent enormous conflict by saying 'Ah, an increase in the GST is not inflationary; it simply puts up prices'. That is his answer; that is his rationalisation. It is which I think the public of Australia are going to find exceedingly difficult to understand. Rightly so, because obviously the GST is inflationary. Higher prices are inflated prices. It will push the cpr up, which is the measure of inflation. So do not tell us it is not inflationary. It is an absurd argument to say that it pushes up prices, not inflation. Of course, the low inflation psychology, which is now being developed and which is so important to our future, will simply be blown away by the introduction of something which takes us back into double digit inflation. We will have wage earners, businessmen, investors and money market operators all starting to think again in terms of higher inflation and taking their decisions accordingly; in other words, taking inflation creating decisions. The only way that a government faced with that circumstance can seek to overcome that problem is to pursue tougher macro-economic policies to try to squeeze out the inflationary impost that it has put into the economy. By adopting tougher macro-economic policies, either by fiscal and or monetary policies, that is, jacking up interest rates, it will squeeze the economy down, it will reduce job growth and it will increase unemployment so as to squeeze the inflation out of the system that it' will have put into it the first place. There is a conflict in the two positions that the Opposition is essentially pursuing. It can rationalise it in the end only by pursuing a: course which would virtually sedate permanently the Australian economy, putting it in a position of no growth and of high unemployment so as to ensure that it could get to an inflation level that no-one else can get and to squeeze out the high inflation which it would have put into the economy in the first place. It is an absurd policy and one which would be exceedingly damaging to this nation. Middle East",13
8,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. r refer him to his speech of 14 July this year to a joint conference of the United Nations Association of Australia, the Australian Jewish Democratic Society and the Australian Fabian Society. I one ask: do his comments stand as official Government policy, were they the Minister's own personal views, or did he just read what was written for him? Was the speech cleared prior to delivery with either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; has there been any reaction to the speech from the Australian Jewish community; and does he plan to make any further forays into foreign policy?",13
9,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question, which seems to be a somewhat delayed reaction to a very brief and I would have thought at the time not too consequential foray into the area of foreign affairs, is a little extraordinary. The fact of the matter is that I made at the beginning of that conference some brief introductory, albeit summary, remarks about some of the issues that that conference might be concerned with. In the course of those introductory remarks, I did what the Prim,e Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I am sure others in the Government have done, which is to express some concern about the settlements that seem to me to represent a situation which is, particularly they are being pursued, not all that helpful to the cause of peace in the Middle East. The only reaction that I received to that speech was from some leaders of the Jewish community in Australia who sought clarification of my remarks. As I recall it, at the end of that meeting they were quite satisfied with the explanation that I gave them. The fact of the matter is that, if we take out of context every comment that people make on a situation as contentious as the Middle East, of course from time to time there will be misunderstandings. But, as I recall the subsequent meeting, it was quite a useful discussion. Of course that meeting in a sense occurred in isolation because I do not normally address issues of foreign affairs. Housing",14
10,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Can he inform the House as to Government initiatives to ensure that, as the economy recovers, Australian households will be able to find the housing they need at affordable prices and of a type that suits their requirements?",14
11,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Banks for his question, which is timely in the sense that it follows a meeting of the Australian Housing Council which occurred on Friday last week. The Chairman of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry, Brian Hamley, was able to mention to the Australian Housing Council on Friday that the Indicative Planning Council was considering revising its estimates to $137,000 for 1991-92 and $155,000 in 199293. The 1991-92 figure is 12 per cent up on last year's figure. That meeting of the Australian Housing Council was not an unimportant meeting and, as people may know, the Australian Housing Council itself is not an unimportant body in the sense that it brings together almost all the major players in the housing industry. Those people came together last Friday on the basis of a discussion of issues paper No.4, which is the fourth paper coming out of the national housing strategy, dealing with the housing industry. That is obviously very important as we move out of recession and solidly into as recovery, especially in the housing industry. It is absolutely vital, as I think was recognised at the meeting of the Australian Housing Council, that the supply of land be able to meet the increasing demand without generating blow-outs in the cost of housing. At the same time the Government is determined to reshape the conditions under which the housing and land industries operate. If there is an area that reflects a kind of boom and bust mentality, it is the housing industry. Over the years we have often seen the numbers bounce around, reflecting often different conditions that operate in the economy. The Government is very anxious that in the movement out of this recession we take the opportunity to see growth in the industry, but growth based on a much firmer industrial basis. It is important to take the opportunity to rebuild the skill base to ensure flexibility and transfers to new building techniques. These issues and approaches were spelt out in the latest issues paper from the strategy. All participantsState governments, local government, the building industry, building unions and the community sector-agreed on a range of issues that need to be addressed at the November Special Premiers Conference, including changes to .the planning strategies of State governments to give much clearer direction to local government and to development and changes to the processes associated, for example, with regulations, where a recent consultant study pointed to the possible savings of over $1 billion. Changes also in the area of taxation will lead to greater transferability of housing as people's circumstances change, rather than locking people into housing because of taxation measures. At the discussions there were also talks between employers and trade unions to find ways of ensuring that costs would not increase as housing associated with Commonwealth-State initiatives are developed. It is good to see the very substantial and growing signs of recoverY in the housing industry. That will have an impact on employment and we will begin to see that as the recovery unfolds. It will also provide a great opportunity on the basis of the national housing review on strategy to ensure that we build policies that not only make that recovery sustainable but also produce a very much more efficient industry. Friday's meeting, I believe, is a very important meeting and some of the thinking no doubt will be taken up by the Premiers in November. Better Cities Program",14
12,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Acting Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the cost over five years of the mad cities fantasy will exceed the proposed savings from his Medicare changes? Was his support for the Budget co-payment scheme for Medicare part of a deal to ensure Budget approval of the $816m mad cities fantasy?,15
13,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is not because I am particularly worried about the silly question, Mr Acting Speaker, but Standing Orders under the heading relating to permissible questions states that we cannot have epithets or characterisations along the lines of 'mad cities' program. Mr Tim Fischer-I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. You have allowed latitude on that point. But is it any better asking for factual information in respect of the Budget priorities as put forward by the Acting Prime Minister?",15
14,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that by now the honourable member for Cowper will need to re-ask his question. I suggest that this time he leave out,that epithet.",15
15,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As always, I bow to your advice, Mr Acting Speaker. My question without notice-it is on notice to some extent because it has been asked once already-is to the Acting Prime Minister, who hopefully will have got his act together by now. Is it a fact that over five years of his cities program the cost will exceed the proposed savings from his Medicare changes? Was his support for the Budget co-payment scheme for Medicare part of the deal to ensure Budget approval of the $816m cities program?",15
16,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I find rather extraordinary the way the Opposition fails to take an intelligent interest in a program which is supported by each of the State governments around Australia. Mr Snowdon-That is nothing new.,15
17,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory! Mr HOWEIt provides an opportunity for major investments to occur to resolve structural problems in Australian cities at a time when we are seeking a recovery from the recessionary period. A great deal of emphasis is placed by the Opposition on the direction of investment. There is no question of the funds for the better cities program coming out of the savings that were recently achieved in relation to health. One could have achieved all of those savings and still left a balance of savings within the health, housing and community services budget which would be equivalent to the better cities program. That program goes well beyond the budget for my portfolic;>. There is no relationship between the better cities program and health and changes to Medicare. That program stands or falls in 'its own right. It is a modest capital program over five years. Anyone who knows anything about capital programs recognises that the amounts of money are very modest, particularly in the initial financial year, but even over five years that amo\lnt of money is a modest share of capital expenditure. The Government is involved in a process of consultation with the States in working out the proposals and areas that will benefit from the better cities program. The Premiers have received a letter from the Prime Minister which indicates the approach of the Commonwealth and sets out in some detail the guidelines that will apply in relation to the better cities program. This week State Cabinets in three States will be considering specific proposals that will be relevant to this program. That will then provide an opportunity for the Commonwealth to begin the process of serious negotiations and choose the projects and proposals which will be funded under this program. The criteria indicates the concern the monwealth has to work with the States to achieve some of the objectives that were mentioned and agreed to by all the particihas pants in the Australian Housing Council meeting last Friday. We are concerned about improving the quality of planning; we are concerned about coordinating Commonwealth, State and local government planning; we are' concerned to reduce the degree of regulation; and we are concerned to ensure that we much better use of existing infrastructure Australian cities. We will be looking to improve the choice that is open to Australians not only for housing affordability but also for the types of housing that might be available. There will be implications for the form and structure of Australian cities that come out of this particular program. As I have indicated, this program will worked out in consultation with State and local governments. It will be a capital gram which, together with the States and investment that occurs on the part of the private sector, will amount to many millions of dollars beyond the investment of the Govby ernment. Australians are looking for leadership in investment, to shape the recovharvest ery and to ensure that employment opportunitonne ties are maximised on worthwhile long term investments. Most Australians will welcome the better cities program, they will welcome the Government's leadership in this area they will be supportive and not denigrate Government's efforts. Grain Industry",15
18,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy advise the House of the status of the grain industry'S claim for losses arising from the United Nations sanctions against Iraq?,16
19,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last Friday, the Government made ex gratia payments totalling $32.9m to the Australian Wheat Board, the Ricegrowers Co-operative and Bergerco. Those payments were made for losses arising from the imposition of the United Nations trade sanctions on Iraq. The background to this position is that in April of this year the Government agreed to make payments of up to $3S.1m and, following an independent audit of the claims, the Comfinal payment of $32.9m was assessed to cover those losses associated with contracted tonnages. Of the $32.9m, the Wheat Board been paid roughly $31m, the Ricegrowers $1.1m and Bergerco $718,000. These payments are in addition to the $319m paid out to the Australian Wheat Board under the Government's national interest credit insurance cover, and the payments of $32.9m fully meet the Prime Minister's undertaking to the Grains make Council of Australia that the Government in would not expect the grains industry to bear the full burden of the United Nations sanctions on Iraq. All of the claimants have accepted the payments as full and final settlement with the Government for their losses. While I am on my feet I should indicate briefly some other areas in which the Government has assisted the wheat industry. We be have taken measures to allow the Wheat Board to make earlier and higher payments to progrowers by providing the Wheat Board with higher borrowings guarantees and we have increased the cash flow to the industry. The 1990-91 post-harvest payments were boosted an average of $5 per tonne and, last week, some the Wheat Board announced the 1991-92 payments, which were about $17 per higher than at harvest last· year. An additional guarantee of borrowings of up to $20m to allow early payment of some existing pool equity for growers in financial distress and has also been made by the Government, and the so far around 1,700 applications have been made under this facility. Finally, the prices outlook does provide some basis for optimism, ostensibly for those outside the drought affected areas such as those that I visited in the last fortnight. I would add that the latest Australian Wheat Board asking price for Australian standard white is now the highest for over a year but, having said that, there should be no room for complacency whilst we still have the drought affected areas of the country and whilst the EC and the USA continue to subsidise their wheat industries. The problem is looking up but further improvement, of course, is subject to the two issues of the drought affected areas and the ability for our industry to access markets overseas. Better Cities Program",16
20,Mr ATKINSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Last week, both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance assured the Parliament that the Government's cave-in on the Medicare co-payments would not have any adverse affect or impact on the integrity of the Budget. Now that the deal with the Left has resulted in a shortfall in revenue of $70m, will this mean an equivalent reduction in the better cities program and, if not, why not?",17
21,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The revised co-payment arrangements agreed by the Government will have a minimal impact on the Budget arithmetic for 1991-92. For 1991-92, outlays will increase by $69m, but the overall outlays new policy balance in the 1991-92 Budget therefore changes from a reduction of $50m to plus $19m. That is, at Budget time this year the Government had offset all new policy agreed since the 1991 Budget as well as saving a further $50m. The size of the change and any risk to the overall Budget strategy needs to be placed in its proper perspective. Changes at the margin to a Budget with outlays of some $100 billion are not an unusual occurrence. Such a small change would not be expected to alter the Budget strategy. If one were to go back to last year's Budget, it was not only good enough but something which had to be pursued with extraordinary vigour to knock over the gas line proposal, so destroying the arithmetic of the Budget to the extent of $700m. The Opposition is prepared to raise a question, to argue and get distressed about $69m-a net $19mwhereas last year it was prepared to hop into the Budget to the extent of $70Om without the slightest degree of shame. The Government has arrived at decisions in the health area which essentially preserve the integrity of the Budget. Foreign Aid",17
22,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development aware of calls by the Leader of the Opposition to slash foreign aid and other calls by the Leader of the National Party in support of tree planting projects in Nepal and other countries that he has visited? Can the Minister advise the House of recent significant developments in Australia's aid program to Indo-China? What are the benefits to the people of Indo-China and Australia of that program?,17
23,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. Far be it for me to try to resolve the contradictions of the Opposition; indeed, I suspect that is beyond the wit of man or woman. I have noted the calls by the Leader of the Opposition to slash the aid budget, and that has been rightly and roundly condemned throughout the Australian community. I notice at the same time that, though the Leader of the Opposition calls for these cuts, members of the Opposition, like the Leader of the National Party, run around the country supporting each and every conceivable aid project. So I can only leave it to the Australian people to make a judgment about those kinds of contradictions. On a more positive note, I am pleased to advise the House that I will be going to Indo China next month to improve further the growing links between Australia and the region. During that visit I will participate with the Prime Ministers of Thailand and Laos in the inauguration ceremony for the construction of the Mekong Bridge. Throughout the region that bridge is regarded as both a visionary and a significant project. Our support for the construction of the $40m Mel}ong Bridge between Laos and Thailand is expected to return about $20m to the Australian economy through the procurement of consultancy and engineering services as well as construction materials in Australia. The final contract negotiations have commenced with the Melbourne based engineering firm John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd for constructing the bridge. There is also a separate contract, which is a joint venture proposal of the Australian firms Maunsell and Partners Pty Ltd and Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd, to supervise the construction. Turning to Vietnam, the Government's decision to resume direct aid restores a very important element in the relationship between Australia and Vietnam. Vietnam is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world and there is a clear need for aid on both developmental and humanitarian grounds. No decision has yet been made about the size of the direct bilateral aid program. The first step will be for an Australian programming mission to visit Vietnam, and that will take place later this month, to consult with Vietnamese officials on the development needs and possible projects for early implementation. This programming mission will finalise its report prior to my visit to Vietnam in November, when I will be able to hold further discussions with the Vietnamese Government on questions of both aid and trade. We have also pledged some $Sm towards a multilateral initiative aimed at helping Vietnam resume normal membership of the International Monetary Fund. At the IMF meeting in Bangkok this week Australia will take part in discussions with other donors aimed at finalising this package. I have been asked what Australia will get in return from Vietnam-a typical question from members of the Opposition. Let me respond to that in two ways. Firstly, we believe that we have a responsibility to this region irrespective of the returns this country gets. Secondly, if the hon.ourable member had any notion of the economic potential of Vietnam and the interest of the Australian business community in growing trade with Vietnam, that would at least help to calm his fears. Better Cities Program",17
24,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Acting Prime Minister confirm that his $816m so-called better cities program will benefit only the major capital cities? Can the Acting Prime Minister confirm that as yet not one detailed project has been announced? Does the Acting Prime Minister think it is fair that taxpayers in rural and regional Australia should subsidise those in the cities when rural communities are in the grip of drought and are facing the worse rural recession, if not depression, since the 1890s?",18
25,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the honourable member's question, there are no proposals as yet. Mr Reith-So, it is a fantasy.",18
26,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When do we get the detail?,18
27,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We could do a deal. I will announce the details when the Leader of the Opposition announces the consumption tax details. I think there is a bit of a difference because I know that when I consult State governments what I propose will be essentially supported, but if the Leader of the Opposition were to consult State governments I doubt whether he would get too many State governments in support of the consumption tax. One State government that came out in support of it almost got knocked over in the process. Let us have enough of this. The guidelines of the better cities program were not restricted to capital cities. Obviously the word 'city' is a broad term and it may refer to non-metropolitan areas. Mr Reith-Some marginal seats involved, eh?",18
28,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is quite open to the Premiers to nominate proposals that relate to non-metropolitan areas. As I understand it, a number of them are effectively doing that. It is worth referring to the fact that the better cities program is not about proposals that stand in isolation. As I said in the previous question, it is about better planning, about bringing together the links between housing, transport and the labour market. It is about capital expenditure at a time when the Opposition talks about capital, talks about investment, but fails to deliver.",18
29,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where is the funding? You have not even got the money.,19
30,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Opposition fails to deliver any specific proposals that might influence and shape investment. At the moment the States are seriously considering the approaches that they intend to take in the negotiations with the Commonwealth. We have had, I think, very fruitful early discussions. I am not in a position to announce the results of those discussions because, effectively, matters have not been to the Cabinet. Of course, if the Opposition is saying that, in tenns of its approach to capital proposals that might affect the States, it is not into consultation, reaching agreement or ensuring that what occurs does so with State and local government cooperation, I guess we understand that. We understand that its concern is not with ensuring a different approach to federalism in this country, ensuring a better relationship between levels of government or ensuring reform that sticks. Essentially, if we can get significant cooperation between the three levels of government in planning these proposals around the better cities theme, as I believe we will be able to, that will mean a great opportunity for structural change and refonn in Australian cities. One gets sick and tired of hearing the Opposition talk about micro-economic refonn but, whenever one comes to a specific area of micro-economic refonn, then remaining silent. We get no real sense of any clear commitments in tenns of detailed policy. Mr Reith-What about the third runway?",19
31,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The third runway is, again, being worked at. We will get a finn decision arising out of the processes before Christmas. Mr Reith-That will be next Christmas.",19
32,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Flinders.,19
33,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will get a finn decision this year, and it will be a decision that has been thought through and worked through in terms of all of the processes that are necessary. The answer to the question simply is: yes, non-metropolitan areas will be considered, but that will be up to the particular States. I would expect that there would be a number of proposals that deal with nonmetropolitan cities. Industry Research and Development Board",19
34,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Can he think of any reason why Denis Hanley, Managing Director of Memtec, a company with a stated policy to move offshore, should continue as Chainnan of the Industry Research and Development Board-a board constituted to oversee industry research and development in Australia and, ultimately, to approve grants?",19
35,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I assume that the honourable member's question has as its origins recent publicity surrounding Memtec's waste water treatment and its research and manufacture offshore. This, of course, was reported in the Australian last week and, as the honourable member and the House will recall, it was the subject of a question to my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In her answer she outlined the Commonwealth's support of Memtec's waste water technology. Let me deal firstly with Mr Hanley's chairmanship of the Industry Research and Development Board. It stands in its own right; it is not related to his chairmanship of Memtec. There is no reason whatsoever why he should not continue as Chainnan. He was appointed in July of this year because of his expertise in the commercialisation of Australian technology, which made him eminently suitable for appointment. It follows a distinguished career in industry, membership of the Prime Minister's Science Council and chairmanship of the Discretionary Grants Committee. He has already made a substantial contribution to the Board's work. So far as Memtec's operations are concerned, it recently consolidated its operations in Australia, it is maintaining manufacturing plants in this country, and I understand that negotiations are still under way between Memtec and the Sydney Water Board concerning the construction of a treatment plant. This really comes to the heart of the problem. The solution lies not in questioning Dennis Hanley'S membership of the IR&D Board. To quote from the article in the Australian by Julian Cribb: One of the highest fliers of Australia's fledgling high-tech sector is being lost overseas because State governments are not interested in adopting its technology for cleaning up the water supply. Despite its export success, Memtec has been unable to convince any of Australia's leading water authorities to invest in its water recycling technology on a commercial scale. Its first major commercial plants now appear likely to be in Europe. The Executive Chairman, Mr Denis Hanley, said yesterday that if the company could win substantial waste-treatment contracts in the US, Europe and Japan but not in Australia, it had little choice other than to research and manufacture offshore. The Federal Government had been"" enormously supportive"" of the company and its technology but State governments were not. Clearly Mr Hanley means in particular the Government of New South Wales. May I enlist the assistance of Opposition members by asking them to encourage Premier Greiner to expand his new 'get tough' approach to include the Sydney Water Board? That at least might make a contribution towards enhancing Australia's R&D.",19
36,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Acting Prime Minister. Does he agree with his colleague the honourable member for Makin, who has said that Labor parliamentarians who voted for the changes to Medicare should be ashamed to call themselves Labor members? Does he agree that the co-payment is effectively a consumption tax on the sick?",20
37,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The changes that the Government announced as part of the Budget in relation to health and, particularly in this case, general practice represented a considered response to a range of problems going particularly to the growth of medical services but also going to the problem of oversupply in this country-the AMA has talked of there being more than 5,000 too many doctors-and the quality of general practice, which I believe is in urgent need of attention. The purpose in terms of Medicare is not simply to arrive at a financing system. Australia is one of many countries which have a system of universal health insurance. We are not particularly special in that regard; it applies to Canada, Germany and many other countries with mixed economies. The changes were designed to address that problem of rising levels of services, linked to the parallel and essential issue of the number of doctors and linked in turn to the structure of general practice. In a health system, in the way that doctors are rewarded it is important to ensure that there is an incentive to provide a better quality health service. The changes that the Government announced were about putting some limits, albeit at the margin, on the growth of services but were also linked to an opportunity to address the issue of supply in such a way that the gains that might occur out of those negotiations with the profession ought to be shared in terms of a better quality of service to patients. The three things are interlinkednot to be seen in separation from one another. In the public debate that has occurred so far, that simply has not been recognised. Very few commentators have referred to the fact that the Government's concern is with general practice, that it is with supply as well as with putting a curb on the number of services, Medicare including by way of a price signal in relation to the so-called co-payment. So I believe that when we commence negotiations-and the AMA has indicated that it is ready to commence negotiations this week-we will be able to achieve a very significant package of reform. This area of health is not easy and the issues are very complex. They will need to be worked through over some months. That is one of the reasons why we separated out some aspects of the package from the point of view of implementation to 1 July next year. That was a concern that led to a change in the announced package to include $12m to make practice grants financially possible, at least on a pilot basis in the first part of this year. The Government has announced a package of measures designed to improve general practice.",20
38,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let's face it; it is a very badly disguised consumption tax.,20
39,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has a policy basis that is thought through, unlike the consumption tax, which has not been thought through in terms of a policy basisMr Braithwaite-Not by you.",21
40,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have this situation in which the Opposition bleats about unemployment, but at the same time its answer-its cure-all, its economic strategy-is essentially a consumption tax that will put a 15 per cent increase or something of that order on every new house. So what I said earlier this afternoon about recovery in the housing industry would be done in because the Opposition has a policy response that does not take account of its implications for employment. Preservation of Endangered Species",21
41,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to the recent press coverage of impediments to the implementation of the national endangered species strategy. Could the Minister inform the House whether the strategy is proceeding as planned and what steps are proposed to ensure that the national strategy proceeds properly?",21
42,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The New South Wales Minister for the Environment has written to me advising me that he is unable to provide comments on a revised national strategy for the conservation of species and communities threatened with extinction. He says that the Premier would prefer to have that matter dealt with through the Special Premiers Conference rather than through the processes that have been in place for over two years. This strategy would simply provide an outline of actions that need to be taken by levels of government to save our endangered species and to prevent other species from becoming extinct. Unlike all the other State Ministers for conservation, over the past two years the New South Wales Minister has not taken advantage of a number of opportunities to comment on the development of this strategy. When a revised version of the strategy was forwarded to State conservation Ministers for comments in December 1990, responses were received from all Ministers except the New South Wales Minister and all of the responses were very positive. This positive attitude was reinforced in July this year when, at a meeting of all the conservation Ministers, they endorsed this strategy and endorsed it for publication-subject to incorporation of the New South Wales Government's outstanding comments. We still have not received any of those comments. As I said, it has been going on for two years. Every other State has lesponded in a very favourable way, and now we find that the New South Wales decision appears to have stalled a very well developed and a very pressing national initiative on the conservation of endangered species. I hope that the New South Wales Government will change its position in relation to this, because we want to get a national approach to the protection of endangered species. I believe that this not only has the support of State governments in this country but also has the support of the great majority of Australians. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Third Runway",21
43,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I direct my question to the Acting Prime Minister. Is it acceptable under his leadership, as it is under the Prime Minister's,· for members of the Ministry to orchestrate public campaigns designed to overturn Cabinet decisions? Does he support the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services in his campaign to stop the building for the third runway at Sydney Airport? Does he agree with the position of the left wing that the runway should not proceed?",21
44,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has, with all respect to the third runway, had a process which has been open to members of the public. Issues like the third runwayMr Tim Fischer-Two years, six months. Mr Snowdon-What did you blokes do in 30 years?",21
45,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point being made by my colleague behind me is that, if Opposition members want to complain about decision making in relation to the third runway, they ought to look at the many years that they had in office to resolve the problems of the Sydney Airport. The fact is that the Government has set up a process and that process will enable the Government to make a decision this year. My understanding is that there has been a supplementary report based on the very large number of submissions that have been received in response to the environmental impact statement. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has a limited amount of time to consider those submissions-I think a little over 40 days",21
46,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Forty-two days.,22
47,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When she has done an analysis of those views and of any other views that may be relevant, she will make a recommendation to Senator Collins as the Minister directly responsible and the Government will make a decision. The important thing is that in contentious issues there is a process that allows a proper analysis of the issues and appropriate comment on them. That process has been gone through and the Government, at the appropriate time later this year, will be in a position to make a final decision. Return of Aboriginal Human Remains",22
48,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Can Minister advise the House of the latest developments in the ca'mpaign to return Aboriginal human remains to the Aborigine people?,22
49,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question about what I think is regarded by all Aboriginal people as a very sensitive and delicate issue; namely, the holding of Aboriginal human remains by museums, universities and other institutions. Unfortunately, this comes after a very sordid history which in many cases amounted to little more than grave robbing and in others was founded on what are now totally discredited supposedly scientific theories based on racial superiority. They are of course absolutely false and are offensive not only to Aboriginal people but, I hope, to all Australians. In recent times there have been a number of cases of the most welcome return of remains from Australian museums to Aboriginal communities. The Commonwealth has also been working closely with Aboriginal people to secure the return of many of the human remains which regrettably are still held in overseas institutions. I am pleased to report to the honourable member that one of the biggest collections of Aboriginal remains held overseas has recently been returned to Australia. I refer to a collection of skeletons and part skeletons of some 300 Aboriginal people which was formerly held by the University of Edinburgh. This, the single biggest collection of remains ever to be returned to Australia, includes remains taken from every mainland State and from the Northern Territory. It happened only because of prolonged negotiations involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the ATSIC organisation and the Australian High Commission. The return of those remains has been particularly difficult and I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the university and to all those who have been involved in securing the return of the remains. One of the problems is that, because of the deficiency in the information available from the university about the origins of the bulk of its collection, the ATSIC commissioners have arranged to the have this material returned to the National Museum of Australia in Canberra for safe keeping until appropriate communities can be identified to take custody of it. Two Aboriginal men with a long history of involvement in this area, Mr David Mowaljarlai, the Aboriginal of the Year, and Bob Wetherall recently returned to Australia with the remains. The successful return of those remains is an example of what can be achieved when all parties work together on this very sensitive issue. I am pleased to report that there is also a high level of political cooperation across Australia on this issue. The meeting of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council resolved in December last year to adopt a policy that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be given rights of ownership over the skeletal remains of their people. That was a unanimous decision. A task force of Commonwealth, State and Territory officials and Aboriginal community representatives has been developing a strategy for implementing that policy and will report to a further meeting of the Council. As I said earlier, the removal of Aboriginal human remains from their resting places was deeply offensive to Aboriginal people, and it remains deeply offensive. I am sure that they will welcome the fact that this major collection from the University of Edinburgh has been returned to Australia and soon will be restored to Aboriginal custody. There can be no justification for the continued holding of such remains, which in many cases have been stored and untouched for decades in the cupboards of museums and collecting institutions in Australia and around the world.",22
50,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Visit by President Bush",23
51,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You will be aware, Mr Acting Speaker, of the Australian Government's invitation to President Bush to visit Australia, and particularly Canberra, in the first week of December. Further, you will recall the related proposal that, following the address by Prime Minister Hawke to a joint session of Congress in the chamber of the House of Representatives in Washington, President Bush might be invited by the Parliament to speak to a joint sitting of this Parliament. Will you ensure that such an address, if it does take place, takes place quite 4. properly in either the House of Representatives chamber or the Senate chamber and not the Great Hall of the Parliament? Because of the procedures involved and the fact that the President is scheduled, in any event, to attend in the Great Hall later that day for another function, will you indeed, Mr Acting Speaker, report to the House what progress has been made on this quite important matter since I last raised it with the Speaker of the House during the September sittings?",23
52,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. In fact, today I have received a letter from the Prime Minister proposing that President Bush be invited to address members and senators in the House of Representatives chamber. I am sure that honourable members would warmly welcome this. I will be discussing the matter with the President of the Senate. I have already asked the officers of the House of Representatives to commence preliminary arrangements so that we can conduct such an address from President Bush. Mr Carlton-What date?",23
53,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The date proposed is 5 December. NA,23

55,Mr FIFE,DAYS AND HOURS OF SITTING,"With your indulgence, Mr Acting Speaker, and in the light of the answer that you have just given to the Leader of the National Party, could I ask the Leader of the House whether it is intended that the House of Representatives will sit a normal sitting week in that particular week in December?",23
56,Mr BEAZLEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF SITTING," It is not intended that that should be so, but I think we are talking to those opposite, if we have not actually talked to them already, as I understand it is being handled at the Leader's level, about the arrangements for that sitting in the House of Representatives. It is not our intention that it would be part of a normal sitting week. It would be for the purpose of that particular occasion. There are obviously a tonne of procedural issues that we are going to have to talk through.",23
57,Mr LLOYD,DAYS AND HOURS OF SITTING,How many days would we be here? How many times would we meet in this chamber?,24
58,Mr BEAZLEY,DAYS AND HOURS OF SITTING,"Honourable members would come in here only once, for President Bush's address to us. The question as to whether we would sit for the whole week is dependent on other factors, not the appearance of the President. It is on those other factors that we will make a determination as to whether it will be a full sitting week. We have not reached a conclusion on that yet. NA",24
59,Mr HAWKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Acting Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",24
60,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,24
61,Mr HAWKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do, Mr Acting Speaker.",24
62,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member may proceed.,24
63,Mr HAWKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"In yesterday's Sunday Telegraph there was an article headed 'Roadbuilding costs scandal' in which it stated very briefly, in just three paragraphs: Road building and maintenance costs could be cut by several hundred million dollars each year by introducing new building techniques and contracting out work, the federal Opposition and transport spokesman David Hawker has claimed. Twice as many local roads could be built for same money if a cheaper slurry seal were used instead of the present hot mix. The very brief article concluded: Mr Hawker labelled the present annual $5 billion outlay on roadway construction a scandal. That is not exactly what I stated. In fact, in a 5-page article which I have released I made a number of observations about the $5 billion road building and maintenance program in Australia. In the conclusion to that article I said: Right before our eyes, despite the grumblings of motorists, hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted each yearnot the $5 billion. I continued: Even more disturbing is that no-one knows just how much. All that has to change. The time has come to blow the lid off this cosy feather-bedded $5 billion per year grossly inefficient industry. That is somewhat different from the threeparagraph summary in the paper. NA NA Health System",24
64,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Commonwealth to implement urgent and major structural reform to address the crisis facing our health system which has caused division and chaos in the Government and has led to uncertainty and confusion in the minds of millions of Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",24
65,Dr BOB WOODS,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Lowe)(3.05 p.m.)This matter of public importance is about a Government which is so afflicted by policy paralysis that it cannot take any of the tough decisions that it needs to take to fix up our ailing health system. The whole country agrees that the Budget was a disaster from almost every point of view. There was just the one shining light in the Budget: for the first time in the whole of the Hawke Government's history, it seemed that it was steeling itself to take a tough decision with the introduction of a $3.50 charge for Medicare. One might think that that was not such a tough decision, but for the Government it was a very tough decision. We in the Opposition had some trouble with the way the $3.50 charge was structured, but we overwhelmingly supported the thrust of a price signal to patients. For that reason, we offered bipartisan support. We said that we would support the $3.50 charge; we would make no politics out of it. We even offered to help the Government sell it. With that sort of support from the coalition, one would have thought that even a Hawke Government would be able to take a tough decision, which was really not that tough after all. But what happened? Old Jellyback looked over his shoulder at the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), counted his support from the loony Left, decided that his job came first, rolled the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and agreed, firstly, to the appointment of a Caucus committee and, secondly, to this final compromise which offers the worse of both worlds. I feel sorry for the Minister. For once, he tried to do the right thing and for just a little while it looked like he was a member of the not quite so loony Left. But boy, did he get rolled. He made the mistake of trying to implement a tough decision under this Hawke Government. That is a recipe for disaster at any time but it is particularly a recipe for disaster when the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is involved. How bad is the system? I think the facts speak for themselves. The system is so bad that, even though most pensioners are struggling along on a very meagre income, something like 700,000 of them, according to HBHA figures, have decided to take out private health insurance. They are terrified of being left to the whims of Medicare. They cannot afford to rot on waiting lists. They cannot afford to suffer pain and discomfort in the last years of their lives. They somehow had to find that money for private health insurance. Do they get any help from this Government? Not one bit. Do they get any encouragement to look after themselves? Not a bit; quite the opposite. They get higher premiums. Each pensioner has to pay something like $200 more for his health policy because of this Government's policies, its ideology and its bigotry in the health arena. Wastage comes in a number of areas. Perhaps the two biggest areas are, firstly, wastage in the public hospital system which this Government has done absolutely nothing at all to address. It has simply washed its hands of the matter and said that it is a matter for the States. The second area is the over-usage of medical services under Medicare. Let us not doubt that there is in fact an over-usage. For once, probably the only time in my life, I find myself agreeing with the honourable member for Blaxland who, in relation to pharmaceuticals, said that if one offers a free service, it is going to be abused .. It is Medicare funds that are being wasted. They are not available for the other things in our system; they are not available to replace broken and painful hips; they are not available to have cataracts fixed so that people can see again; and they are not available to fix other painful problems. Those services are rationed and those patients are on waiting lists for months and sometimes years on end waiting for relief from their suffering. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs had our complete support to fix this and he wimped out. He had a bunch of jelly bellies in the left wing of his Party who said, 'We can't do that; we can't charge patients. Heaven forbid!' - regardless of the fact that I gather his own telephone surveys showed that something like 60 per cent of the population supported the co-payment. So the Government has been rolled in a big way. This is one of the most humiliating defeats in the history of this Government that I can recall, and that is saying something. The Government was forced to appoint this Caucus committee-its views were known in advance and its decision was predetermined-to come up with some alternative options. Let us look at what the committee did. It was given terms of reference which were specifically to take into account the requirement to reduce growth in medical services and to come up with the same fiscal result as the Budget. What sorts of solutions did the committee come up with? The first one was to increase the Medicare levy. That is a loony decision, if ever I have heard one. How on earth the Government is going to cut down overusage and overservicing by increasing the levy is beyond me. But the other option-the basis for the Government's final decision-is even worse. Instead of attacking free medicine and bulkbilling, and trying to reduce overservicing and overusage as the result of bulkbilling, the Government wants to increase bulkbilling. Somehow it thinks that making more items free will actually cut down on overusage. If ever there was a case of convoluted thinking, that must be it. Normally the thinking is that, if one makes something more expensive, it is used less. But somebody in the Labor Party seems to think that, if it is made free, fewer people will use it. It is beyond me and I think it is beyond most people with any common sense in this place; but that is exactly what the Government is proposing. I call upon the Government to explain exactly how increasing bulkbilling will cut down on overusage and overservicing and how it will achieve the same fiscal results as the Government set out to achieve. The answer of course is that it will not; it will cost another $70m. Make no bones about it, that is $70m worth of wastage. Think what $70m could have done. Think how many hips could have been replaced, how many cataracts could have been fixed and how much pain could have been relieved. Think about the inconsistencies, and the hypocrisy involved in that sort of decision. The Government has been saying all along, and indeed said it today, that a price signal was important to cut down on overusage and overservicing. But in the end the Government wimped out and took a decision which actually encourages the smallest possible price signal. Yet it had the audacity to claim on Thursday evening that this proposal was a stronger package than the original one. The honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) got it right when he said that those Labor MPs who voted for it should be ashamed to call themselves Labor membersthe wrong reason but the right result. Clearly, as we have said today, the Government's motivation in imposing those charges was not to improve the quality of the health system in Australia by reducing wastage. If that were the Government's motivation, it would not have encouraged bulkbilling. The Government's motivation is to squeeze more money out of health to fund its loony Left mad cities program upon which it plans to blow $800m of taxpayers' money. We tried to find out today what this crazy fantasy is. Nobody knows, not even the Acting Prime Minister's own Department of Health, Housing and Community Services knows, as it said before an Estimates committee. It is some loony Left, half-baked fantasy, presumably dreamed up in a shower or somewhere. I think it is true, however, that all governments in their declining months have a tendency to build monuments to themselves. A better cities program is nothing more than that: it is a monument to the doomed Hawke Government. If Government members doubt whether bulkbilling leads to an increase in services, I suggest that they read the Auditor-General's report. The evaluation made by the Auditor General clearly indicates that there is an association between the overusage of medical services and the incidence of bulkbilling. This is not an Opposition document or an AMA document; it is a document by the Auditor General of Australia, completely independent of the processes of government. Yet, in spite of his statement, Government members cannot accept that bulkbilling leads to overuse. Never mind that the State with the highest incidence of bulkbilling-New South Walesis also the State with the highest usage. Never mind that bulkbilling GPs request more pathology services per patient than nonbulkbilling GPs. Never mind that one particular Melbourne GP who switched over to bulkbilling pathology services, with no other change in his practice, requested 40 per cent more services from that pathology service in the first year. Never mind that in Tasmania, where only 55 per cent of GP services are bulkbilled, the per capita cost is $191, whereas in New South Wales, with 75 per cent, the cost goes up to $250 per capita. The Government's own report from the Macklin inquiry indicates that patient copayments will significantly reduce demand. Overseas data says the same thing, that patient co-payments of around 15 to 20 per cent will reduce services by the same sort of ballpark estimate. Professor Richardson indicates in that report that, if doctors are able to do so, they will make up for the reduction in their incomes by increasing their servicing of patients. The easiest way in which they can increase their servicing and the number of items which they service is if there is no cost signal to their patients. With bulkbilling there is no minimal signal; the patients effectively sign a blank cheque for the doctor. This is happening already. Over the weekend two of the major bulkbilling clinic chains in New South Wales indicated that they will not be charging the $2.50 signal. How do Government members think those clinics will make up their losses? One thing is sure: they will certainly not be cutting down on the number of patients they see, and they will not be cutting down on how often they see them. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) said today that he wanted to address the problem of rising levels of service and that he wanted to give incentives to provide a better level of servicing. Encouraging bulkbilling will not do any of those things. It will do the opposite; it will cause higher levels of service and shorter sausage machine type consultations. A price signal to the patient is important. What about this $3.50 charge that the loony Left was so twitchy about? How draconian was it? Most of us would agree-even the Minister would agree-that $3.50 is not an enormous financial burden; it is about the price of a packet of cigarettes. An amount of $3.50 would neither deter someone who genuinely needed to see the doctor, nor break the bank, particularly when there were big safety nets to protect those on lower incomes. We should bear in mind that those on the lowest incomes were entirely protected by the $3.50 proposal. We are not talking about 100,000 or 200,000 people; we are talking about over four million people not paying any charge at all. But the loony Left's welfare mentality is that government is there to pay for everything. It has really run away with itself this time. We will still support the Minister in this matter. He will not find us doing back-flips. For once he should show some backbone and some guts and do what is best for Australia, not what is best for his opinion polls. It is not too late. I also ask the Minister whether it is true that, in spite of the fact that he has been comprehensively rolled by his Caucus colleagues and the Cabinet decision is in tatters, he had already authorised the Health Insurance Commission to spend a quarter of a million dollars on publicity for the $3.50 charge? I invite him to answer that question when it is his tum to address these issues. That quarter of a million dollars could have been spent on helping those who are sick, suffering and in pain. It means that the Minister's ego must be so strong that he could not believe that he could ever be rolled in this matter. This is an example of enormous arrogance and callous disregard, not only for his own Caucus colleagues but also for the taxpayers and the patients in Australia. The other matter that the Minister addressed in the Budget which seems to have gone by the board for the time being is the question of doctor numbers. He repeated today that there should be no increase in the number of doctors and in his Budget statement he said that there are thousands too many doctors in Australia. He said that it is vital to restrict the immigration of overseas doctors into Australia. On that problem as well he has wimped out. It is much worse than just wimping out because, having said during the Budget that the number was thousands too high and there needed to be constraints upon the immigration of doctors, he then turned around and, if he were accurately reported, threatened the AMA and the people of Australia. The Minister is reported to have said that unless the AMA toed the line on the $3.50 and other charges, he would flood the market with foreign doctors. If that is what he said, it is the worse example of standover bully boy tactics that this Parliament has heard of in many years. He effectively said that in order to get the AMA in line he would destroy the quality of medical care in Australia by allowing a flood of underqualified foreign medical graduates into Australia. The Minister does not. worry about health standards in Australia, he does not worry about quality of health care and he does not worry about the pensioners who really need that good quality health care. The only thing he is concerned about is winning a fight with the AMA. If the Minister did say those things, as reported, he should stand up in a few minutes and withdraw those statements and apologise, not only to the AMA but to the whole of Australia, for using the health of the people of Australia as a bargaining tool and a weapon in a battle with the AMA, because that is exactly what he seems to have done. If that is the case, he should be ashamed of himself. What about the Minister's long term plans for the health system in Australia? For some time, professionals in the system have been saying that his long term aims are to increase government control over the health system, nationalise it and wipe out private health systems in Australia. That postulation has now been confirmed by the announcement in the Budget of practice grants and practice budgets. Practice grants. mean that the Government will give a GP a lump sum and, in return, that GP will no longer rely on fee for service medicine. Anybody with any sense at all will realise that this is the first stage towards putting GPs on salary.",24
66,Mr MELHAM,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hear, hear!",28
67,Dr BOB WOODS,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to hear that the honourable member for Banks is confirming that that is the aim of the Government. Once GPs are on salary, they will have to toe the line because the Government will tell them what to do. Once we have practice grants and practice budgets, doctors are no longer working on behalf of themselves or on behalf of their patients; they are working on behalf of the Government. The Government can restrict services and constrain the number of tests and treatments. If a doctor does not toe the line and do that number of tests, the Government can withdraw or cut his practice grant. This is centralisation and it is nationalisation. I refer honourable members who doubted that this was nationalisation by stealth to the comments by Stuart Hamilton, the Secretary to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, in Senate Estimates Committee E on 19 September, when he said that the model for those practice grants and budgets was the UK health system. He made no bones about it. Mr Downer-What! Say that again.",28
68,Dr BOB WOODS,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He said that we are going down the way of the UK health system. It is a disaster. It is a system where there are no financial incentives for being efficient, no financial incentives for better quality medicine, and no financial improvements to be made in the system in terms of making the health system better. Yet the Government is now telling us that this is the way it wants to go. Its secret agenda is out of the bag. We understand what the Minister is after. It is a case of the loony Left taking over, as we always suspected. I said earlier that it was nationalisation by stealth. I think I ought to change that; there is nothing stealthy about what this Government is doing. Let me look at the overall picture. In February this year apparently the situation was not too bad, according to the Minister. He said: The Government has sought to manage an equitable approach to health insurance policy. It has been successful, it has been stable and it has resulted in the restraint of costs. Fine! But, by August this year, in an address to the Fabian Society on 29 August, the Minister said: Medicare is unsustainable. He also said: There are specific issues which raise concern about the sustainability of the program, the effectiveness of the health care system, and the way services are delivered. Either the Minister deceived the Australian population in February and told the truth to his Fabian Society mates in August, which would be completely unacceptable to the people of this country, or the situation in regard to our health system is indeed rapidly deteriorating and has now reached crisis point. I suspect that both are true-that the Minister did deceive the population of Australia and that there is a rapidly deteriorating crisis. We will help the Minister create a precedent for this great country and do what is best for its people and make it even greater. (TIme expired)",28
69,Mr HOWE,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What honourable members have just heard is fairly typical Opposition fare. It was totally negative and its analysis was riddled with contradictions. On the one hand, I am supposed to want to introduce price signals, to introduce approaches which in some ways might be seen as market elements, and, on the other hand, I am supposed to be pursuing a socialist model1ike the national health system in Britain. The fact of the matter is that the Governin ment is seeking to bring about a reform of general practice and the Opposition is seeking to avoid making any sensible comments about general practice. What we have heard from the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), is another bit of a rave about how he is in favour of private health inSurance, or perhaps in favour of co-payments, how he is against bulkbilling, how he thinks something is wrong with the public hospitals system and how the loony Left is taking over the world. After that, there was not a sentence of any substance. There was also a reference to the spending of $250,000, an issue that I thought was settled at the Senate Estimates hearings, where it was made clear that the Government had spent so far something of the order of $30,000, certainly nothing of the order of a quarter of a million dollars. As I have said, the Government is about improving the quality of general practice. We believe there are some economic considerations that have something to do with what I think is a depreciating quality of general practhing, tice. I do not believe that is particularly the responsibility of Medicare, just as I do not think a system of private insurance would either gain or destroy the quality of general practice, but the way that we pay is not unrelated. It has got some influence. At the moment we have a health system which essentially is underwritten and therefore we are in a position where we are able to restrain costs. Health is not like any other commodity. Through the 1980s we have been able to sustain health at less than 8 per cent of GDP. The United States, a classic example of a country which has gone predominantly the private health insurance route, is spending about 12 per cent of GDP. Australia has, on the whole, done very well. Nevertheless, there is a concern that through the 1980s there has been a growth in the number of health services. That preceded Medicare. It was not caused by Medicare but, nevertheless, it is there and it was a matter of some concern to the Government. We picked up that concern, particularly in relation to general practice, because we were interested how to improve general practice. Our analysis was a simple one. Firstly, it said that there was a very rapid increase in the supply of doctors through the 1980s-so much so that people were saying that there might be as many as 5,000 too many doctors in the system. Secondly, people were saying that in that situation of oversupply there was an incentive for doctors to lift the number of services under a fee for service system to the point where they were able to achieve a certain level of income, a level of income that they he said all thought might be adequate. So the Government said that if the incentive is there to overservice, or the incentive is to see as many patients as can be squashed in rather than provide quality health care, perhaps we ought to look at providing some other incentives. That is all practice grants are. They are being tried out not by a socialist government but by a conservative government in Britain which has used a number of ideas . which are in fact included in the package that we are talking about. It is not a package that is the first step of nationalisation or someor the first step of a national health service; it is a simple change to provide some alternative incentives, particularly incentives that will improve the quality of general practice. For us to go in that direction, of course, we will need the profession to agree, or at least the doctors within the profession; we will also need some agreement about what is good quality general practice, because that is what we are seeking to support. Of course, as honourable members will know, we have gone some way; in that direction already with vocational registration, and this is about quality and accredited general practice. General practice can also include taking account of other factors within the primary health system. We are interested, for example, in the way that drugs are administered or are ordered up by doctors. They often order up ancillary service, without any awareness at all of the cost to the community of the drugs or the tests that they order up, whether they are radiology or pathology tests or whatever. So the notion of asking doctors to at least pilot or experiment with a scheme or consider ways in which they could playa larger role seems to me to be directly in line with the principles of the College and something which, frankly, I do not think the College is likely to be antithetical to. In fact, I suspect the College has had rather stronger resermore vations about the concept of a co-payment than it is likely to have about the thrust better quality general practice. But the honourable member suggests, disapprovingly, that that would not be the case. I am not whether his background is general practice, but my feeling is that out there in the comdoctor munity general practice is looking for a much better deal, and I think there is an opportunity to gain rather more status for the professional, to gain rather better working conditions, have access to rather better technology, to be seen as having a crucial role rather than a peripheral role in terms of health care, and be seen as having a recognised speciality alongside the so-called specialists who very often gain most of the income and a great deal of the status. My view is that we will see what the situation is when we get on to those discussions. The Opposition spokesperson indicated that we had given up some of these things. Not all. We have not been in a position where could hold the discussions, which we expect to commence later this week, now that the Government has completed its reconsideraHealth tion. The honourable member opposite seems to advocate two things. He seems to advocate private health insurance-he wants to see lot more private health insurance-and a lot less bulkbilling. He does not like bulkbilling and he likes a lot of private health insurance. The reason that the Government is not going to be particularly pursuing the area of gap insurance or seeking to increase private health insurance in terms of general practice is that we believe it sends all the wrong signals. What it essentially suggests to people is that they need to pay more out of their own pockets; that is, that the aged people who are currently taking out private insurance need more private insurance and more of the workers who have private insurance need to be taking out more private insurance, presumably for greater cost. A greater share of health costs, if you like, would be borne by the private sector. Essentially the Opposition is saying that an average person ought to be spending a lot out of his or her pocket on health, and that ought to be taken out not only through a of consumption tax but also through private health insurance. I am certainly aware of private health insurance and I know that quite a sure high proportion of the population has such insurance, not specifically for visits to the but in relation to potential visits to hospitals. So the issue of private health insurance and the issue of hospitals and how we fund them will need to be looked at as part of to the national health strategy. The Opposition spokesperson's contribution to cast great doubts on bulkbilling. Of course, bulkbilling is really the Opposition's bete noir; it is the thing it wants to get rid of. The notion that somehow people might be able to go to the doctor and not have heavy out of pocket expenses is for the Opposition a great deal of worry. The fact that one might, through bulkbilling, get a greater handle in tenus of what actually occurs in the health at system, where costs are being incurred and we perhaps get a greater hold on costs does not seem to be of great concern to the Opposition. The fact is that bulkbilling has enabled the Insurance Commission to build up a picture of what actually is occurring, and that has been part of the approach that the Health Insurance Commission has used to ensure that a the health system is a very disciplined one. Whereas the spokesperson for the Opposition would like to diminish bulkbilling, in fact bulkbilling has operated effectively and well as a system, and has operated as a system that has not contributed to any blow-out in costs. In fact in terms of costs Medicare, the health system, works well and does not need that kind of attention. The Government nevertheless recognises that some members of the Government party had some concern about bulkbilling and some concern that the introduction of the co-payment might be a disincentive for bulkbilling, or that the structure of the cut in the rebate might be adjusted so it was clear, at least as far as the Government was concerned, that there was a degree of neutrality about bulkbilling as well as a recognition .that that has positive consequences. So in the design of the changes that were announced last week the Government has built in a modest incentivenot for patients, but for doctors-to continue to bulkbill. I think something like 70 per cent of all services are currently bulkbilled. We are not anxious to make a change in relation to those services. We are anxious, however, to ensure that patients are aware that a visit to the doctor involves costs, and we are anxious to use the concept of price signals. The Government is putting into place over the next few months a comprehensive package of reform of general practice which will mean that we will improve the quality of general practice and we will be able to sustain Medicare as a system-and a very popular system of health care it is-in the longer term. The honourable member for Lowe referred to words such as crisis. I have never used such words about Medicare. I have simply indicated that changes are necessary-not simply in the area of general practice but overall-to ensure that over time we are able to deal with the growth in demand for services, guarantee equitable access to hospitals, and develop a comprehensive system of health care which is properly coordinated, particularly with regard to aged care and other services. In our negotiations with the States, that will also be an important part of what we seek to achieve. So, as the Government begins on this significant process of reform, we expect that we will get some cooperation from the medical pro-ession. We understand that there will be disagreements, but we would like progressively over the next year or so to put those reforms into place, dealing with problems as they arise, but making sure that our health care system continues to maintain the popularity it has had in the past. (Time expired)",29
70,Mr NEHL,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Contrary to the comment of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) just 11/2 minutes ago, there is a crisis in health care in Australia. Everybody else in Australia knows it, even if the· Minister does not. The Minister just said that he has never used such a word. He is out of touch with his portfolio. If he does not realise that there is a crisis in health care in Australia, I do not know what he does realise, because there is an urgent need for major reforms in the system, and the tough decisions are needed. The whole thing with the Minister's Government over the last eight years has been the rhetoric it has used. Government members talk about the tough decisions, but they never take them; they talk about the compassion, but they do not show it; they talk about the caring, but it is not evident. There is division and chaos in the Minister's Party. There is uncertainty and confusion among millions of Australians about what will happen with Medicare. Would you believe that the latest development is that the unions now want to get into the act and run their own system? I think this is absolutely unbelievable. But in today's Australian the following headline appears, 'Union run health scheme an option'. I will quote the article: The trade union movemeI1t should consider operating its own national health insurance scheme if the Medicare system continued to declineThere we are; the Minister's own unions say it is declining. This was the Secretary of the Labour Council of New South Wales, Mr Michael Easson. He was addressing a conference of the State Young Labor Council in Sydney. He said: . . . while the union movement would resist a decline in the Medicare system, it should consider a union alternative if the decline could not be arrested. The union movement knows that there is a crisis-which shows how much faith the Minister's union mates have in him. Medicare is in decline; Medicare is in crisis; and, under Labor, Medicare will continue to decline. Let us get back to this thought of the unions getting into it. Can honourable members imagine how a union run Medicare system would go? We have the experience of the great success of ACTU travel. ACTU retailing was another great success. Mr Bruce Scott-Do not forget ACTUSolo petrol.",31
71,Mr NEHL,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am coming to that. And who was in charge of the ACTU then? It was Mr Hawke, the present Prime Minister. ACTU travel was a flop, ACTU petrol was a flop, and ACTU retailing was another flop. That is what it is all about. All the unions will do is flop. The present crisis ridden system is bad enough. I would also like to look at the perfonnance of the Government last week. We could start with a headline from the Sydney Morning Herald of last Wednesday, 'Medicare row: PM steps in'. Well, he is not here to step in this week, is he? He is doing his statesmanlike strutting on the world stage. I suppose it is rather like the times when he was with the ACTU and when there was some major industrial dispute-he would be off in Israel and then just fly home ready to settle it with a trumped lJP settlement. Well, he cannot do that any more. That particular article in the Sydney Morning Herald states: The Prime Minister was forced to intervene to try to settle a Caucus revolt Mr Howe told the committeethat is, the Caucus committeeits proposal would seriously undermine the credibility of the August Budget and would also discriminate against pensioners and the chronically ill. That is the Acting Prime Minister who said that. The report continued: He argued the committee's proposals would also have a harsh effect on pensioners going to non-bulk billing doctors who used so-called ""pay doctor cheques"". That is a crisis. That is what it is all about. So what has changed since last week? The only thing that has changed since the Minister was saying those things last week is that the Government has been rolled by its own back bench. The credibility of the August Budget is still seriously undennined. The Caucus changes will still discriminate against pensioners and the chronically ill; they will still have the same harsh effect on pensioners. Or was the Minister, currently the Acting Prime Minister, not telling the truth last week? What has changed? What has the Minister done today? In the MPI today, the Minister spoke at great length about the deterioration in the quality of general practice. But the President of the 8,000-member Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Tony Buhagiar, said that the co-payment played into the hands of medical entrepreneurs whose main aim was to maximise income rather than care for their patients. He went on to talk about sausagemachine practices involving even further overservicing. It is all right, I suppose, for the Minister to talk about the general practice. But I suggest that the President of the college of 8,000 members knows a little about what he is talking about, and I would rather believe him than believe the Minister. The Minister went on to say that putting doctors on practice grants was not the first step in nationalisation. He should tell that to the marines. We know what he is on about. If he is going to have paid salary doctors in general practice, he is talking about what the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), said earlier, which is that the truth has come out about the Minister's secret agenda and he is looking at introducing facets of the British national health system. All I can say is that that is not on as far as I am concerned; it is not on as far as the Opposition is concerned-and it is most certainly and definitely not on as far as the people of Australia are concerned. I would like to speak a little more about last week because the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) got into the act as well. There was a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald of 'Willis says $3.50, or Medicare fails'. But it is no longer $3.50 so, if we can believe the Minister for Finance, Medicare has failed in principle already. Mr Bruce Scott-He's failed. Mr NEHLHe certainly has failed. A paper by the Minister for Finance given to Caucus members last week to try to help them-and they need a lot of help-painted a grim picture of Medicare's future, which backs up the criticism that the Opposition has been making of Medicare. The paper claimed that spending on Medicare benefits was set to blowout to $1.56 billion between this year and 1994-95. The Minister's paper said: Unchecked, it has serious implications for other programs, the level of taxation and living standards, and greatly increases the difficulty of maintaining an appropriate fiscal policy. Of course, the integrity of the Budget is still there. We see what the Minister for Finance says. He went on to say, talking about the pressures operating on Medicare: Unless these pressures are addressed in the very near future, Medicare will not be sustainable. That was the Minister for Finance. He spelt it out; we do not have to say it. The Government itself is saying those things and cooking its own goose. Answering a question from me last week, the Minister for Finance said, 'There is some concern within the Caucus about the shortfall in the Budget'. I would like to tell the Government that there is more than some concern among the people of Australia. There is great uncertainty and confusion, and that has been caused by Labor's mismanagement. What has happened to the Budget's credibility? There is still the $70m shortfall, although a little while ago the Acting Prime Minister said that that is only a minimal amount. I should be so lucky to have such a minimal amount. It is still $70m. There were charges of discrimination against the pensioners and the chronically ill. I mentioned that a moment ago. Well, the $3.50 fee has come down to $2.50. That is a reduction of a dollar. How much less discrimination against the pensioners and the chronically ill does a dollar buy? What is a dollar's worth of discrimination? Perhaps we should ask the smiling honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). He may think that that is a joke, but the pensioners and the people of Australia do not. Where is the consistency in this Government? There is no doubt that we have to have changes in Medicare. We supported the Government in its move; we were prepared to do that because it has to happen. I conclude with another little quote from a senior Left figure, reported in the Australian of last Thursday: It is a loss-loss situation. It is up to Cabinet to make the best of it. That was in relation to the Government's factional problems. I am talking about the people of Australia. For the people of Australia it is a loss-loss situation. Regrettably, under this Government -(Time expired)",32
72,Mr MELHAM,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was somewhat amused to hear Opposition speakers .. in this matter of public importance debate today. What we have heard has been an exercise in blatant political opportunism and an act of the utmost hypocrisy by an Opposition which for nine years has been unable to formulate a health policy. I have just done a rough exercise to see how many Opposition spokesmen on health there have been in the term of the Hawke Labor Government. The Opposition has gone through health spokesmen like a dose of salts. Let me recount them. Firstly, there was the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). Then there was the former member for  current member. Then there was Senator Michael Baume. Then there was the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Where is he? He is now relegated to the back bench. That is how good he was at introducing policy on health. Then there was the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). What has happened to him? He hit the fence. after his damning admission of the Opposition's health policy prior to the last election. He has realised that he has no future in the Liberal Party so he will not be back after the next election. Now we have the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). Perhaps members of the Opposition will tell me if I have missed any. That is six. Are there any missing links from the Opposition who were involveq. in attempting to formulate the Opposition's policy on health? What the Opposition is concerned about is not reform, but the destruction of Medicare. That is what members of the Opposition are about. That is what their nine-year record in opposition is about. That was their record under the Fraser Government when they set about dismantling Medibank. This Government recreated Medibank under the guise of Medicare. It has reformed and enhanced Medicare by these changes. The simple fact is that the Opposition is not concerned about the health needs of Australians and would like nothing better than to abolish Medicare. In an interview on Radio 2GB on 30 January 1990, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said, 'I don't think health is an important issue'. Yet those opposite brought forward this MPI today-in vastly different terms from the MPI that they were attempting to introduce last Thursday, which related only to the co-payment. What cant, what hypocrisy, we have heard from members of the Opposition here today. Let the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Lowe go out and tell the Australian people that as far as they are concerned health is not an important issue. The Leader of the Opposition's view on health care is well documented. In the Sunday Age of 17 February 1991, the Leader of the Opposition said: A more radical alternative would be to see Commonwealth cease paying specific grants States altogether in such areas as education, health and so on. And the payments would instead be made directly to individuals, perhaps in the a voucher. The voucher could then in tum be used by individual to buy services from State governments or from private sector providers. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition would abolish Medicare altogether and to provide pensioners with health vouchers, rendering them second-class citizens. The simple fact of the matter is that most Austrasing lians support Medicare; indeed, most lians welcome reforms which will strengthen and enhance Medicare. Yet all the Opposition is concerned about is the dismantling of Medicare. The Opposition is not concerned about the health needs of the Australian people and best to deliver services. Today's MPI is nothing but a grubby political point scoring exercise which will be seen for the sham that it is. This Government is committed to ensuring the ongoing viability of Medicare. The reforms announced are part of an overall package designed to improve the quality of service, to target resources to where they are needed, and to address the problems of overservice and oversupply of doctors. The package of reform demonstrates the Government's commitment to maintaining Medicare as a universal and equitable health care system. Medicare is a central plank of Labor's social justice strategy, but change is essential to sustain Medicare as a universal equitable health insurance system. Without those changes, within a few short years Australians would lose the most stable health insurance system in this country's history. That is what these changes are about. And that is what the Australian people will accept, because our record on Medicare is clear, and we stand on our record. The Opposition policy on health is clear-to whom we do not know, because the Opposition has not yet announced it; we are still waiting for it. What we have is certainly a shadow government and a shadow spokesman for health; a 'shadow' in the true sense of the wordcompletely lacking in substance. That is what the the honourable member for Lowe is-and that to is what this MPI is-completely lacking in substance. The record of the current Minister fonn of for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) is clear. It was clear when he was the Minister for Social Security. It was clear in the reception he received from the elderly, the aged and the disadvantaged when 1 introduced him to those members in my electorate prior the last election. It was clear that they saw thus him for what he is: a visionary-a compassionate man who is concerned about redresthe inequalities in our society and who Austrahas a social justice strategy. We will go to the people at the next election and there will be a clear distinction between this Government and the Opposition. What we will achieve in 1993 is another three years in office, because we are prepared to how confront hard decisions; we are prepared to put forward our package; we are prepared to allow vigorous debate in our party room; we are prepared to modify when modification necessary. We should not be frightened of change; we should be frightened of this Carthyist attitude that has crept into Opposition since the election of the Leader of the Opposition. That is what the Opposition is attempting to do in this debate in terms Medicare-create fear, rumour, scaremongering. The Opposition is completely lacking substance. It should put forward its alternative health policy before it walks into the people's parliament, the House of Representatives, and brings forward a sham such as the MPI that it has introduced today. I would like to see more of this from the Opposition, because the more the people of Australia see of the Leader of the Opposition and what he represents, and what the other side of the chamber represents, the more certain the election of the fifth Hawke Labor Government in 1993 will be.

NA Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs: Government Debate resumed from 10 September, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper.",35
74,Mr KERR,COMMITTEE REPORT,"I am is very pleased to have this opportunity to respond to the paper presented to the House Mcby the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Enthe vironment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in relation to the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional of Affairs on the legal regimes of the external territories entitled Islands in the Sun. The in Government has agreed to implement a significant number of the recommendations contained in the report. It is particularly pleasing to note that the Government has indicated the need for reform of the legal regimes of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. As the Committee indicated in its report, the legal regimes of these Territories, both of which are inhabited, simply cannot be permitted to continue in their current form. It is particularly pleasing that the Government has responded in such a timely and energetic way to the recommendations that were made. The thrust of the recommendations in respect of both Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island was that the inherited legal regime was simply unacceptable and that, essentially, the laws of Western Australia, as amended from time to time, be applied in those islands to replace the currently applied law, but that it be done with sensitivity to the local specific requirements of the islands' populations. In instance the Government has responded positively, undertaking to apply the Western Australian based legal regime by 1 July 1992, and building into the system of adoption of that law a system of consultation diswith the local people and an education program to provide local residents with information about their statutory rights and obligaof tions as these developments occur. We are very pleased with the substantial response that the Minister has given to those very important recommendations. It is, however, in relation to the response by the Government to certain aspects of the report dealing with Norfolk Island and the Jervis Bay territory that I wish to address my Response main comments today. That is not to say that they are the only points that ought to receive the attention of this House, because there are very important issues with respect to Ashmore and Cartier Islands and the Coral Sea island territories which I believe this report has properly brought into focus. In each case we have recommended that consideration be given to the incorporation of those territories within the adjacent mainland jurisdiction of the Northern Territory and Queensland respectively, to provide for their government. Those are the issues that I believe need to be addressed in the long run. I turn to two matters where the Government has chosen not to adopt the thrust of the Committee's report. They are in relation to Norfolk Island and J6rvis Bay. Currently, the Jervis Bay territory is ruled under the laws of the Australian Capital Territory made by the ACT Government pursuant to an agreement by the Commonwealth. As the Committee noted in its report, the ACT Government is not responsible for the effect of its legislation on Jervis Bay and, as a consequence, the Commonwealth Government has to monitor that situation. The Committee does not question the commitment of those charged with administering the law in Jervis Bay. However, it questions the administrative sense and, indeed, the need for Jervis Bay to be administered from a distance. As recommended by the Committee, it seems anomalous that more locally based administrative units such as the Shoalhaven Council are not drawn on to provide local services. Further, the historical basis on which Jervis Bay was made a territory has long become irrelevant. Commonsense would seem to indicate that the Committee's recommendation that the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments pursue the possibility of applying New South Wales law in Jervis Bay, as well as giving consideration to the incorporation of Jervis Bay within the State of New South Wales, be rigorously explored. In that regard, I note also that our report says that the principal Commonwealth concerns in Jervis Bay are now the environment and the interests of the Aboriginal community in Wreck Bay. One disserving point that I have noted in terms of the response to our report is rejection of a proposal to give the Wreck Bay community control of access onto its lands. I believe it is anachronistic that the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community must suffer the incursion of passers-by to and from the waterways through their granted lands. It is, of course, a matter for the community itself. They may well wish to permit that to occur in the future by way of either a licence or general permission or let, but it seems to me to be a rather diminished grant of land rights to that community to pass over administration of a particular piece of land but still allow public access through that land in the way that occurs in Jervis Bay at the moment. I urge that the House press on the Government the need to catch up with realities. It strikes me that the historical reason for the provision of a separate port facility for the Australian Capital Territory-which was the reason why Jervis Bay was passed to the Commonwealth as a port facility to provide direct seaport linkage for this particular Territory-simply has become an historical anachronism. It is not a relevant reason for the Australian Government persisting with a separate system of administration of that Territory. I move on to the matter of Norfolk Island. In its report, the Committee made a number of recommendations to ensure that the people of Norfolk Island enjoy a range of rights and protections consistent with those available elsewhere in the Commonwealth. The Committee is very pleased that the Government has accepted its recommendations in relation to the provision of optional voting and enrolment rights to the people of Norfolk Island, enabling them to participate in Federal elections. This right was previously denied to those people. True it is that many on Norfolk Island do not wish to exercise those rights. It is out of respect for those residents of Norfolk Island who strongly hold to the view that they should not be compelled to participate in electoral systems that we adopted the quite unusual framework of permitting an optional enrolment in Federal elections. But there are on the island a number of people who wish to exercise these democratic rights and, for the first time, they will be able to do so effectively and as a right. There is one particular matter that deserves note where the Minister has not been inclined to follow the recommendations of the Committee. That is with respect to the citizenship requirements for participation for election in the local Assembly. Increasingly, the Assembly has been invested with the wide range of self-government powers. That recognises the particular constitutional circumstances of Norfolk Island where, to the greatest degree possible, self-management has been passed to islanders and they in tum have accepted that responsibility. It is reflected by the differing regimes with respect to social security and differing regimes with respect to a whole range of issues that apply distinctly and uniquely on the island. One thing that is clear is that the franchise that presently exists to be a voter in the Norfolk Island Assembly is open not only to those who are Australian citizens but also to those who hold citizenships other than Australian-in particular, many New Zealanders and some indeed from the United States or various other parts of the world who have come to Norfolk Island under the specific migration provisions that exist under the legislation that applies. This means that in the Norfolk Island circumstance, unique in Australia, non-Australian citizens can participate in self-government of a Territory or State. We have, through the administrative arrangements and the statutory changes that have occurred on Cocos Island and the memorandum of understanding, limited the franchise on Cocos Island to those Malays, for example, who have chosen to take Australian citizenship. We do not by any means wish to remove from the Territory those who have chosen not to take Australian citizenship-by their inheritance and their pattern of residence they have, no doubt, properly been seen to have acquired a right of residency-but we do say that only Australian citizens should be entitled to vote; and that is the principle we have applied on Christmas Island and Cocos Island. It is a principle well treasured in this Parliament. It is not a principle that has been adopted with Norfolk Island. In the minds of the Committee that is a major point which deserves reconsideration by the Government because it is not appropriate at this stage of Australia's development-or of the development of Norfolk Island as a Territory which has moved so far towards self-determination within the Commonwealth structure - for that anomaly to remain.",35
75,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE REPORT," I wish to add to the remarks of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) with respect to this response from the Government on the report tabled by the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, entitled Island in the Sun. Unlike the honourable member for Denison, I am not that happy with the approach of the Government in several respects. I find really quite regrettable the complacency apparent in the departmental advice to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons)-rather than in the Minister himself, for he has not been there for that long-about the continuation of legal regimes which are demonstrably unsatisfactory. I think that the Department should have been alerted long ago to the fact that it is quite anachronistic for the Cocos and Christmas islands still to be subjected to legal regimes which are a product of the peculiar way by which they became Australian territory. I am not happy that there is to be no change before 1 July 1992. I suppose, to offset that, that one can say that at long last there is a date. There are all sorts of fundamental problems which I found in what I saw as the departmental response as being really quite incredible. It is atypical of the bureaucracy telling us where we go. In recommendation 5 we have the statement with respect to Christmas Island where the State law is considered incompatible with Commonwealth legal principles. The point is that it is international legal principles to which we as a nation are a party and which are at the moment incompatible with the law that is applicable there. When we get on a little bit further there is the suggestion with respect to Norfolk Island, for example, that it is just not possible for a list of the laws that are actually applicable to be compiled. I accept the limitation on resources. What the devil does the Government expect-that some poor litigant who finds himself aggrieved is going to go along to the courts and ask for a definition of the law only to find the response: 'I'm terribly sorry, the law is imprecise. There is no list. There is no identification. There is no way by which you can find what law is applicable to the cause that you wish to pursue.'? So I accept the constraints on resources; I understand the difficulty and I regret that nothing has been done before. But, frankly, I say to the Minister's Department that there is a fairly urgent requirement firstly for expeditious treatment and secondly for the Department to accept that, from this Parliament's point of view, there is a need for some precision in the identity of the law. There are several minor items I wish to raise. They are major issues but they are minor in the sense that, because I wanted to spend a little more time on one part of the report, I will mention them in passing. The first is with respect to negotiations with the Cocos-Malay community on Cocos about the environment in North Keeling. I found it a little sad that there is still no apparent capacity for us to establish some sort of a national park over the North Keeling group; it is apparently still subject to those negotiations. Those who have flown over it or know anything of that island group know that it is quite unique. I am very apprehensive about the extent to which that environment could be prejudiced. I would suggest that that is another matter in the handling of which there needs to be a certain amount of expedition. As to the second issue, while I note that in the Government's reply it has commented that in due course the representation in this Parliament of the Northern Territory would need to be re-examined if the laws of Western Australia were applied to those territories, I think that it will be more appropriate as soon as possible for a request to be made to the Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner and, instead of a representative from the Northern Territory being the appropriate representative here, I would suggest that it be either the honourable member for Kalgoorlie e Mr Campbell), whose electorate of Kalgoorlie is more closely proximate to the area than anybody else's or, alternatively, a member from one of the seats in Perth, from which city communications flow. It is important that there be a Western Australian member because, obviously, if Western Australian laws are to apply, it is important that we get somebody who lives in Western Australia, who has some communication from the standpoint of Western Australia, to be able to maintain that liaison. I think there are problems and the member for the Northern Territory really has no direct connection; it just seemed to be convenient at the time. We need to remember that right through there is this problem, that the nature of the law applied is the product of the history. That has been stated in the response of the Government and it is stated in our report. But we really cannot, in 1991, sit back and say, 'Look, okay, it happened historically. It is not going to happen in the future'. Like the honourable member for Denison e Mr Kerr), I am not particularly happy with the Government's response on Jervis Bay. In my view, again the Government has acted a little high-handedly and certainly that bureaucratic reaction comes through. It talks about the extent to which it disagrees with the environmental approach of the Shoalhaven Council. I can tell honourable members, there are not too many local government bodies that have anywhere near the resource to be able to handle the environment the way the Federal Government does. I can understand people saying, 'We want to have this big purse looking after our resource'. But there is no reason in 1991 for Jervis Bay to be part of the Australian Capital Territory. Let us be realistic. Times have passed; circumstances have changed. It is not going to be a port for Canberra. It should not be administered by Canberra. Let us get our sticky fingers out of it as soon as we can. Sure, we have to represent the Aboriginal community-and I do not demur from that. But I do not think in a transfer of responsibility there is any reason for us to forget that a lot of States have a lot more Aboriginals for which they are responsible in a direct administrative sense than the ACT. Certainly there is reason for us to try to accommodate, in my view, a transfer to New South Wales as soon as possible-and I do not agree with the Government's approach to that in any way. The issue that I really want to come to is Norfolk Island. Since the Committee produced its report, there has been a survey of the people. They seem to be very insistent that they want to retain their own separate identant. tity. I accept that. Perhaps as a result, we to be producing our report today, I think I might look at the recommendations and see the extent to which the Norfolk Island comthink munity and its wishes are being contravened. Indeed, I think that any of us visiting Norfolk Island cannot but be impressed by the way which they want to be a little bit independent, as our report has commented, but related Australia and leaning on Australia-not having Australia lean on them. There are aspects of the Norfolk Island response which I think are really very difPresident ficult. I am worried, for example, about the extent to which we are going to be able call on cost recovery. There is a dispute. Islanders complained to us about the extent which the Federal benefit has been overstated; or, rather, the Federal benefit perhaps been not seen as the Islanders see it. In words, use of the airport, use of facilities are part of it being a Territory of Australia, they say needs to be identified, and cost recovery needs to be more pertinent to their requirement as an independent territory than it does in the extent to which the Commonbelieve wealth has applied its laws. It worries me that we talk about, in mendation 44 on page 29, adopting the principle of increasing cost recovery in relation to Norfolk Island. The confusion over what costs what and who is going to pay what worries me. I do not think the Norfolk Island people need to be given the short shrift that I have seen happen too frequently from Commonwealth financial officers. The most recent example of that was the air display the Richmond air base at the weekend, where the Department of Finance placed an abhe solutely ridiculous obligation on the contracthe tors. It meant the more successful the contraclikely tors were, the less money they got. I have no faith at all in the business approach of the Government and the Department of Finance and, therefore, I am concerned, when we talk about increasing cost recovery, that it is not going to be interpreted in a manner that will be to the advantage of citizens of Norfolk Island. There are two other things that a-e imporFirstly, I am disappointed that the Govwere ernment has not picked up my recommendation, which unfortunately we did not get around to putting in our report but which I has the general support of the members, and that is that no member of the Legislative Assembly in Norfolk Island-that is, the in NILA-should continue to be a paid employee of the Assembly. I might well not be to accurate because the position may have changed since our visit and the report was produced in March, but I found it quite unsatisfactory to have one member, in fact the of the Legislative Assembly, also a paid employee. I do not in any way object to to a paid employee being a candidate, and I do The not object to his being elected. But once he to has been elected, in my view that should ensure that he no longer is a paid employee. has There obviously has to be a conflict of other interest between somebody who is a senior that officer of the Legislative Assembly, who is his employer, and then who is also President. So he is an employer and an employee in a position where I would see his public and private duty as being in conflict. I do not that is satisfactory, and I believe there should be an obligation put in place to ensure that, once a person has been elected, he recomshould not continue to be an employee. There is also a problem in giving a vote to the people there. I understand the views of the for Norfolk Island community. But I would say to the Minister: one way to overcome that, I believe, is that anybody who is presently a citizen of Australia should be allowed to retain his or her vote, if he or she is a at resident of Norfolk Island, in the electorate from which he or she left. In other words, if or she is an elector of Denison, though for time peing is in Norfolk Island and is not to remain there for more than two years, I believe he or she should be able to retain his or her vote in that particular electorate. That would both overcome the objections of the people of Norfolk Island and also, in part, meet the recommendation we put in our report. My time has almost expired. I would just say that this area, I believe, has been understated, undersold and perhaps inadequately addressed over the years by this Parliament. It is extraordinarily important for Australia that we recognise that these territories are part of our responsibility. I know there are difficulties; I know the problems of distance. I know the problems of isolation; I know the problems of history. But it is tremendously important that we, in this Parliament, understand that those people are as much Australians as we are, and I am afraid that to date they have not been treated equally and, therefore, it is time and there is a need for something more to be done about them.",37
76,Mr LAVARCH,COMMITTEE REPORT,"I join with my colleagues who served on the subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in producing the report Islands in the Sun. I welcome the Government's response to the Committee's report. However, I would have to say that I do share largely in the concerns raised both by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) about some aspects of the Government's response. I would describe the Government's response to the Committee's report as prudent and cautious. However, I think on a number of matters it has probably strayed too far on the side of caution rather than taking some decisions which are very long overdue and may, at least in the instance of Norfolk Island, gather some local opposition but which I think, nonetheless, are necessary decisions and ones which are well argued and well supported by the Committee's report and recommendations. In relation to the islands in the Indian Ocean, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island, I welcome the fact that the recommendations of the Committee have been taken up by the Government. The fact that there is now a definite time frame set down for the application of Western Australian law to both those territories I think is probably as good a result as could be obtained. There needs to be a reasonably comprehensive process gone though to decide which laws from Western Australia should apply. Certainly the vast bulk of the law of Western Australia will be able to be applied without any difficulty at all but there will be some instances where it will need to be modified. The Government has set something like a year from its response to when that will happen. Maybe that is a bit long but at least there is a definite date now which the Commonwealth is working towards. That gives the residents of those islands some certainty; they know what their position is going to be. Certainly both the Committee's report and the Government's response to that report are consistent with the administrative arrangements which have been entered into, particularly on the Cocos Islands. On the whole, I think the Government's response in relation to those two territories is quite satisfactory. In relation to Jervis Bay, I merely endorse the comments that have been made by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I do not see any reason at all why Jervis Bay should continue to be part of the Australian Capital Territory. Its reason for being part of the ACT has long since past; it is not going to be developed as a national port to serve the national capital. The residents of Jervis Bay oppose any idea of the territory being incorporated into New South Wales, and I can understand why. The level of services being provided to those residents is much higher than is generally enjoyed by communities of similar size in any of the Australian States, so it is only natural that the local residents there view with some concern the idea that Jervis Bay may become part of the State of New South Wales. Be that as it may, and although that is a natural reaction on the part of those residents, that is no reason at all why the Government should tread so cautiously in its response in this matter. What does the Commonwealth really want to protect in relation to this territory? I think that the concerns of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community can be adequately addressed and that there will be sensitivity in areas such as the police because the evidence before the Committee was that there was a very good relationship between the Australian Federal Police serving that community and the Aboriginal community. In that sense it is a model that could be looked at by the rest of Australia, and I think it is to be commended. However, that in itself is no reason for the Commonwealth to say that it should be keeping its hands on Jervis Bay. There have been other reasons advanced over the years why the territory should remain with the Commonwealth. At one stage there was thought of some nuclear reactor being established in the territory. Mr Simmons-A long time ago.",40
77,Mr LAVARCH,COMMITTEE REPORT,"Yes; those days are long gone. I do not believe that is likely to occur. On balance, there really is no reason in principle at least why that territory should not become part of New South Wales. There was some concern expressed about the policies of the neighbouring council of Shoalhaven, particularly with its environmental policies. Again, maybe that is a legitimate concern for local residents to have, but many local residents and communities throughout Australia also have concerns about the environmental policies being pursued by their local council. By no means should the Commonwealth walk away from protecting the interests of the environment in Jervis Bay. That can be a matter on the table for the discussions with the State of New South Wales about the ultimate incorporation of the territory into that State. I simply reinforce the point made by my two colleagues that any fair examination of the evidence that the Committee took publicly from residents and the various departments and authorities involved leads one inevitably to the conclusion that Jervis Bay should be incorporated into the State of New South Wales. In relation to Norfolk Island, the Committee in its visit there experienced very strongly the views of the Norfolk Islanders, particularly those of Pitcairn Island descent. They made it very clear to us that they viewed even the fact that the Committee was holding the inquiry as being an intrusion into their affairs. The Committee did not approach it with any attempt to override the level of independence which we have seen develop on Norfolk Island-quite the opposite. It was the Committee's view that the process of independence on that island should be enhanced. We went about examining the various issues before us in relation to Norfolk Island with the aim of enhancing the process of self determination and self-government. That is no reason why the citizens of Norfolk Island should be denied the same basic rights and responsibilities which are afforded to all Australians; in particular, I refer to the right to vote. The Committee came up with a solution which will place Norfolk Islanders in a unique position; that is, they will be the only Australians able to choose whether they enrol themselves to vote in a Federal election, though having chosen to enrol, voting will become compulsory. I was delighted when the Government took up that particular recommendation because it was one which attracted a fair bit of criticism from the island. I think all honourable members received some representations from a Mr Ric Robinson, amongst others, from the island, saying that they considered this to be the thin edge of the wedge. However, the Government examined the Committee's report and, I am very pleased to say, was in support of that particular recommendation. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) has been kind enough to pass a letter to me written by an islander, a Mr Fitzgibbons. He has applauded the Committee's recommendation in relation to voting rights. In fact, he has described this particular recommendation as being in Solomon-like terms. Mr Simmons-Well deserved.",41
78,Mr LAVARCH,COMMITTEE REPORT,"It is a very rare tribute for a member of parliament to be compared with Solomon. I take that compliment from the Minister, that it is well deserved, on behalf of all the Committee. But Mr Fitzgibbons is one of a large number of residents on Norfolk Island who wants the right to vote and believes it is a right, as an Australian, that they should enjoy. Even though I concede this may not be a majority view on Norfolk Island, I think the response of the Committee and the Government is to be applauded. In respect of a range of other recommendations on Norfolk Island, the Government has adopted some and has been a little bit more cautious on others. On the whole, I support what the Government is proposing to do on Norfolk Island. It is a territory which has gained a large degree of independence and self-government. That process is to be encouraged. It is the role of the Government and of this Parliament to have a monitoring brief to make sure that basic rights and privileges are being enjoyed. Provided that is so, then the Government should largely leave well enough alone. I am happy enough with the Government's response in this area. On the whole, I applaud what the Government has done and I will now allow the Minister the opportunity to make some closing remarks.",41
79,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEE REPORT,"Calare-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (4.30 p.m.)The report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that is the subject of debate this afternoon, Islands in the Sun, dealing with the legal regimes of Australia's external territories and Jervis Bay, provides the most comprehensive review of the legal regimes of our offshore territories and Jervis Bay yet undertaken. I take this opportunity to sincerely convey the appreciation of the Government for the work done by the Committee. Its report makes a very timely and welcome contribution to the process of reform that is currently under way for the administration of Australia's external territories. That is particularly the case with respect the Indian Ocean territories. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) quite correctly pointed out, we have to take into account the historical background of Australia's involvement in those particular island territories. I appreciated his comments in relation to my tenure in this portfolio. Nonetheless, progress has been made, and significantly that progress will be developed over the next few months as the new legal regime systems begin to operate from 1 July 1992. This year has been a very significant year for the Indian Ocean territories, in particular the Indian Ocean territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. In March this year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) signed a memorandum of understanding with the Cocos Island Council which, to all intents and purposes, brought into effect the decision that the islander community made under a United Nations act of self-determination that went back as far as 1984. Clearly, at that time the Cocos-Malay community decided that it wished to be part of Australia. In one sense, this Parliament can take a great deal of pride from the fact that the progress towards the integration and incorporation of the Cocos (Keeling) Island community within the broader Australian community has certainly been advanced in terms of the United Nations timetable. This Government believes that the residents of those territories have a right to enjoy the same benefits and the same opportunities and, importantly, to exercise the same level of responsibilities as do other Australians. This is certainly very much in keeping with the Government's commitments towards the principles of social justice, access and equity for all Australians. Significantly, this extends to the question of the legal regimes and the fact that those communities should have access to modem legal systems and the full range of legal rights and protections that are available to anyone who lives in mainland Australia. The Committee concluded that, with the exception of Norfolk Island, the legal regimes of the inhabited territories are inadequate to the needs of the territories' residents. I repeat that the Government certainly has long recogto nised this deficiency. Those difficulties are at least being addressed through the normal legislative process. In particular, we are seeing quite significant moves over this financial year in respect of the Indian Ocean territories. The Committee recommended radical reforms to achieve the necessary modernisation of the legal regimes of the territories, particularly in the case of those Indian Ocean territories. It adopted as a general approach the application to the territories of the legal regime of the nearest mainland jurisdiction. It noted that the laws of the Northern Territory already apply to the Ashmore and Cartier Islands under the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act. There are a range of issues in the report that I could deal with. As I said, it is an excellent report in terms of the issues that it raises. I should take the opportunity to respond to some of the specific points addressed by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the right honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) in relation to the report. In the case of the Indian Ocean territories, there was a clear inadequacy in the operation of those regimes. At present, the legal regimes consist of a mixture of the laws of the United Kingdom and Singapore, local ordinances and a small number of Commonwealth Acts. The Committee correctly diagnosed these laws as of Byzantine complexity with serious deficiencies in their coverage of basic human rights. We could all say, 'Hear, hear' to those comments by the Committee. The existing regimes also obstruct the Commonwealth's commitment to extend to Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Island residents the same rights as those enjoyed in mainland Australia. The application of Western Australian law is clearly the most appropriate course, given the geographic proximity to the State of Western Australia and the obvious linkages that exist with that State. The Government will certainly be moving in that direction with a proposal to apply Western Australian based legal systems to both territories by the beginning of the next financial year. Importantly, the territory communities agree that this is the best course of action. When this issue was debated in the House on 7 and 14 March, the right honourable member for New England noted that tourism seems to offer the best prospects for future economic development within the Indian Ocean territories. The adoption of a Western Australian based legal regime is one way in which the Government can encourage tourism investment and jobs in those particular islands. I take the opportunity to assure the right honourable member for New England and other members of the Committee that the Government is addressing the issue of a regular air service to the territory. My Department is presently considering proposals for a commercial service to replace what we in my office affectionately call DASETT Airlines. We do not particularly feel that DASETT should be in the business of running a charter airline operation to the Indian Ocean territories and we would hope that with a commercial operation the island residents will receive a better service. Importantly, on a regular passenger service basis, it will also provide greater opportunities for investment within the tourism industry. I also noted the right honourable member's concerns for environmental protection in those particular territories. Both the Commonwealth and the Western Australian governments' conservation and environment legislation will apply and each will be examined on a case by case basis to achieve desired outcomes in a consultative arrangement with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service as well as the State conservation officials. The application of subordinate conservation legislation in areas outside the parks and reserves in these territories will also be examined on a case by case basis following similar consultations. I also make reference to the point about the possible incorporation of those island territories in the Indian Ocean within the State of Western Australia. They will remain, as the Government has indicated in its response, part of the Federal division of the Northern Territory for Federal election and referenda purposes. Incorporation of the territories into the State of Western Australia would, under the Constitution, require a referendum to change the State boundaries. Secondly, the people of the territories have indicated to me that they are not ready to consider a step like this until they have had time to adjust to some of the major changes that are occurring in their way of life at present. There has not been a rush of people in either Cocos or Christmas islands to have those divisional relationships changed at present. Clearly, the views of the Western Australian Government would also have to be taken into account. I tum now to some specific comments in relation to Norfolk Island. I appreciate that the Committee found very little to criticise in Norfolk Island and concluded that the Island's legal regime was generally appropriate to the needs of the territory. In 1979, the then Government set Norfolk Island on a path towards internal self-government and successive governments, including this one, have since endorsed the policy of self-government for the territory within the framework established by the Norfolk Island Act 1979. The Committee reported favourably in relation to self-government for Norfolk Island and endorsed the constitutional arrangements established by the Act. I think it is fair to say that the Committee made only two substantive recommendations in relation to Norfolk Island; they relate to the question of citizenship and the issue of optional enrolment. The question of the Australian citizenship requirement for membership of the Legislative Assembly was abolished in 1985 after the matter was carefully considered by the Government. In the Government's view, there are not any compelling reasons for changing that decision. To do so would have a serious impact on about a quarter of the permanent population of the Island, preventing those people from participating in the local elections-that is, for the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. On the question, though, of the Federal parliamentary representation, the Government is of the view that the right to vote in elections for the national Parliament is a fundamental democratic right and Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island should not be denied the opportunity to exercise that right. Accordingly, we have adopted that recommendation. However, I take this opportunity to spell out a number of points. Nothing in this decision alters in any way the Government's resolve to establish an appropriate level of self-government in that territory. Indeed, on the very day that the Government considered its response to the legal regimes report, I wrote to 11 of my ministerial colleagues proposing the transfer of further powers to the Norfolk Island Government. In deciding this particular recommendation, the Government has no hidden agenda. There is no creeping effect as has been suggested by some residents of the Island. Nor does the Government accept, as has been suggested, that this is some sort of a thin edge of the wedge proposal for the subsequent integration of Norfolk Island into mainstream Australia. The Government has no plans for that, and I suggest to anyone who says that is the case that those suggestions are certainly mischievous. Despite some impressions to the contrary, the proposal for optional enrolment-I stress the word optional-was not put to the Norfolk Island electorate in a referendum in February. The question put at that referendum was broadly framed and involved possible taxation and other implications to which a simple yes or no answer had to be given. At the time of the referendum, the published documents of the inquiry had not been canvassed and certainly had not canvassed the issue of optional enrolment. As already noted, nothing in the decision affects in any way the Government's resolve to continue down the path of ensuring that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly essentially has those State, Territory and local government type functions that are appropriate. There is no logical reason why this decision should be resisted or should give rise to claims of annexation and the like as has been reported in the local press; nor is it correct to say, as has been suggested. by the Norfolk Island Government, that at issue is the island's political autonomy; and nor, as has also been said, is the island being 'integrated' into the Australian political system. The Government merely considers that the option to vote in Federal elections should be available to Australian citizens who happen to live on Norfolk Island. They are the important issues that I want to address. The issue of Jervis Bay has been raised by a number of honourable members. It is true that the functions that the Commonwealth had in mind back in 1915 or thereabouts when it set up an opportunity for a possible seaport have long since changed but, in view of some of the other changes that the Commonwealth is proposing with respect to the establishment of a marine national park at Jervis Bay, I think it is terribly important that the Commonwealth does exercise a great deal of power in that area and, for that reason, the Government sought not to make any changes. Once again, I thank the members of the Committee. In my view, they have produced a landmark report dealing with some of the legal and related issues with regard to the external territories. As a result of their deliberations and the Government's response, I think all the residents in those external territories, and indeed in the Jervis Bay territory, are better off. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Consideration resumed from 10 October. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendments.

80,Mr CREAN,FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION BILL,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Because there are amendments relating to three separate Bills before the House today, I should indicate that before the parliamentary recess all three Bills, the Fisheries Administration Bill, the Fisheries Management Bill and the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill, were passed by this House. When the legislation got to the Senate, it was referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Senate rose before that Senate Standing Committee completed its deliberations. In the parliamentary recess, two reports came to the notice of that Senate Committee. One was the report of the Ecologically Sustainable Development Committee dealing with fisheries and the other was the final report of the Industry Commission which was originally understood only to go to the question of charging-the cost recovery issue-for fisheries management, but in fact made some observations that went beyond that point. Against that background, I had a number of discussions with the Opposition both in this House and in the Senate, as well as with the Committee. What resulted was a series of discussions that ultimately led to these sets of amendments that incorporate issues that were raised, mostly out of those two reports. The amendments refer in differing ways to the three different Bills that are before us and, if I make some observations at this stage, it will not be necessary for me to go into detail with each of the subsequent two pieces of legislation. To try to give the House some idea as to having an interest in consumer where the changes were picked up, I think it aspects of the industry;"". useful to try to categorise them into a number of different aspects. The first goes to the (2), (4) ecologically sustainable development issue. The House would be aware that an objective of the fisheries legislation was to ensure the conservation of fisheries resources and the environment which sustains those resources. The amendments that go to this issue further strengthen that commitment by requiring that the exploitation of fisheries resources be conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, in particular the need to have regard to the impact of fishing on non-target species and on the marine environment. I consider that this is a logical development of the policy statement and is in keeping with the development of our thinking on ESD, in particular in relation to fisheries. A second point of concern by the Senate Committee was the extent to which the industry would really drive the agenda. I to restate the position of this Government relation to that. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will have the task of enforcing regulations which will prevent fisheries from being overexploited or overcapitalised. At times, the collective interests of all the fishermen in the fishery and of the broader community may be at odds with the self-interest of individual fishermen. Since the Authority itself will be a government body undertaking the government's regulatory role in fisheries management, it would, in our view, be totally inappropriate for the industry to have the dominant influence. To do so would be a bit like asking the players to umpire their own football match. The Senate Standing Committee on Infisheries dustry, Science and Technology, while the various claims of AFMA that it would be an industry body, did accept the assurances that were provided by the Government. simply place on record that anyone who still has concerns in this regard should examine the detailed accountability provisions that are built into the legislation. There are a couple of assurances-they continued to surface in the Senate Standing Committee-that I think are important place on the record. The first concerns costs to the fishing industry. The commitment is that the industry contribution, in aggregate, will not be greater in real terms for the duration of 1991-92 than for 1990-91. It does not include the new research and development levy, and expenditure for fisheries management overall in 1992-93 and 1993-94 will not be greater in real terms than like expenditures in 1990-91, excepting voluntary levies that industry may impose and any other costs that are set by the industry. A second concern of the Senate Standing Committee was the review of legislation undertaken by it in 12 months time. I have agreed to this review and, in doing so, it reflects my desire to ensure that the legislation is as good as can be possible and that if deficiencies are found then they can be addressed. In addition, the review will enable further consideration of the final Industry Commission and ESD working group reports want if certain recommendations dealing with the in legislation have not already been addressed. There are 18 amendments to the first Bill before the House, the Fisheries Administration Bill, and some 61 amendments to the next piece of legislation, the Fisheries Management Bill, but the bulk of these amendments are procedural or consequential in their nature. The changes cover a variety of areas, but only three effectively or significantly affect policy. I have already referred to one: the issue dealing with ESD; the second is the extension of plans of management to cover, where appropriate, recreational fishing because most recreational fishing is undertaken in waters adjacent to the States and, in most cases, is regulated by the States under the State management arrangements, but there noting are a number of Commonwealth managed fisheries where it may be necessary to control recreational and commercial fishermen, for I example, in relation to tuna. So the change enables plans of management to be formulated to cover all of those involved in a particular fishery, thus ensuring more complete resource management. It is envisaged that this facility would only be required where recreational fishing has a to significant influence on the resources. The third broad grouping of amendments that significantly affects the policy direction goes to the provision of a temporary orders facility. This is designed to enable the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to take quick actiori to deal with emergencies or to correct errors or anomalies in a plan of management. It can be used by AFMA where the necessary, and where no other action will produce the desired outcome, but it must be consistent with AFMA's objectives. I consider this to be an important tool for AFMA, as I will not be involved in the day to day to be management of fisheries myself.",46
81,Mr LLOYD,FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION BILL,"I bet you are pleased about that, too. Mr CREAN I certainly am. This is its policy significance. We just hope that those to whom we have delegated that authority are able tOI use that flexibility sensibly if they need to, but a temporary order can only be made for three months and may only be extended once. With the indulgence of the House-I have spoken to the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), before this debate, because these amendments cut into the three different Bills in various ways-I felt it would be helpful to outline the broad thrust of the amendments which have been agreed to, the process which led to that, and to indicate, which I am pleased to do on this occasion, that there was some very extensive consultation with the other side of the House. I am pleased to say that, because on previous occasions members of the Opposition have been critical of the lack of information or forewarning on these matters. I believe we have discharged that function properly in this case, and that is why I believe we have the level of agreement necessary to give passage to all items of legislation.",47
82,Mr LLOYD,FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION BILL,"I wish to make some general comments covering the Fisheries Administration Bill, the Fisheries Management Bill and the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill. The Opposition will be supporting all the amendments. I hope that this is the end of the passage these amendments. This has been a messy and most unsatisfactory way of introducing and considering significant legislation. In saying that, I am not being critical of the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), because he inherited this situation at a very difficult time; in fact, I commend him for the way he accepted and responded positively to the reality that the legislation was not satisfactory. I would like to run briefly through the situation. Firstly, the document, White Paper-whatever one would like to call itentitled New Directions in Commonwealth Fisheries Management was released in 1989. I think it was sensible to have that broad presentation of government thinking. The Fisheries Administration Bill was presented in December 1990, with a promise of the remaining six pieces of legislation early in 1991. We were advised that the new arrangements would start on 1 July, even though no legislation had been passed by the Parliament and it was ahead of the remaining pieces of legislation that were necessary for the total package. There was also the appointment of some key people ahead of any parliamentary approval or authority for those appointments-in particular, the Chairman, Mr Jim MCColl. I wish him well. I think that he is a good appointment. I have known him for quite a few years. I just wanted to refer to the way the appointment was made. At the same time there was obviously a breakdown within the AFS with regard to administration to a certain degree. The legislation was presented in early June. Once again, the new arrangements were to start on 1 July. The legislation was guillotined through this place in 45 minutes. That certainly is not the way significant legislation should be considered. I am advised that there were far too many unanswered questions relative to the power of the Minister, the Department, AFMA, and so forth-questions such as: if there are about 800 Commonwealth fisheries levy payers, why do we need to have a ratio of over 100 : 110 people in the Australian Fisheries Service to cover that number of people and, with it, the cost to the fishermen of who were being required to pay 90 per cent of some unknown and unaccountable costs? In the meantime, the Government had established, on a different timetable, an Industry Commission inquiry to look into certain aspects. That seemed to me to be a silly thing to do, because if there were to be inquiries they should at least be held together. As the Minister said, running on a separate agenda, of course, was the ESD process, of which fisheries was part. The logical and sensible thing was done in the Senate; that is, the matter was referred to a Senate committee-not as a spoiling tactic, because I think it was important for everybody to sort this thing out better. At the time the matter was referred to the Senate committee we were not thanked by industry leaders for doing it, they wanted the legislation through as quickly as possible. I believe that there is a lesson to be learned by the leaders of a number of other rural industries. I say to whoever is in government, 'Don't support government legislation automatically until you see the small print'. Now, 80 amendments later, we have a rewritten Bill. The draft report of the Industry Commission is out. There is the commitment by the Minister and the Government that in 12 months there will be a review by the Senate committee. There is clarification of the industry, its payment situation and total cost, and the Minister himself in his comments has made a commitment with regard to cost over the current year, et cetera. I have just received a letter from the Minister, for which I thank him. It says: I am writing to you to confirm the funding arrangements for the Policy Group which will remain in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy when the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) is established, following passage of the Fishing Legislation Package. He then goes on to some of the procedural arrangements. He says: At present the funding of similar activities in the Australian Fisheries Service (AFS) comes entirely from Consolidated Revenue. In addition to these activities the Group remaining in the Department will undertake a range of new tasks associated with the Fisheries Management legislation and the operation of AFMA under the Fisheries Administration legislation. I am writing to confirm the information provided by the officers at the meeting that funding for this Group will be met entirely from Consolidated Revenue. That clarifies another point. There has also been some further clarification regarding the situations under which a resource rent tax applies. For those reasons, we will certainly be supporting the legislation. I hope that everybody will see that it is better legislation. Now with the new arrangements there is an urgent need for better organisation, both within the Department and outside, so that fishermen will get value for money with accountability, so that the industry is able to address this very serious situation of resource security and maintain the stocks for fisheries and so that, within the limits the Minister has stated with regard to Government policy, et cetera, as much real administrative power as possible goes to the MACs so they can be given a real chance to understand or to make the difficult decisions themselves which are for their benefit. It is important to note that in the legislation there is the banning of driftnet fishing in Australian waters and there is the establishment of a research and development corporation for the industry. On all those points there will be no further contribution to any of the amendments. As far as the Opposition is concerned it has all been sorted out. We fully support all the amendments and the three Bills. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted.

84,Mr SMITH,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"This is a resumption of debate on the Special Broadcasting Service Bill which was brought to the House a little while ago by the Government. I indicate on behalf of the coalition that we will be supporting the Bill but there will be some amendments which I understand were circulated in my name earlier in the day. This is a very significant Bill, for many reasons. I will canvass some of those later on but, broadly speaking, the SBS, which was established some considerable time ago, on 1 January 1978, has always been administered under the Broadcasting and Television Act 1948. The current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a commitment in July 1989 under the national multicultural Australia agenda that the SBS would be covered by its own Act, and this is what this proposal does. The Bill gives the SBS greater freedom to manage its own affairs. It provides a new charter for the SBS, making it a statutory authority with similar powers and operational structure to the ABC but, unlike the ABC Act, it allows limited sponsorship and advertising, which I will come to directly. As I said, the SBS was established as an independent statutory authority by a coalition government back in January 1978 under the then Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1978 in response to a need by Australia's ethnic communities for a more comprehensive broadcasting service and to provide services not otherwise available through the national, commercial or public broadcasting sectors. The Act empowered the SBS to fund its operations by the broadcasting of sponsored programs, by charging for the provision of services and facilities and by the sale of programs and rights or interests in programs in addition to moneys appropriated annually from the Parliament. It was not, however, to derive revenue by means of normal commercial advertising, and therein lies a major change in this proposal. As I have indicated, the coalition will support the legislation but we do have some amendments which I will come to directly. As I have said, the Bill establishes the SBS as a separate statutory authority. It defines the charter of the SBS to reflect its primary role as Australia's multicultural broadcaster, and sets out its structures, powers and responsibility. It allows the SBS to borrow money from the Commonwealth or other sources with ministerial approval and confers powers to enter into hedging contracts and to invest surplus funds subject to the Treasurer's approval. It enables the SBS to generate offBudget revenue through permitted business activities and gives the SBS the opportunity to increase revenues through advertising and sponsorship. The board is required to develop and publish guidelines on advertising and sponsorship announcements. The Bill increases the size of the SBS board from seven to nine. It states in the Bill that at least one of those new board members ought to have an appropriate understanding of the interests of employees. Only the managing director will be a full time member. I would have thought that all board members ought to have an appropriate understanding of the interests of its employees. Whilst I can understand the rationale, from the Government's point of view, of wanting to so nominate such a director, I think that each and every member of the board should have the welfare of its employees as a pre-eminent concern. To dress up the Act, as has been done, so as to have a union representative formally on the board is unnecessary, in my view, but we will not be moving an amendment to delete it. The Bill contains provisions setting out the duties of the board of directors and the managing director and provides for their appointments, remuneration and leave arrangements. It empowers the SBS to engage staff in accordance with terms and conditions determined by the SBS, with the provision that they be developed in full consultation with the unions and that they adhere to the Government's policies on industrial relations matters. I might just say in passing that the problems that arm's length GBEs and government instrumentalities have in meeting all of the requirements of the Federal Department of Industrial Relations have been exhibited more recently in regard to Telecom, where I understand there have been great difficulties in determining arrangements for employment and, of course, redundancy. We have to be careful, when saying to these bodies that they should act in a commercial way, that we do not restrain them with the limitations imposed by the Department of Industrial Relations. I think there is ample evidence of that. Certainbuilding ly, having talked to some of the GBE managers, I can say that they are frustrated quite often with the role that the Department plays vis-a-vis the charge to manage effectively and commercially that which they are supposed to proceed with. The Bill also requires the Board to develop and publicise the SBS's programming policies and its policies on handling complaints. The Board is to describe the consultative mechanisms for gauging community needs and opinions in the corporate plan and, in the first instance, to establish an interim community advisory committee, which I will come to later. I might just add with regard to complaints that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) indicated in his second reading speech that the Government was looking in detail at what it was going to do with regard to public accountability arrangements for both the SBS and the ABC. He indicated that the Government would be making some decisions about how complaints might be handled and whether or not that would be an appropriate role for external body such as the office of the Omareas budsman-which I think would be a sensible and the most appropriate route for thorough investigation-and the Australian Broadcasto ting Tribunal. We wait with interest to what the Government will do with regard that matter. Certainly the Gulf crisis brought to a head the whole question of how we deal with public accountability with regard to the broadcasting media funded by the Government, those being the ABC and the SBS. The financial impact on the Commonwealth expenditure is neutral, although I did notice the other day that a motion came before the Parliament to refer to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works an application for $3Sm to purchase and refurbish a new headquarters for the SBS. It is currently in leased premises. That $3Sm is equal to SO per cent of the total Budget allocation for the SBS. Whilst I recognise that that move is necessary, I hope that it is being done on the basis that there will be greater economies in the longer term. Indeed, as I recall, there was some excess capacity in that which would probably generate some revenue for the SBS as well. Broadly, the Opposition has been very happy and satisfied with how the SBS has been run. I can truthfully say that in the short time that I have held the position of shadow Minister for communications, I have been very impressed with the way that it has conducted its programming and, more particularly, its commercial operations. It is very conscious of its budget limitations and it is always striving to deliver programming that is relevant to its target audience. I think that those who enjoy the SBS applaud what they are able to see. One will always have difficulties at the margin-and do we not have them in every sphere-but certainly SBS is doing a very good job and it needs to be congratulated in that regard. Indeed, we have great hopes for SBS in the future. Whether it remains in government ownership, of course, remains to be seen in the longer term. In any event, as it becomes more commercial, it is certainly exhibiting its capacity to do so. I might say that not all Australians enjoy an SBS. That is a real sadness. Some regional have been denied the facility to watch SBS. As I sit in my own electorate and know that the SBS signal flies past and goes down Hobart, I often wonder why it is that the see people of northern Tasmania-Tasmania to being the most decentralised State in the Commonwealth-are denied the services of SBS. I hope that one day that will be corrected. I certainly think that the timetable that has been announced for the provision of SBS services to regional areas needs to be considered regularly, and we need to keep the pressure on for the delivery of SBS. I know that in my own area there is a great sadness that we do not receive SBS, because we believe that the additional choice ought to be available to us, and, for a very modest outlay, SBS could have been made available to the whole northern area of Tasmania. But that is all tied up with the conversion from VHF to UHF and a whole range of other technical matters that it is not appropriate to raise here. Coming back to the matter of the SBS's budget, in 1991 SBS had a total of $66.41m available from government, projected revenue of $3.7m and cash on hand at the year's start of $2.097m. Expenditure by functional areas was estimated at $ 12.24m for radio and $28m for television prqgramming, plus $18.72m for infrastructure and publicity and $6.755m for the corporate area. In a 1988 policy discussion paper, the Department of Transport and Communications estimated that $70m would be necessary if SBS television was to incorporate local content in accordance with ABT requirements. The SBS has translated this to mean that $90m would now be needed to make a 'proper effort in innovative, high quality, locally produced material'. We now come to the crux of this issue, that is, sponsorship and advertising. Sponsorship has yielded modest results-$0.85m in 199091-and experience elsewhere in the world shows that it will never cover the cost of local production. Apart from news, current affairs and sport, SBS television currently has only some $4m to commit to Australian production initiatives. SBS estimates that advertising could yield $5m per annum in the early years, thus adding nearly 20 per cent to its television budget. Honourable members will recall that that is the largest part of its budget. Newspaper reports in June 1991 refer to papers before Cabinet suggesting that, based on a 2.5 per cent rating estimate-the current figureand a total television advertising pool of $1.36 billion, some $3Om could eventually be raised through advertising. This is disputed by advertising and media consultants Mitchell and Partners, who believe that SBS could expect between $lOm and $15m advertising revenue a year. Media consultant George Patterson Pty Ltd calculates a potential revenue of $26m, based on an average rating point during one survey period of 1.3-that is, 11.2 for the three commercial channelsand advertising costs of $402 per second. This assumes that every spot is sold arrd that the network is fully booked every week-a somewhat unrealistic assumption. So the advertising revenue that is being sought and will be permitted under this Bill is a significant change, and those revenue projections need to be kept in mind, because I do not believe that the revenue from advertising will be as great as some believe it will be. Referring again to the charter, we have indicated, by our support for the Bill, that we do support the charter. But, clearly, I want to indicate that, in agreeing with the charter, we do not envisage a guarantee of continuing rapid increases, or indeed any increases, in funding for the SBS. I think it has to be accepted that public broadcasting has done reasonably well over recent years and that, with the economic constraints that confront all governments of whatever complexion, the rapid increase in funding is something of the past, certainly in the foreseeable future with the economic climate the way it is. In terms of our current policy, we have a proud record of supporting the SBS. Indeed, at the time when it was mooted that the SBS be merged into the ABC it was this side of the House that said, 'No, it should continue to be a distinct entity'. Mr Ruddock-Who wanted to get rid of SBS?",55
85,Mr SMITH,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I think it was the other side of the House. I am sure that the honourable member for Dundas will get the opportunity to tell honourable members opposite in chapter and verse what a folly that was. In any event, we have always taken the view that SBS has established a sound reputation as a lean and efficient organisation providing a highly regarded service to viewers and listeners extending well beyond the initial client liudience of the ethnic communities. It has justifiable pride in cost efficient performance and values its independence. It has, in the process, made an important contribution to the enrichment of Australian culture. The coalition parties will maintain it as a separate entity and support its continued development and access, within the confines of economic restraints. Its principal function, of course, is to provide multilingual and multicultural radio and television services which inform, educate and entertain all Australians and, in so doing, reflect Australia's multicultural society. The charter, as such, is not contrary to anything that we state in our ethnic affairs policy. I come to the matter of advertising and sponsorship. The relevant part is clause 45, subclause (2) of which stipulates that advertisements or sponsorship announcements may be broadcast only between programs or during natural program breaks and restricts them to a maximum of five minutes in any 60 minutes of broadcasting. The commercial equivalent is 12 to 13 minutes under a self-regulation regime. There is no definition of natural program breaks, but the SBS provides an example of such as being the half-time in a soccer match. So in effect what will happen is that advertising will top and tail programs, but it will be broader advertising than under the existing guidelines, which were ministerial guidelines, which provide a limitation on what can be shown by way of advertisement. I indicated in my earlier press releases, and I do so again by way of the amendments circulated, that I believe that the guidelines that are to be developed by the board under subclause 45(4) ought to be subject to the Acts Interpretation Act so that they become a disallowable instrument. It would be appropriate, given the concern and the major change that is taking place in permitting advertising, that there be some ongoing parliamentary scrutiny. I do not envisage that that would be intrusive in any way but I believe that it would be appropriate for that to take place. There are many arguments about whether or not there should be advertising and the extent of advertising. Some have put forward views that it ought to be limited to sponsorship or a form of underwriting. But in any event the two major parties have now decided that we will proceed down this path and advertising in the generally accepted form or meaning of the term is to be appropriate for the Bill. I indicate that there was some concern that the interpretation of the second reading speech led to the view that the advertising would not be required to adhere to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's standards and industry codes and rules. I am grateful to the SBS for providing me with a letter today clarifying that matter. It clearly is to be the case that it will be treated just like any commercial advertiser. I am sure that that gives some relief to the other commercial advertisers, but also it makes it quite clear that the advertising that we talk about is the normal commercial advertising that will appear on the SBS. I will move that amendment at the committee stage. I come back to some of the issues regarding advertising because they are particularly significant. The SBS has argued for advertising to help to fill the gap between the funding it gets and what it wants to do. What it wants to do is to offer a double benefit to the SBS and Australia as a whole-accessible and relevant programming that will lead to greater audiences. The SBS claims that it will give a major boost to the creative and cultural well-being of this country and that every dollar that SBS puts towards Australian production has a potential to draw another $3. Admirable though that be, that remains to be seen. I have the view that the revenue that it intends to generate will not be as high as it thinks. But, if one of the consequences of going down this path is to provide greater Australian production, that certainly would be welcomed by me and the Party that I represent. The SBS claims that it is 'a long way towards achieving our multicultural objective of a service to all Australians'. I have made a comment about that already. I point out that there are some concerns that, with the SBS pursuing advertising, we will see fewer programs covering the multilanguage groups and that we will see more English groups as it compromises on seeking advertising. That is a fear that has been expressed. It remains to be seen whether it will be fulfilled, but it is certainly something that the SBS has indicated that it is aware of and will be addressing in the programming and advertising arrangements that it puts forward. The SBS also maintains that limited advertising opens up much wider potential than sponsorship, which generally has limited runs, which operated under the ministerial guidelines. Apart from the limits on advertising imposed by the legislation, SBS also points to the limit imposed by its audience reach of 75 per cent of the population, which is further limited to 68 per cent of homes that receive a viewable picture from its UHF transmission. SBS states that it will not seek regional and local retail advertising. So it will be a national advertising target. r want to talk more about the advertising issue, but r think time will be against me. It is important to mention some of those issues on the contrary side-whether or not advertising will threaten the independence and integrity of SBS. Those matters were considered carefully by us, as was whether or not its quality would be compromised; whether or not the legislation lays the groundwork for further commercialisation-the SBS has been somewhat mediocre in how it has handled that; and whether, once advertising is accepted, the pressure will be on to raise greater and greater percentages of its budget that way. Those are all legitimate concerns and it remains to be seen whether those fears will be fulfilled. A further point was made that, having established the principle that the SBS will be able to advertise, what will happen with the ABC. We now have a contradictory policy in a sense. We are saying to the SBS that it can advertise in the full commercial sense but with a limitation of 5 minutes per hour; yet recent decisions with regard to the ABC went 100 per cent in the other direction. Of course, many take the view that we should be consistent with both. It will be interesting to see what will happen ultimately with the ABC and advertising. r have indicated already on behalf of the coalition that r believe that sponsorship in the form that we know it at present is appropriate for the ABC and ought to be continued. r refer to things such as the Esso Night at the Opera, the NEC marathon and so on. But we certainly have a contradictory policy at present with regard to how that might be implemented. One of the other points that were raised with me is that it will reduce the funding base of ethnic print media. Depending on what happens with cross-media ownership rules in this country in the longer term, perhaps the ethnic print media will be able to take a position at some future time in the broadcasting facility provided by the SBS. r do not believe that that will cause great concern for them in terms of their revenue. r raised the matter of the application of ABT standards and commercial codes to the SBS and the SBS has indicated to me today that it certainly would meet those codes. r welcome that. Of course, there are some other issues that r ought to raise with regard to the amendments that r have proposed. They relate primarily to the corporate plan. Under the proposals in the Bill, the corporate plan is not subject to any overall ministerial review other than in a very limited form. The only express power given to the Minister to vary the corporate plan relates to the community consultative arrangements. My amendments change that to give the Minister, under clause 49, a power to vary the corporate plan. There may be an argument that the Minister's very wide powers under clause 11 could be used to alter other parts of the corporate plan. Clause 11(1) states that the Minister may give to the board such written directions in relation to the performance of the SBS's functions as appear to the Minister to be necessary in the public interest. The corporate plan could easily be covered by this clause, but the Minister may only give the directions for prescribed matters or in prescribed circumstances. Prescribed matters may be prescribed only by regulation which means that they may be disallowed by Parliament. No regulations have been formulated yet and the Department envisages doing so only when, or if, the Minister requires it. The ABC does not have to submit its corporate plan to the Minister, although it does do so. There is no obligation under its Act. However, it is understood that the Minister wrote to the ABC earlier this year saying that he might like to alter the ABC's Act to include a corporate plan requirement. Clause 50 does appear to be a standard in corporate plans, but in my view Telecom Australia has similar requirements to clause 50, as does the Australian Postal Commission. Given that the Minister has already indicated to the ABC that he wants an ability to review its corporate plan, I will assist him by moving the amendments to the Bill, and I hope that the Government will support them. I envisage that a Minister, in reviewing a corporate plan, would be reviewing it in terms of its commercial content and not entering into any arrangements with regard to programming, which is truly a function of those in charge of managing an organisation, and their independence to do so needs to be assured. The other matter I want to raise before concluding my remarks is the Community Advisory Committee, which I understand is a somewhat contentious matter. I have had representations from the ethnic community wanting to have some longer term input into the programming arrangements. With all the furore that we saw over changes in the programming for radio, I think this matter has heightened their concern. In passing, I welcome a remark of the Minister, as reported in the Age today, that a second frequency for the SBS, at least in capital cities, will be considered. Whilst he cannot guarantee funding, he has indicated that he does now at least agree with us that this might be a solution to the problem of meeting the community's needs. Whilst I am unable to say yes, we support it-I have been asking for a long time for some costing details-in principle, it would seem to be a possibility. I also mention in passing that if it means that the broadcasting of Parliament is to be in any way compromised in trying to meet the needs of the new SBS signal that the Minister is proposing, I think the Parliament needs to be very cognisant of that issue, which relates to the power of transmitters, the fact that we are on half power now and that it was envisaged that we would get the additional vacant capacity. It would now seem that that might be going to SBS in Sydney and Melbourne, but I am sure that the Minister-and indeed, the Speaker-will give details of those proposals. I come back to the community advisory process. Under the Bill, an interim advisory committee is established for the purposes of assisting SBS in the formulation of its first corporate plan, and then it becomes disbanded. It is a matter of judgment, but I take the view that the involvement of the community in an active, ongoing way, with all the problems that generally brings from time to time, is a preferable route to take than establishing something and then saying, 'No, we don't want you any more'. I think a small advisory committee of people on the board to work in an ad hoc advisory role would give comfort to those who watch and listen to the SBS. I think it would be a positive thing to do. It would signal to the audience that they do have an input into the SBS and the running of it in a positive form other than having an input only to the board. In that sense, we will be moving the amendments. I am not sure what the Government's response will be with regard to that - I do not even know what the Australian Democrats' response will bebut in the circumstances it would seem to be a reasonable proposal. One of the other amendments that I will be moving deletes a clause which exempts the SBS from paying sales tax. I think the SBS is becoming more and more commercial. If it is given the ability to enter into advertising arrangements, I think we should take the necessary steps to impact upon its management. It is entering into a commercial environment and, therefore, I think the exemption from sales tax ought to be removed and there should, accordingly, be a proposed amendment. I again point out that we support the legislation. We accept the charter and the limitation on advertising that is proposed in the legislation-that is a very significant change. There is now a contradictory approach to the ABC and the SBS, which is a matter for the Government to determine or at least justify. The amendments that I will be moving relate primarily to setting up an advisory board which requires the advertising guidelines to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by making it a disallowable document and requiring or allowing a Minister to overview the corporate plan. The concept of the corporate plan is very important. In the recent annual report, the mention of the discussions with staff about the development of the corporate plan gives one a great deal of confidence in the ability of the SBS to develop that. So the intervention of the Minister, I would imagine, would be minimal, if not nil. Finally, if the SBS is going to be commercial, it ought to pay sales tax as do other GBEs. The other matter I mentioned during my remarks was that there is a special reference made to a board member who must have as a concern the interests of employees. I hope that all board members of all GBEs would not need that type of reference in an Act; that they would have as a pre-eminent concern not only the market they are serving but also the welfare and concern of their employees.",57
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,Mr Dubois)The Chair understands that the amendments will be formally moved in the committee stage.,61
87,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I have been waiting for the Special Broadcasting Service Bill for some time. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware that in the last decade there has been a lot of debate about the future of the SBS. Finally we have before uS a Bill which will put the SBS on a firm footing, in legislative form, in such a way that, on the one hand, it will be given additional responsibilities and powers and, on the other hand, it will secure the SBS for what I hope will be a permanent period in the development of Australia's multicultural society. Given the importance of this legislation, is interesting that we have heard the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), talking about some small and rather trivial concerns in relation the Bill rather than about the broadness of what is involved here and how important it all is to the development of multiculturalism. He did make a couple of comments which I think need to be corrected. The first correction concerns the question of the Government's intentions for the SBS. Let me make it clear that the Labor Party has always had a policy of support for the SBS. A Budget determination was made at one time to merge the SBS and the ABC. That was opposed by significant sections of the Labor Party. In the democratic processes, not only were there consultations taking place but also the ethnic communities were having a large say in the matter. In the end, after a long consultation process, and after a process of debate and discussion within the Labor Party, the Government reversed its decision. It is true to say that many of us were not persuaded by the original decision to merge the ABC and the SBS; therefore, it is incorrect to try to argue some kind of political point that the Labor Party was opposed to the SBS. It was not. There was a particular Government Budget decision under difficult budgetary circumstances. It was recognised that this was a mistaken decision and it was reversed. The Party always retained its general policy on the SBS. I want to make those particular points because it appears to me that both the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass, and the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), wish to try to make a large point of this matter. In respect of the general support for multiculturalism, there is no doubt about which party has been very strong in its support and which party has actively worked for the promotion of multiculturalism; whereas there is an enormous question mark over the Opposition. This is because over a period with different leaders of the Opposition there has it been a general attack on multiculturalism. It is true that at the moment the conservative parties, to some degree, are using the word 'multiculturalism' on occasions, but we could to not say that they would have an active agenda for the support of multiculturalism. Far from it. I will not go into the Leader of the Opposition's recent comments on immigration because that is for another occasion. I am alanned at the recent statements of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to immigration. They are part of a pattern that we have had with conservative leaders who have found it convenient at a particular time to attack either immigration or multiculturalism. It is unfortunate that the shadow Minister chose to try to make some political points on this matter and, indeed, that Liberal Party activists have gone around Australia trying to make political points in relation to the recent problems of the SBS which concern the radio rescheduling issue. I will have more to say about that matter later. I think it should be borne in mind that, when it comes to the actual delivery of the programs with respect to multiculturalism and the consistent support of programs with respect to multiculturalism, there is no doubt that the Australian Labor Party has been and continues to be the pre-eminent Party. Having said that, I think that we should also congratulate the Minister for bringing in this legislation and for the way in which the charter has been put together so that there is an emphasis on the aspects of the duties of the SBS. I refer particularly to clause 2 of the charter, which reads as follows: (2) The SBS, in performing its principal function, must: (a) contribute to meeting the communications needs of Australia's multicultural society, including ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; and (b) increase awareness of the contribution of a diversity of cultures to the continuing development of Australian society; and that is very important(c) promote understanding and acceptance of the cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity of the ralian people; and (d) contribute to the retention and continuing development of language and other cultural skills; There are several other important clauses with respect to the goals of the SBS. Point (e) is also worth referring to. It reads: (e) as far as practicable, inform, educate and entertain Australians in their preferred languages; These are important goals because, essentially, the support for a multicultural society is being translated into the charter of the SBS in a fundamental way. We are not a monolingual society. We are a society which has English as its major language, but we also support, through our national language policy and other major multicultural policies, the learning of other languages, retention of languages by people who are bringing their language skills here in Australia and the idea of communication in various and diverse language forms. We also support people coming to an understanding of what multiculturalism is about. There is no doubt that the Special Broadcasting Service has had a key role to play in the success which we have had to this point and will have a key role to play in the future. That key role involves the understanding that in Australia an individual can actually choose to participate in a diverse number of cultural forms. An individual can do that through the excellent entertainment, the excellent information and the excellent current affairs and news services provided, for example, by the SBS. He can also, if he has some development in a second language, listen to the radio programs on SBS radio, be informed in that particular language and also learn more about that particular language, if so inclined. These are all extremely positive developments, not only for those Australians who are of ethnic or migrant background but for all Australians, because there is no doubt that we are increasingly an international world and that it is necessary for us, if we are to play our role in the world, to maximise our understanding of the cultures and traditions of the world and also to maximise our skills in relation to dealing with those cultures and Austtraditions. That involves the actual practice which the SBS has been involved in. I think the SBS has been a great success. There have been teething problems from time to time. Notwithstanding those problems, in overall terms we have actually been able to get the service going. It is increasingly supported by more and more Australians. I know that sometimes the notorious rating figures say that not too many Australians watch SBS. It really amazes me when I hear that argument put because, of course, the rating system used is clearly such that it is not intended for a system such as the SBS. The percentage of people that might be watching or listening to SBS at a particular time may be relatively small, but the point is that it changes as the language group changes or as the program changes. If one adds the cumulative effect of all the people who watch or listen to the SBS, it is much more dramatic than the figures would indicate. I believe that the majority of Australians support SBS and the kind of job which it has been doing in tem1S of not only promoting multiculturalism but also, to use the slogan of SBS, 'bringing the world back to Australia'. I think that SBS, especially in its news and current affairs services, has played a very important role in making ordinary Australians familiar with not merely events overseas but with some of the complex issues involved in events overseas, including controversial events such as the recent events in the Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia, Croatia and Slovenia. I also compliment the Government for this Bill because, of course, it will in a sense permanency and security to the SBS. I say to those people who still have some fanciful idea that there should be an amalgamation of the ABC and the SBS-if there are any left around the place-that we have had that debate and we have had that experience. Let us forget that one and let us proceed to the real issue, which is to ensure that both the SBS and the ABC perform their functions within the Australian community. The ABC plays an important role. Nevertheless, its role is not and has not been in relation to the promotion of Australia's multicultural society, notwithstanding the fact that it has a clause in its charter along those lines. I have spoken in this House before about the failure of the ABC to meet the obligations under that particular charter. But that is another matter. Obviously, if the Australian multicultural society is to be truly represented, there must be a distinctive service of the kind provided by the SBS. When talking about the SBS, we nearly always talk about SBS television, which is very important. It has, in fact, played a wonderful role in our society and its news services and current affairs services have played a specific role in illuminating us not only about international events but also about events in Australia to do with various ethnic communities, events which, unfortunately, are generally not recorded or are certainly not recorded sufficiently by other television stations. SBS radio, however, has played an important role, especially for our older communities, because it has been able to communicate in the various languages with the diversity of Australians. The language programs on SBS radio are some of the most popular programs on radio; a very high proportion of particular ethnic communities listen to those particular programs. A very high proportion of the Vietnamese community listens to the Vietnamese program, the Turkish community to the Turkish program, the Greek community to the Greek program, and so on. All of those communities, including smaller communities such as the Lithuanian community, are very much ingive formed not only about events in their former homelands and events, situations and actions with respect to the ethnic community in which they participate, but also about the broader Australian politics and society in a way in which they could not be informed through the ordinary media, because their linguistic skills are insufficient in the English language. So it is a very important task that is performed. It was, therefore, regrettable in this context that we had the problem arising with the rescheduling of the SBS radio programs. In a sense, the problem was inevitable. More and more ethnic groups were coming to Australia. The original numbers of some of them were small but have grown substantially. Those groups were making claims for more air time on SBS radio. Other groups had integrated into Australian society in such a way that many of them had forgotten all or some of the language which was being spoken. So there was prima facie an argument that, in fact, a rescheduling should take place. The shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) spoke about the community consultation process which, unfortunately, was inadequate in this case and, as a result of that, it was necessary to go back to the decision which was made by the management and the board, especially with respect to the 21 language groups. To the credit of Mr Johns and the management of the SBS, once they had recognised that there was community concern and opposition to aspects of the decision and the way in which it had been made, they agreed to reopen the process of consultation and to amend the decision. I commend the Minister for Transport Communications (Mr Beazley) for his role in the negotiations and discussio- in this because the final result is that, although obviously we cannot within the. one radio station satisfy the concerns of all groups-and some groups are still disaffected-at least all groups, now having been reinstated, will getting air time and, naturally, those groups whose time has been reduced will be able look forward to the second station, which is the sensible solution to the problem. medium and longer term solution to the problem, but it has now become more critical in the light of events in recent times. In conclusion, I support the Minister's statement that the matter of a second frequency, a second station, will go before the Government very soon. I support the setting up of that second frequency and look forward to further development of the SBS radio on these issues. I welcome this Bill. I think it is important for the ethnic communities and for multicultural Australia. (TIme expired)",61
88,Mr RUDDOCK,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I bring to them. hope the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) will stay around for this debate, because I want to take up some of the eight remarks that he made during his contribution. He breached, I think, one of the fundamental rules for survival in government. It has of always seemed to me that if one is magethnic, nanimous in the way in which the Opposition, that is an indication of the strength of one's position in government, and the more ungracious one's comments position of strength about one's opponents, the more that demonstrates how much more insecure in office one is. In his comments, of course, the honourable member did not draw in any positive way to the attention of the Parliament the role of the Fraser Government, which, through the Galbally report, brought SBS television into being. He certainly did not deal with the support that the Government is receiving in relation to a matter that is not without some controversy, and that is a Bill dealing with sponsorship and advertising on SBS, in respect of which, if one were so inclined to take the cheap shot, it would be so easy to do and so. It is disappointing to me, as one who speaks in relation to our multicultural society matter, on behalf of the Opposition, that the honourable member, whose interest is well known, should see fit to make some rather shabby comments in relation to the Opposition's positions in these matters. From his be own experience and background, he knows that his observations certainly were not wellto founded observations. If he wants to take up those issues, I will certainly meet him in this It is the forum on each and every occasion. The Special Broadcasting Service Bill is to establish SBS as a corporation and to give it a charter delineating and governing its functions. The charter establishes the primary role of SBS as Australia's multicultural broadcaster and its primary objective is providing multilingual and multicultural broadcasting services. This is no small task, as it charges SBS with the responsibility of very meeting the communication needs of Australia's multicultural society and of educating all Australian people on the contribution which the diversity of cultures and languages can It is important to actually look at the charter. Clause 6 (2) of the Bill sets out in points, (a) to (h), what those functions are. It reads that the SBS must: (a) contribute to meeting the communications needs Australia's multicultural society, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander one deals with communities; and (b) increase awareness of the contribution of a diversity of cultures to the continuing development from the of Australian society; and (c) promote understanding and acceptance of the cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity of the raHan people; and (d) contribute to the retention and continuing development of language and other cultural skills; and (e) as far as practicable, inform, educate and entertain Australians in their preferred languages; and (f) make use of Australia's diverse creative resources; and (g) contribute to the overall diversity of Australian television and radio services, particularly taking into account the contribution of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the public broadcasting sector. . . (h) contribute to extending the range of Australian television and radio services, and reflect the changing nature of Australian society, by presenting many points of view and using innovative forms of expression. Interestingly, while reference is made to multilingual and multicultural radio and television services, and to contributing to meeting the needs of a multicultural society, the term 'multiculturalism' or 'multicultural' is not defined in this legislation. Where do we find that definition? The definition as set by the Government was in the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia, a well-known document which has received bipartisan support. The honourable member for Calwell raises the question of where our responsibility for multiculturalism lies. It lies in that definition. On that definition there is unanimity of view-not one discussed and agreed to by the Opposition, but a coincidence of view, as I have said from time to time, because the Government does not discuss these questions with the Opposition; it hands down the statements from on high. In relation to this issue, what do we have? We have some very positive comments in relation to this Bill but we also have some amendments proposed by the Opposition. Some of them relate to giving this Parliament a role in considering the program of guidelines for advertising and also for sponsorship, providing for community consultation in a more effective way-that is a matter the honourable member for Calwell raised-but also providing the Minister with greater authority to direct variation of the corporate Aust- plan. We propose an amendment which states: When the Board prepares or revises a corporate plan and gives a copy of the plan to the Minister, the Minister may, within 60 days after receiving the copy of the plan and after consultation with the Board, direct the Board to vary the plan. It is a much stronger provision than is contained in the legislation that we have before us. I must say that if I were the Minister and a body brought forward a corporate plan which ignored half of the Government's policy in relation to the definition of multicultural society, I would be giving some directions. The fact is that SBS has been somewhat like some members of the Government at times who come forward after we have put down this definition of what we mean by multicultural and say, 'Really, all you have to accept are the three dimensions, but let us ignore the other part of the definition which sets out the limitations of what is meant by ""multicultural'''. I have been chastising the Government for this of late and I was very grateful to hear you, Mr Deputy Speaker, deliver a message on behalf of the Prime Minister e Mr Hawke) last weekend in which emphasis was put on the limits to multiculturalism, limits that are expressed when people want to make sure there is an understanding that all Australians, regardless of their background, regardless of where they are from, regardless of their commitment to their former homeland and genuine interest of the affairs of that homeland, and their entitlement to express those views in Australia, still have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, its interests and its future, first arid foremost. It is interesting that on page 4 of the corporate plan SBS has decided to leave out the three limitations upon which bipartisanship is premised. I would hope that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs e Mr Hand), is quick to ensure that the Government's policy as set down in its own definition is observed by its statutory broadcaster. I would hope that when the Parliament amends this legislation to give the Minister that \ability, SBS will take it on board. The honourable member for Calwell comes in here and raises the question of our commitment. Our commitment is predicated on the basis of the acceptance of the whole definition. It always has been, and the honourable member keeps on coming into this House to extend the boundaries in a way which suggests that migrants have no commitment to Australia. That is what he is saying. He is saying that part of the definition can be ignored or should be ignored. That is the substantive point that needs to be known and understood.",64
89,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I agenda rise on a point of order. I have just been grossly misrepresented and I want that corthe rected.",66
90,Mr RUDDOCK,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"He can do it at the freedom appropriate time, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is a point of order.",66
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE, seems There is no point of order.,66
92,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, when can I correct that gross misrepresentation?",66
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,At the end of the speech.,66
94,Mr RUDDOCK,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"The points are very on a clear, as found in the national agenda, they read as follows: multicultural policies are based upon the premise that all Australians should have an overriding unifying commitment to Australia, to its interests and future first and foremost; multicultural policies require all Australians accept the basic structures and principles lian society-the Constitution and the rule of tolerance and equality, Parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and religion, English as national language and equality of the sexes; and multicultural policies impose obligations as conferring rights: the right to express one's own culture and beliefs involves a reciprocal sibility to accept the right of others to express views and values. Nobody demurs from those points when they are made, but they should not be overlooked, they should not be diminished, and no suggesthis tion should be made that they can be to diminished. Yet, when I go to the 10 key objectives in the corporate plan for 1990-93, I find that, based upon half of the definition, these points are made: The SBS exists to provide informative, entertaining and innovative television and radio programs to the Australian community which will: 1. Playa dynamic role in reflecting, re-shaping and modernising Australia's image of itself, including improving the understanding of the evolving institutional structures and traditions within Australia; I just ask this question: what does SBS have in mind in terms of the evolving institutional structures when the limits of multiculturalism as defined by this Government in its national are clear? Is it talking about changing the Constitution? Is it talking about changing rule of law? Is it talking about changing issues related to parliamentary democracy, of speech, religion, or English as the not national language? Is that what it is suggesting? I do not believe it is, from the discussions I have had with SBS over time. But it to me that it needs to have a clear understanding also of what the Government has put down as the national agenda for a multicultural Australia and what the Government means by it. It should not be involved in extending the boundaries. The reason why Ministers ought to be able to give instructions is that if statutory authorities decide to go off frolic of their own, that capacity to offer and some guidance needs to be there. The honourable member for Calwell talked and about SBS radio and the radio rescheduling issue. Again, he was less than magnanimous in his comments. Only a week ago he was to chiding me for not wanting, in any motion I of Austrapropose as a private member in general law, business on Thursdays, to congratulate the Government. The fact is that the Opposition the has been providing helpful and constructive advice on this issue of SBS radio scheduling, as well and our policy has provided the very basis responupon which this Government may well be their able to get itself off the hook that has been created for it. The Opposition made it very clear right from the onset of this issue-as early as May year-that there ought to be an extension the consultative period and that there ought to be a constructive examination of the prospects and costs of a second frequency for ethnic radio on FM for both Sydney and Melbourne. This was because our policy document made it very clear that there ought to be further frequency provision for SBS. When large meetings were organised and the honourable member for Calwell became aware that this was an issue",66
95,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,Ohl,67
96,Mr RUDDOCK,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I did not hear from the honourable member before these issues were raised or before the meetings commenced in Melbourne and Sydney in which he took a public profile. These matters might well have been able to be dealt with at a formative stage largely before they became a controversial issue in which the honourable member was able to play his usual St George role. The Opposition made it very clear that the Minister should receive a delegation from the ethnic communities to hear first hand. We requested SBS to review the proposed schedule to accommodate some of the constructive suggestions that had been put forward at public meetings. We put this view forward strongly, recognising that SBS radio has a strong and supportive constituency, that the proposal for a second frequency must be accelerated and that full costing on the technical aspects of its adoption be made available to the Opposition and the community. We emphasised that the Government should give a recommitment to equity and access policy aimed at supporting the maintenance of ethnic culture and language and not permitting the rescheduling proposal to be a positive discrimination against some small language groups. We noted very strongly that there was a requirement for full consultation. We will be able to test the extent to which Government members believe in community consultation by whether or not they support our amendment to establish a community advisory committee. We will be able to see where the honourable member for Calwell stands when that amendment is moved and whether he is serious about consultation or whether he has been posturing again in this debate. The resolution makes it clear that the board must establish a committee, to be known as the Community Advisory Committee. The function of that committee is to advise the board on the community consultative measures to be included in each corporate plan. Each member of the Community Advisory Committee is to be appointed by the board, and the board is to appoint a person to the Community Advisory Committee if it is satisfied that the person has an understanding of Australia's multicultural society and particular interests relevant to and an understanding of ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. So there is a benchmark upon which the honourable member can be judged. I make these comments today because the honourable member wants to put in doubt the commitment of the Opposition to the maintenance of the Special Broadcasting Service and its multicultural role. In June 1975, under the control of the Attorney-General's Department, 2EA and 3EA commenced broadcasting and were later transferred to the Department of the Media. The seven languages that were used at that time were increased to 35 by the beginning of 1978 under a Liberal Government. Following the Galbally report, SBS television was established-under a Liberal Government. I could go on and give chapter and verse as to the way in which under a Liberal Government these services were expanded. The only time the issue of a merger of SBS and the ABC has been raised has been under a Labor Government, by the colleagues of the honourable member for Calwell. The people who put in doubt the commitment to a multicultural Australia of an emerging SBS were those honourable members opposite. I would not have to remind the honourable member for Calwell about these matters if he were prepared to be a little more magnanimous in the approach that he would take to these matters in the Parliament from time to time. (Time expired)",67
97,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented in the comments made by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and I wish to make a personal explanation.",67
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,Mr Dubois)Please proceed.,67
99,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,I do not want to take up the time of the House,67
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Just explain how you were misrepresented and not engage in debate, then.",68
101,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I was misrepresented on three occasions. On the first occasion the honourable member for Dundas stated that I had misrepresented him in relation to his position on multiculturalism. That is not true. I stated quite clearly that I was referring to the current and previous Leaders of the Opposition in relation to immigration and multicultural policy, not to the position of the honourable member for Dundas. Secondly, the honourable member claimed that I had said that the Opposition had been involved in some skulduggery with respect to the SBS rescheduling exercise. I specifically did not refer to the Opposition as such but to the Liberal Party and Liberal Party members. I did not refer to the communications spokesman or to him. I would prefer to discuss the third point in which the honourable member misrepresented me privately with him. I conclude by saying that I did not intend this to become a political debate. It was begun by the statements of the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), and his very ungenerous comments with respect to the role of the Labor Party and the role of the SBS.",68
102,Mr RUDDOCK,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been grievously misrepresented in relation to this matter. I will make one brief point, if I may, with your indulgence.",68
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,The honourable member may proceed.,68
104,Mr RUDDOCK,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) cannot separate me from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in relation to these questions. I am the Opposition spokesman. What I say is Opposition policy and it represents the view of the Leader and myself.,68
105,Mr ONEIL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I had intended speaking on the Special Broadcasting Service Bill very briefly because I am a great supporter of SBS and the services that it provides. I will come to that in my speech shortly. I am tremendously disappointed by the attack on the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). It would be quite remiss of me not to say something about the honourable member for Calwell. Nobody in this place has a more compassionate and caring attitude for people from overseas than the honourable member for Calwell, who himself comes from overseas. As the Chairman of the Government's immigration and ethnic affairs committee, he does an absolutely sterling job. I cannot sit in this place and hear the outrageous attacks made by the doubtful honourable member for Dundas; I understand that his seat will be abolished and he might be the honourable member for North Sydney next time. I think it is quite outrageous that attacks can be made on my honoured colleague. I have no brief for him, but I must say that he is absolutely superb in his representation of people from overseas. I think it is very important that I put those comments on the public record because I do admire him deeply for the work that he does in trying to assist migrants and disadvantaged people, particularly those from the less fortunate communities. I represent an area with 65 different nationalities, and he has spoken to those people first hand. I know how dedicated he is to improving the lot of people from overseas. However, I want to talk about the Bill. We seem to have gone away from this Bill and the reason for it. This Bill provides SBS with a new charter and the full range of corporate powers appropriate to an independent public authority. The decision to develop the Bill was announced in the Government's national agenda for a multicultural Australia launched in July 1989. The agenda defines the Commonwealth Government's multicultural policies and the goals that underline them. The national agenda for a multicultural Australia emphasises that the nation's cultural institutions, including the media, have a critical role to play in both mirroring and shaping Australians' image of themselves. Our institution needs to be responsive to Australia's diverse community in which four out of 10 Australians are immigrants or the children of immigrants, half of them from non-English speaking backgrounds. The Government regards the SBS as both a special service for Australians of non-English speaking background and as a genuinely multicultural broadcaster for the benefit of all Australians, regardless of their background. The establishment of separate legislation for the SBS will secure the future of the SBS and will guarantee the multilingual and multicultural character of the broadcaster. I say that simply because for a long time in my electorate people have been crying out to get multicultural television-SBS. They really like it, and I agree with them. I believe that SBS runs the best news service in Australia. It is sad indeed that all Australians do not have the opportunity to see the SBS news service which, as I said, is absolutely excellent. It is sad that the programs that are shown in the cities by SBS are denied to country viewers. I will be extremely delighted when, in 1992-93, SBS will become available in the Spencer Gulf region of my electorate. It will be a great day indeed and I certainly hope that either the Minister for Transport and Communications e Mr Beazley) or the honourable member for Calwell will have the opportunity to visit my electorate for the inaugural launch of that SBS service. As I said earlier, the honourable member for Calwell is held in extremely high esteem by all nationalities represented in my electorate. This legislation defines the charter of the SBS and sets out its structure, powers and responsibilities. It removes from the Broadcasting Act the provisions relating to the establishment and management of the SBS. The principal effect of the legislation will be to establish the SBS as a statutory authority with similar powers and operational structures to the ABC, taking into account the statutory authority and government business enterprise reforms where appropriate. The tremendous thing about this is that not only will the SBS services continue to be as good as they have been in the past, but also they will be able to be built upon. When SBS is available in my electorate, the standard will be lifted quite significantly. All of the national sporting and cultural events that people long to see from their own countries will be available on SBS-for instance, the World Soccer. Many people in my electorate love to see the soccer. Denying them the opportunity to watch World Soccer is akin to a tragedy in the family. The opportunity for them to view programs of that type will be a tremendous improvement. I am sure that this legislation will allow the SBS people to raise money to obtain better programs and better programming, and that can only be a plus for the SBS services. The new legislation provides the Government, the SBS and the public with a clear statement of the SBS's intended role. It also establishes management advisory accountability and staffing structures appropriate to the functions of the new corporation. I believe this is very important indeed because people want to know where the SBS is going and where multiculturalism is heading in this country. It is indeed appropriate that people from overseas who have made significant contributions to our country still have the opportunity to keep in contact with their own families and the programs of a high standard produced in their former countries. It is also a tremendous opportunity for Australians who have not been overseas to experience the culture and lifestyle of people from other countries as they carry out their day-today dealings. It is a wonderful educational opportunity that will be provided by an expanded SBS. I believe that this is a tremendous piece of legislation. It is very positive, effective and constructive legislation. I certainly am quite disappointed that the honourable member for Dundas has seen fit to pick so many holes in this legislation. I am one who believes that immigration, multiculturalism and ethnic affairs should be something that we should deal with in a bipattisan manner. I would never get into an argument with anybody about the colour of his skin,.his origin or where he came from. It is quite disappointing indeed that this sort of thing creeps into the chamber. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. That is very unreasonable and Ii would hope that the honourable member would retract that, given my position on issues of race. I regard it as being grossly offensive to suggest that in this debate the issue of race has been raised in the comments I have made, and I ask for an immediate retraction. The comments are offensive to me and the remarks ought to be withdrawn immediately.",68
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Mr Dubois)Order! The Chair did not understand that those remarks were attributed to any member, least of all the honourable member for Dundas. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, the remarks were made in a contribution to a debate in which I am the only person who has participated.",70
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,No. The Chair understands that the comments were made generally and did not relate to any member at all. There is no point of order.,70
108,Mr ONEIL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept your ruling. If the honourable member for Dundas is so sensitive of the fact that I called him a racist, there is something ludicrously wrong with him because that is not in my make up. If the honourable member thought that Mr Ruddock-I do not know what you are doing now.",70
109,Mr ONEIL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,The honourable member is the only one in this chamber who takes that interpretation on board. Nobody else does. I am sure that none of his colleagues in the House would either. Mr Ruddock-That is a specious comment and totally uncalled for.,70
110,Mr ONEIL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"If the honourable member is going to take that on board, I am sorry for him. Mr Ruddock-I insist, and I must say that the Hansard record now discloses, that the honourable member has called me a racist. That is grossly offensive. It is something that should not happen in this chamber and it is something that should be withdrawn immediately. I am the only one who has put my career on the line to cross the floor in relation to matters of that sort and I will not have it said and I will not have my integrity impugned in that way.",70
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"The Chair did not hear the honourable member for Grey call, accuse or refer to any other member as a racist. The Chair can stand reminded if that did happen, but the Chair did not hear the member for Grey accuse the member for Dundas of being a racist. Mr Ruddock-The record can be checked.",70
112,Mr ONEIL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Because we are getting near time, can I say that there is no way that I would have been calling the member for Dundas a racist.",70
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,The Chair accepts that. Mr Ruddock-I accept that too. It was a misstatement.,70
114,Mr ONEIL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"If the honourable member for Dundas believes that there was some interpretation by me that he is a racist, I would most certainly apologise, but I do not need to apologise because I did not put that interpretation on what I was saying. As a matter of fact, I am quite upset by the fact that the honourable member for Dundas would think that I would call him a racist, because that is not at all in my make up. I understand his Christian beliefs. There is no way that I would put any interpretation on the fact that he is a racist.",70
115,Unknown,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,70
116,Mr LEE,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Tonight I wish to speak in support of the legislation which is currently before the House, the Special Broadcasting Service Bill 1991.",70
117,Mr GRIFFITHS,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,Will you confine yourself to the legislation?,70
118,Mr LEE,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I will confine myself to the legislation, as requested by the Minister for Resources. I will not be discussing abattoirs, the meat industry or anything of that nature. This legislation will provide for specialist legislation to give SBS a charter which will express and guarantee the multilingual and multicultural character of the Special Broadcasting Service. It is something which I am sure would have the support of many honourable members, including the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Later in my speech I will say something about some of the programs run by SBS, which I find highly commendable. They are programs which I believe attract the support of my constituents for the continuation Special Broadcasting Service. The primary role of the legislation we are debating is to ensure that the charter for the Special Broadfunding casting Service is codified and removes from the Broadcasting Act the clauses which provide for the special nature of SBS. Mr Acting Speaker, as you would be aware SBS has a charter to provide radio as well as television services. There has been some debate in your own State and others that extra funding should be used by SBS to ensure that a larger number of Australians do have access to the radio and television services which it provides. It is common knowledge, of course, that many Australians have great difficulty in picking up SBS television in particular. I that SBS is able to devote resources to that years to come to ensure that more Australians are able to receive some of the excellent programs which it broadcasts. The area in this legislation which I wish address in the short time that I speak tonight is, in particular, the Government's proposal allow SBS to increase its revenues through advertising and sponsorship. It is no secret that the television networks would have much preferred the Government not to have allowed SBS to attract sponsorship and advertising revenue. That is because in the advertising market, if an advertiser is able to buy time place advertisements on SBS, that is revenue which probably will not be going to other parts of the media. However, I suppose the special attraction for advertisers is that by advertising on SBS they are able to reach a relatively small audience-an audience which might be unique in its ethnic character. For example, one can imagine that if OTC wanted to promote cheap discounts on telephone services to Italy, it might seek to sponsor a program or have an advertisement run on one of the Italian programs on SBS. So while the audience might be relatively small compared with some of the other areas of the media, it could still be quite profitable for advertisers to secure advertisements at the right price on SBS radio and television. It is also important that we recognise that any revenues which SBS is able to attract through sponsorship or advertising will be in of the addition to the revenue which SBS now receives. The Government has given SBS a guarantee that for the next three years its will be guaranteed and indexed for inflation. So if it is able to attract that extra revenue it can ensure that it will be used to improve the quality of its programs. That should be an encouragement to SBS to get out into the marketplace and seek to attract the extra revenue. If that guarantee were not there and SBS was told that any advertising or sponsorship revenue it received the Government would deduct the public funding by an equivalent amount, then SBS would have no incentive to go out and seek to maximise the revenue it hope can receive from advertisers and sponsors. in That is something many of us would think was not very clever. I suppose the program which has been sponsored and has received the greatest to publicity on SBS television is, of course,The Civil War series. I remarked in the Labor to Caucus recently that it is one of the best programs, of the one or two episodes I have seen. I think SBS should be congratulated for the high quality of that program and others which it broadcasts. The right honourable member for New England is a great fan of soccer and I am sure or he would have been a very frequent viewer when the World Cup soccer series was broadcast on SBS. That program was also sponsored by Australian Airlines. I think Legal and General was the sponsor for The Civil War. The sponsor, by providing the sponsorship funds, was given the right to run one advertisement-I think perhaps a 60 second advertisement-at the beginning and the end of the sponsored program. In that way the viewers were not disturbed and were not constantly interrupted, as is the case on some of the commercial television programs. I do not th,ink that the viewers suffered in any way. The viewers, of course, gain the advantage that SBS achieves an increase in its revenue and it has extra funds to use to provide greater quality programming, so everyone is a winner. When this debate took place in the Labor Caucus I contrasted the SBS policy with that of the ABC. I made the point that sometimes I am a little irritated by the number of advertisements which currently appear on ABC television. ABC is meant to be advertisement free-advertisement free time and space-yet I am sometimes a little irritated by the number of advertisements for books, records and other promotions that are available at ABC shops. While I am sure Tim Bowden writes excellent books, I cannot quite see the difference between an advertisement for one of his books on ABC television and an advertisement for one of his books on commercial television. Mr Hawker-They are free, that is the difference.",70
119,Mr LEE,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"The shadow Minister for land transport, the honourable member for Wannon e Mr Hawker), makes the point that advertisements are free. That makes it more attractive to Tim Bowden and I am sure he has no objection to the ABC running those advertisements. I think that sometimes the ABC needs to do market research on whether there is any irritation for the viewers due to what seems to be an increasing number of advertisements promoting not only ABC programs but other ABC products. I do not deny the fact that the ABC should have the right to inform viewers and listeners of programs that are coming up-all radio and television stations do that-but I think the ABC has to be careful that it does not run too many advertisements on television. I make it clear that I have not made this point tonight simply because of the 8c a day advertisement which the ABC ran some years ago; I just think the ABC at the moment is running too many promotions for products available at ABC shops and records which are put out through the ABC marketing system. However, I do not deny the fact that SBS does the same. Those of us who watch SBS know that SBS marketing seeks to promote books and other products, such as videos, that are available through SBS marketing. Of course, SBS is able to increase its revenue by promoting products in that way. At this stage the number of advertisements on SBS has not reached the saturation level which seems to be the case on ABC at the moment. Having dealt with that issue, I wish to mention several other areas where I think SBS is doing an excellent job. First of all, as my colleague the honourable member for Gray (Mr O'Neil) mentioned, SBS should be commended for the extremely high quality of its news service. The international coverage of SBS leaves every other channel for dead. That is a marketing decision which has been taken. The SBS decided to develop its news service as the one providing the best quality and the one that gives the greatest coverage of international news events. I suppose the fact that its resources are limited means it is difficult for SBS to match the major commercial networks and the ABC local content. That might be one of the forces which drive SBS into having a very high proportion of television footage from international television networks. However, I think SBS and Brian Johns and his staff deserve to be commended for the high quality of SBS's news and current affairs programs. I am not mentioning this because I happened to be featured on Dateline last Saturday night. I have to make that clear.",72
120,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"You might be on there next week, too.",72
121,Mr LEE,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Perhaps for balance SBS will have the right honourable gentleman on next Saturday's program. Another program which has really set a standard for all networks is SBS's broadcasting of the program Eye on the Prize, which I think was produced originally by one of the public broadcast networks in the United States. Eye on the Prize is about the American civil rights network. I think it was subsequently repeated on the ABC or on one of the commercial networks. Certainly that series won a large number of international awards, and rightly so, with some amazing footage of the stormy events of the 1960s in the United States. There is another matter that would be of interest to you, Mr Acting Speaker, as I understand you met Alexander Dubcek recently. I had the privilege of meeting Mr Dubcek while he was in Australia and I asked him to autograph one of the books released by SBS marketing called The Other Europe. It has a photograph of Mr Dubcek and Mr Brezhnev outside a meeting which took place shortly before the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. It triggered for Mr Dubcek an amazing recollection of the events which led up to the taking of that photograph. I have to say he was certainly impressed with that book produced by SBS marketing. Whilst other speakers have mentioned the very important role SBS plays in producing programs for Australians who have come here from other countries, it is also important that we realise that SBS believes its special charter extends to other people as well. Knowing your background, Mr Acting Speaker, I am sure that you would be a keen watcher of the Eat Carpet rock program sometimes late at night on SBS television. I am sure the right honourable member for New England is always watching Eat Carpet late at night. I am afraid to say the program's content on the beef cattle industry has dropped off in recent days, but Eat Carpet has been running a series of short films which I understand have won very strong commendation from people involved in the Australian film industry. Often it is very difficult to be able to get mainstream television stations and the ABC to run these short, and sometimes quite experimental, films. Eat Carpet is playing an excellent role in ensuring these programs are able to be watched by those Australians who are keen observers. I wish to reaffmn my view that this legislation which provides SBS with its special charter has the support of all members of this House. I know the Opposition has foreshadowed some amendments because it believes the charter and the structures for SBS can be arranged in a better way. However, I will leave that for the Minister at the table, the Minister for Resources and others who are more expert than I am to explain why they think the Opposition's amendments are unwise. I will finish by adding my support once again to the Government's proposal to give SBS this charter. It is long overdue, and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) deserves to be commended.",72
122,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE," Can I say to the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that I am delighted that he was here at 8 o'clock. I was not. I thought the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) would be continuing, but he did not. There are several aspects of this Special Broadcasting Service Bill. To start with, for me there is a measure of deja vu. Both Tony Staley and I tried hard to introduce this legislation 10 or more years ago. In part we failed because the Opposition did not want it. Of course, at that stage, there were other factors about. The legislation did not get up then because the role of the ABC was not defined, and this is part of the trouble all of us have had. There is a difficulty in the legislation now before us. I do not want another ABC. The SBS is not the ABC. The SBS's charter is different, and part of the reason for its success is that it has been different. If it wishes to emulate the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, it will fail. As one who appointed Sir Nicholas Shehadie as Chairman, I am delighted to see that he has survived the years. Could I say that Bruce Gyngell, the first Chief Executive I appointed long ago, really did a remarkable job. Bruce and I were in the Citizens Air Force long ago and flew Mustangs and did other things. I must admit I did not really see him in those days as a television entrepreneur. Yet he was one of those who really began television in Australia. He has demonstrated his talent in his success in the United Kingdom in recent years. The point I raise with respect to Bruce is that he initiated the concept which has given the television part of SBS its character. Although we are now considering legislation-and there will perhaps be a few amendments before the legislation finally passes through the Parliament-the important point for the SBS is that if in its television service it moves away from the general character that Bruce Gyngell initiated, it would be a pity. It has done a great job. It has not just provided a special language and cultural service for those Australians of more recent origin, but it has also brought something of cultures other than our own to those of us who are not of a cultural diversity that others enjoy. For that reason it has provided something very special. Indeed, I know of no other service anywhere in the world that equates to the television programs that SBS offers. Now that it has legitimacy and now that it is to have its own Act, it would be a great pity if it changes its image and its direction. I would give this quite strong and severe admonition to SBS, 'For goodness sake, do not try to do something different. What you have is great, what you have is appreciated'. The honourable member for Dobell has identified the tremendous range of programs. Let us try to preserve that. That is the first thing. The second is that there are problems in trying to identify how one will be able to provide adequate diversity in language programs through the broadcasting as distinct from the television part of SBS. People tend to think SBS is just a television station. It is not. It has a range of radio programs which are important and which have caused problems to both sides of politics over the years. When a language that is not common to all of us and that most of us do not understand is used for the purpose of broadcasting material, it is very hard and inevitably there is a bit of apprehension about what the devil is being said, and why and how. Yet that is a very difficult and important part of SBS's responsibility. I am delighted that the ABC has started to use languages other than English for a few of its programs. I hope those who are public broadcasters will continue to do the same. For a long time. I felt that part of the problem, both in radio and television-and this is not peculiar to SBS but applies also to the ABC-is that we have not given the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal a responsibility in this area. I notice in this legislation that there is a requirement that SBS complies with advertising standards. I do not really see that that is the way to go. I am not happy about the legalistic direction of the ABT in recent years. It was far better when it was oriented towards the practical production of an emphasis that looked at the interests of the community and consumers and when it did not require 10 silks and accompanying juniors to present a simple case for the renewal of a licence. I am concerned that we try to maintain a diversity in language broadcasting in radio that does not look to the SBS providing the only programs. If we had the ABT as the backstop, then it would not matter who provides it; you would have somebody who would be able to keep a check on whether it becomes too political or something like that. Really, this is my main concern. Where we have very real difficulties, as there are between Croatia and Serbia and other former member states of the Yugoslavian nation, that do reflect on the prejudices and concerns of Australians, they should not in any way be related to the broadcast of programs within Australia. I know that inevitably we will have views expressed, but that is not what I am talking about. I do not want to see the translation into our Australian idiom of some of the prejudices and animosities that, sadly, exist-not peculiarly between those states I have mentioned but also in the Middle East, Ireland and too many other countries around the globe. I do not want to see those things translated into Australia. Indeed, from my point of view, I want to see one Australia with all Australians' paramount concern being for this nation, with English as our predominant lingua franca, and with a capacity to preserve and protect our culture, traditions and origins. We should encourage those who have diverse backgrounds to retain their pride in their ancestry and in its succession, but not to translate their hatreds and animosities into our society. I am concerned that the ABT is not, apparently, to be responsible for the SBS, any more than it is for the ABC, and I think that that is a deficiency. I come to my third matter concerning the nature of this legislation. The honourable member for Dobell and others have spoken about advertising and sponsorship. I have worries about the powers in this legislation. I think that, provided that they are carefully exercised, they should work well; and I that if they are carefully exercised they will enable the resources of the SBS to be extendfour ed. But, as I started by saying, let us not the television part of SBS try to extend charter. If it tries to produce programs and do what the Australian Broadcasting Corporation does, it really will be taking a lot of resources from the commercial channels-and that not what it is about. There is reason to The Civil War and programs of that ilk; there is reason for us to look at soccer; there reason to produce particular rock programs. All those programs are great. But let us not try to get the advertising revenue that will make the SBS another commercial channel. we do, again, that will change its character, and I do not think that is really what we are about. The fourth thing that I wanted to address a real concern, and one which I know is shared by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) , who has just joined me in the House. A considerable number of us are very concerned that although the signal for SBS available on Aussat and on the whole of satellite service, it is not available, without some sort of encrypting decoder, in a lot places in Australia. I regard that as absolute nonsense. This legislation is about a public broadcasting service. We call it special, and that term is part of a name that I guess I much as anybody gave it long ago. But I want to see that it is available, and I see no reason why that SBS service should not be available. I am not referring only to a satellite service. I see no reason why translators should not available. My colleague from Cowper menand tioned the north coast. Indeed, I understand from him that the previous Minister promised that the service would very shortly be availidea able on the north coast. There are a lot of who would like to see translators available provide SBS services to supplement the presently available services in our particular areas. I live in a part of the world where most times we are flat out getting one television station. Sometimes we can get two, and if we no could get the SBS it would be a real bonus. We should not have it in our minds that, just because there has been aggregation and think change in the management direction of television stations, everybody has access to television stations, or five if SBS is have available; not everybody does, and I would its like to see SBS more readily available. I have read with interest some of the directions included in the second reading speech is presented on behalf of the Minister for show Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). Two aspects of that concern me. I read that is the SBS will be allowed to undertake 'permitted business activities', and that they can be entered into only with the agreement of the Minister. I am cynical about what that means. If I do not believe that the SBS should do anything unrelated to its prime purpose. As I started by saying, it is far better doing what it has been doing-acquiring overseas programs, transmitting them and allowing us is to see a selection of programs in other languages and from other cultures. It does not really need to do all that the ABC does. In fact, I think the ABC would be a jolly sight better if it scrapped half of what it does do is and if it were to be subdivided. That is the another aspect of my attitude towards the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that I of would like to discuss on another occasion. I know that there are problems with some aspects of that, but we do not want this SBS legislation to be a vehicle by which we have as another multiplicity of outlets in the public sector which is not necessary and which is not pertinent to the principal purpose of the SBS. I see that the SBS will have its board increased by two people. I know it is imporbe tant that we have young people on the board that we have a flexible arrangement whereby the main consumer groups can be represented. But I do not really take to the of having everybody represented. We are us never going to get everybody in Australia to represented. We do not need to have too big a board. I would prefer to see a smaller but effective board which is able to come to the compromises that are necessary. Sure, we can still, with that number, do as the Minister said; that is, 'seek equitable representation of women, young people and people of different ethnic backgrounds'. But we will not get everybody covered. One of the plagues we have in our society is that, because we have all these States and Territories, we try to give everybody a guernsey on everything and we forget that we are basically Australians. We do not need to have every ethnic group represented on the SBS. We do not need to have every sector of the community on the board. Sure, we have to have a cross-section, and the principle is great. But let us not increase the number every time we want better representation; let us make the board more efficient and more effective and preserve the task. I am not convinced that the SBS really needs to produce all its own programs. One of the aspects of the ABC that I have been looking at, and on which I am quite keen, is whether we should not take out of the ABC the production capability. We have produced over the course of the years some wonderful films and some wonderful television material. I am not too sure that that really needs to be under the control of either the ABC or the SBS. I know that the Australian Film Corporation operates separately and that it produces some wonderful material. I just do not want the SBS to feel that, because it now has its own Act, its own charter and all these wonderful plans, it has to set up great studios and do the same as the ABC does. I think there is reason for us to produce programs in Australia. I think we have a talent in that direction. We have some wonderful film makers, producers and directors, just as we have, on the other side, actors, actresses, musicians and others talented in the artistic sense. But we do not need to do it all through the public sector, and we do not need necessarily to do it through the broadcasting agencies. This SBS Bill really exists to create the transmission facility, not necessarily the creation facility. I am a bit worried about some of the rhetoric in the second reading speech to the extent that the Minister might be thinking that this is the way to do it. I want to see production; do not get me wrong. I want to see Australian production. But I query whether this is the vehicle by which we should get it. I do not really want to see a great amount of public resources going into this area for that purpose when, as I said, the Bruce Gyngell charter-which has been largely preserved since its establishment-has been a very good formula for success and it is one which I think we should protect. It is difficult to know just what role we should seek for this Special Broadcasting Service. I know that there are those who look at the SBS and ask, 'Why can it not be done within the ABC?'. I think that establishing it as a separate identity has more advantages than disadvantages. But there are real worries about the extent to which, looking at the ancillary powers within the legislation, we are really trying to make another Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Let me give another example. Let us look at clause 71 of the legislation, headed, 'Lines for conveyance of electric current to transmission facilities'. For the life of me, I am not quite sure why this legislation has to give the SBS the power to provide and operate 'transmission facilities for the purpose of broadcasting programs of the SBS'. I know that transmission has been difficult. We have had problems in getting a slot within the UHF frequency which enabled us to get the tower transmission facilities we needed. But I wonder whether the SBS really needs to: (a) install and maintain any electric line that is necessary for conveying electric current to, or for the operation of, any such facilities; and (b) arrange for and obtain from any person the supply of any electric current that is necessary or advisable for the operation of any such facilities. I might be persuaded to the contrary but this is what I mean when I say that we get so much into the particular that I start to be concerned at what the devil we are doing. I want to have the protection of a body which has existed for more than 10 years without legislation, which has done a brilliant job and which has survived in spite of all sorts of political opposition because it has done that job. Do not let this legislation be a reason for it to fail. That really is my final message to the House. When something has succeeded, do not let us plague it by making it almost impossible for it to do what it has done successfully. I am slightly apprehensive that in the nature and character of this legislation we are not necessarily going to make the Special Broadcasting Service better. What we are going to do is to hem it in and restrain the flexibility that it has enjoyed to date. If that is to be the product and if it will not be as effective as a result, this legislation will fail, which would be very sad. It would not give us what the people want; it would not give us what the audience wants; and I do not believe that it would give the people of Australia what this Parliament intends. I hope that that will not be the product of the passage of this legislation tonight.",73
123,Mr CAMPBELL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE," Having listened to this debate in my room, I could have gathered that all was sweetness and light. Sadly, this is not so and I am afraid that I will have to inject a somewhat discordant note into the debate. I do not intend to vote against the Special Broadcasting Service Bill. It certainly would not be worth the trouble that that would cause me in the Caucus. However, I want to make it very clear that I do not approve of the Special Broadcasting Service and I think that this legislation is unnecessary, as is the SBS. I am mindful of the fact that the only other country I know that funds two publicly controlled broadcasting services is Fiji, and I think it is true to say that that has not done a lot for harmony in that country. We have to ask ourselves why the SBS was created. I ask myself this because I represent almost one-third of Australia in size, and very little of my electorate can receive SBS at all. We certainly do not get any television except off the satellite, if we are lucky enough to have a satellite dish. We then have the added indignity of the SBS using taxpayers' money to go out and pay for coverage of the World Cup soccer at exorbitant prices, which drove the ABC out of the market and therefore made the coverage unavailable to my electorate, a large part of Australia. That is simply disgraceful and I would certainly not like to see it happen again. I believe that the SBS does have some talent in its organisation. It runs some good programs, and in this regard it could well be a model for the ABC. However, there is a desperate need for a second ABC channel and, in my view, that should be the SBS channel. We have to ask ourselves why we have the SBS. It is because of the policy of multiculturalism. We ought to look at how this policy was foisted on the Australian people. It is true to say that no government has ever had a mandate for multiculturalism. It has never been tested on the Australian people and, if it were tested, I believe that it would fail. The policy of multiculturalism had its intellectual beginnings in Australia with Al Grassby, the immigration Minister in the Whitlam Government. I note in passing that Mr Grassby made patronage in immigration matters a high art form. As Peter Hartcher noted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 May this year, his approach was to surrender to special interest groups in immigration matters. Hartcher stated: In a year in which 112,000 immigrants entered Australia, Grassby's office decided the vast bulk of the annual intake on the basis of special interest without reference to the Immigration Department. Why did he do that? What basis did he have for that approach? This was the Minister who foreshadowed the policy of multiculturalism in this country. Mr Grassby was following an overseas model when he foreshadowed the blight of multiculturalism with his paper A Multicultural Society in 1973. That model was, of course, Canada. It was Canada that first embraced a policy of multiculturalism; that policy arose because of that country's misfortunes. That country clearly did not function very well as it had two separate cultural stmctures, which in the early days had led to physical conflict. The British and the French were, of course, traditional enemies. Some say that, despite all the moves towards European unity, they still are. A distant relative of mine, General Wolfe, gave the French a bit of a belting at the Heights of Abraham in Canada. They have never forgotten it. But I have made amends: I married a French woman and we agree that I do not discuss that battle and she does not discuss the Battle of Hastings. Anyway, with such a combination, Canadian unity was always a tricky question. The two groups together both maintaining their own cultures and languages always had a certain forced element to it. This division has never been adequately overcome, and it is what threatens to split the country asunder today. In the 1960s there were disputes between the English and French speakers for dominance, so a royal commission was established on bilingualism and biculturalism in 1965. A group called the Conference of Canadian Slavs protested against the tenns of reference for the royal commission. They did not fit into it. The royal commission decided that Canada was a home of more than two cultures and adopted the word multiculturalism. A Minister of state for multiculturalism was appointed in 1972. If the linguistic and cultural divide had not existed between the English and French speakers in the first place, and if there had been a common language and a common culture to aspire to, they would not have had the problem of a third group feeling alienated. Multiculturalism for the Canadians was making the best of a bad lot as far as national unity went. But what of the value of multiculturalism Australia? We did not have to have this blight inflicted upon us. We were not divided in two as Canada was. We had only one national language, which was English. Only a fool would deny that English is and should remain our national language. It and a common evolving Australian culture are our heritage. Mr Grassby decided that these migrants who had come to Australia from non-English-speaking backgrounds since the end of the Second World War, and their dependants, had to be given some special recognition. He decided that they did not fit into the mainstream and that some acknowledgment had to be made. Did the Italian and Gennan migrants who came here in the nineteenth century need that special patronising treatment? I think not. They adapted to Australia very well indeed and have made an enonnous contribution-a proud contribution-and they and their descendants are in the main today proud Australians. Of course, what has happened is that we have fanned a grievance industry with this policy of multiculturalism. We now have so many professional multiculturalists looking for something to grandstand about. Others probably do it on their behalf; they raise grievances that these people themselves have never even considered. I believe that most people who came to Australia came here intent on being good Australians. No-one forced them to come. They came of their own free will. I represent a lot of migrants and I know that most of them want to be Australians. Of any who do not, I think we have a right to ask what in fact they are doing here. If they do not want a commitment to Australia, I say that there is no place for them here. I might add that marty migrants have told me that they feel offended by the policy that we have adopted. As one explained to me recently, 'I used to feel I was an Australian; now I am just a bloody ethnic'. I think this is something that we ought to consider. It was Grassby who foreshadowed the policy of multiculturalism, and it was taken up under the Fraser Government, for the very tawdry reason of buying votes. It was supposed that ethnics were somehow able to be to manipulated-that one had only to manipulate one or two and they would all follow like sheep. I find this concept not only very wrong but very insulting. Believe me, I do not believe that migrants are any less intelligent than the Australian population, and in fact the evidence demonstrates that. To actually believe that one can manipulate their votes is to denigrate them in what I consider to be a very racist way. Of course, the policy was adopted by the Hawke Government when it came to power. Mr Hawker-Shame!",77
124,Mr CAMPBELL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I think it was quite shameful, just as it was with the Fraser Government. It, too, thought that it could do this manipulation. There is no such thing as an ethnic vote, simply because, when voting, people make decisions basically on what they perceive to be their self-interest. Another problem is that the multicultural policy has totally distorted our immigration policy. It continues to do so. We have seen the effects of this over time, and 1 believe that it is something that Australian people will have to remedy. 1 was at a mining company dinner recently with a Japanese industrialist. It is a very tening experience to be told by a Japanese industrialist that his industry is very hard on Australia because we do not have a common language. He pressed on me the importance of having a common language, that we should all speak English. He told me that he had been to the production line at Nissan in Melbourne and had heard every language but English spoken. He thought that this was quite lamentable and that I, as a politician, apparently was fully responsible and should do something about it immediately. He pointed out to me, with some pride, that they did not have those sorts of problems in Japan. 1 think we really do have to consider we are going with this policy. 1 do not that SBS technically runs a good show. think it runs it much more economically the ABC. While tonight 1I have heard many people heaping praise on SBS news, it has never really occurred to me that it is that much better or more informative; it merely longer. But that may be the criterion: people may have an overwhelming desire for news. 1 myself find that 1 can get by with one news broadcast a week; it does not seem to change very much. Frankly, 1 do not think it would matter if we simply repeated it on a monthly basis. We then have to look at the effect the policy is having. Let us bear in mind that SBS exists because of the policy of multiculturalism. If that policy did not exist, there would be no demand for SBS. We would simply have a second channel, along with the ABC, and the sorts of programs watched SBS would filter into it. 1 remind the House of a Minister in this Government who had very strong representations made to him by member of this Parliament who pleaded for special consideration for SBS. He said that his mother, who was very old and could speak no English at all but was very interested affairs, loved to watch the news and SBS screened the only program she could watch. The gentleman, of course, had forgotten that SBS always has the news in English. Mr Hawker-Who was it?",78
125,Mr CAMPBELL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"The honourable member knows him well. It is, of course, a classic chascase of people pushing an issue for what it presents in the way of power, not for genuine community interest. 1 do not like to dwell on personal stories in great depth, but 1 was touched recently when 1 was in Melbourne. 1 got into a taxi and asked the taxi driver how the World Cup was going, because 1I have a son who plays soccer and 1 was rather interested. He told me, very proudly, in a very heavy accent, that he was an Australian and he followed some obscure Australian Rules club; 1 think it was Essendon. We had gone for a couple of miles and he said to me, 'I don't know what's gone wrong with this country'. 1 asked him, 'What do you mean?'. where He explained to me that his boy had come deny home crying from school. He had asked, 1 'What do you cry for?'. The boy said, than 'They've sacked so and so'. He asked, 'Who's so and so?'. It turned out to be Yugoslavia's inside left. The taxi driver asked, 'What has that got to do with you?'. is The boy said, 'He's a Macedonian; I'm a Macedonian'. The taxi driver said to his boy, 'How can you be a Macedonian when I'm an Australian?'. The boy said, 'My teachers at school tell me I'm a Macedonian and 1 must honour my culture', The taxi driver said, 'I go to that school and say, ""Listen, you-""', and he said several expletives which 1 will not use here-""'You tell my boy he's Australiannothing else'''. He felt very angry about that situation and frustrated because he felt he was completely powerless. 1 think there is no doubt that Victoria is the home of multiculturalism in this country, as on it is the home of so many. other vested interests. It is the Victorian education system that has gone furthest down the road of a carrying this propaganda line. It is a very worrying thing and 1 certainly hope that it is rectified. If 1 were a Minister in Victoria, 1 would be taking a very hard line to make sure in world that this was stamped out. Mr Hawker-Not a very good Government.",79
126,Mr CAMPBELL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Do not think it is just this Government; it has existed over many governments. I think it is something that Australia really has to consider. The migrants who came here in the early days had no assistance. They had to get out into the country-and most of them went to some very remote parts-and build on it. The Barossa Valley in South Australia is a classic case. They did a very good job and I think they became very Australian; I think that is where their aspirations and their loyalties lie. I do not think migrants are any different today, except that we now have foisted on them many of these pressures, which they certainly do not want. I am in receipt of a letter from the combined Yugoslav clubs in Western Australia. Western Australia has a great variety of people from Yugoslavia-predominantly, I would say, from Croatia, but from other places as well. These combined clubs have written to me and said that their members had come to Australia, they were proud to be Australians, they were loyal to Australia and they felt very strongly that the problems of their previous land should not be inflicted on Australia. They did not want a bar of bringing any of those problems to Australia. They spoke very strongly and scathingly about politicians who, for various reasons, jump on one or other of the ethnic band wagons. They thought it was wrong and that Australia should not get embroiled in the turmoil of their countries. Many of them had lived through horrendous times and they did not want to see that in Australia. Australia does not want to see that and Australia will not tolerate it. This Bill has the endorsement of both sides of the House. I have not had a look at the Liberal Party amendments; I suspect they are inconsequential. Mr Hawker-How can you say that if you haven't looked at them?",80
127,Mr CAMPBELL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Most of the Liberal Party's amendments are inconsequential; it is a matter of habit. Even if I agree with them, I will not be supporting them, because this is a matter that will be resolved quickly. I think things are coming to a head in Australia. I think we are going to see a reaction from the people of Australia. The Menzies by-election was a sign of the times. I say here and now that in the next election any pressure group that stands out for a cut in immigration to this country will receive a bigger percentage of the votes than the Democrats or the Greens. As a consequence, it will have a greater part to play in the determination of future policy of this country. I think that it probably is a good thing, because in an issue as important as this the Government should not operate without mandates. This applies to successive governments. We should bear in mind that there never has been a mandate in this country for the policy of multiculturalism. Had that not been foisted on us, we would not need to introduce this legislation with respect to SBS.",80
128,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Northern Territory-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (8.48 p.m.)It is my fortunate privilege to sum up this debate, which obviously has traversed a wide range of subjects, not all of them directly associated with the legislation. The contribution from the honourable member for Kalgoodie (Mr Campbell), whilst not directly relevant to the legislation, did have some tangential association which I might address in my contribution, because my view is starkly different from his. Now is not the time for us to explore those differences, other than to point out at the outset that, whilst multiculturalism presents him with a problem, it presents me with no problem and it presents the Government with no problem. I think he ought to be mindful that, whilst he may reflect some views from within his electorate, they are not endorsed by the people from the area of the Northern Territory, my home electorate. Quite the opposite is true. I make the point that I neither acknowledge nor support the negative comments about multiculturalism. I wish to also emphasise that the migrant community that I have come in contact with throughout Australia is strongly supportive of this legislation and sees it as important that this Bill be enacted. It is important to understand that the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia provided constructive comments on the legislative principles and directly assisted in the finalisation of the Bill. It is important that we understand that. It is also important that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie understand it, because the Government-as, I understand, does the Opposition-has a commitment to fostering the development of multiculturalism in its varied {orms. It is also important to understand and appreciate that those people who have come to Australia as recently arrived migrants or are descended from migrants have a valid and a valuable contribution to make to the linguistic and cultural diversity of this country and they have a desire, which is manifestly obvious in terms of the SBS, to express at times those linguistic and cultural differences in the programs which are offered. No-one is arguing that we should be seeing emerge a situation that has been typified by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I found the honourable member's contribution in terms of the Japanese busillessmen rather interesting. I do not know what relevance it had to this legislation. I suggest that it was totally irrelevant and, in the context, I suggest that perhaps the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ought to re-examine the merits of that statement. I think we can be justly proud of the cultural and linguistic diversity of Australia. Noone is suggesting that English is not the first or main language of government or is not the main language of the community. No-one is asserting-and least of all me-that it is not the language which dominates our society and with which we communicate with each other in formal business. The fact that there may be some Australians who do not speak English as their first language should not be a matter of great concern. What should be of concern is that we provide every opportunity for those people to learn English where it is possible. In summing up, I refer again to the legislation. It provides a comprehensive legislative charter. It guarantees that the SBS can continue to operate independently. It provides the SBS with the same range of corporate powers that the ABC has. The Government's vision for the SBS is encapsulated in the new legislative charter, which is worth quoting in some detail. Subclauses 6(1) and (2) of the legislation give us those details. Subclause 6(1) reads: The principal function of the SBS is to provide multilingual and multicultural radio and television services that inform, educate and entertain all Australians, and, in doing so, reflect Australia's multicultural society. I would have thought that, in the context of this Parliament's duty to the Australian community and our desire to ensure that SBS operates effectively and properly and that it represents the whole of the community in terms of its service, that is a laudable objective and a principle which ought to be emphasised and strongly supported by all members of parliament. Clause 6(2) reads: The SBS, in performing its principal function, must: (a) contribute to meeting the communications needs of Australia's multicultural society, including ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; and (b) increase awareness of the contribution of a diversity of cultures to the continuing development of Australian society; and (c) promote understanding and acceptance of the cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity of the Australian people; and (d) contribute to the retention and continuing development of language and other cultural skills; and (e) as far as practicable, inform, educate and entertain Australians in their preferred languages; and (f) make use of Australia's diverse creative resources; and (g) contribute to the overall diversity of Australian television and radio services, particularly taking into account the contribution of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the public broadcasting sector; and (h) contribute to extending the range of Australian television and radio services, and reflect the changing nature of Australian society, by presenting many points of view and using innovative forms of expression. It seems to me that those principles-certainly agreed to; as I understand it, by the Opposition-are principles which could be supported by the entire community. Notwithstanding the criticisms that some people have made in the course of this debate, I suggest that if we are truly desirous of ensuring that our community fosters good relationships amongst the various groups that make it up-and let us remember that we are probably the most culturally, ethnically and, indeed, linguistically diverse nation on the face of the earth-we cannot adopt a head in the sand attitude, as has been proposed by some people in the course of this debate, and that we should acknowledge and, indeed, account and provide for that cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity. That is what this charter does. It is very simple. I must say, as a member of the Government and having an involvement in terms of this portfolio, that it makes me extremely proud to be in a position to support the charter publicly in this way. It is a positive charter, a dynamic charter, which should sustain the SBS through the next phase of its development as our multicultural broadcaster. Whilst I appreciate the enthusiasm with which the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), has supported this legislation-and I must say that I am afraid we are unable to accommodate his proposed amendments at this pointI noted with some concern the possibility, which he alluded to either directly or indirectly on different occasions during the course of his contribution, that there may be the prospect of privatisation of SBS under a coalition government. He said at one point that whether the SBS remains, and I may not be giving this verbatimMr Smith-I don't think I used the word 'privatisation' .",80
129,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"No, the honourable member did not. He said that whether SBS remains in government ownership is yet to be seen. One would take it from that that there would be a deal of contemplation in the Opposition about the future of SBS, were there to be a coalition government. The honourable member's references to funding, in my view, placed a question mark on the ongoing commitment by a coalition government to the SBS's future. He also referred, at one point, to the possibility of ethnic media currently operating in Australia taking an interest in SBS at some stage. They are signposts to me-I hope I am wrong-that the Opposition might be frankly considering at some point the privatisation of SBS. It raises some interesting questions. Mr Smith-I hadn't thought about it.",82
130,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I am pleased that the honourable member has not. If he has not thought about it, no doubt he will confinn in the course of the committee stage of this Bill that he has absolutely no intention of doing so, in which case we would all be very pleased. If the honourable member is thinking about it, he might tell us how he would like to do it instead of perhaps ignoring the subject. Mr Smith-You have to be patient.",82
131,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Patient with the Opposition! I have to say that we are very patient. We have learnt to wait. With a great deal of angst, we can wait. I am sure that, in the context of other debates which we are currently having, we cannot wait much longer. Indeed, the community cannot wait much longer. In deference to the shadow Minister, if he were prepared to put us out of our misery about the privatisation of SBS, I would be very pleased to accept his assuranthree ces. I am sure that members of the SBS board would also be very pleased, as no doubt the migrant community and those people who support SBS would be. I also noted that the honourable member for Bass cast doubts on the Government's commitment to keep the ABC free from advertising. The Government has made its position very clear. There is no intention at all to introduce advertising on the ABC and it has guaranteed the ABC's base rate of budget funding for the next triennium. The honourable member, in an aside, also questioned the potential impact of providing facilities for the SBS for additional ethnic language programming on the parliamentary broadcasting service. Whatever the outcome of the Government's considerations in this area, it will be cognisant of the needs of the parliamentary broadcasting service. I note with some satisfaction the number of people who watch the parliamentary broadcharter casts. We might not be high in the ratings, but it is quite remarkable how many people from diverse backgrounds have pleasure in saying, 'We noticed your bald scone'. happen to sit in the chamber in a position in which I am fairly close to looking directly into the camera, and as a result of these broadcasts a number of suggestions made to me about my appearance and what I should do about it. Some of those suggestions I have taken seriously; most of them. I have been unable to accommodate. However, that does point out to me that there are many people in our community who do watch the parliamentary broadcasting service-and, indeed, I think it is a valuable service. The Opposition's amendments will be considered again before this subject is debated in the Senate, but each has deficiencies. Requiring advertising guidelines to be subject to parliamentary disallowance is a major regulatory impediment to one of the few where the SBS should be operating in a commercial manner. Requiring the corporate plan to be subject to ministerial direction involves the Minister directly in SBS's decisions about scheduling and program contents strategies. This, in my view, underservices. mines in one stroke the independence which the Bill seeks to confirm. There are a range of other protections in the Bill for SBS's financial arrangements, for example: forecasts of expenditure and revenue in the corporate plan; Treasurer's or Minister for Finance's approval for borrowings; contracts over to be approved by the Minister; and full financial reporting in the annual report. The Bill sets up a much better system for community consultation than, in our view, requiring a committee to be established. It requires the board to be aware of and respon1994. sive to community needs and opinions, and it leaves it up to the board to decide how best to meet that obligation. This places the responsibility where it belongs: fairly on the board. If the Minister is not satisfied with the proposed arrangements, he or she can direct the establishment of a community advisory council. I would think that, given the nature of the and given the nature of the Government's intentions in terms of this legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to be setting up a parallel committee structure to mirror the I SBS board and perhaps even take from it some of its responsibilities. The charter makes very clear what is expected from the board in terms of ensuring that the community views have been are represented. A number of speakers have talked about SBS extensions. One should note that in the near future, indeed, with the second generation of Aussat satellites, there will be a national SBS beam and that, if people are not in areas where re-transmission facilities have been provided, they will have the capacity, either through the self-help program or independently, to purchase dishes and receive the service. Those people are not unlike many people who live in remote Australia, as I am sure honourable members are aware, who, if they want to receive remote areas commercial television services, have to provide their own equipment. I would suggest that it is certainly a province which needs to be examined at some time in the future, but the possibility is there for people to make arrangements in the future to receive SBS In June of 1989, the Government announced the extension of the SBS to a number of regional centres around Australia, however the areas selected were chosen because they included a major centre with a service area of around 100,000 people, a high proportion of $2m whom were from non-English speaking backgrounds. These centres include the La Trobe Valley, Bendigo, Ballarat, the Darling Downs and others. Some of them will receive their services this year and others will receive them the next year and the following year, by I am pleased, and the Government is pleased, with the support generally that has been received from the Opposition. I found on reflection some of the contributions in the nature of a debate rather interesting. I noticed the dialogue between two members of this Parliament who happen to serve on a committee; I found that rather interesting interplay. No doubt, honourable members also noted with some relish the contributions made by Opposition members who support the legislation. I just reiterate: we cannot always agree with all of our friends all of the time, and that is why I could not agree totally with what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie had to say. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee Clauses 1 to 44-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 45.",82
132,Mr SMITH,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I move: (1) Clause 45, page 16, after subclause (4) insert the following subclause: ""(4A) Guidelines developed by the Board under subsection (4) are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901."". Firstly, I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) for his summing up and his complimentary remarks. I suspect that he probably had greater differences with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) than he did with me. But we shall not enter into that debate any further, as it has been well aired here this evening. I am disappointed that the Government does not see any merit in our amendments, and I will not take the time of the chamber to discuss each and everyone of them again, because I had ample opportunity to do so during my remarks earlier today. However, our amendment to clause 45, which is a proposal to make the advertising guidelines subject to parliamentary scrutiny by making them a disallowable instrument, does have the advantage of giving to the Parliament scrutiny of what is the fundamental major change with Aldred, K. J. regard to this legislation and the operations so far as the consumers of its services will be Bradford, J. W. concerned. To have a five-minute limitation Burr, M. A. within the hour for advertising-'advertising' Cameron, E. C. being interpreted in the broadest sense-is a Chaney, F. M. major change, and to have the Parliament Cobb, M. R. involved in some form of scrutiny is important. Indeed, the other major amendment that we have moved-that is, that the corporate plan, particularly in its commercial aspects, be subject to revision by the Minister-is also important. As I mentioned earlier, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has written to the ABC suggesting that he might want to see that particular Act amended so that he can have an overview of its corporate plan. They are the two central matters that we are raising by way of amendment. I am disappointed that the Government does not see merit in them. Where there is public funding, I believe there needs to be some ability given to the Parliament to be involved, either through the Minister or through the operation of the mechanisms in this House, and a disallowable instrument is by far and away the preferable way to proceed. Some of the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) also allude to some of the reasons that underpin our desire to see these amendments enacted. But, in any event, I would want to insist that this amendment be considered and that the chamber be given the opportunity to test the matter. So the Opposition would wish to divide at some appropriate stage on that matter. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Smith's) be agreed to. The Committee divided.

134,Mr RUDDOCK,AYES PAIRS,"I strongly support this amendment. It will be a matter pressed by the Opposition. We want to see the sincerity of the members of the Government in relation to this matter. If they are opposed to effective communication, effective liaison and effective dealings with ethnic communities and others whereby advice can be obtained, let it be understood by the way in which they approach this issue. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) made it very clear that he sees effective consultation as a guideline to this Government. It is a matter in which its word and effectiveness can be judged. He claims a great deal of success in having obtained a shift of the Government's position in relation to certain scheduling changes as a result of more effective communication through ministerial intervention and otherwise. This particular amendment provides for a structured mechanism for effective community advice to be offered. It is a matter on which the Government clearly ought to be in agreement and accept. We can judge its sincerity in regard to consultative arrangements by the way in which this issue is now dealt with. I am disappointed in a real sense that while we are looking at this question, which was the subject of quite considerable debate earlier in the night-these questions were put at issue and the honourable member for Calwell was keen to have it understood that he had a view about the importance of community consultation-this issue may be resisted by the Government. We will press it here and we will also press it in the other place. We will certainly ensure that people are aware that there appears to be this unwillingness and inflexibility on the part of the Government.

Clause agreed to. NOES Clauses 68 to 76-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 77.",87
136,Mr SMITH,NOES,"Clause 77 relates to the establishment of an interim community advisory committee, and in the proposed new clause that we just voted on, 51A, the Opposition wanted to insert a community advisory committee. The interim advisory committee was proposed to be set up for a short period of time to provide broad community consultation for the period of the establishment of the corporate plan. It is our view that there should be an ongoing commitment to the community advisory role with a broader community beyond the board. That is why we moved the earlier amendment and that is why, as a consequence, we moved to delete clause 77. I might say that at the division stage it was hoped that some members of the Government who had been very vocal about the need for community consultation, particularly through PAIRS the whole period of the change in the language arrangements for SBS radio, would have given support to the continuation of a community advisory role because so many of them said at public meetings in Sydney and in Melbourne that it was absolutely vital that SBS listen to the community. The board rejected the views of the community. There was no advisory committee at all that could be consulted or have its views put to the board, and so members of the Labor Party were turning up around the country saying, 'We believe in community consultation'. Tonight we gave them the opportunity to put in place a small community advisory committee and this amendment was voted down by the Government, and particularly by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who was one of those leading the charge demanding greater community consultation. I think it is regrettable that it has been rejected.",87
137,Mr SNOWDON,NOES,"Northern Territory-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (9.38 p.m.)In supporting the Government's propositions, I just point out that the proposed consultative arrangements in the legislation are intended to focus on the desired results of the consultative process rather than the means of achieving them. The Bill imposes on the board a duty to be aware of and responsive to community needs and opinions on matters relevant to the charter and requires the board to work out how to fulfil this duty. The proposed consultative arrangements are intended to allow flexibility in the consultative process rather than to impose rigid consultative structures which have not worked well elsewhere. Rather than compelling the formation of a community advisory committee, as the Opposition is aware, the Bill allows a committee to be formed either by a direction of the Minister or on the advice of the interim advisory committee. The Bill allows alternative arrangements to be implemented by the board if these are perceived to be a more appropriate way of ensuring that it is aware of and responsive to community opinions. There are a range of provisions in the Bill to ensure that the SBS board cannot pay lip service to its obligation to consult. For example, the corporate plan must include the board's strategies. These can be rejected by the Minister if they are not satisfactory. The annual report must include a description of how effective the consultative measures have been. I conclude by saying that it seems a bit frivolous to assert that one should be setting up a consultative board in parallel with the obligations of the board which are clearly set out in the legislation. Whilst it is important that there be consultative processes and that all sections of the community are involved in those processes, to go about them in the way which has been proposed by the Opposition would not only, in my view, be a duplication of the functions of the board, but would undermine the processes which this legislation seeks to put in place.

Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon)-by leave-read a third time. NA",87
138,Mr BEDDALL,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 8 and 9 (1991). The tariff proposals which I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The alterations result from the Government's decisions on the Industry Commission's report No.9, The Commercial Tariff Concession and By-law Systems. These systems allow imported goods to be entered at concessional rates of duty. These initiatives were announced by my colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on 24 September 1991. Customs tariff proposal No.8 introduces a new schedule 4, item No. 56, to provide duty free entry of capital equipment which is technologically more advanced, more efficient or more productive than equipment currently available in Australia. This concession will operate on and from 12 March 1991 and will enable Australian manufacturers to import state of the art equipment to assist them in becoming more internationally competitive. The Government's intention to introduce such a concessional item was announced in the March industry statement. The changes in proposal No.9, which will operate on and from 1 October 1991, will expand or extend concessions already in place and introduce a new concession for the duty free importation of certain raw materials and intermediate goods of chemicals, plastics and paper and allied products. The coverage of item 31 in schedule 4 is expanded to include all aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft, other than goods for use in the servicing of aircraft. This change affirms the Government's objective to develop and maintain the international competitiveness of Australia's aerospace manufacturing and aviation industries by providing duty free access to the specialised parts and materials used in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft. Item 36B in schedule 4 allows duty free entry of a number of chemicals provided these goods are used for a specific end use and contains a sunset clause which tenninates the provisions from 31 December 1991. The change contained in this proposal cancels the sunset provisions. New item 57 in schedule 4 is created to allow the duty free importation under strict end usage under security provisions of ethylene vinyl acetate, nitrocellulose or pyroxolin coated cotton bookbinding fabric, phannaceutical grade gelatin, polyacrylamide flocculants and polycarbonate. The objective of this item is to enhance the international competitiveness of Australian industry by allowing the duty free importation of these raw materials and intennediate goods that, in respect of the production of an end product, offer a substantial and demonstrable perfonnance advantage over goods available in Australia in the nonnal course of business. Summaries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCLachlan) adjourned. NA [COGNATE BILL: NA (No.2) 1991] Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by Mr Baldwin: That the Bill be now read a second time.",88
139,Mr MCLACHLAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Barker) (9.45 p.m.)We have no objection to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 being debated cognately. It is primarily a housekeeping exercise, but it does implement some policy decisions, the most notable of which is Australia's ratification of the Florence agreement and extension of developing country preference to Czechoslovakia and Namibia. We do not oppose the Bill, but we do have concerns about some aspects of it, which I shall raise a little later. This debate is occurring against a background of disarray within the Government ranks about industry policy. The reality of that, of course, is that the Govenunent simply cannot tackle the fundamental structural impediments which besiege us all and which are costing industry in this country around $50 billion a year. We are all aware of those impediments in the industry relations system and the tax system; in transport, communications and the waterfront; in bureaucratic red tape, green tape and black tape; and in the Government's pervasive anti-investment stance-to name just a few. They have resulted in 870,000 people being unemployed and perhaps 100,000 small businesses going out of existence in the last 12 months. More than that and worse than that has been the loss of investment and business confidence-not to forget the fact that we have in this country, according to the Reserve Bank, $29 billion of non-performing debt and high real interest rates. Not surprisingly, we are seeing some Government Ministers starting to run around the place panicking, grasping at straws, whilst one or two others use the policy vacuum to further their own political ambitions. Some of these demands are a little more sensible than others, if somewhat belated. I was interested 1991 to hear, for example, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) starting to talk about fast tracking major projects-some of those, that we all know about, in Western Australia; some in the forestry industry; and so on. He is finally acknowledging what the coalition has been saying for a long time now-that Australia is no longer an attractive place to invest. That is being said by business leader after business leader, not so much in words but by people voting with their dollars and, very sadly, moving those dollars offshore. It is a pity that the Minister did not see fit to speak out loudly some time ago when those bad decisions were being taken but, whilst the latter day conversion of the Minister is welcome, the facts are that he and his Government have been in power for eight years and there is still no indication that the Government will accelerate the broad structural reform agenda, where the really big gains and the big dollars are. Nor is there any indication that Senator Button is pushing in this area either. It seems that he is limiting his concern. Although he mentions this area once or twice, he seems to be limiting the main thrust of his concern to taxation and to less ideologically provocative matters. Not once have I heard anybody from the Government discuss the $20 billion that could be picked up from industrial relations reform which has been referred to time and time again by the Business Council of Australia. And this is not even refuted by the Government. Nevertheless, I think that very conservative estimate is there to be picked up. Although the words are now being used by the Government, addressing the real problem is some time further down the track if we. are lucky. The only signal that business is getting at the moment is that the Government has lost its way. It has abrogated its responsibility to govern in the interests of all Australians and instead is acting on its own behalf in a confused manner and to self-serving ends. Not surprisingly, this vacuum has given rise again to a debate which we thought had been put aside. That vacuum has encouraged a revival of the protectionist debate, a debate which the MTIA said, after 12 March, was dead. It is not quite dead because it keeps on coming to the surface. I suppose it is raised again because of the Government's unbalanced approach to protection cuts in that it refuses to act on the structural reform side of the ledger, which was mentioned by Senator Button in his letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). If the Government acts on only one side of the ledger, it is perpetrating a system which is patently unfair. It reduces protection on one side, does not do the structural reform on the other side and finishes up with a system which is unnecessarily destructive of jobs and industries. I have to say that it is small wonder in these circumstances that some are seeking new versions of the old and failed palliatives. But whilst this debate goes on, yet again we are ignoring the real issues and losing valuable time in this country. As I said a minute ago, we are losing potentially $50 billion of certain benefits that would flow from fundamental change. It is against this sad background that we are debating the Bill tonight. As I said at the outset, this Bill implements a number of changes, most of which have been previously announced. I will briefly run through them. Schedule 1 provides free rates of duty for pretanned bovine leather, and this corrects an anomaly created by the conversion to the harmonised tariff which operated from January 1988. Subsequent to the decision to remove the tariff on wheelchairs, schedule 2 reduces the tariff on wheelchair parts to zero and removes an anomaly we forewarned of earlier. The need for this amendment highlights the danger of piecemeal tariff changes because of the inevitable tariff anomalies created, a subject relevant to changes to implement the Florence agreement, which I will come to in a minute. Schedule 4 redefines orange juice to include the products of oranges and raises the rates of tariff. Surprisingly we agreed in this case that those rates should be raised. Schedule 5, amongst other things, reduces the duty rate for aviation gasoline following a reduction in the excise rate. The reduction represents the cost component included in the customs duty to fund the operation of the rescue and firefighting service at capital city airports. This service was withdrawn on 1 July 1991. That schedule also implements measures to enable Australia's partial accession, announced last year, to the 1950 UNESCO agreement, called the Florence agreement, on the importation of goods of an educational, scientific and cultural character. Included in these changes is the introduction of zero duty rates for audio cassettes as from 1 July 1991. These previously attracted a 17 per cent duty. The audio cassette industry, which is dominated in Australia by EMI and Sony, accepts the removal of tariffs on its output but it is concerned that tariffs on its inputs, Czero cassettes and magnetic tape, will remain. It is requesting that tariffs on these two inputs also be removed. I have to say that the coalition has some sympathy with this position. Not surprisingly, however, Greencorp Magnetic, the only manufacturer of magnetic tape in this country, opposes the removal of its tariff, in part, I suppose, because it pays tariff on inputs such as chemicals. The Government's apparent reasons for not removing tariffs on the audio cassette industry inputs are, firstly, that it wishes, in its own words, to contain the effect of tariff changes arising from the Florence agreement; and, secondly, the tariffs on these inputs are being phased by 5 per cent by 1996 as part of the general tariff reductions. Whilst it is true that tariff rates for magnetic tapes and cassettes will be at that rate-S per cent, by 1996-the fact is that the Government has set a precedent to remove tariffs by its decision to accede to the Florence agreement in the first place. The coalition does not consider this is a make or break industry issue, but the principle at stake is quite important. Earlier this year, for example, and as already mentioned, the Government created a similar anomaly when it neglected to remove the duty on wheelchair parts at the same time as removing the tariff on wheelchairs. We have given the audio cassette industry's request lengthy consideration but, on balance, we have concluded that to move amendments to correct the clearly anomalous situation created by the Government's decision would almost certainly create even more anomalies in this and, indeed, in other industries such as the computer industry where magnetic tape is also manufactured. In other words, the Government has opened a Pandora's box, and to make some changes would probably make it worse. Instead, the Government is asked by us to provide an assessment of the impact of the changes on the audio cassette industry and to provide a guarantee that it will closely monitor the impact of those changes on the industry. We believe that the Government would have been far wiser to adhere to a program of phased and predictable tariff reductions across the board, but now that it has deviated from that principle it must be prepared to ensure that it does not create an unsustainable situation for one industry. We seek the Minister's assurances on that score. There is another proposal in this Bill I would like to comment upon. Schedule 6 includes Czechoslovakia and Namibia as countries eligible for developing country status and, therefore, should have access to the 5 per cent preferential duty margin. Neither of these countries can be described as major trading partners, I have to confess. At this time we do not oppose these amendments. But we have to express some doubts about the developing country status of these countries. We will not oppose it because, as tariffs phase down, the preference, the advantage that that preference gives phases down with it. But if we keep on extending developing country status to more and more countries it could certainly undermine tariff assistance for some industries overnight and thus negate the whole point of phased, predictable tariff reductions which we have repeatedly said are the way to deal with this problem. There may well be other grounds for extending developing country status to these countries, and I am not suggesting that we should not encourage trading links with them. But I query whether developing country status is the best way of achieving this from their point of view or from ours, especially when, as I said, tariffs are coming down in Australia. Quite frankly, the best thing we can do for 'developing countries' is to trade with them, and the quicker, in a predictable and transparent way, that that protection comes down, the more benefit it will be to developing countries throughout the world. I think the work has been done, if my memory serves me right, to show that $1 of trade is worth $2 of aid, and that if we were to get rid of all of these protective mechanisms around the world, that would be more beneficial to the developing countries than all of the aid provided by the Western world at the present time. As I indicated at the outset, the coalition does not oppose this Bill, but we would like the Government's responses and assurances on the particular issues that I have raised. I would ask the Government to get its act together on industry policy and to provide the _direction and policy that is so urgently needed. On the subject of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1991, the Bill amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate two tariff proposals tabled in the Parliament earlier this year. The proposals provide for an increase in excise duty payable on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas and a reduction in the excise duty on gasoline used in aircraft. On the first, the excise duty paid on LPG is adjusted each year on 1 April and 1 October in accordance with excise policy announced in April 1980. The excise rate will increase from $5.78 per kilolitre to $35.94 per kilolitre for the period from 1 April 1991 to 1 July 1991, with the significant increase apparently reflecting higher prices resulting from the Gulf war. From 1 July 1991, the excise on LPG was replaced by a resource rent tax under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Amendment Act 1991. Consequently, this system by which the excise is adjusted each six months has now concluded. In regard to the gasoline for aircraft, the excise duty payable will fall, with effect from 1 July 1991, following the Civil Aviation Authority's decision to remove rescue and fire fighting services from secondary capital city airports. The reduction in the excise rate reflects the withdrawal of that part of excise revenue directed towards the provision of these services, and is mirrored by a reduction in duty on imports of gasoline for aircraft contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which I mentioned earlier. The decision to remove the rescue and fire fighting services was taken following a review by the Civil Aviation Authority of existing arrangements, and was supported by airport users and the aviation industry. The coalition does not oppose this Bill.",89
140,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991. As has been indicated, the principal amendments being proposed relate to five major issues. The first is the granting of developing country status to Czechoslovakia and Namibia; the second is the removal of duty on parts of wheelchairs; the next is the definition of orange juice; the next is a reduction in the rate of duty on aviation gasoline; and, finally, the removal of duty on certain educational, scientific and cultural material. The issue I want to comment on tonight, however, is that of tariff preferences for developing countries. This issue was commented on in at least one report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, that of its examination of the Australian Customs Service. I think it was during the last Parliament that this issue was raised with that Committee as part of an ongoing examination of the role played by the Customs Service and of the relationship between Australia and so-called developing countries. In that report, which was a unanimous report of that Committee, it was quite clearly indicated that developing country preferences should be eliminated. Examples were given of countries that were given developing country status, and therefore attracted special attention and treatment from this Government in its trading relationship, but were in fact at the forefront of steel production in the world-not just in this part of the world but in the whole world. In effect, the technological development that was taking place in countries such as Taiwan and Korea while Australia was, in its own way, taking up the challenge of trying to meet the technological changes in those countries-and was making a reasonably good job of itmeant that it was hardly appropriate to apply developing country status to those countries. As a result, I believe that this legislation, which partly addresses that general issue, is quite appropriate, and I am pleased to see that the Govenunent has acted by introducing it. The Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries provides preferential treatment of imports for developing countries, as the term suggests. They receive a discount of 5 per cent off the general industry assistance tariffs of over 5 per cent; otherwise they are not subject to industry assistance tariffs at all. As time has gone on it has become totally inappropriate to provide that particular assistance to some of those countries in respect of shoes, for example. In particular, the comments in respect of Asia are most appropriate at the present time. I have had the opportunity to look at some statistics on major import sources for Australia between 1982 and 1990. If we look at the trading relationship that exists between our country and other major trading blocs around the world, we can see clearly that many of those countries which to date have attracted that so-called developing country status are in fact in Asia or the Asia-Pacific region. But times have changed. They have not stood still; they have embraced technological change; they have embraced the latest in equipment; they have embraced some practices in industrial relations with which this country would not necessarily have an affinityalthough I suggest that there are probably some people in this place who would suggest that we should. Nevertheless, they have also seen some major changes taking place in their economic circumstances. Returning to this table which I have extracted, it is interesting to note that, for developing countries, the percentage share of major import sources from 1982 to 1990 has remained reasonably constant. In 1982, for example, developing countries-and I have defined what they are, and the Bill certainly does that-represented something like 27.46 per cent of the major import sources for Australia. That went downwards in 1983, 1984, 1985 and, indeed, 1986, to a low of about 20.53 per cent. But what we have seen since that time is a slight increase such as that in 1990, when that percentage figure was 23.28 per cent. So those countries defined as developing countries still provided nearly a quarter of major import sources for Australia. n is therefore a very important trading bloc, and one of which we need to take consideration. However, the other interesting point that arises out of this is that it is not all plain sailing. We have heard the term 'a level playing field' bandied around in reference to trade, to sanctions, to GATT agreements and to the Uruguay Round. They are all buzz words at present. Australia is out there trumpeting the benefits of having a level playing field in trade, yet it is not really playing on a level playing field. I suppose it is a bit like what the Australian rugby union team did to Wales in the UK in the World Cup a couple of nights ago. It is not two teams that are equally balanced in this trading relationship. One is stronger than the other because of a variety of incentives put in place; yet we as a team on that playing field trying to get some advantage find that not only is the playing field not level but also there is a very stiff wind blowing downhill in the second half with the other team. Consequently, that is to our great disadvantage. It is interesting that imports from these developing countries totalled about $12 billion in 1989, and exports from Australia to those developing countries amounted to $17 billion. That accounted for about 36 per cent of Australia's total exports, so there is this very close relationship between the two. Over 60 per cent of the imports from developing countries are accounted for by six countries. Interestingly, of course, they are all from AsiaTaiwan, South Korea, Singapore, China, Hong Kong and Malaysia. How one could possibly say that most of those countries on that list are developing countries is beyond me. Accordingly, the legislation tonight addresses that problem. The Government, in its March 1991 statement Building a Competitive Australia, announced a number of steps to improve our trading position, and they are relevant to this discussion today. The first was to maintain our vigorous national campaign to try to achieve equal treatment for agriculture under the GATT umbrella to avoid the chaos and insanity of a trade war. Of course, we have had recently the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) and appropriate representatives from both sides of the Parliament travel to Europe to try to argue this case. We have seen the same group travel to the United States a couple of months ago to argue that case but, unfortunately, to this point in time, again to go back to that so called level playing field argument, we just do not seem to be able to talk to the right people to get an appropriate position for Australia. Secondly, the 1991 statement Building a Competitive Australia talked about helping our farmers and manufacturers to take effective action against foreign producers who seek to dump their products on the Australian market at unfair prices. I and a number of other members of this place have spoken previously and at great length about dumping and the problems that causes. We have also spoken at great length about the time taken to investigate dumping action and cases that are brought to the attention of appropriate officials. Whilst the Government has moved some way to try to address that problem, it has not moved far enough, and as recently as this afternoon some discussion was going on amongst colleagues on this side of the House about the question of dumping and what could be done about it. It is an issue that needs further examination and I commend that to the Government to pursue. This is probably in line with what the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) was talking about in sending appropriate signals to manufacturing and industry in this country that Government policy is in tune with their concerns and their problems. Coming back to steel again-an issue that I know reasonably well-for example, I know that in the steel industry plan which was put in place by our Government in 1983, a direct component of that dealt with the issue of the potential for dumping steel products in this country and, appropriately, having the Government take action as required to ensure that that did not happen. That was an important component-not the most important but nevertheless an important component-of the restructuring that occurred then of the steel industry which gave some degree of stability and certainty to one industry in this country. As I have said, I commend to the Government further consideration of that whole issue of dumping. The statement went on to provide a considerable sum of money, $2m, to continue the Australian made campaign to try to reduce Australia's reliance on imports. That is good as far as it goes. I have no difficulties with that. But, of course, the other side of the coin is that one should have equivalent products made in Australia that one can buy. As part of that buy Australian campaign one would hope that that is the case. But, basically, what Australia has to move more towards is import replacement, import replacement industries, and processing in this country of primary products and other things that we produce. I suppose that the woolly jumper is a classic example. Why do we just shear the sheep and send the wool overseas and then import a jumper that has been manufactured from Australian wool? Why do we not simply try to ensure that, even in some minor way, some of the primary produce that we mine or manufacture in other locations is processed so that there is value added to that product from which Australia benefits. Mr MCLachlan-That makes manufacturing more efficient.",92
141,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Barker very discreetly and very quietly suggested that we need to make manufacturing a little more efficient and more effective and perhaps to have appropriate policies in place from government in a macroeconomic sense to set the scene to enable that to happen. Frankly, I could not agree with him more. That is appropriate. Maybe the business taxation suggestions from Senator Button, referred to earlier, are an appropriate first step in that direction. That is not the only step but it is certainly one. Maybe we need to try to convince those primary producers and others and the manufacturing and secondary industries that there is a source of venture capital to promote some of those other industries that we need. I take the view that at present we have this massive pool of savings out in the community, in the main locked up in superannuation funds. Perhaps a proportion of those could be used as a venture capital substitute for investment in improving secondary manufacturing-a pool of resources that could be loaned at reasonable interest rates to people in manufacturing and in this way stimulate economic activity in this country. This debate has ranged across a wide range of issues, but they are all consistent with the theme of the Government in looking at ways in which Customs tariffs need to be continually reviewed_ and the way in which this whole concept of phasing out preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore, Taiwan, Kong and the Republic of Korea from 1 July 1992 will impact on that. As I have said, those four countries alone are major manufacturing nations in their own right. I do not think anyone could suggest that they are developing countries. Accordingly, the sorts of preferences that we have allowed to conthe tinue in our trading relationship in the Asian region for so long I think now are apty propriately being phased out. Let us face it: it is in the Asian region that Australia's trading future in the main lies. That is not to say that there will not be markets in the United States, the Americas generally or in Europe for certain products; but essentially they will be in the Asian region. We as a Parliament and as a Governbe ment have to look at ways in which that can be encouraged. There is no doubt that there is a massive market immediately to the north of this country. It is time to promote that, whether it be through Austrade, through trade missions led by business leaders of this country going to those sorts of countries whatever; I do not care. But there is this massive market to which we have access. It is my view that this legislation will make a contribution towards improving Australia's trading relationship with our It will also make a contribution particularly to ensure that, as far as developing country preferences are concerned, those that in the that. past have had this special relationship with Australia no longer need to have that relation- . ship. However, going the reverse in respect Czechoslovakia and Namibia is based on different set of circumstances and premises and I do not regard that as in any way ment contrary to the removal of the sorts of a preferences for the Asian countries to which I referred. On the contrary, we have had a massive breaking down of the walls, parralia ticularly in eastern Europe as far as political stability is concerned. We have also looked ways in which developing countries in need special assistance. Again, I feel it appropriate for a country of the status Australia and, accordingly, I do not see conflict in granting developing country status Hong to those two countries. The legislation is important. It is an ongoing contribution to improving the role Australia can play in the world, particularly in regard to our trading relationships with our near neighbours. I commend the legislation to House and hope that we will continue to note with a great deal of pleasure and certainthat our trading relationship with Asia is on the increase and we should continue to promote it.",94
142,Mr CADMAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"An air of realism is being injected into the debate tonight from the Government side. At last Government members are beginning to understand the problems, but there appears to completely no understanding of what the possible solutions could be. This side of the House recognises some of the difficulties that have been outlined. The Government seems to be floundering around looking for quasiprotectionist results, dealing with the dumping problem, which we endorse, but with an or unwillingness to take up the main themes of that 12 March statement, to drive them home and bring them to reality. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) should take a step forward and put them into action. Is that what he is suggesting-a promotion to near neighbours. the front bench? Mr Marlin-Far be it from me to suggest",95
143,Mr CADMAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Perhaps it is warranted. The failure of the Government to show any realism in macro-economic policy and then of deal with some of the micro-economic a reforms that Australia so sorely needs is evident in the contributions from the Governside. I believe that tonight we are facing realistic understanding in the Parliament that the matter of preference in trade to developing nations has to be dealt with as a whole. Austgives concessions to entry of goods into Australia from so-called developing countries. at The previous speaker, the honourable member Africa for Macarthur, listed some of these is countries-Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore of and Hong Kong. I do not think anyone in any Austraiia, with the wildest stretch of the imagination, could any longer regard some of those nations as still developing. This legislation adds two more to those favoured nations: Czechoslovakia and Namibia. In legislation proposed by the Government, we have an accelerated wiping out of tariffs for some industries and an increased list of those countries which should receive favoured treatment. I believe that shows the confusion of the Government. At the same time as it is prepared to change its own rules for Australian manufacturers, it is adding to the list of those competitors against Australian manufacturers who are getting favoured treatment to import their goods. The unrealistic aspect of all of this is demonstrated in the rising dole queues and the increasing number of bankruptcies. The Government has even failed to live by its own judgments and its own statements. It has failed to recognise that if we reduce tariffs a finished product and not for the components of a product, Australian companies will continue to be disadvantaged. They cannot compete unless they can buy the components of their products at world market prices. A small example which I believe is typical of this Government is that it has chosen to stick with the Florence agreement for audio cassettes and tapes and to move in an accelerated fashion to zero tariffs. In the same legislation it has extended developing country preference to Czechoslovakia and Namibia. That is a complete lack of realism of the real problems facing Australian manufacturers. The 12 March statement set out some good goals. One of those goals is a refonn of the processes of anti-dumping legislation. The Opposition, alternatively, has a broad vision of macro-economic refonn, which moves away from comparatively high inflation and high interest rates to low inflation and low interest rates, and a refonn of the waterfront and all of the micro-economic areas that are critical to efficient economic production in Australia. Not only does the Opposition have those broad goals and objectives, but it also has detailed policies on anti-dumping procedures to prevent people taking advantage of the Australian market and bringing in subsidised or government supported goods which compete against Australian products. The Government talks about level playing fields. There are no level playing fields; there is only self-interest in trade. Australia has to become self-interested. We have to convince countries in the rest of the world that they would be better off if they reduced their protection-our great commodities from our great industries have to have a market in which we can sell-and we have to show that we are not stupidly generous or just plain stupid, at the same time as destroying a predictable process of tariff reduction and extending the favoured treatment to others. What inconsistency there is in these policies. It is impossible for those who are making investments, who are planning to be competitive, who want to take up the industrial relations opportunities that the Opposition is putting to the Government and to the Austrafor lian people so that Australians can work in a cooperative environment together and so that the goals of employers and employees are complementary and can be achieved in harmony. The Opposition has put forward policies that the Australian people want to take up and it has also tagged the falseness of the Government's understanding of any of these areas. The lack of realism of the Government, despite its understanding of the problems, will bring Australia into worse and worse difficulty. The Budget is blowing out with an increasing number of unemployed. I looked at the unemployment figures just for western Sydney today-a mere one and a half million or two million people. They are staggering. There has been a 75 per cent increase in unemployment in western Sydney in just 12 months-that is how inappropriate the Government's policies of high interest rates and reducing tariffs are-without any commensurate action to support people who want jobs and employers who want competition but cannot face it because they have one hand tied behind their backs by a Government that is unwilling to enact refonns that are needed and obvious. The Government keeps running away from the obvious reforms that are needed. It will not tackle the problems of industrial relations; it will not tackle the problem of having the ACTU put its imprimatur on every Government decision; and it will not tackle the problem of providing leadership. It is no wonder there is disarray on the Government benches as Government members search for someone to provide leadership. They cannot make up their minds whether they want the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the former Treasurer. The only reason that they are in this dilemma is that no firm leadership or direct goals are being set by leaders of the Government for all Australians.",95

Debate interrupted. NA",97
148,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Victorian Meat Industry",97
149,Mr MCGAURAN,ADJOURNMENT," It is necessary to bring to the attention of the House for Government action the revival and the extension of organised crime activities within the meat industry-activities based on money laurtdering and drug trafficking and distribution. Those criminal elements gaoled or implicated at the time of the meat substitution scandal of the 1980s are back in business in abattoirs, meat boning rooms and meat processing facilities in Victoria. Their networks have grown. The sophistication of their activities has increased powerfully. They have formed powerful networks of interlocking companies and personal relationships. They are increasingly intertwined in mafia and triad criminal activities. The Giannarelli family, known to be at the heart of mafia activities in Melbourne and the subject of close examination in the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, continues to utilise abattoir cash flows as a means of laundering money won in the gambling rooms of Carlton. By its structure, the industry lends itself to interstate drug distribution. The meat wagon shipments are well known to authorities of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, to be the means by which drugs are distributed nationally. The best known of these to AQIS is the drug rurt operated between Griffith in New South Wales down to Daylesford in Victoria. Another known run arcs across the western district of Victoria. The industry'S sealed export meat trucks are known to afford perfect cover for drug distribution. It is common knowledge in criminal circles that the doors to trucks can easily have the hinges knocked out of them without breaking locks, and drugs and other contraband can be substituted at ease. AQIS inspectors are helpless in this regard. They are not empowered to extend their searches beyond a simple assessment of meat quality. They have their hands tied. The stories of the extent of the penetration of the meat industry by organised crime are rife. Only last year, Malvern police observed alleged drug deals involving vehicles registered to Melbourne's Islamic abattoirs. This year, one of AQIS's own inspectors has resigned his position after having been urtder investigation for operating a drug ring. In July or so of this year the individual in question was arrested by police in Warrnambool and now awaits committal hearings. Those major identities gaoled or implicated at the time of the meat substitution scandal are back in business. Evidence reveals that figures such as Raymond Hammond, gaoled for conspiracy to defraud, is back with his hand in the operation of boning rooms in Melbourne. Joe Catalfamo is back, too, with links to boning rooms and butchers and transport companies. Norbert Boehm-a ring leader in the meat substitution racket who acted in concert with the other Mr Big of the meat scandal, Walter Steiger-has deepened his and his family's links within the industry. Boehm, who was released from prison only this year, already has shelf and trustee companies in place to extend his influence into the meat export industry. He now works for Liberty Meats. His companies continue to operate, having been largely transferred to brother's name. Boehm's business links also give disturbing evidence of involvement with other prominent regional abattoir operators. It was Norbert Boehm, incidentally, who financed Leonard Suszko into that other company at the centre of the meet substitution storm, Cisco Meats. Leonard Suszko is back in town; so too is Graham Pearce, another coconspirator in the meat scandal. He is now a stock buyer for Liberty Meats and Steiger Meats and has been linked with the operations of certain regional abattoirs. The old network has effectively reformed itself. Those at the centre of the meat substitution racket are seemingly irrepressible. The ring leader of the meat substitution racket, the German national Walter Steiger, has already tried to buy his way back into the local market after fleeing Australia in the early 1980s. Walter Steiger and Norbert Boehm jointly own Steiger Meats, which was one of the meat companies central to the substitution racket. Though now living in Germany and living off the $lm with which he fled the country, only last year Walter Steiger began efforts to set up a meat importexport business. His financial links to this country are still in existence by way of his continued interest in Heide Pty Ltd, of which he remains a listed director. The company platform for his return is in place. Only in July 1990 did Steiger's daughter make approaches to a branch of the State Bank of Victoria to secure lines of credit through a major Munich based bank. Representations have also been made to the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions to determine Steiger's legal status in the event of his return to Australia. The Australian Federal Police and AQIS officers know of these approaches. Steiger is trying to re-enter the game because the game is on again. In Australia, Steiger and the others know the game is there for the taking. The meat industry cannot afford to have its reputation and credibility compromised, especially as the meat industry is worth nearly $3 billion in annual export earnings. But equally important is the need to ensure that the honest efforts and investments of the many owners, his operators and workers in the industry are not jeopardised. Goods and Services Tax",97
150,Dr CATLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to point out to honourable members what great pleasure I had reading the commentary of the greatest Liberal of his generation, Malcolm Fraser, on the proposed GST, in the newspapers yesterday and today. The Canberra' Times version of this article is entitled 'Disadvantages of a GST should not rule it out'. When one comes to examine this article one sees with what lukewarm support the former Liberal Prime Minister of this country greets the proposition for a goods and services tax. Firstly, he says that one cannot argue for its introduction on the basis of the need to lower taxation in this country since we have the lowest rate of tax of any OECD country except the United States, which is the same, and Turkey, which is lower. This, of course, is the result of the reduction of the bloated government expenditure patterns that this Government has been able to trim, the bloated patterns which we inherited from the Fraser regime. Secondly, he points out that, in order to get any serious reduction in income tax as a result of the introduction of a consumption tax, it would have to be introduced at between 10 and 15 per cent, with no exemptions. He goes through the possibility for exemptions and revenue. points out that one cannot have them if one wants to reduce income tax at the same time. The arguments that he goes through concern housing and the finance markets, but makes it very clear that a government has tax the common everyday items that everyone buys because, if these are exempt, revenue falls dramatically. There cannot be exempcountries tions. Thirdly, he points out the difficulty of collecting such a tax and argues, rectly, as do we on this side of the House, that there are now over 60,000 registered wholesale taxpayers and there would be not less than 10 times that number under a GST. Fourthly, he looks at the wholesale sales and points out: To suggest that we need to change the system because there is a 20 per cent sales tax on tooth brushes and none on caviar, is not realistic. Anomalies creep into any system. That is what Malcolm Fraser said. The article goes on to say: Till now, governments have believed that luxury goods should attract a higher rate of tax than called essentials, some of which may not be at all. Listen to this: I still hold to that view. If there are anomalies in the system responsibility of government is to remove them, not to go to a much more regressive system of taxation. Fifthly, will this new goods and services introduce the increasing level of savings investment that this country needs? this side of the House agree that that is a recognisable and needed policy objective for government. Fraser says: Unless the balance is altered in other ways there no real reason why we should get that increased investment and reduced demand for imports. That is, from a GST. He is quite correct. That in itself will not do it. Sixthly, he goes on to say that the governments that introduced a VAT or a GST introduc;ed it because they were strapped cash. He states: They regarded such a tax as an easy way of raising It is worth noting that in New Zealand total tax has risen about 4 per cent of GDP since the introduction of a GST. he In other words, the GST-VAT system has to been introduced and an increasing taxation level as a whole has resulted and we at the present are among the lower level of taxed in the OECD. Finally, he says: If such a proposal is to succeed it will need to be explained in detail and argued with intellectual clarity and strength. The reasons for delaying that quite cordebate are not convincing. We on this side of the House, of course, look forward to a further exposition of the need for such a tax, particularly in light of the most successful political Liberal leader of his tax generation having argued about it in such a way that it has to be titled 'Disadvantages of a GST should not rule it out' and then having spent most of his column in the national newspapers itemising why the difficulties have not been explained by the Opposition but need to be. Finally, I would like to make the point that, soduring adjournment debates, during Question taxed Time and during 60-second statements, we have had the back bench of the Opposition saying that we intended in 1985 to introduce a VAT. Not only did we not introduce a VAT, not only did we reject a VAT, but it the was not on the agenda. What was on the agenda was a retail tax, which is quite a different proposition, collected by retailers and not collected by all distributors and tax producers in the economic system as is a and VAT, which will involve a horrendous numWe on ber of tax factors.(Tzme expired) Unemployment",98
151,Mr FORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter which is of increasing conis cern in the community at large, and in my own electorate of Dunkley in particular: the alarming growth in unemployment since the March 1990 election. Last Friday, the front page of the Australian featured the headline 'Labor's ideals battered'. The accompanying article focused on the plight of the for unemployed, devoting considerable space to four individuals registered at the Frankston CES in my electorate. On Friday, Mark Kalb, Miriam Henry, Josephine Wainwright and Jackie Tallon became the public face of those Australians who have been so callously sacrificed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the former Treasurer, the honourable member for B1axland (Mr Keating), on the altar of their own personal ambition. Not only has this Government deceived the nation's farmers and its business people but also it has betrayed the young by encouraging them to remain in educational institutions and complete training courses only to discover that there are no jobs at the end. But it is not only the young who have been dumped on the scrap heap of unemployment. Miriam Henry is a single mother in her early fifties who has three children to support. In recent years she has made a remarkable effort to get off social security and into the work force. However, since returning to high school and completing years 11 and 12, Miriam has had only two temporary jobs. This situation is absolutely intolerable. These people have been most cynically sold out to the interests of the industrial relations club, the ACTU and the new class of trendies in secure government jobs. Above all, they have been sold out by the Prime Minister's vaulting ambition, his Macbeth-like determination to hang on to his position at all costs. In Dunldey, unemployment amongst adults is at least 15 per cent and it is 40 per cent amongst the young. Even that pathetic apologist for the Cain and Kirner governments, the so-called independent Age, has finally acknowledged that the unemployment rate in Victoria is really 13.5 per cent, not 10.2 per cent. If the calculations had been made on the same basis as in 1985, if we were not cajoling young people to linger hopefully in educational institutions, then the figure would be as high as 16.5 per cent. Here are the results of 20 years of business bashing. Here are the results of inconsistent tariff policies and of a recession we had to have. Mark, Miriam, Josephine and Jackie are the hapless victims of exorbitant interest rates and ever increasing government imposts on the productive sector. Many businesses have been forced into liquidation as a direct result of high interest rates. Having borrowed at 10 or 12 per cent, they have been quite unable to recover from the effects of rates of 20 per cent and above. Unless the Government is prepared to take immediate action and introduce a moratorium on debt, I foresee a level of bankruptcies rivalling that of the worse years of the Great Depression. The cost of unemployment is enormous. A million unemployed cost approximately $10 billion. Naturally, two million unemployed would cost $20 billion. This growing burden on the taxpayer cannot continue. But unless more practical measures are implemented immediately, the problem could go on for years. The Government's failure mentality and its inertia in the face of escalating unemployment reveal its complete inability to face up to its responsibilities to the Australian people. Instead of accepting that vast amounts must be spent on the growing numbers of unemployed, it is more logical to invest this money in Australian business. Surely it would be better to direct $10 billion now to business rather than having the unemployment which will inevitably result from the ever increasing number of bankruptcies. Apart from essential reforms in industrial relations, Australia urgently needs an overhaul of its iniquitous taxation system. Not only do we need a goods and services tax, but also something must be done about the alarmingly low level of domestic saving. In contrast to Australia, most other developed countries have savings schemes which aim to encourage capital fonnation and support business with low interest rate loans. In Japan, many people contribute to economic growth and wealth creation by investing in Maruyu accounts. In a Maruyu account, the interest is basically tax free and deposits of up to $200,000 can be securely invested with no threat to one's social security entitlements. Not surprisingly, these savings accounts have done much to underpin the economic growth that has characterised the Japanese economy since the Second World War. Loans from such funds, in an Australian equivalent, would be available to business at 4 or 5 per cent. Initially, capital would be directed to businesses with established track records. (Time expired) Clare Hall",99
152,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise not to speak on topics previous speakers have spoken on tonight but to speak of a very good old friend of mine who passed away some 12 months ago. Not only was she a former staff member of mine and a very good friend but also she was a long term member of the Australian Labor Party. I speak of Clare Rebecca Hall. The anniversary of her sad passing was 4 October, and I have not had an opportunity before to make the comments I wish to make tonight. On Friday, 4 October, my thoughts were certainly with Clare and, in particular, with her husband Russ. A more dedicated couple one would never find. I phoned Russ on the Monday after that weekend. Of course, that weekend had been particularly difficult for him, remembering the great partner that he had had for many years. I would like to pay tribute to Clare tonight for the very significant contribution she made to Australian politics which spanned some 30 years. Clare's efforts were made not as a row player as a member of parliament, but, rather, through a lifelong active role in the Australian Labor Party and, more directly, as a staff member for parliamentarians. She was a life member of the Australian Labor Party, and deservedly so. Her story starts with her birth in the home at the back of her parents' cafe at Main Beach on the Gold Coast in Queensland-a more conventional birth in a hospital having been prevented by flooding over the Southport Jubilee Bridge. It was probably as a result of that that Clare loved to swim. She was a great swimmer and, right up to her later years, like yourself, Mr Acting Speaker, she loved to ride a surfboard. She was very active in that role until, very sadly, illness took her. Clare was the second child of Charles and Rebecca Rowe. She learnt from an early age to accept working long and hard as the norm. With the outbreak of World War II, her father, already a veteran of Gallipoli, joined up to serve his country again. It was during this time that the family moved to Brisbane, where Clare went to Mary Immaculate College. While working after school in a milk bar in Annerley, she helped pay for her education. It was at this milk bar in 1944 that Clare and her husband Russ first met each other. Russ, then a young soldier, made frequent visits to the milk bar. The war parted their ways, and it was not until 1946 that, by chance, they met again after joining the same tennis club. The relationship grew and finally they married in 1953. After their marriage, Clare and Russ settled at Inglewood in western Queensland. It was here that Clare's ever present desire to help people was put to use for the benefit of a large number of people for the first time. In 1956, the town and surrounding areas suffered badly due to heavy flooding-which is quite in contrast to today, of course. Clare saw the needs and suffering of the people in the area and became an active member of the local committee for flood relief. Once this work was finished, Russ and Clare moved to Brisbane where, in 1957, Clare took a position with the Australian Labor Party. Her commitment and dedication front to her work was quickly recognised and she soon became private secretary to the ALP Queensland branch secretary and office manager, serving in this position until 1965. During Clare's time in the Party office, apart from her secretarial work, she took an active role in the Party's affairs and participated in many of the Party's forums. This involvement continued after she left full time employment with the Party in 1965. At various times, Clare was a delegate to the Party's State Council, State conferences and the national conference, as well as serving on the State electoral college and disputes tribunal. In these roles, as always, she gave freely of her time and energy and always acted in what she believed was the best interests of the Party that she loved and believed in so much. Clare left the Party office in 1965 to work for Senator Jim Keeffe. This was her first direct role in the parliamentary system and was a role in which her caring and concerned nature was shown in its full light. As secretary for Senator Jim Keeffe, Clare had daily contact with many people with a wide range of problems. Always they were received in a warm and friendly manner, given a full and sympathetic hearing and offered the fullest possible assistance. This was Clare's greatest asset-her ability to make people feel at ease and her commitment to obtaining a satisfactory resolution to their problems. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to say a few words about Clare tonight and to remember, particularly for the benefit of her husband Russ, the very sad sentiments felt by myself and all my friends, particularly those in my electorate, who learnt to love Clare, as we all did. (TIme expired) Product Labelling",101
153,Mr HICKS,ADJOURNMENT," For some time people have been particularly concerned about food lines coming into Australia which are incorrectly labelled or, if they are correctly labelled, have print so small on the labels that people cannot read them easily. This is particularly so with generic brands of canned fruit. When housewives or their husbands buy canned fruit at a supermarket, they do not know where it is made but they assume it is made in Australia. When they get home and read the small print on the cans they find that the fruit has probably been canned anywhere else but in Australia. Recently, this type of concern was brought to my attention by a lady who bought a handbag in a shop. The brand name on the handbag was that of a world famous boutique with an 'i' added to the end of the name. One would think that that would immediately make the bag come under suspicion. However, the label said, 'All Australian leather handbag'. The cost of the handbag was $165. I am not an expert on handbags, but it was not one I would write home about. She took the bag home. The first time she used it she happened to look inside-keep in mind that the label said 'All Australian leather handbag'-and saw a smaller label which said, 'All Australian leather handbag. Crafted in India'. Whether 'crafted in India' means made in India, I am not sure; nor am I sure what 'crafted' means. I would suggest that to all intents and purposes the handbag was made in India, possibly the leather came from India and the only thing done in Australia was that it was sold here. I see nothing wrong in bringing manufactured items into Australia, provided they are labelled correctly. If a person buys a handbag which says 'All Australian leather handbag', it should be an Australian leather handbag. I made a few more inquiries by speaking to my office staff. They told me of one case where a person in a duty free shop saw the labels saying 'Made in Korea' being cut off little koalas so that the koalas could be sold to Japanese tourists. Another lady told me that she had bought a car mat because it was made in Australia. The only thing made in Australia was the plastic bag it was in. When the bag was opened up, the car mat label showed it was made in Taiwan or somewhere else. We should be doing something about this misleading labelling. Many people want to help Australia by buying Australian. As I said before, we have nothing against people importing goods, but these goods should be correctly labelled. Goods made in India, Hong Kong, Singapore or anywhere else should have the country of origin shown very clearly on the goods, and koalas in particular made overseas should be branded as Korean made or Singapore made, but certainly not as being made in Australia. Flood Mitigation in Western Sydney",102
154,Mr ELLIOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Parramatta) (10.53 p.m.)Tonight I want to speak on a matter that really shows the Liberal and National parties' absolute contempt for the people of western Sydney. I heard the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) earlier tonight speaking about the needs of western Sydney. It is appropriate to make these remarks because my concerns relate to an issue relating to the New South Wales Greiner Government, which in a decision that it has taken today has shown contempt for the people in Parramatta and western Sydney. Last week I spoke in the Budget Estimates debate about the Commonwealth's commitment to flood mitigation in western Sydney and the urgent need for the people of Parramatta and Toongabbie to have that recognition by the Commonwealth matched by the New South Wales Government. As recently as tonight I found out that the New South Wales Government has refused to meet and honour the commitment made by the Federal Hawke Government in the 1991 Budget to help alleviate the flood problems in western Sydney. The decision of the Greiner Government highlights the contemptuous attitude that it has to western Sydney. I suggest it highlights the reason why the Greiner Government has such a total lack of support from the people of New South Wales, as the polls confirm, and also highlights the fact that it has lost the support even of members of its former coalition government in the State of New South Wales. While we are able to say that the Federal Government's initiatives in the Budget to provide an extra $lm for flood mitigation works in western Sydney have been hailed by the people and the local government from the region as a major step forward on the part of the Commonwealth Government after years of lobbying by the community to overcome their problems, the State Government has refused to come to the party and to match those funds to accelerate urban flood mitigation works in our area. It is worth highlighting at this stage that in recent years there have been fatalities because of the flood problems. Something like 11 deaths have occurred there since 1976. If that does not highlight the need for governments to respond positively to the problems, it is hard to see what does. As well as that, we have had major flooding of homes. There were 400 homes were flooded in 1986 and a large number of homes were flooded in 1988; but still the Greiner Government has refused to match the Federal Government's initiative in this year's Budget. For the people, particularly in the Toongabbie area, who would have been major beneficiaries of this work, I can only say that the Commonwealth Government will maintain absolute pressure on the New South Wales Government to ensure that it reverses the decision it has taken today and that it comes to the party to match the funding that has been provided by the Commonwealth and to see that we get on with overcoming the difficulties that many people in the region have suffered from. These problems are made more serious because only last year the New South Wales Government said, at that time as part of a phoney campaign it was running, that any funding that was provided by the Commonwealth would be matched by it; that was the undertaking given. Of course, that was prior to the recent State election in New South Wales where the Government lost the State seats of Parramatta and Penrith and came very close to losing a third seat, Badgerys Creek. Even with those losses, clearly it had no regard and no interest in trying to present a facade of doing something about the problems these days. It also highlights the fact that the Greiner Government really typifies what the Liberal National Party is concerned about. In the Sydney area that Government is more interested in doing things to help the people on the North Shore than it is in helping the people in the western suburbs, where ordinary citizens live and have particular needs which the conservatives have never cared about. In the case of people who live in the electorates of Parramatta, Prospect and Greenway, the Liberal Party has no regard for those areas, no policies and no commitment to help overcome the problems of the people in those areas. It is pleasing to see that the decisions which this Commonwealth Government took in this year's Budget recognised those concerns. We have listened to the people from that particular part of Australia. We have recognised their needs. The Federal Budget demonstrated the Government's commitment to respond to those particular concerns. At the same time, we are faced with a Liberal Party and National Party not caring one iota about trying to solve the flood problems of the people of the region. I say to all the other representatives of western Sydney and of local government in New South Wales from that region that we will be demanding that the Greiner Government demonstrate its commitment to the people of western Sydney by the reversal of this very unfair decision to not match a Federal Government initiative that would have gone a long way towards overcoming the from. immediate flood problems and accelerating the facilitation of works that would overcome those problems. Certainly the work is long overdue.(TIme expired) Overseas Students: Bank Accounts",102
155,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"A matter relating to qualifications required young persons residing in Australia to operate a bank account and the impact and difficulties for exchange students from overseas has been brought to my attention by Mr Arthur Cowling, the international president of Y's Men International. He asked me to raise this matter because, as you know Mr Acting Speaker, there are students coming into Australia sponsored by Rotary, Lions and also the Y's Men youth education exchange program. One young lady had, with her parents, made arrangements to transfer into a bank account in Australia a sum of money to enable her to do some travel on her own account whilst in Australia. However, when she went to the bank to draw some money out she was required to provide documents for identification based on a total of 100 points. She presented her passport, which qualified her for only 70 points, and was refused access to the money. We can understand the embarrassment student and also for the host family. Surely a valid passport, which obviously identifies the subject, is sufficient documentation to suit any bank. I can understand that if a person does not have a passport, other identification has to be provided. No doubt that is where the points system has evolved But I am unable to accept that it should be necessary if a valid passport is produced. I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to take up this matter particularly with the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and also the Minister who is responsible for youth affairs, because I believe this is a most important of issue and requires attention.",104
156,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate is interrupted. The House D. stands adjourned until 2 p.m tomorrow. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr Duffy to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, and for related purposes. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 14 October 1991: Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act-Direction under subsection 45(1), 28 August 1991. Civil Aviation Act-Civil Aviation Regulations-Civil Aviation Orders-Part l07-Amendfor the ments, 3 October 1991. Ships (Capital Grants) Act-Return itemising grants paid to shipowners in 1990-91. Telecommunications Act 1991Form of agreement pursuant to section 70. Form of licence to operate as a general (or mobile) telecommunications carrier pursuant to section 68. The following answers to questions were circulated: Sheltered Workshops: Award Coverage (Question No. 968) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 20 August 1991: (1) Would acceptance of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union's (FMWU) log of claims to cover sheltered workshops with a federal award result in these workshops for the disabled being longer economically viable and thus forced to close down. (2) Is coverage of sheltered workshops in Western Australia by the Western Australian Disabled Workers Union State award inadequate to the extent that it must be replaced by FMWU coverage; if so, in what way is it inadequate.",104
157,Mr WILLIS,PAPERS,"The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am aware that the FMWU has served a log of claims on a number of sheltered workshops throughout Australia. Service of a ""log of claims"" is, in the Australian industrial relations system, generally the initial move in the process of employer-union negotiations over wages, conditions and other issues. Even if the eventual outcome of this claim were to be the making of a federal award, it does not follow that it would have the effect suggested by the honourable member. It would be for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to decide the content of the award, within created by the demands contained in the log of claims and their rejection by the employers. The Commission could, if it decided to proceed with the matter at the federal level (see below), be expected to take account of special needs of workers in these establishments, the interests of their employers and the public interest generally. (2) Questions of whether State award coverage should be superseded by Federal awards are within the responsibility of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (the AIRC). Under paragraph 111(I)(g) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the AIRC has a discretion to dismiss a matter or part of a matter, or to refrain from hearing an industrial dispute or part of an NA industrial dispute, if (among other things) it appears that the industrial dispute or part has been dealt with, is being dealt with, or is proper to be dealt with by a State industrial authority, or it appears that further proceedings are not necessary or desirable in the public interest. Assuming that the. FMWU's claims are, in fact, found to be within the AIRC's jurisdiction, it will no be open to the Western Australian Disabled Workers Union (WADWU) to put argument to the AIRC that the matter, in so far as it relates to Western Australian sheltered workshops, should be dismissed, having regard to all relevant considerations. These may include the history of State coverage and the attitude of the workers concerned. It will be equally open to the FMWU to put argument to the AIRC about why Federal award coverage should be preferred. It is quite properly the responsibility of the AIRC to determine appropriate award coverage on the basis of all the information before it. Widow's Pension: Eligibility (Question No. 1010) Mr Harry Woods asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 22 August 1991: (1) Was the cut-off date for women aged at least (a) 50 or (b) 45 in receipt of a sole parent's pension to retain or be granted a widow's pension the ambit set at 1 July 1987; if so, why. (2) Were recipients of pensions other than the sole parent's pension considered for the eligibility referred to in part (1) (b); if not, why not. (3) Were only women considered for eligibility to the widow's pension; if so, why. (4) Is the Government phasing out the widow's pension; if so, why. (5) Will the Government reinstate the widow's pension; if not, why not.",105
158,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Since 1 July 1987, widow B pension has been granted only to eligible women who were at least 50 years of age at that date 'or who were at least 45 years of age at that date and received class A widow's pension or supporting parent's pension (or sole parent pension which later replaced these payments) on or after that date. This approach to the phasing out of widow B pension was taken to avoid causing hardship to women who were already receiving this pension or who had a reasonable expectation of eligibility. (2) No. The continued eligibility for grant for those aged 45 to 49 years recognised the greater transitional needs of women who faced particular barriers to labour force participation because of their age and time spent outside the labour force raising children alone. (3) Since its introduction in 1942, widow B pension has been payable only to women. The rationale then was that married women were traditionally expected to be economically dependent on their husbands and it was considered appropriate to provide income support to a woman who was deserted, divorced or survived her spouse. (4) and (5) Widow B pension provisions have been anomalous. In recent years the social security system has been restructured so that it meets the needs of people in today's society. Widow pension was introduced almost 50 years ago when community values and expectations about the role of women were different from those of today. In more recent years the participation of women in the workforce has increased significantly. Badgerys Creek: Pl'Oposed Airport (Question No. 1018) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 3 September 1991: (1) Do the environmental impact statement (EIS) guidelines for a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport require the assessment of prudent and feasible alternatives. (2) Is the conceptual design for Badgerys Creek Airport completed; if so, does the design use an estimate based on a 2900 metre runway, four domestic gates, one international gate and one stand-off position, all to be completed in 6 years. (3) Did the third runway EIS prepared for the Federal Airports Corporation estimate the cost for stage 2 at Badgerys Creek Airport at $720 million; if so, (a) why is there such a difference from the estimate provided in the conceptual design referred to in part (2) and (b) was the estimate based on the same level of development and completion time as that set out in the conceptual design; if not, on what basis was the estimate made. (4) Did the Prime Minister announce on 22 March 1989 that detailed design of a general aviation airport at Badgerys Creek would proceed immediately; if so, has the design been completed; if not, why not. (5) Was a concept design for a general aviation airport at Badgerys Creek completed in March 1991. (6) Did the 1990-91 Budget provide $34 million for a general aviation airport at Badgerys Creek to be completed in 1992; if so, (a) what sum has been spent from that provision and (b) for what purposes has it been spent. (7) What is the present estimated cost of providing a general aviation airport at Badgerys Creek. (8) Will a general aviation airport at Badgerys Creek be capable of accommodating 25 per cent of the existing air traffic at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Mr Beaz]eyThe Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. A conceptual design has also been prepared for an initial general aviation aerodrome as announced by the Government. (3) No. The Stage 2 development at Badgerys Creek as envisaged in the Draft EIS is described as a general aviation/charter/industrial airport with a 2000-2500 metre runway which would be developed between the years 1995-2000 at a cost of $441 million in addition to the cost of the initial Stage 1 general aviation development which was estimated to be $33 million. The envisaged Stage 2 of development of Badgerys Creek Airport as outlined in the third runway Draft EIS is not directly comparable to the conceptual design that has been prepared for an airport to cater for domestic and limited international services. (4) The Prime Minister announced that the development of Badgerys Creek would begin and that a general aviation facility would be constructed immediately as a first stage. The conceptual design that has been prepared is an essential preliminary stage of the detailed design process and will enable the early commencement of construction once the Government has approved the proposed scope of initial facilities in the context of its consideration of the future airport capacity in the Sydney basin. (5) The technical aspects of the conceptual design for a general aviation aerodrome had been completed by March 1991 but the preparation of the associated reports was not finalised until August 1991. (6) The 1990-91 Budget provided $34.352 million for second Sydney airport related costs comprising $4.9 million for airport conceptual design work, $11.0 million for local road upgrading and $18.452 million for the Badgerys Creek site acquisition. Expenditure against these three components was $2.6m, $11.0m and $0.8m respectively. (7) A general aviation aerodrome with a 1200 metre long runway capable of accommodating aircraft up to 12500 kg weight and with basic support facilities is estimated to cost $53 million (December 1990 prices). (8) Aircraft types that accounted for about 22 per cent of movements at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in 1988 could operate on a 1200 metre (12,500 kg weight limit) runway at Badgerys Creek. However, it is not possible to determine which, if any, of these aircraft movements would be attracted to Badgerys Creek. Airport Local Ownership Plan (Question No. 1038) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 September 1991: (1) Which regional and rural airports have transferred to local ownership under the Airport Local Ownership Plan since 1988. (2) Which airports are still to transfer under the Government's new proposals.",105
159,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question. (1) In 1988 Rockhampton Aerodrome transferred to local ownership under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan (ALOP). As at 1 October 1991 sixty-two aerodromes have been withdrawn from the ALOP since 1988 under the new arrangements which were formally announced in August 1990. These aerodromes were Cairns, Forbes, Thangool, Karratha, Gladstone, Merimbula, Bedourie, Birdsville, Broken Hill, Baradine, fugham, Port Hedland, Quilpie, Eromanga, Blackall, Isisford, Maroochydore, Moruya, Leigh Creek, Borroloola, Pormpuraaw, Barcaldine, Burketown, Gregory Downs, Jundah, Stonehenge, Windorah, Kummurra, Cleve, Coober Pedy, Cowell, Kingscote, Kimba, Loxton, Marla, Marree, Millicent, Minnipa, Narracoorte, Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Renmark, Streaky Bay, Waikerie, Wudinna, Gove, Cooma, Dalby, Geraldton, Winton, Mount Garnet, Ballina, Armidale, Hay, Clermont, Groote Eylandt, Coffs Harbour, Croydon, Rockhampton, Georgetown, Weipa and Newman. In addition, funding for thirty-five pastoral stations, previously funded under the ALOP, ceased on 21 August 1990. Ten aerodromes have transferred from Commonwealth ownership to full local ownership under the new arrangements. These are Mackay, Camooweal, Kalgoorlie, Mangalore, Mount Gambier, Ceduna, Norfolk Island, Whyalla and Normanton. Broome Aerodrome was sold to private ownership. (2) There are twenty four Commonwealth aerodromes which are still to transfer under the new arrangements. These aerodromes are Bacchus Marsh, Carnarvon, Chadeville, Coen, Cooktown, Cue, Cunderdin (currently on short term lease to the Shire of Cunderdin), Derby, Fitzroy Crossing, Flinders Island, Forrest, Hall's Creek, King Island, Lockhart River, Longreach, Mallacoota, Marble Bar, Meekatharra, Mount Magnet, Nullagine, Onslow, Thursday Island (Horn Island), Wittenoom and Wyndham. The Government is also seeking to transfer the civil areas of Defence aerodromes at Wagga Wagga, Curtin, Williamtown (Newcastle), Tindal, Oakey, Learmonth and Schofields. One hundred and seventy-seven aerodromes which currently receive funding under the ALOP are still to assume full financial responsibility for their aerodromes under the new arrangements.
