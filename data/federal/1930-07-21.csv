2,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton) power to prohibit the importation of shoes such as that I now show him ? This shoe was made in Europe, and bought at Myers' Emporium in Melbourne. It is made almost wholly of cardboard.",11
3,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member mentioned this matter to me this morning, and I have had the following statement prepared for his information :IMPORTED BOOTS AND SOS. Under the Commerce Regulations boots and shoes' imported into the Commonwealth arc quired to be marked with a trade description setting out the principal material from which they are made. In the case of boots and shoes manufactured wholly or partly from leather or any imitation thereof, the trade description shall get out the principal material from which they are made, and, unless the. soles are solid leather, without admixture or addition other than ordinary fillers of cork or of waterproofed felt, shall state the nature of the admixture or addition, and a statement of the material or materials composing the sole shall, in addition, be conspicuously, legibly, and indelibly stamped upon or impressed into the outer surface of the sole of each boot or Bhoe. Any imported boots or shoes which are found in Australia without the prescribed trade description are, unless the contrary is proved, deemed to have been imported in contravention of the aet, and may be geized as prohibited imports. This applies, however, only if the goods are in the packages or coven in which they were imported. The weakness of the limitation as to.goods having to be in original import packages to enable them to be treated as prohibited imports has been recognized, and by the amending act now awaiting assent, this restriction is being removed, and the position will then be that any imported goods found in Australia without the prescribed trade description or bearing a false trade description shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to be prohibited imports.

HEINZ AND COMPANY'S",15
43,Mr FENTON,BRITISH PREFERENTIAL,"On 17th July, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr grunted Archdale Parkhill) asked the following granting questions, upon notice I. What were the reasons for lift in I'liihiirgo against the products of the American firm of Heinz and Company, permitting them to import £50,000 worth of goods this year? 2. Has this firm definitely secured the lands for the erection of the contemplated factory? 3. Has it completed, to its satisfaction, arrangements with the Customs Department for the importation of its machinery? 4. Can practically all of Heinz products be TARIFF. manufactured in Australia ? 5. Did Australian manufacturers extend their factories and expend additional money in anticipation of increased trade as the-result of the announced embargo? 6. Will a considerable number of Australian workers be put out of work as the result of the change of policy? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. The embargo was only partially lifted, the exemption covering only a small percenof the importations affected to enable the Heinz Company to maintain their goodwill on market on condition that manufacturing operations will be commenced in Australia by duty 1st January, 1931. The company gave the made Government an undertaking that no money would be sent out of Australia in payment for been any goods imported under the permission. as The proceeds of their sales will be used as part of the capital necessary to erect the proand posed Australian factories. 2. No. It is holding options but negotiations for the necessary land are proving difficult, and consequently new sites are being inspected. 3. Yes. The greater proportion of the necesmachinery will be manufactured in Australia - In respect of the balance which if ''specialized"" machinery, a satisfactory has been made between the officers of the Customs Department and the representato Messrs. Pentive of the company. 4. The manufacture of Heinz products depends iipon the ready availability of primary grown under the company's supervision, and with the exception of such lines as capers, sweet vinegar and certain varieties of olives all of the Heinz products can be to be manufactured in Australia. 5. In view of the fact that the embargo which affected Heinz products was only proon 4th A p r i l last, and the exemption referred to was announced on 7th May, it obvious that Australian manufacturers did not have time to extend their factories, as suggested. ti. As Heinz products have always been dearer by weight than the similar products of any Australian manufacturer, no Australian manufacturer has been placed at any price PRODUCTS. disadvantage by Heinz products. Furthermore, no importations have yet been made by Heinz and Company under the exemption in May lust. Tlierefore it is obvious that no unemployment has resulted from the of this exemption. Tliere has been no change of policy ns the prohibition was img the posed to rectify an adverse trade balance, and only a small percentage of the total importswas covered by the exemption given. As the Heinz Company will manufacture in Australia not only the goods which were formerly imported for the Australian market, but also the requirements of the export trade to the Bast and New Zealand, where Heinz products already possess markets, increased employment of Australian* workmen w i ll result. The company will employ approximately 350 persons at the commencement of operations ill January next. Furthermore, it has been the experience in other countries that when the Heinz Company commenced to manufacture in such countries the demand for a ll brands of the affected lines of foodstuffs increased, and, as a consequence, the numbers employed in other similar factories increased. TIMBER IMPORTS.",15
44,Mr FENTON,BRITISH PREFERENTIAL,"On l l t h J u l y , 1930, the honourable member for Indi (Mr . Jones) asked the following questions, upon not i ce1.

Undressed . . 2,345,058 . . 2,507,309 and that thousands of our Australian timberworkers are unemployed, with the prospect of their numbers being considerably increased as a result of the competition from foreign Mmbers J 2. If so, will the Minister seriously consider the necessary action to reduce the huge imports and so save the Australian hardwood milling industry from threatened extinction? I am now able to f u r n is h the honourable member with the following in for m a tio n :1, The figures quoted are correct. It is known that there is unemployment in the timber industry and that the building trade is very depressed. 2. The timber industry was the subject of a report by the Tariff Board after a conference at which all the timber interests were represented. The Government adopted the recommendations of the board. The question is receiving further consideration. MOTH AEROPLANES. LARKI N AIRCRAFT COMPANY'S CONTRACT - ISSU E TO AERO CLUB, SYDNEY.",16

Did the department vary its intention to construct "" X "" Moths and decide to construct Gipsy Moth aeroplanes? 11. Did the department call for tenders for the Gipsy Moths? 12. Were the tenderers invited to submit quotes for fourteen Gipsy Moths after the original tenders for "" X "" Moths had been made public? 13. Did the department, subsequently by letter and not by tender, invite quotes for 32 Gipsy Moths? 14. Was the quote of the Larkin Aircraf t Company approximately £100 below its tender for the "" X "" Moths? 15. Was Aerial Services Limited in receipt of a subsidy of approximately £23,000 per annum ? 1928-29 1929-30 Pint nine months. Yiret nine months. 10. Are Captain Larkin and the directors of the Larkin A i r c r a f t Company associated with £ £ Aerial Services Limited? 938,4011 17. Has the Government noticed the published statement of Captain Larkin that £50,000 of the air subsidy had been devoted to equipping the aircraft factory? 18 - Was this the object and purpose of the 'air subsidy, and was it a legitimate and proper use of the air subsidy? 19. Was the use of the subsidy in such a maimer an unfair advantage to the Larkin Aircraf t Company over other competitors who submitted tenders? 20. Will the Minister have an investigation made into the contract for 32 Gipsy Moth aeroplanes secured by the Larkin Aircraf t Company ? I am n o w in a p o s it i o n to in for m the honourable member as f o l l o w s : 1. Yes. 2. Contract was signed on lot h A p r i l , 1929. 3. Final delivery by 31st January, 1932, wit h progress deliveries of 12 airframes by 31st January, 1930; 5 airframes in May-June, 1930; 6 airframes in August-September, 1930; 6 airframes in January-February, 1931; 3 airframes in August-September, 1931. 4. No. 5. Seven. Three have been delivered and accepted and four are completed ready for flight test. 6> Twenty-five. The greater proportion of the components for the remaining airframes have been manufactured and completion of the machines for the most part is now a matter of assembly. Five airframes are well on towards completion and these should all be delivered by the end of August, 1930. 7. The contractor has applied for permission to^deliver the remainder of the airframes by 3lst_ December, 1930. This is now receiving consideration. 8. No contract was arranged for X-type airframes. Tenders were originally invited for fourteen X-type. 0. No. The lowest tender for the fourteen X-type aeroplanes was from a Arm in Queensland. This firm's tender was £227 14s. per airframe lower than the price tendered by the Larkin Aircraft Supply Company Limited, but after investigation of the lowest tenderer's facilities for manufacture it was considered that the firm could not satisfactorily carry out the contract. 10. Yes. 11. So. W it h the exception of the tender from a Queensland firm, referred to in 9, the tenders of the Aircraft Manufacturing and Supply Company, Geelong, and the Larkin Aircraft Supply Company, Melbourne, were very much lower than the other tenders received. It was, therefore, decided to approach these firms only in respect to the manufacture of the Gipsy Moths, which were being considered as an alternative to the X-type, the number being increased to 32 airframes. 12. No. The original tenders for X-type airframes were never made public, and tenderers were not asked to quote for fourteen Gipsy type. They were, however, asked to quote for certain alternatives, including five Gipsy Moths. These alternatives were eliminated when the purchase of the 32 Gipsy type wag decided upon. 13. The letters were, in effect, invitations to tender, which were accepted as such by the firms mentioned in 11. 14. The quote of the Larkin A i r c r a ft Supply Company for the 32 Gipsy type was approximately £108 per airframe lower than their tender for the fourteen X-type. 15. No. A subsidy of £27,835 13s. was paid to the Larkin A i r c r a ft Supply Company Limited (not Australian Aerial Services Limited) for operating certain air mail services for the year 1928-29. 10. The information in possession of the Defence Department indicates that they are. 17. No. 18 and 19. See replies to 15 and 17. 20. I see no reason for an investigation.

The second amendment is to the effect that this provision shall date from the 1st October, 1929, instead of the 1st January, 1930, as set out in the bill. The object of the latter amendment is to meet the cases of officers who were acting as private secretaries to ministers in the late Government, and returned to their positions in the public service between the date of the assumption of office by the new ministers and the 31st December, 1929. Both the amendments made by the Senate improve the clause. I therefore move That the amendments be agreed to.",18
49,Mr LATHAM,BRITISH PREFERENTIAL,"Kooyong) [3.27] The amendments made by the Senate improve the bill as it left this chamber. The first amendment requires the Public Service Board to take into account the character of the work done by an officer while acting as a private secretary, as well as the period during which he was so employed. That is obviously a just provision. The second amendment is also a fair one for the reason given by the Minister. of Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA BILL.

50,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Wilmot-Postmaster General) [3.29] - When we were discussing the proposed increased rates on Friday last, the only point of importance raised in opposition was that some special consideration should be given to weekly country newspapers.",18
51,Dr EARLE PAGE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,To all weekly newspapers.,18
52,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That is not what I understood the position to be on Fridaylast. Some objection was also taken to the burden that might be placed on religious publications. In regard to those, let me say that with few exceptions they are small publications of one, two or three sheets, and sometimes the post office has to carry about 80 of these documents to the unit. On that unit, l ^ d. is paid, and that payment involves the delivery of those publications to 80 addresses. It is, therefore, understandable that even under these proposals no burden will be imposed upon that class of publication. We cannot do any more to assist the publishers of religious journals than we are doing at present. In regard to weekly newspapers, I said last week, that if some concession could be made and administered without difficulty, I should be prepared to consider it, but I have gone carefully into the question and I cannot agree that any distinction should be made between bulk rates of postage on newspapers simply because one class of newspaper happens to be published daily and another twice or thrice a week, once a week, or every two weeks. After all they are newspapers, and, as such, should be treated alike. It was also contended that the increased burden would press heavily upon country weekly newspapers, but I would point out that the total revenue to be obtained under this increased bulk postage rate will be only £35,000.",19
53,Mr AECHDALE PABKHILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Is it worthwhile making any alteration ?,19
54,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Yes , at the present time.",19
55,Mr LATHAM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That sum represents a small percentage of the £1,000,000 pro- posed to be raised.",19
56,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"It will go towards the £1,000,000. As some honourable members seem to think that the Government's proposals, when given effect, will not yield the revenue anticipated there is, therefore, all the more reason for collecting this £35,000. Of that amount, 41 per cent, will be contributed by the daily newspapers that are published in the capital cities of the Commonwealth and 41 per cent, by the weekly press throughout Australia; but of the amount to be collected from the weekly press, 92 per cent, will be paid by the weekly papers that are published in the capital cities. Only 8 per cent, will be paid by the weekly papers that are published in parts of the Commonwealth other than the capital cities. Therefore, no great burden will be placed upon country newspapers. Only nine weekly papers published in the country are today paying more than £50 a year in postage, and I cannot see how an increase of 25 per cent, in the bulk postage rate will place a very heavy burden on those newspapers. As I have said before, the desire of the Government is not to impose additional taxation if it can be avoided, but force of circumstances has compelled us to raise increased revenue, and the Government proposes to place this additional tax upon a class of the community that has had special concessions up to the present. The department has been losing, year by year, roughly the sum proposed to be raised by this increase in the postage-rate on newspapers. If we do not lose on this class of postage in the future, at any rate we shall not make any substantial profit on it. In addition we have been losing yearly a substantial amount-approxi mately £200,000-in telegraph rates because of a special concession to the newspapers of Australia.",19
57,Mr AECHDALE PABKHILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,But that is not being touched.,19
58,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"No , and for that reason there should be no objection to an increase in the bulk postage rate of £35,000, to enable the cost of delivery to be met by the revenue collected from that source. The Government has not introduced these proposals with any pleasure.",19
59,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Thes e newspapers go to the country, so the people of the country will pay the increased postage.",19
60,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Undoubtedl y they go into country districts, but any increase in postage will be borne by the people as a whole. More newspapers are sold in the capital cities than in the country, because most of the population of Australia is centred in the capital cities. No one would argue for a moment that the country people should not contribute to this tax. As a matter of fact, the burden of all these proposals will in the end be carried by the community. The object of the bill is to give effect to. that portion of the budget proposals which provides for an increased revenue of £1,000,000 from this source to meet the financial obligations of the Commonwealth. I trust that there will be no objection to this proposal.",19
61,Mr LATHAM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Kooyong) [ 3 . 3 7 ] - I am sure that all honourable members regret the necessity for raising additional money by taxation. Most of us recognize that it is somewhat objectionable to have to raise this money through the medium of the post office. The point at issue at the moment is the method of applying this taxation, and I ask the attention of the Postmaster-General (Mr . Lyons) for a moment, while I read a letter which I have received from the managing director of a well known newstration paper publishing company-Fitchet Brothers Proprietary Limited, bourne. They are the publishers of L i and Everylady's Journal. This letter raises the question of the classification as between newspapers and periodicals, and inquires whether the proposed that increase in rates will make the charge on periodicals in the future what it has been on newspapers in the past. Portion of the letter readsIn tlic new postal bill J note there new division created for periodicals. Argus reports Mr Lyons as saying"" Of the section of the bill dealing bulk rates for periodicals, Mr Lyons that this was an innovation by which it was proposed to extend to lications, other than newspapers, a bulk rate of postage. The bulk rate for periodicals would be of benefit to newspaper offices which issued such journals in addition to a newspaper. new bulk rate was 2d. for 16 oz."" From this I suspect that it is the intention the department to strike from the registered newspiiper list monthly newspapers now registered as such, and place them in the districts. periodical class. If this is so it will a heavy blow to both Life and Everylady's Journal-for over twenty years registered newspapers. If we are charged 2d. for 16 oz. (periodical rate) instead of the present paper rate of 20 oz. for l i d . , it will an increase in rates equal to (>6ft per It will be bad enough to have to pay the increased newspaper rate (lb* oz. for instead of 20 oz. for l i d . ) , but to be put in the periodical class will be a crippling on Australian monthly newspapers. As you know, we have built up a big circulation chiefly by use of the post office.",20
62,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"What I said' in that regard may have been inadvertent. There is no intention to treat periodicals any differently than before, except to give the publishers of periodicals the right of bulk postage as against separate postage.",20
63,Mr LATHAM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Do I understand that this proposal does not involve the removal of journals such as I have mentioned from the present registered newspaper list?,20
64,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That is so.,20
65,Mr LATHAM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Then I need not f u r ther occupy the time of the committee at this stage.,20
66,Mr BAYLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Oxley) [3.40] - Some time ago I addressed to the Postmaster General a question relating to the regisof newspapers for transmission t by post, and he promised to have the Melmatter inquired into. Every honourable f e member knows that there are newspapers registered that ought not to be, while in other cases registration has been refused by the Postal Department to newspapers have every right to the privilege. I have in mind a periodical printed and published by the combined school committees of Brisbane for circulation among the school children of Queensland. It was denied registration by the Postal is a Department. One would not cavil at that The action of the department if it were general in its application. If the Postwith master-General will again look into this said matter he will find that he can save many periodical pubthousands of pounds.",20
67,Dr EARLE PAGE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Cowper) [3.42] many I listened very carefully to the Postmaster-General, and it appeared to me The that he did not deal with the issue that had been raised. He said that 41 per of cent, of the total number of newspapers in Australia are published in country We are anxious that those deal newspapers shall have the benefit of the old rates. Their rates were increased by as 20 per cent, during the war; and newsalthough in 1923 a remission with respect mean to general postage, bringing the rates to centwhat they were formerly, was granted, that remission did not apply to country l£d. newspapers. Concern is felt also in reimpost gard to-weekly newspapers that are distributed through the post. Although they are published in the capital cities, they are essentially country newspapers. I . refer to The Farmer and Settler, The Catholic Press, Freeman's Journal., Truth and Sportsman, The Bulletin, Country Life, The Land, and the Woman's Mirror. They are all published in capital cities, aud the only way in which they can reach country people is through the post. The daily newspapers are distributed by runners, rail, and other methods. I urge the Postmaster-General to reconsider this matter. Papers like The Bulletin have to compete with similar publications-from overseas, and they have not the benefit of a protective duty. They find themselves very much burdened by all these additional charges. It is proposed to increase the bulk postage rate by 25 per cent., to impose-a duty of f l a ton on newsprint, and a primage tax of 2-Jper cent. I presume that their income tax also will be increased; but after they have paid these - other charges they will have little income to tax. The big daily newspapers in Sydney propose to increase their price from Id. to LJd. from the 4th August next in consequence of these additional charges; but these other publications will not be able to increase their prices similarly, and the extra charges will have to come out of whatever profits they now make. I . take it that the Government does not wish to impose a discriminatory tax upon a certain class of newspaper. The amount at stake is small compared with the total sum that it is proposed to raise. I urge the Government to do justice to these newspapers.",20
68,Mr HAWKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Wakefield) [3.45] The Postmaster-General (Mr Lyons) argued that newspapers receive a concession totalling something like £200,000 a year, on the telegraphic rates that are charged for press messages, and that, therefore, it is not unfair to make the revenue meet the expenses of handling the distribution, through the post, of country newspapers,' which do not use press telegrams to any great extent, and which provide the only means for those who live in small townships in the country to learn when sales are to be held, and generally to keep themselves acquainted with local affairs. The honourable gentleman also said that weekly newspapers published in other than the capital cities contribute only 8 per cent, of the amount collected from the weekly press, and that their contribution to the additional £35,000 that it is proposed to raise would be very small. He further said that only nine newspapers published in country districts pay in postage more than £50 a year. I contend, however, that in the existing economic circumstances, an additional 25 per cent., even on a small postage bill, will prove a very serious matter, particularly in country districts, and will be found only as a result of further severe pinching and scraping. These newspapers may have to cut down their already restricted wages bill. It is undesirable at the present time to do anything that will have the effect of accentuating unemployment in our country districts. The outlook is far from bright in districts where the population is scattered. I understood the honourable gentleman to say that the people in the city pay as much in postage as do those in the country. He should not overlook the fact that in the city the majority of the newspapers are delivered by hand, while in the country practically every newspaper is carried through the post. I strongly support the request for a reconsideration of this matter.",21
69,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Corangamite) [3.48]. - I draw attention to the postal matter that is sent to Australia from England, to the detriment of our printers and our postal receipts. I suppose that, as is the case with me, many business men in Melbourne receive advertising communications from England at regular intervals. Last week I received a communication that I placed before the Department of Trade and Customs. I had already brought the matter tinder the notice of the Postmaster-General's Department without getting any satisfaction. It appears to me that provision to meet such cases could be made in this bill. The communication in question was enclosed in an English envelope, upon which was impressed a halfpenny stamp; but it was sent from England as if from an. address in Melbourne. The envelope contained a blotter in the form of a calendar for two or three months, and also a postcard addressed to "" The Roneo Company, Market-street, Melbourne."" The whole of this matter, which is printed in England, is carried to Australia for a halfpenny. The address on the postcard is. printed in such a way that it appears to have been done in Melbourne. I do not know whether this matter should be handled by the Department of Trade and Customs or by the Postal Department; but some investigation should be made. When such matter printed in England is carried to Australia at such a low rate it must have a detrimental effect upon those engaged in the printing trade in Australia. If similar printed matter were despatched from Melbourne to any part of - Australia, at least Id. in postage would have to be paid. I doubt whether it could be sent to England for that amount. I do not know if the difficulty could be overcome by an amendment of this bill; but I trust that the Postmaster-General (Mr Lyons) will give the matter further consideration before it reaches another place. Mr GREGORY. (Swan) [3.51] - I am opposed to all the increased rates set out in the schedule, although in the circumstances, I suppose it is useless to offer any strong opposition to the proposed additional rates on letters.",21
70,Mr GABB,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,It is popular to oppose these rates.,22
71,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"There is no necessity for the imposition of additional rates when the Government is spending mouey so extravagantly in many directions. It is amazing how some honourable members delight to support increased taxation. There does not seem to be any justification for imposing these extra rates, particularly as the postal department has for some years beeu able to provide interest on the money borrowed for new works. Residents in the city will still have their newspapers delivered at the door without having to bear any extra charge; but country residents will have to bear the extra impost. As thousands of newspapers are carried by rail, the beuefit to the department cannot be great. Seven or eight years ago an agreement was reached under which the rates for the carriage of newspapers were increased; but since that time, I do not think higher rates have been imposed. I should like the Minister to state why this additional rate which will seriously affect country readers should be imposed. I make no plea on behalf of the newspaper proprietors ; I am thinking more particularly of the people living in the country who rely upon newspapers, not only as a meansof keeping in touch with current events, but for information to assist them in the businesses or callings in which they are engaged.",22
72,Mr GABB,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,How many papers doesa man in the country receive?,22
73,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Some of them take two or three each week, and the additional rate will add to their expenditure. In order to test the feeling of the committee, I move That the words "" sixteen ounces or part of sixteen ounces "" be omitted from Part I . of theproposed schedule with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" twenty ounces."" My proposal is to substitute the rates previously in operation. In view of the additional taxation to be imposed in other directions, newspapers' should not be taxed to the extent of an additional i d . Many country residents subscribe regularly to The Bulletin, The Australasian, and to other weekly papers published in the State in which they reside, as well as local newspapers. As the additional impost is wholly unjustified, I trust that the committee will support the amendment.",22
74,Mr MORGAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Darling Downs) [3.55] - I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and to renew the protest I made when speaking to the second reading of the bill. I listened very attentively to the Minister's statement which was quite unconvincing. The proposed rate will increase the cost of newspapers and journals published incidentally in the interests of those who are living in the country, and who will have to bear the impost to a greater extent than others. The Minister said that most of the weekly newspapers are published in the city, but even if they are they are read by country residents as a means of entertainment, and to enable them to obtain the latest information concerning the businesses in which they are engaged. The Minister also stated that the weekly newspapers published in the country contributed only 8 per cent, of the total amount collected by way of postage on such newspapers published in Australia. If that is the proportion, the Government should take its hands off this little additional revenue in its endeavour duce its deficit. I submit that if there is taxation. any real necessity for additional revenue, the position could be met by reducing penditure in the department.",22
75,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Moreton) [3.59].""- I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr to Gregory). The proposed increase in the rates on newspapers will add to the hardnewspaper ships of those living in the country, who are entitled to receive this class of reading matter, which is often of an eduing up. cational and entertaining nature, at the lowest possible rate. I trust that the Minister will accede to the requests made to him on Friday last when matter was under consideration. The newspapers, on which the additional rate is to be imposed, are sent in very large numbers to the country where many of their readers live in a of semi-isolation. These people deand pend upon such publications keep them in touch with the outhope, side world, and also to assist them in adopting the most modern methods in agriculture or in whatever line of busihis ness they may be engaged. If settlement is to be increased, every facility should be given to those who are following rural pursuits. By this measure the Minister will place yet another burden on country people whose newspapers will cost them applications are made. more. The Minister stated that the number of papers affected by this increase would be small. That, it seems to is an additional reason why they might exempted altogether. Most of the city newspapers are delivered by hand. This year's budget provides for the expenditure of £4,000,000 more than the budget of 1928-29, and rather than place most of these addiconsideration. tional burdens on the people in matic, the country, the Government should try to save some of that £4,000,000. I hope that the Minister will not persist in his present attitude. The country people have had a very difficult during the last few years; many of them have suffered greatly from droughts, are now threatened with falling markets. They are entitled to be relieved of further taxation. I trust that the Minismay ter will accept the amendment of the bit of honourable member for Swan (Mr. to reGregory), and withdraw this special",23
76,Mr BAYLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Oxley) [4.3] - I hope exthat, before the Minister turns down this amendment, he will give consideration to my suggestion that he should obtain from his departmental officers a statement as the probable amount which could be saved' by an effective combing of the register. Year after year the and names of new publications are added to the list, and it is time there was a clean",23
77,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Wilmot-Postmaster General and Minister for Works) [4.4]; - The matter raised by the honourable this member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) is worthy of consideration, but it is impossible to attend to it in this bill. It is proposed, however, to bring in an amend-ment of the Post and Telegraph Act for state the correction of long-standing anomalies, in it we shall lay down definitely what to a newspaper is, and what it is not. We in this way, to be able to straighten out the tangle in which we now find our^ selves. The honourable member is right in contention. I believe that there are publications registered for transmission by post as newspapers which .should not be included in that category at all. They have been admitted because there exists a precedent, on the strength of which Sometimes, I have no doubt, this results in keeping off the list publications which have a right me, to be included. The law is somewhat be vague in this respect, and the department has to use its own judgment. The honourable member brought under the notice of the department a periodica] or newspaper for which he asked special I do not wish to be dogbut I believe that under the new scheme, allowing periodicals to be posted in bulk, the publication he mentioned may benefit. This periodical is, I admit, a most desirable one, and if it can be time to bulk postage, it ofcould included in the list newspapers entitled effect a suband stantial saving. The Government cannot accept the amendment of the honourable any member for Swan (Mr Gregory); we consider it in a couple of years' time when the finances of the country are straightened out. Honourable members opposite have reiterated statements that [di d not deal with the merits of the proposal that country newspapers should receive special consideration. Although I listened to many speeches I heard no valid argument as to why we should select one section of the community for specially favourable treatment. If I stand honourable members aright, they desire that publications, such as biweeklies, tri-weeklies and weeklies circulating in country districts should receive some special concession. The fact is, however, that daily newspapers circulate in the country just as much as do periodicals.' In my own State the dailies from Hobart and Launceston circulate right throughout the island, and are widely read by the people in the country.",23
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Well , take the extra charge off them all. We shall not object.",24
79,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"If we do that we shall get the country into the same position that the right honourable gentleman got it into when he was a member of the last Government. I point out that 41 per cent, of the revenue from newspaper postage comes from the dailies. If it is proposed to exempt the periodicals because some of the country people read them, we should also exempt the dailies, because a great many country people read them too. If we look at the thing fairly and squarely we must recognize that all should be treated alike. One thing has impressed me about the argument of honourable members opposite: they are so all-embracing. First they say that the increased postage ou periodicals will be an additional heavy burden on country people, and for that reason should not be imposed. Then, a little later, they argue that, the Postmaster-General having pointed out that the burden will not be so very heavy .after all, it might as well be taken off altogether, because it will not matter much anyway. I am not a bit enthusiastic about imposing increased burdens on any one. If I could avoid it I would. I cannot accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr. Morgan) because it is not worthwhile for the small amount involved to upset the whole organization of the department. It concerns only a small section, and involves only a small amount. Otherwise, I might be prepared to consider his proposal. The same honourable member suggested that the extra charges would be unnecessary if we were to effect economies in the department. It is easy enough to say that, but I maintain that there is no other department under the control of the Commonwealth Government in which undergreater care has been taken to effect economies. That does not apply to the regime of any particular government. Before the present Government came into office the administration of the department was carefully investigated, and every pound spent was checked. That process is going on today, and fresh efforts are being made to effect economies.",24
80,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,What profit is the department budgeting for this year ?,24
81,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"We are going to make a profit, I hope. If we do not the Treasurer is going to experience a loss. One difficulty with which we are confronted is that when we attempt to exercise economy honourable members come along individually and plead that this or that must not be cut out, but that, on the contrary, we should grant something more. I know that, generally speaking, they have a good case, and I regret that.we must refuse their requests. We are constantly turning down recommendations which, from a business point of view, it might be wise to accept, but we do it because we are under the necessity of avoiding extra expenditure. The department cannot be charged with failing to exercise the fullest measure of economy,. I should be glad to know what particular activity of the Postal Department could be cut out in order to save money.",24
82,Mr MORGAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"It would be possible to make a 10 per cent, cut in salaries.",24
83,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That can be discussed during the budget debate. The honourable member's suggestion is an old Tory proposal, but surely it has nothing to do with the bill now before us, which deals with the postage rates.",24
84,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Henty) [4.10] - I cannot agree with the Postmaster General (Mr Lyons) that to make a reduction in favour of weekly and other periodical newspapers would be to discriminate in their favour as compared with daily newspapers. On the contrary, to leave the postage rates as they are set out in the bill appears to me to be discriminating against weekly and other periodical newspapers. Despite what the Minister has told us, I think he will agree that the proportion of weekly newspapers posted is far larger than that of daily newspapers.",24
85,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The post office handles 41 per cent, in each case.",25
86,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That sounds fairly convincing, I admit. I think, however, that this is a concession which the Postmaster-General might have been prepared to accept. The amount involved is not very large. I was rather surprised to find honourable members opposite, who represent country districts, remaining silent during this debate. Although one would have expected them to join in the protest against this increase, they have sat silent, uttering no protest against this most discriminating form of taxation upon country interests. ""We are well accustomed to this silence by now.",25
87,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Order !,25
88,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I am endeavouring to get a little support for our case, and I do not know any other way in which to go about it. However, I shall not detain the committee. We are engaged once more in a forlorn hope against the big battalions opposite, but I again remind the committee how, a bill of this kind, one of the new taxation measures, brings home to us the price we have to pay for the Government's fiscal policy. There is an axiom in taxation that an old tax is a good tax, and so it was, to large extent, with the customs revenue. The Government has now wantonly discarded millions of customs revenue in pursuit of its new fanatical tariff policy, and one of the immediate results of 'the loss of that old tax, which was a good tax, because we were accommodated to it, is this great welter of taxation upon newspapers. As the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has pointed out, there is a new customs duty on newsprint; there is also a primage duty to be paid by the newspapers, and I take it that they will also have to pay the proposed sales tax. There is also this increased postage. All this comes upon the newspapers at a time when we know that there has been a big falling off in their advertising revenue. It is just an example of how exceedingly short sighted and ill-considered it was for the Government to engage in this great fiscal change involving the shifting of the incidence of taxation at a period of unparalleled depression in Australia. Dislocation is widespread. I do not wonder that the immediate result of the Government's policy is the announcement that the old Sydney Morning Herald will be compelled to increase its price from Id . to l£d. The seriousness of it is that if the example of the Sydney Morning Herald is followed, as I assume it will be, by other Sydney newspapers, it means a tax of from 3d. to 6d. a week on the basic wage, and that tax spread over the State of New South Wales will run into a huge sum of money. It will penalize industry very heavily, and can only be reflected in increased cost of living and increased cost of production. However inevitable this new form of taxation may be, it is to be deplored, and the Government is to be condemned for not having foreseen the evil consequences of its tariff policy. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [4.15] - ] support the clause. I have listened with amusement to the remarks of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). He is rather surprised at the silence of ministerial members, and is particularly concerned at the silence of honourable members of the Labour party who represent country constituencies, and their disregard for the unfortunate position in a very which, he says, the country press will be placed. He, like the honourable, member for Moreton (Mr Francis) has made a very touching appeal on behalf of the country press. If honourable members on the ministerial side are silent, honourable members-opposite could not but help being silent .after the statement made by the Postmaster General (Mr Lyons), that the Postal Department was losing £200,000 a year on the press telegraph service. At any rate, none rose to urge that the department, should be made 'to pay, because honourable members opposite cannot afford to antagonize those who so loyally come to their heels at election time, and indulge in lying propaganda to the detriment of the Labour party. To honourable members opposite it seems quite all right that, at a time like this, when we are experiencing a period of financial stress, the press telegraph service should continue to be rendered by the Postal Department at a loss approaching £300,000 a year. It is true that the Postmaster-General 3poke of £200,000 as being the loss, but a few years ago, when the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) supported the late Government, the loss on that one item alone was £270,000. When it came to a question of the disposal of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, honourable members opposite held up their hands in. horror, and said that the loss which was being made by that line of steamers should not continue - that the country could not afford it they allowed the loss on the press telegraph service to continue. They now talk about effecting economies in the Postal Department. Has any one of them suggested that the charges for press telegrams should be reviewed? latest report of the Post and Telegraph Department shows that the loss on the telegraph branch of the department last year was £224,000. There is no justification for continuing that loss. One would naturally expect to find men who are always harping upon non-paying services and the necessity for economy urging that this particular non-paying proposition should be cut out.",25
89,Dr EARLE PAGE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Why does not the Postmaster-General cut it out? Mr C. RILEY - I regret that there has been a serious omission in that regard in this bill; but the Postmaster-General has foreshadowed another bill which, I feel sure, will deal with the substantial loss which is now being borne by the people in connection with the telegraph service. I do not believe in the people being called upon to subsidize this service; but that is what they are doing in regard to press telegrams. It is notified in the Sydney press today that the price of newspapers is to be increased from Id. to l^d., simply because the proprietors of the newspapers are now being called upon to pay more for their newsprint. It is said that the increase in newspaper prices is due to the recently imposed duty of £1 per ton on newsprint. The wealthy newspaper proprietors will as a result of the new t charges, collect £14 for every ton of newsprint used by them, as against an expenditure of £1 a ton that they will be called upon to meet. If they propose to force the people to pay more for their papers, there is no reason why the people should continue an unprofitable telegraph service on behalf of the newspaper proprietors. The people of Cook, whom I have the privilege to represent, may despatch .telegrams in case of illness, accident, or death, and may occasionally post letters. Whatever service is rendered to them is paid for by them, and the same should be done by the newspaper proprietors-thes e huge mergers about which the honourable member for Henty ; yet (Mr Gullett) talks whenever he has an opportunity to do so. We should closely scrutinize all non-paying services in these days. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan) has no suggestion to offer to enable the Government to balance the accounts of this department The except that the wages of the employees should be reduced. I trust that the Postmaster-General (Mr Lyons) will lose no time in introducing a bill to provide for an increase in press telegraphic rates so that our wealthy newspapers, and noi the workers of this couutry, will pay foj this service.",26
90,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Darwin) [4.21] - I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), if it will lead to discrimination between weekly and daily newspapers, and will adversely affect people who live in the country. Our daily newspapers, as well as weekly publications, are delivered through the post in most country districts. The Postal Department has rendered an extraordinarily good servicf in this respect in recent years, and this has been advantageous, not only to the people, but also to the newspaper proprietors. This bill was introduced prematurely; it should not have been, submitted to us until after the debate on the budget. It seems to be inevitable that increased taxation will be imposed upon the people, but I am antagonistic to the use of the Postal Department as a taxing agency. In recent years, every effort has' been made to make this big public utility self-contained, and it is regrettable that there should be any departure from that policy. The service rendered to the public by the Postal Department is greatly appreciated. If there was any necessity to increase the charges on newspapers to make that branch of the service payable, I should not have objected to them being made; but I do not think it is proper to increase charges solely to - swell the general revenue.",26
91,Dr EARLE PAGE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,The honourable member appears to be under a misapprehension as to the object of the amendment; it provides only that the old rates shall apply to newspapers-bot h city and country newspapers.,27
92,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,My amendment does not discriminate in any way.,27
93,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"If that is. so, I am under a misapprehension. I understood the Postmaster-General (Mr Lyons) to say that the amendment would lead to discrimination.",27
94,Dr EARLE PAGE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Cowper) [4.25] A misunderstanding seems to have arisen in connection with this amendment. All that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) is seeking to do is to substitute for the language of the bill, the wording of the present act.

The speech of the Postmaster-General seems to have misled some honourable members.",27

96,Dr EARLE PAGE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I hope that the amendment will be agreed to, for it does not seek to discriminate in any way whatever. It is true, of course, that the country people will be the hardest hit by the passage of this bill, but that is because their newspapers are nearly all delivered through the post, whereas the newspapers of the city dwellers are ordinarily distributed by hand or some method other than posting.",27
97,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Swan) [4.28] - I wish to make it quite clear that there is no suggestion of discrimination in my amendment. It is very well known, as the Leader of the Country party (Dr* Earle Page) has said, that, the country people usually receive their newspapers through the post. If they want the Australasian, the Bulletin, or any other periodical, they order it direct and so have to pay postage on it. The Postmaster-General should have advanced some substantial reason for this increase, but he has not done so. I hope even yet that the Government will reconsider the whole matter. Many people in the country subscribe for two, three or even four newspapers a week-the y like to get the journals that specialize in particular subjects-and the extra postal charges that it is now proposed to fix will hit them fairly heavily. It is intended to increase the postal rate for letters to 2d. per oz. That will undoubtedly cause a reduction in the number of letters posted. We have always found that low postal rates mean bigger business for the Department.",27

100,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Adelaide) Whereas there has been a change in the rate for newspapers reducing weight from 20 to 16 oz. for 1-Jd., the increase on second-class matter, which includes business catalogues, commercial papers, patterns and samples, amounts to 100 per cent., the rate having been altered from I d . for 4 oz. to I d . for 2 oz. That will f all particularly heavily upon businesses that have a large country order trade. I have received the following appeal from such a business firm in Adelaide:Dear Sir, We sent you the following telegram this morning, which wo hereby confirm:Why is postage on second-class matter increased 100 per cent, when letter postage increased only 33 per cent. Increased catalogue postage terribly serious. Please try adjust. Penny for three ounces would help tremendously. This telegram practically explains itself. When we knew that the postage was to be increased from l i d . to 2d. it was quite bad enough, but when we found by this morning's paper that the postage on second-class matter NOES. was to be increased from Id. for every four ounces to Id. for every two ounces we were astounded and we fail to understand why the increase of 100 per cent, is justified. We might mention that last year we posted 150,000 catalogues, all of which were over two ounces, and you can therefore see at » glance what the increased cost is going to mean to us, not to speak of all the other firms throughout Australia posting large quantities of catalogues. Our suggestion is that you try and get this altered to Id. for every PAIBS. three ounces, which would be just about th* same proportion as the letter increase. We trust you will take this matter up very seriously and do your best to get it altered. We would also point out that if it is not altered it will mean the practical closing down of our country order department, with a subsequent big loss to the post office. This step would also mean the dismissal of some fifteen to twenty assistants in the mail order department, as it would be practically impossible to carry this huge extra surcharge. By giving this matter your best attention you will oblige. 1 suggest to the Minister that this firm's request might be met, and the rate altered from I d . for 4 oz. to I d . for 3 oz., instead of 2 oz. That is a reasonable proposal.",28
101,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I pointed out, in the honourable member's absence, that an international agreement exists that the unit shall be 2 oz., so. that it must be either 2 or 4 oz.",28
102,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I do not wish to ask [4.36] - for what is impossible, but the imposition will impose a tremendous hardship on the firms such as the one that I have quoted. It will curtail their country order business and hamper trade. It is doubtful whether they could or would desire to add the additional cost to their goods. The imposition will f all particularly heavily upon country people, who rely largely upon the mail order business to replenish their supplies of clothing and so forth . I can quite understand the Minister being firm in his attitude with regard to the alteration in bulk postage weights OD newspapers from 20 to 16 oz. for l£d. In our present straightened circumstances that is a fair thing, but I believe that his 100 per cent, increase on second-class mail matter is too heavy. I had hoped that it would be possible to meet these people by making the weight 3 oz. instead of 2 oz. and suggest that at the next international postal conference, an effort be made to alter the basis of the unit.",28
103,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"If the honourable member's request were acceded to there would be one unit for overseas and one for local postages, which would greatly complicate and inconvenience the work of the Department.",29
104,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,So that it is not impossible ?,29
105,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,It is really impracticable.,29
106,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,I hardly accept that statement as freely as I did the previous one that it would involve international postal complications. If it is merely a matter of departmental arrangement the difficulty could be overcome.,29
107,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,It would be very difficult to do so.,29
108,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The honourable gentleman proposes to confront these business people with an even greater difficulty. I submit that the extra revenue that would be derived, would justify the employment of additional postal assistants. If that is not done, it will practically mean the closing down of the mail order department of many big concerns, with a consequent falling off in postal revenue.",29
109,Mr LACEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Will not all postal order businesses be on the same footing? Mr YATES.'-Eirm s such as the one that I have referred to rely to a great extent on their postal business. However, I leave it to the judgment of the Postmaster-General to determine whether it is not possible to give effect to the request that the weight should be 3 instead of 2 oz. for Id. I know that it will receive the consideration of himself and his Department.",29
110,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Warringah) [4.46] - I support the views expressed by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), but I further urge the Minister to revert to the old arrangement, and move That the words "" two ounces or part of two ounces "" be omitted from Part II . of posed schedule with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" four ounces or part of four ounces."" The schedule in the principal act contains the words "" wholly set up and printed in Australia"", so that special concessions might be given to periodicals, catalogues aud other printed matter produced in this country. For some reason this Government has eliminated those words and withdrawn that concession to local industry. The Minister has not explained the reason for that action. Apparently it is the intention of the Government to give no assistance to that branch of the local printing trade. Large emporiums usually have a very considerable country order business, and publish and circulate very ornate and expensive catalogues. Not only do those catalogues entail a good deal of printing, but they also give work to many engaged on photographic processing, etching, the manufacture of blocks, and so forth. Some catalogues contain as many as 34 to 36 pages, and are printed in several colours. In conformity with the general excellence of the work, these catalogues are printed on high-class art paper, which is considerably heavier than ordinary paper. This 100 per cent, increase in the postal rates of catalogues will cause firms to restrict their output of such literature, which will mean a corresponding decrease in employment in the various trades that I have mentioned, and a reduction in the post office revenue. I do not know what revenue the Postmaster-General expects to receive from these increased rates on catalogues and commercial papers; but I suggest that unless he expects a considerably increased amount, it would be better to keep men employed than to impose rates, the results of which, after all, is only problematical. The increased rates will seriously affect the mail order departments of the various emporiums throughout Australia. The reduction in the volume of their business will counterbalance any additional revenue which may be derived from the increased rates, so that the net gain to the department will be little, if any. The printing of catalogues forms a considerable proportion of the business of many printing establishments, and any reduction in the volume of the work must necessarily the proaffect the unemployment market. I do not know why the words "" wholly set up and printed in Australia "" have been deleted.",29
111,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,They do not mean anything.,29
112,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES," It would appear, that while the Government is penalizing the Australian printing industry,"" it will allow catalogues printed overseas to enter this country subject only to a 2 i per cent, primage duty.

Moreover, the imposition of these higher rates must throw additional workers out of employment, both in the printing trade and in the mail order departments of various city firms, because any restriction of the use of catalogues must result in a falling off in country orders. Many firms now do a large volume of trade through their mail order departments. If that trade is interfered with, further unemployment must result. Housewives in the country have to depend a great deal'on the illustrations and other particulars shown in these catalogues when ordering goods. The increased rates will place them at a disadvantage.",30

117,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Most country firms have conveyances - travelling with their goods, so that they will not be affected by the increased postage rates. In view of the very small additional revenue likely to be derived, it does not seem worthwhile to run the risk of throwing additional men and women out of employment. The relief to country stores will be very little, if any. I regret that the post office is to be made a taxing machine. What sum does the Minister hope to realise from this particular increase in postal rates?",30
118,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,The items cannot easily be separated.,30

If it can be shown that his suggestion is practicable, I am prepared to have the necessary amendment made in another place.",30
123,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That satisfies me.,30
124,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I cannot agree to the suggestion of the honourable member for Warringah, that there should be no increase in the rates on this class of postal matter. It would be wrong to leave out this section when increasing postal rates generally. The argument used by honourable members in opposition to the Government's proposals could be used in connection with practically any proposal to increase charges. I do not anticipate that the gloomy predictions of honourable members will be realized. It may be that, because the rates of postage on catalogues and similar publications have been based on a unit of 4 oz., such catalogues are bigger than is necessary. Smaller catalogues . might be just as effective. Mr AECHDAL E PARKHILL - Smalle r catalogues would mean less printing.",30
125,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"It is possible that there will be no reduction at all in the size of the catalogues issued by city firms. Their catalogues now reach a certain standard, and they may decide to make no alteration. It must be remembered that these catalogues are not sent to housewives merely to entertain them: they are Sent as an advertising proposition. Hitherto, catalogues have been carried by the post office at a loss, from which the big city firms have benefited. I am surprised that members country constituencies, who had so much to say about a previous proposal, should now be concerned about the big city emporiums to the detriment of the outback country traders, one lionorable member put it , have to hawk their goods to effect sales. The new rates will benefit traders living in the country. Even if there should be a f a l ling off of employment in the mail order departments of big city firms, there will be a corresponding benefit to country traders.",31

128,Mr LYONS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The Government knows fairl y well what additional revenue it will derive from its proposal as a whole, although it is difficult to separate the items. The important'point is that the Government must, get additional revenue. The new rates will have that result. The honourable member for Warringah objected to the deletion of the words "" wholly set up and printed in Australia "". The existing rate for catalogues wholly set up and printed in Australia is Id. for every 4 oz. or part thereof. The rate for printed papers is the same.

131,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Henty) [5.6] - Mr . Speaker [Quorum formed.] This measure provides for the payment of a bounty on flax or linseed of 15 per cent. of its market value from the 1st March, 1930, to the 29th February, 1932; of 10 per cent, from the 1st March, 1932, to the 2Sth February, 1934; and of 7$ per cent, from the 1st March, 1934, to the 28th February, 1935. I am opposed to it . In the first place I think this is no time to increase taxation unnecessarily, and further, I am opposed to these two bounties even on the merits of the case, as presented by the Assistant Minister (Mr Forde). The cultivation of flax and the manufacture of linen are two of the oldest industries known to civilization. There is evidence of the growth and domestic use of flax fibre as far back as 5,000 years. Egyptian mummies have been found in tombs clothed with linen of the finest quality made some 2,000 years before Christ. There are many references in the Old Testament to the production of flax and the use of linen. For instance, the Book of Exodus, referring to the plague of hail, states that the flax and barley were smitten, and in Proverbs, a virtuous wife is thus describedHer price is above rubies. . . . She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands. . . . She layeth her hande to the spindle aud her hands hold the distalt'. . . . She maketh fine linen. Flax has been produced in practically every civilized country in the world, but never has any couutry that I know of, with the exception of Australia, in normal times paid a bounty on its production. This is but another commentary, first of all, on the cost of production, and, secondly, upon the policy, which has run mad in Australia, of Parliament granting practically every request made by industry for subsidies. The flax industry is not new in Australia. I u Victoria, flax has been grown in a small way for some 40 years. The cultivation and production of flax was carried on for some year3 in Tasmania. It is remarkable that the industry has never prospered, or expanded. The proposal for a bounty in this instance is not good. As a matter of fact, a bounty equivalent to the one now proposed-takin g into consideration the high cost of production today-wa s granted by this Parliament in 1907, and continued for ten years. The proposed bounty is on a sliding scale, beginning at 15 per cent, this year and decreasing to 7-J per cent, in 1935. The old bounty was at a flat rate of 10 per cent. At that timeall costs in this country were lower than they are today, and that grant actually had a higher purchasing power than the bounty proposed under this bill. The old bounty absolutely failed to encourage and prosper the production of flax fibre in Australia. It was limited to a period of ten years from 1907 to 1917. The sum of £13,000 was available each year to the industry, but in no year was that amount paid. Other difficulties attending the flax industry in Australia are the relative unprofitableness of production here, and the positive unpopularity of this rural industry among our farmers. Towards the end of the war, in 1917 or 191S, the Imperial Government, finding its great supplies of flax fibre cut off from Russia, and requiring large quantities of linen for aeroplane manufacture, appealed to the Empire generally to endeavour to produce flax fibre. That led to a series of bounties being offered in various parts of the Empire. In Australia, the Government guaranteed £5 a ton for flax as cut in the paddocks and delivered to the factories. Afterwards, bounty was increased to £6 a ifr. Gullett. ton. The industry was subsidized in Canada for some time, and also in New Zealand and Kenya, East Africa. That was continued until about 1922. The proposed bounty is to continue from Atarch of this year to February, 1935. The intention is to encourage the farmer* to produce flax, and to encourage capital to take up the manufacture of various types of linen and other products of flax fibre. If this is an honest bill, the financial assistance will end in 1935. It is proposed that the flax and linseed manufacturers are to pay the farmers £5 a ton for the flax that they produce and deliver to the factories. A similar amount was .paid under the war-time special grants, buT immediately that was withdrawn, flax production practically ceased, not only in this country, but also in England, Kenya, Ireland, and Canada. Therefore it is a fair anticipation that immediately the proposed bounty is withdrawn in 1935, this industry, which we are bringing into artificial existence, will once more collapse. The taxpayers' money will have been wasted, the farmers will have been fooled, and a good deal of capital invested in the various factories will have been lost. In England, under the war-time bounty system, there were, in 191S, 13,000 acres under flax, and in 1924, only 600 acres. In Ireland, there were, in 191S, 143,000 acres under flax, and, in 1925, only 50,000. In Kenya there were, in 1920-21, 25,000 acres under flax, and only 500 acres in 1925. In Canada, the number of acres under cultivation was 31,000 in 1920, and only 6,000 in 1925. It is therefore evident that in those white-labour countries the industry failed when the bounty was withdrawn. The production of flax is a peasant industry, and will not sustain the Australian standard of living. Because of that, it has failed, and will continue to fail. We are endeavouring, under this bill, to produce extensively in Australia, by means of subsidy from the Treasury, an article that is cheaply produced elsewhere and which it would pay industry in this country a thousand times over, to continue to purchase abroad. the The Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Eorde) has quoted a good deal from the Tariff Board's report. To mo, LI lis a lhost unsatisfactory report, bfcCiiiioe it. discloses an entirely inadequate investigation into the industry. The :repon is also most contradictory, and has been a,most entirely ignored by the Assistant Minister. There is one safeguard in it which-he has tossed aside. To give the committee some idea of the unsatisfactory nature of this report, I shall quote a few of its passages. The question was put to the Tariff Board whether there was, in Australia, sumcient land of the right quality for the production of our requirements in linseed and flax fibre. The board has estimated in its report that Australia's requirements of fibre amount to 1,370 tons a year, and of linseed to 22,300 tonsa year. It says that it is necessary to have 450,000 acres of country suitable for flax production to cope with those requirements, the assumption being that it is grown as a rotation crop and planted on the same land every three years. It then proceeds to show that this area is available. The evidence obtained from the different States proves what a sloppy investigation was ninae, and also what a sloppy report this is. The chief agricultural instructor, Department of Agriculture, New South Wales, showed in his evidence that most exhaustive tests of flax cultivation had been made in New South Wales. He saidThose lusts have been carried out for the growing nf (lax for linseed, and from the results, the department, although anxious to promote and encourage the cultivation, is forced to the conclusion that it cannot confidently recommend linseed culture in the States »s a profitable proposition. efforts were made by the department in the year 1918-19, and trials were made at 25 localities in the State in 1918, and 41 in 1919 under the supervision of the district agricultural inspector, and whereas the wheat crop was a. success in every instance, the flax crop practically failed. Although experiments are Mill bniug carried on, the prospects of its - iuccessfiil cultivation in the State are not encouraging. Broadly speaking, the State of New South Wales contains every class of country that is to be found in Victoria. Tasmania, or South Australia. Yet. according to the evidence given by Mr. Patrick Rvan, there are in Victoria 100,000 acres af land suitable for the growing of flax. That is just a vague assertion, and it is not backed up by [156] facts. But still more extraordinary is the evidence of Mr J. Moore-Robinson, who is interested in a flax factory in Tasmania. In his evidence^ he estimated that, in Tasmania alone, there are 180,000 acres of land available for flax cultivation; but he, too, did not, bring forward any facts to prove the accuracy of his statement. The evidence relating to the land that is available in South Australia is the most extraordinary of all. The report of the Tariff .Board in this connection readsProfessor A. J. Perkins, of the Department, of Agriculture, Adelaide, stated that, although there were 3(>7,00O acres of land suitable for. the growing of flax in South Australia",31
132,Mr LATHAM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That land is alreadybeing used for the growing of more remunerative crops.,33
133,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That is pointed our in the report, which saysthese areas are at the present under other types of crops, and that before these othur crops can be displaced by flax to any important degree, it will be necessary to show very clearly that flax is likely to prove a more remunerative crop that those at present grown on the land. My object in quoting from this evidence is to indicate the extraordinarily indefinite and inconclusive nature of the report. I had it before me when I was in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs last year. I then formed the opinion, and I did not hold it alone, that this is one of the Tariff Board's most unconvincing efforts. The only semblance of merit in the report lies in the fact that the recommendation of the board is Special very closely conditioned. That condition, however, has been entirely ignored by the Assistant Minister. On page 17. leading up to its recommendations, the board says The Tariff Board is of opinion that Governmental assistance to the industry at present, in the face of the earlier history already referred to, would only be justifiable if it could be governed by conditions which would assuri' that no bounty would be payable, unless an appreciable percentage of Australian requiiv mcnts were produced. It appears to the Board that the granting of a bounty of the nature applied for by tin? Tasmanian company might merely result in increased confidence of investors and consequent assistance in the flotation of the company, and the selling of shares. If it yielded no greater results than the earlier efforts, the money would be wasted. The granting of the bonus requested by the Drysdale concern would, obviously, be a "" leap in the dark,"" as there is no dennite evidence at present that the machines, the subject of the application, will prove efficient in the treatment of fibre. The request for the advancement of money on the security of the crop has no merit. The Board is prepared to recommend the payment of a substantial bounty, both on production of fibre and seed, but proposes to impose conditions that no bounty should be payable until the combined efforts of the ducers in the Commonwealth result in the production in Australia of an aggregate quantity of fibre, and of seed equal to not less than one-fifth of Australia's requirements as estimated in this report, namely, the requirements of 22,300 tons of seed and 1,370 tons of fibre. In other words, the Tariff Board lays down that, before any bounty is paid, production should equal something like 4,000 tons of seed and 300 tons of fibre. That condition, as I have said, has been set aside by the Assistant Minister. wishes this House to consent ment of the proposed bounty unconditionally. All that honourable members, and the people generally, know for a cermen; tainty is that taxation will be increased at a most ill-chosen time. There is no guarantee that the payment of the bounty when prepared will lead to the establishment of the flaxessential growing industry in Australia. Even if ' the report of the board had been followed, I should still have been opposed to the proposal; but without the condition has been laid down, it savours very strongly of straight-out electioneering. Where is flax grown at the present time? It is grown at Drysdale, in the Corio electorate, and in two or three Tasmanian happen. electorates that are represented by honwill orable members who sit opposite. It a case of "" Bendigo "" over again. Such a proposal is particularly deplorable unfortunate in the present state of finances, and it should not have been country. brought forward. I am opposed to the bill, first, because I do not think that we should be paying any bounties at the present time unless the case made out for one is overwhelmraw ing, and the industry concerned is big and of first class importance. As we cost, know, this is not a white man's tected industry. The separation of the flax fibre from the stem is one of the dirtiest and most miserable jobs unmaterials Mr Gullett. dertaken by mankind anywhere in the world. It is an occupation that is not suitable for the Australian standard of living, and it will never sustain that standard unless it is heavily subsidized. Secondly, I oppose the bill on the ground that this is an electioneering proposal. I appeal to the House to consider the effect that it will have upon Australian industry generally. I should pro- like honourable members to reflect upon the great number of industries whose costs inevitably will be increased if this measure becomes law. Let us take the Assistant Minister's own list of commodities in which flax fibre is either the main staple or it is to be found in part, even though the that list is not in any sense an exhaustive one. Between the coarsest material and the finest linen, the uses of flax fibre in one form or another, are almost innuHe merable. The honourable gentleman mento the paytioned the following:Linen thread for tailors' and bootmakers' use; thread for embroidery; twine for harness-mounting, lines and nets for fisherand all kinds of cords and ropes. He went on to sayIn the manufacture of woven goods, flax, and spun into yarns, is the fabric of lawns, cambrics, handkerchiefs, canvasses, pillow-cases, sheets, linens, aprons, shirtings, collars, surgical bandages, hollands, crashes, and similar materials. that I put it to honourable members opposite particularly, shall we do the wise thing if we increase the cost of the raw material required for the manufacture of those commodities? We know what will For a few years the bounty be paid out of Consolidated Revenue. is Then prohibitive duties will be imposed on the articles I have enumerated, or on and the raw material that comes in as flax our fibre, and has to be made up in this In the main there are two distinct, profitable, and laudable types of manufacture in this country. The first type of manufacture is that in which our own material is used. When such raw material can be produced at a reasonable that is a most desirable form of proindustry. There are many classes of manufacture at present carried on in Australia, in which imported raw are used, and which are of great value to the Commonwealth as they provide employment for a large number of persons and great sums of money. For instance, we import crude rubber, but the balance of the work associated with the manufacture of the finished article is done in this country. ""We are all very proud of our rubber manufacturing achievements in Australia, but the time may not be far distant when it will be considered that we should not import even crude rubber. If this craze for producing all our raw material develops to any extent an attempt will be made to produce rubber in hot-houses in Australia. Surely the people of Australia are entitled to obtain some of the cheap products from other countries. There is no reason why the Government should pursue its objective to an unreasonable extent and in endeavouring to assist the production of everything, constantly increase the cost of living to the community. It would pay Australia infinitely better to purchase its flax fibre, the people. and in some cases the finished articles, instead of trying to produce everything in Australia. Mr C. EILEY -""What articles?",33

If the Govern The ment persists in its present policy of ing a bounty, flax fibre in Australia will be very expensive, and the cost of the materials required in dozens of manufacmillions turing industries will be heavily creased. The price level must be reflected in the cost of the goods in which flax is used, and the cost of living proportionI ately increased. The Assistant Minister has left no doubt in the minds of honormately able members as to his intentions. He said that in 1928-29 we imported flax products to the value of approxinecessary mately £1,000,000, and he wishes to develop the flax fibre industry in for order to protect the industry to that extent, regardless of the cost. should this burden be placed upon the payers ?

139,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I believe still more in supporting those already establishedthose which are of service to the community ; but I am strongly opposed to the payment of a bounty to assist every possible industry that may be suggested, especially when, by so doing we place an additional burden upon I understand that what is known as water retting is loathsome work, and thai prior to the war the bulk of the world's requirements in flax was produced in Bussia. I do not think there is another country in the world the standard of living is anything approaching our own in which the retting and of flax is undertaken. There is One aspect of this matter, however, which is w.orthy of consideration and which I commend to the attention of the Assistant Minister. growing of flax for the production payof linseed could possibly be undertaken with fairly satisfactory' results in Australia. In the United States of America of acres of land are used infor growing flax for the production of linseed, but in that country the fibre side of the industry is left severely alone. n Canada, according to the latest figures which I have been able to obtain, approxione million acres are under cultivation for the production of linseed. In those countries it has not been found for the government to subsidize the industry in any way. Flax growing linseed has been found very profitable when undertaken as a mixed farming Why proposition under the rotation system. taxThe Tariff Board's report on the possibilities of this industry is most It does not even touch the fringe of the problem. For a period of ten years after 1907 when production costs were cheaper than they are today, a substantial bounty was paid, but the results were anything but satisfactory. Then we had a wartime bounty, but immediately it was withdrawn the industry practically vanished. The Tariff Board's report provides the House with very little dennite information concerning the industry, particularly as to the area of land suitable for the purpose, or as to the cost of production.",35
140,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,The industry is languishing in New Zealand where flax ought to grow more satisfactorily than in Australia.,36
141,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Yes , it has fizzled out in New Zealand.",36
142,Mr FOEDU,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,But quite a different type of flax is grown in New Zealand.,36
143,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"We have already bad a lecture from the Assistant, Minister concerning the type of flax which is grown in New Zealand. We all know that the New Zealand flax is totally different from that on which it is proposed to pay a bounty here. I have quoted the position in a number of other countries and have shown that even where the conditions are more favourable than they are in Australia the results have been unsatisfactory. Immediately the assistance which Was given during the wartime period was withdrawn the industry collapsed, and if this bounty is not continued a high tariff will be imposed to protect the industry. The Government should delay the passage of this measure and take the earliest opportunity to gain information on the - productiou of flax in other countries where it is grown in large quantities, either for fibre or for linseed. I suggest that the Government should arrange with an experienced person with a knowledge of mixed farming who intends visiting other countries to conduct an investigation into the whole industry. The cost would not be great; such a person would do the work if part of his travelling expenses were paid or for a suitable fee. Mr C. RILEY - Why did not Government of which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a member do that?",36
144,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That Government did not submit such a proposition as this. It is not the responsibility of a government to subsidize every tin-pot industry that may be brought under its notice by some interested person. If this measure is not passed i : will not inflict hardship upon an^ one. The quantity of flax grown in Australia is only nominal, and there is not a single farming district in Australia that would be any poorer if this measure were not passed. This is a most unfortunate measure. Its only merit even during a period of prosperity would be in relation to the production of linseed. If the Government wishes to assist the industry it should arrange for an independent expert to conduct an investigation in other countries, where flax production is profitably carried on without governmental assistance, before asking the taxpayers of Australia to contribute towards an industry which, on the information placed before ns, is not worthy of our support.",36
145,Mr FROST,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Franklin) [5.58] - I am very pleased to support this proposal for the payment of a bounty on the production of flax which has been so strongly advocated by the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde). I am at a loss to understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) should be so strongly opposed to what he terras "" this tinpot"" industry. The flax industry is worthy of our support. Flax products to the value of £1,500,000 are annually imported into Australia. It has already been demonstrated that flax can be successfully grown here, and if the industry is firmly established it will be the means of providing employment for a large number of persons. Large areas of land suitable for the production of flax are available in Australia, and in Tasmania alone, 1S0,000 acres can be made available for this purpose. In consequence of the introduction of motor transport, the demand for hay and chaff has considerably diminished, and those who, in the past, have been engaged in producing fodder could, if this industry were established, devote their attention to the the production of flax and other crops. This crop needs a great deal of cultivation, and is most satisfactorily grown on good land. Moreover, it is a good crop to be grown in rotation with others, because the be3t results are obtained bygrowing it on the same ground only once in six years.",36
146,Mr STEWART,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Why is that?,37
147,Mr FROST,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,It has been found by experience that one crop of flax will not do well immediately after another.,37

For years past efforts have been made to put it on a proper footing in Tasmania, but no assistance has been given by the Government, ft has been proved that flax can be grown - satisfactorily. It is especially desirable that the industry should be encouraged in Tasmania because it will furnish employment, for many people. We know that young men leave Tasmania in considerable numbers every year because there is nothing there for them to do. In past yfars they came to the mainland, but even that avenue is closed to them now because r hings are so bad here.

151,Mr FROST,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Can the honourable member suggest anything better? In order to jupply the whole of Australia's requirements for flax it will be necessary to sow «0,000 acres.",37
152,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Wit h such a magnifi-«nt market why has flax not been grown - N-tensively before?,37
153,Mr FROST,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"For the expenditure of f.15,000 or £20,000 a year by way of a oounty we shall be able to develop an industry which will eventually be worth £2.000,000 a year to Australia. The » verage yield for a crop of flax is two tons to the acre. It has been stated in evidence before the Tariff Board that the cost of mltivation, solving, harvesting, carting, uid all other charges including rent, binder twine, &c, is about £4 an acre. The returns to the grower vary, of course, with r.he quality of crop. About £6 a ton is paid for the crop in the sheaf. An average crop may be regarded as equal to two tons an acre, but three tons and four tons an acre have frequently been harvested. By using better varieties it would be possible to increase the average yield beyond two tons an acre. Some varieties produce only a ton to the acre but others as much as four tons. On one property , near Latrobe £240 worth of flax was taken off fifteen acres. It is a very profitable crop. Linseed is imported into the Commonwealth to an annual value of about £750,000 a year, while canvas and linen threads worth about £1,000,000 are also imported. Those markets await us. When the industry is developed it will provide considerable extra revenue for the railways, and will furnish employment for many workers. Even from the sniall crop grown in Tasmania last year, the Tasmanian Government railways benefited to the extent of £400, and £200 was paid to carters. The establishment of factories in connection with the flax industry will involve the employment of much additional labour. In each centi-p where areas of not less than 200 acres of flax are grown there will be a deseeding and decorticating mill. These mills take the seed from the flax, ana produce fibre from the flax straw. One mill at Launceston employs about twelve men, and this year has handled about, 500 tons of flax. The seed products of these mills will be taken to a common centre in each State, and from' there the seed requirements will be dis-' fcributed to growers, and the fibres dis-. tributed to canvas mills and linen-threadfactories within the Commonwealth. One 1 company anticipates erecting three canvasmills, each designed to produce about' three different weights of canvas. The' economic aspect of this arrangement is r that flax crops produce at least six qualities of fibre, the differences being due to climatic conditions, varieties of soil, vagaries of rainfall, incidence of frosts and droughts, period of sowing, and the nature of harvesting operations. Certain qualities of fibre are most suited for strong, light-weight canvas; others are most suited for middle or heavy-weight canvas. The idea, therefore, is that suitable fibres from all over the Commonwealth will be concentrated on the mills producing canvas of the type most suitable for the fibres concerned. Each of these canvas mills will directly employ 150 persons, of whom three-fifths will be male employees. Over and above the canvas factories, there will be a linenthread mill, employing about an eqnal (amount of labour. Most of the flax grown in Tasmania is raised in the potato-growing areas, so that, instead of the land being left fallow, a crop of flax can be put in, and the return to the farmer greatly increased. I trust that this bill will be passed, because it is desirable that the industry should be established on a sound footing.  speech just delivered by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) should, I think, induce the Government to abandon this measure.' As one who has had a life-time experience in agriculture, I can understand how it is that growing has not been successful in Australia. If land, after growing a crop of flax, needs a spell of five years, the crop is not one for practical consideration.",37
154,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Who said it needed such a long spell?  ber for Franklin did. I understood him to say more than once in the course of his speech that flax could be grown on the same land only once every six years. People have been growing flax in Australia for the past 55 years, during good seasons and bad, and during times of prosperity and of depression. If it were possible to make a success of the crop, it should have been achieved during that long period; but it has not been a success. I take second place to no one in my desire to develop primary industries natural to the country; but I object to voting public money to foster an industry such as, this, above all at a time like the sent. If the Government were not satisfied that those who had attempted to grow flax in the past were proceeding on right lines, it could have co-operated with the State Governments in the conduct of experiments. Small areas of 100 acres or so should be set aside, and the land properly fallowed and fertilized. It could then be learned definitely whether or not the crop is suitable, without the expenditure of large sums of public money. This bounty bill is only fooling the people. No doubt wild-cat companies will start for the purpose of making flax products; people will be induced to put their money into them, and the whole thing will be a failure. I hope that the Government will make some attempt to conserve public money. The enterprise is doomed from the start. This flaxgrowing appears to be much on a par with wheat-growing. The average yield seems to be about 18 to 20 bushels, and it requires a rainfall of about 20 inches very a year. The crop is worth about £20 a ton, or approximately £10 an acre. Wheat yields much the same. If the flax industry cannot stand on its own feet, and needs to be bounty-fed, the burden will fall on other sections of the primary producers, who export their produce. We have been told that, through this inordinate attempt to bolster up industries that flax- cannot stand on their own feet, the exporting industries have been seriously handicapped. This will be an additional handicap upon the wheat and wool growers of Australia. I must oppose the bill.",38
155,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Darwin) [6.5] - I do not anticipate that there will be any serious opposition to this bill. It is said that it is the duty of an Opposition to oppose. I would say rather that it is the duty of an Opposition to examine critically every proposal of the Government, especially if it is a proposal to spend public funds. In his role as Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett), the honourable member for Henty, made a valiant attempt to criticize the present proposal. I cannot follow his reasoning. After saying many uncomplimentary things about the Tariff Board's report, notably that it was most unsatisfactory, he proceeded to tell us that the Minister had ignored the pre- whole report in submitting this bill.",38
156,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,I said that the one redeeming feature in the report the Minister had ignored.,38
157,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"On e would think that if the Tariff Board's report was so shocking, as the honourable member makes out, the Minister's failure to follow it should commend itself to him. At any rate, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost), who is a practical farmer, and has examined this proposal critically, has told us why he considers flax growing for fibre or linseed is likely to be a success in Tasmania, and in other States with similar soils. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that the Tariff Board has given no evidence in support of its estimate of the number of acres suitable in the several States for cultivation of flax. It is not likely that an expert would visit a district with a chain and measure it to ascertain exactly what number of acres could be used for certain cultivation, but it is an easy matter for Mr Moore-Robinson, who submitted evidence to the board, with his practical knowledge of the fitness of land for growing flax, to be able to estimate the number of acres in a certain district suitable for flax growing. His estimate of 180,000 acres in Tasmania is not an exaggeration. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also suggests that land which is capable of growing flax is now growing other crops.",38
158,Mr GUXLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Without subsidies.,39
159,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The honourable member could not say that the other crops are profitable. If he wants to know where there is any land suitable for. flax-growing, which is now producing nothing, I invite him to visit my electorate. can show him 180,000 acres of land suitable for growing flax which is now growing nothing but trees or rubbish. Whether it would be a payable proposition to develop it for the purpose of f rowing flax, I do not propose to say, but £r. Moore-Robinson's estimate of 180,000 acres applies to land in Tasmania that is or has been cultivated and is eminently suitable for growing flax. TheTe are in other States districts with similarly suitable soil. I have some practical knowledge of the subject, and I give it as my opinion that flax can profitably be produced at £5 a ton, the figure given in the Tariff Board's report, whereas there are many unprofitable crops now being produced on land capable of growing flax. Eor instance, there has been a decline in the production of hay, the reason for this being the increase in motor trausport. Hay-growing is practically at an end as a profitable industry, and we must have something to take its place. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), in his criticism of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) claims that flax cannot be grown every year on the same land. There may be some soils capable of producing the same crop year after year for a number of years, but every practical farmer knows that a rotation of crops is necessary, and it is stated by practical farmers that flax is a suitable crop for growing in rotation with potatoes, peas, and other products, now produced on soil suitable for flax-growing. We import a tremendous quantity of flax fibre and commodities produced from flax as well as linseed, and it appears to me that it is just as essential to produce in Australia those things that are needed in Australia as it is to export goods. Sufficient flax could be grown in Australia to replace the flax productswhich are imported at the present time at the rate of £1,500,000 worth per annum. There is, therefore, every prospect of the industry being developed until it becomes one of the most successful of our primary industries. It may not be a suitable crop on land which is now used for wheat-growing, but we want to utilize every variety of soil in Australia for the production of something for which each variety is suited. We should not rely on wheat and wool I alone for the prosperity of the rural districts of Australia. I differ from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) in regard to his statement that the flax-growing industry cannot be maintained in Australia at the present high costs of production.",39
160,Unknown,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,39
161,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Fla x is cultivated by methods very similar to those adopted in other important agricultural industries. The ground is prepared by means of the most up-to-date implements, the crop is harvested with machinery similar to that used for harvesting wheat, oat and hay crops, and the seed is threshed with ordinary threshing machines. Therefore, I dispute the contention that the cultivation of flax could not be economically carried out in Australia owing to the cost of labour. This bounty differs to an extent from others that have been provided by this Parliament, such as the cotton bounty. Child labour, for instance, would not be employed in this industry, nor would it necessarily involve the employment of cheap labour. Black labour or child labour might be considered desirable for the picking of cotton, but not for the cultivation or harvesting of flax. The provision of this bounty would certainly not increase the difficulties of industries, nor would it increase the cost of commodities to the community, as suggested by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). The tariff protection given to certain industries necessitates the granting of protection to others, but that objection do.es not apply to flax-growing. This bounty is definitely limited as regards both the amount and the period for which it is to be paid. It has been recommended by both the Tariff Board and the .Development and Migration Commission. Tasmania and many parts of Victoria are particularly suited for the cultivation of flax. It can be grown in Gippsland, Corio, and Wannon, in Victoria, and at Mount Gambier in South Australia. The success of the industry in Tasmania would be of special benefit to that State, which needs a greater variety of primary products than it can now grow successfully in competition with other parts of the world. I welcome this bill. I am not prepared to oppose a bill which I consider desirable 3imply because it emanates from the present Government. I shall give my support to any proposal that appears to me in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and especially of the primary producers who are deserving. I hope that my friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) will support this measure as heartily as he supported the cotton bounty. There seems to be some doubt whether cotton can be grown under Australian conditions, but it has been proved that flax can be successfully cultivated in this country. I cannot speak from first hand knowledge of the process of retting flax, but we have the evidence of the Tariff Board that this can be done by machinery. I have every confidence that the - bill will be passed without opposition.",39
162,Mr WHITE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Balaclava) [8.5] - I oppose the bill, because in my opinion this is not the time to bring forward bounty measures. This proposal would involve the Government in the payment of £20,000 a year to assist a few flaxgrowers in Tasmania., and in the electorate of Corio. There has been a serious decline in the national income, the natural other corollary of which should be reduced expenditure. The Government has brought down a budget under which it proposes to take from the community another £14,000,000 in taxation, and yet it gaily proposes to spend a large sum in assisting the flax-growers. Despite reduced expenditure in the Defence Department, the budget will involve an increase in general expenditure of over a million. Already bounties have been granted on cotton, sewing machines, and so on, without regard being had to the source fron which the money is to come. It i. essential for Australia to return to the road thai, leads to prosperity. That means that we must live so far within our incomes that we can pay from the proceeds of our exports the interest on our overseas debt, and provide a sinking fund for its liquidation. Will the payment of large bounties on industries such as flax growing lead us back to prosperity? One of the great financial authorities of Groat Britain is now visiting Australia to advise us bow best we mayextricate ourselves from the financial morass in which we are floundering. We will shortly have his opinion as to whether we can afford further bounties. The time seems to be coming when the Prime Minister will be saying in his party room, ""Stand up, any honourable member who has not yet been given a bounty"". I shall oppose any such proposal as this that impairs the financial integrity of the Commonwealth. Capricornia has a cotton bounty; West Sydney is to have u most expensive ship built for the purpose of providing work there; Bendigo is to have a sewing machine bounty. Now we are asked to give a bounty on flax to suit Corio. We all know what the honourable member for Calare (Mr. Gibbons) also led the Government into when he promised the electors in that constituency 6s. 6d. a bushel for wheat, if they would return a Labour government to office. That promise has brought grey hairs to  Moloney), who promised the farmers a guarani.ee of 4s. a bushel, and the bill which was to give effect to it was rejected by the Senate. That is one of the results of the Government's disregard of the economic conditions of the country.",40
163,Mr RIORDAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The Government that the honourable member supported promised £20,000,000 for 'housing.",41
164,Mr WHITE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I did not make that promise. I admit that in many instances bounties have assisted in the establishment of industries; but each case should be considered on its merits. The time is certainly not opportune for the expenditure proposed under this bill. The fact that Drysdale, or any other part of Corio, is suitable for the cultivation of flax, that a little of that commodity is grown in Tasmania does not warrant the Government in assisting the industry with a bounty. Is there any honourable member who knows of further industries that the Government can assist at the expense of the country? Mr C. RILEY - Yes ; I have such an industry in mind.",41
165,Mr WHITE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Then I hope the honourable member will bring it under notice. This bill also has the usual objectionable tralia features with regard to labour conthe ditions that one finds associated with produce, industrial measures brought down by the present Government. The cost of prorequirements duction is to be kept up, willy-nilly, to of that unfortunate level that has brought us to our present unhappy economic posirequirements. tion. I oppose this bounty on the broad principle that the country cannot afford to pay it.",41
166,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Moreton) [8.11] - I have given the subject matter of this bill much consideration, because I am particularly anxious to help Tasmania, flax and have always had that desire. was privileged to travel throughout that State recently as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, when it investigated Tasmania's claim for special assistance from the Commonwealth, and I am no satisfied that that State is in an unenvisown able financial position. If I could any feature of this bill which would assist Tasmania permanently, I would gladly support the measure: but the moreI analyse the proposal, and the arguments advanced in its favour, the more convinced I am that it should be rejected. First, one has to ask what chance there is of flax-growing becoming a staple industry in this country. This is a proposal to grant £20,000 by way of bounty, although we are taxing the people of Australia to the extent of an additional £14,000,000 so that we may square the national budget. If honourable members from Tasmania or any other part of the Commonwealth can satisfy me that there is a reasonable chance of the flax industry becoming successful, I am ready to be convinced; but the debate on this bill has furnished no proof of such a possibility. If flax grows well in Australia, it seems to me that the or greatest prospect of success lies in cultivating it for linseed only. The chief point advanced by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost), and the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) is that land suitable for the growing of flax' is to be found in Tasmania and on certain parts of the mainland. Let us examine the report of the Tariff Board to see how successful the cultivation of that crop has proved in the past. The report statesEstimated on actual production in Ausin former years, the 70-acre crop of flax in Victoria for the yeaT 1927, included with ISO-acre crop of Tasmania, would approximately, 8 tons of flax fibre, and 18 lb. of linseed, and, seeing that the of the Commonwealth are estimated at 1.370 tons of fibre and 22.300 tons linseed, it is evident that Australia does not supply any appreciable quantity of her As a matter of fact, Australia does not produce 1 per cent, of her requirements. The report also states that In 1918, at the request of the Imperial Government, the Commonwealth Government undertook the control and management of the industry in Australia, and at the outset I guaranteed flax-growers £5 per ton for their flax in the sheaf. In 1919, 1920, and 1921, the guarantee was increased to £fi per ton. But, in spite of every effort that was made to increase the production of flax, real success was achieved. The area to flax in Victoria between .1924 and detect 1927, inclusive, was as follows:19Z4 .. .. 130 acres 1025 154 102fi .. 425 „ 1«27 . . . . . 70 .. The position in South Australia is just as hopeless. The best reply that can be given to the observations of the Assistant Minister in connection with South Australia is the following extract from the board's report:Professor Arthur James Perkins, Director of Agriculture for the State of South Australia, .'gave evidence that flax has been grown in South Australia, only to a very limited extent, - and it is doubtful if today an acre of it - could be located growing. Many tests have been made and experimental plots sown, but they have not been a success owing to the attacks of caterpillars. Through this and also through lack of an assured market, farmers have not been inclined to persevere with the development, of this industry. In these circumstances, it is not of much use for the Assistant Minister to lay stress on the fact that the professor also said that there are. 367,000 acres of land in that State suitable for growing flax. This land is, of course, under profitable crops at present.",41
167,Mr GABB,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,What about Queensland?,42
168,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,No flax is grown in Queensland.,42
169,Mr GABB,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That is why the honourable member is opposing the bill.,42
170,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That is not so. I am prepared to support a proposition for the growing of the flax plant for seed. The position in New South Wales is also very unsatisfactory. One of the witnesses before the board stated that experiments had been conducted by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture on government experimental farms, and also, for many years, on plots owned by farmers. The seed for these trials was distributed free by the Government. In this connection the report statedThese tests have been carried out for the growing of flax for linseed, and from the results, the department, although anxious to promote and encourage the cultivation, is forced to the conclusion that it cannot confidently recommend linseed culture in the States as a profitable proposition. efforts were made by the department in the year 1018-19, and trials were made at 25 localities in the State in 1918, and 41 in 1919 under the supervision of the district agricultural inspector, and whereas the wheat crop was a success in every instance, the flax crop practically failed. Although experiments are still being carried on, the prospects of its successful cultivation in the State are not encouraging. The position in Western Australia is also such that there is little likelihood of successful developments there in this industry. The board asked Mr G. L . Sutton, Director of Agriculture in that State, for certain information, and, in reply, Mr Sutton said that although the climate and soils of Western Australia were suitable for the growth of flax, the settlers considered that it , "" required more extensive work than they were prepared to give it . "" It will be seen, therefore, that nothing practicable has been, or apparently can be done in this industry in Victoria, South Australia, or Western Australia. The following paragraph from the report shows what has been done in Tasmania :The Tasmanian Flax and Canvas Co. L t d . , of 13 Patterson-street, Launceston, has been formed for the purpose of encouraging the growing of flax for linseed and fibre, and later to manufacture canvas. This company contracts with the flax-growers to purchase flax when harvested at a base rate of £5 per ton. The proposals embodied in the prospectus are firstly to purchase crops from which they would take linseed, and, secondly, extract the fibre from the remaining straw, and later they estimate to have plant erected for the manufacture of canvas. At the time of the inquiry the factory consisted of a small plant for the recovery of seed. That is, in my opinion, the only aspect of the subject which is worth some consideration. Recently Mr Norman C. Grigg, director and manager of the Drysdale Flax Company Pty. Ltd., travelled extensively through Ireland, Belgium, and other countries to investigate the treatment of flax fibre, and he informed the board that he wasFirmly convinced that the present methods of water retting or dew retting, as adopted in Australia and other parts of the world, were not satisfactory. He went on to say that he was designing a machine for the more economic handling of flax for the production of fibre. Special But the machine had not then been tested.",42
171,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The machine has since been tested, and proved to be a complete failure.",42
172,Mr LEWIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That is not so.,42
173,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"There are many serious labour problems connected with this industry which make it totally unsuitable for Australia. In European countries it has been the practice from time immemorial to pull flax up by the roots rather than cut it, as in the case of corn. But it will be apparent to everybody that, while that method might be practicable in low-wage countries overseas, it would not be economical in Australia, where high wages are the rule. Although the reaper and binder has been used in Australia to harvest the flax, it has not been too successful, for it injures the flax. It was for this reason, doubtless, that Mr Grigg endeavoured to invent a machine. As a matter of fact, we are faced with the extraordinary proposal that a bounty shall be provided for the production of flax practically to enable a company to import a machine for the purpose of conducting experiments.",42
174,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Where did the honourable member get that information?,43
175,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,It is in the report of the board.,43
176,Mr BELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That report is three years old ,43
177,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The relevant paragraphs of the report, in this connection, are as follow:Evidence was given that in European countries flax is pulled by hand, but it would not be an economic proposition if the same method were adopted in Australia, owing to the higher wages paid here for that class of labour. The reaper and binder is used here for the purpose and has shown a considerable saving on the hand pulling. Some claim a percentage, of fibre is lost through the few inches of stump left, but from evidence this is of such small value that it is not worth consideration. A flax pulling machine has been patented and manufactured in Canada and it is the intention of the Tasmanian applicants to import one of these machines for trial. The machinery used in the flax mills in Australia is very primitive, necessitates a large amount of hand labour and produces a comparatively low percentage of fibre from the straw. A good deal of activity in the way of ing machinery for the greater production and more economical handling of the fibre took place in Europe during the latter part of 1021, hut no evidence has been submitted of the results. Another difficulty in the way of the successful establishment of the industry in Australia is that the seed has to imported, but even this has not proved satisfactory, as the following paragraph in the Board's report indicates:Seed has been imported at various times but the results have not been immediately successful owing to the seed requiring a few years for it to become thoroughly acclimatised. Although in 1907 the Commonwealth Government granted a bounty of 10 per cent, on the value of the flax products, both fibre and seed, produced in Australia, and £13,000 per annum was made available for each of the ten years from 1907 to 1917, there was no marked increase in the acreage sown to flax, and in 1917 the bounty was allowed to lapse. The amounts paid in bounty during the years the act was in operation, were as follow:Flax and Years. Hemp. Linseed. £ £ 190708 190809 .. 126 .. 0 190910 .. 120 191011 .. 123 191112 480 191213 .. 215 9 191314 318 191415 77 191516 .. 635 1910-17 267 1917-18 2,361 ., 15 I have already made passing reference to the labour difficulties connected with this industry. One of the principle of these is in connection with the retting of the crop. Retting is a term used to describe the rotting of the flax. The fibres of the flax plant, in their natural state, are bound to the stem by a pectinious compound, a substance which is characteristically gummy or gelatinous. For commercial purposes it is essential to separate the fibres from the stem, and this object is accomplished by retting or scutching. The function of retting is to decompose, by fermentation, the adhesive substances which bind the fibres to the stem and to sufficiently rot the pith or stem develop- that in the subsequent operation of scutching it will break and freely separate from the fibres which are held, and remain in the scutchers' hands. Several retting processes are followed at present. Under one method the retting is done in pools of stagnant water. In another, it be is done in ponds of water which are Blowly changed during ""the process of retting. The Sax is usually left submerged *for about fourteen days. One can imagine the stench that arises when the decaying flax is taken out of the water. A third process is to submerge the flax in sluggish streams or marshes. In some places double retting is practised. In fact, this is almost alwaysdone when the finest flax is required. In this case the flax, after being pulled, is set in long stooks in the field to dry. When thoroughly dry it is put up into stacks, or stored away in barns, and protected as much as possible from vermin until the following spring. Then, after retting, it is again dried and, if of good quality, is again stacked until the following spring, when it is either grassed or retted a second time. The second retting is frequently done, however, in the same season as the first. Still another process of retting is known as dew retting. The flax, when retted by this method, is spread out thinly and evenly over a field where the grass has been recently and closely cropped. About 1 to l i times the area of land in which the flax was produced is required for dewretting. The heat, dew, rain and sometimes the snow, all contribute to carry on the process of fermentation. At intervals of about a week the rows of flax have to be completely turned over. Beginning with the first row, and with the aid of a long, straight rod, the flax is turned on to the space originally and purposely left when it was first spread out. The second row is then turned over to fall into the position left vacant by the first row, and so on with every succeeding row. Additional turnings are necessary after every heavy fall of rain, and also every few days in showery weather. It will be realized, therefore, that this is a costly and slow process, which might be carried on successfully in low-wage countries, but cannot be profitably adopted in Australia if we are to keep up our standard of living-and I hope that our standard of living will be maintained. It seems to me that it is utterly impossible for us ever to establish this industry on a profitable basis in Australia. The industry has been overtaken by serious difficulties, even in Ireland. This is shown by a paragraph which appears Mr Francis. in the Journal of the Parliaments of the Empire, volume 9, No. 2, for April, 1930, at page 318. The paragraph is included in a short report of the proceedings in the House of Commons on the l l t h March last, on which occasion Major Hall-Thompson directed attention to the serious state of the industry in Ireland, and urged that the Imperial Government should grant assistance to the workers up in the industry. If the very long experience of Ireland in flax-growing has not enabled her to avoid difficulty, how can we hope to avoid it? But it is possible that we could do something in Australia in the direction of growing flax for the seed. I ask the Minister to withdraw the bill to enable him thoroughly to investigate the subject. If he can then prove to the House that there is a reasonable prospect, of successfully establishing the industry, I shall be delighted to support any efforts to that end. But on the facts adduced by the Tariff Board and by my own personal inquiry, I cannot believe that success will follow any attempt artificially to set up the industry in Australia at this juncture. I do not believe that we should, by the aid of this bounty, encourage people to launch out into the industry, particularly those in Tasmania who already have their own problems. Another reason that has been advanced for encouraging the establishment of the industry here is that each year - we import over £1,000,000 worth of flax products. I remind honourable members that these are the output of low-wage countries, and that their manufacture here would not be practicable at anything near the same cost. Handicapped as it would be by the drawbacks associated with the process of retting in Australia, I see not the slightest chance of establishing either the growth of flax or the manufacture of its products in this country, unless we imposed a prohibition on the importation of flax and flax products. That, of course, would so inflate the price of everything that we use that is made from flax that our endeavours would be automatically checkmated thereby. Some of the items whose importation would have to be prohibited are flax, various linen piece-goods, cordage, fishing lines and nets, cottons of all description, twine, silver cordage, and a whole series of other commodities that are used in the daily routine of our lives. Our burden is already sufficiently heavy, and the inflation of prices, consequent upon a prohibition of the importation into Australia of flax and its products, would be the last straw that would break the camel's back. If Tasmania were to pin its faith in its financial - recovery to the growth and manufacture of flax, its position would become worse than it is today. There are many other avenues along which that State may advance to regain its former prosperity, and I am hopeful that the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, following the result of its inquiry into Tasmania's disabilities, will provide a remedy that will give some slight relief to the island State. The Minister would be well advised to withdraw the bill and to consider more fully the development of the flax industry by concentrating on the production of linseed, and the manufacture of its by-products. If that were done there would be some prospect of success. I should be prepared to support the Minister in his endeavours along those lines.",43
178,Mr LEWIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Corio) [8.45] - I listened with a very great deal of interest to the speeches emanating from honourable members opposite in opposition to this proposal. It appears to me that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) and his colleagues base their chief complaint on the fact that the constituencies in which flax-growing iscarried on are represented by honourable members on the Government side. They regard that as a reason why the Government should not proceed with its proposal. Their's is a parochial attitude savouring strongly of politics. I believe that the Government has every justification for introducing this measure. Its action indicates that it is prepared to give sympathetic heed to the need of those who are pioneering the flax industry in Australia, men who received no consideration from the Government that previously occupied the Treasury bench. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) quoted from s, document purporting to give the views of Mr Grigg, of Drysdale. Whatever may have been the opinion of Mr Grigg on the subject in the past, there is no doubt that he now supports the proposal of the Government to grant a bounty to assist the cultivation of flax in Australia. I contend that the assertion that Mr Grigg's flax - manufacturing machine is a failure is absolutely inaccurate. The machine is at. present working very efficiently, and is eliminating from the process of flax manufacture many of the disagreeable factors that were enumerated by honourable members opposite. The machine is an Australian production, the creation of Mr Grigg's brain. His experience from its operation has convinced him thai certain minor improvements can be effected that will still further increase its efficiency. By his process., it is no longer necessary to submit flax either to water or dew retting. His machine makes it possible for the whole process of separating the fibre from the flax straw to be carried on under the shelter of a roof. Therefore, many of the objections that were raised against the industry by honourable members opposite are rendered ineffective.",45
179,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"It is a wonder that Mr. Grigg dpes not make use of his invention in the Old Country, where he would make a fortune with it.",45
180,Mr LEWIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Mr Grigg is an Australian, a returned soldier, who lives at Drysdale. The honourable member, who professes such sympathy for returned men is, apparently, on this occasion, prepared to sneer at the efforts of one of their number who is trying to pioneer an industry in Australia.",45
181,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,That is merely the honourable member's way of putting it.,45
182,Mr LEWIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Hi s machine is in the initial stages of its development, and it is hoped that, as the result of experience, it will eventually be perfected, enabling most of the objectionable features of flax production to be eliminated. It is true that Mr Grigg's process of dealing with the flax is not universally adopted! It not only allows the fibre to be separated from the straw, but it enables Mr Grigg to produce a valuable edible cattle fodder, which he disposes of profitably to dairy farmers. It has been demonstrated by analysis that that edihle fodder is more nutritious than ordinary hay. Mr. Grigg is whole-heartedly behind the bounty proposed by the Government as a means to assist to establish the industry in Australia. Some of our rope and twine manufacturers have experimented with his flax fibre, and have produced ropes which have been found to be most satisfactory. Their only complaint is that the fibre produced by Mr Grigg's process during summer time is not as good as that produced in winter. only period when' he has to apply moisture to assist in its production is during the abnormally hot summer months. Even then the whole thing can be done under cover of a roof. It is no longer necessary with his process of manufacture to resort to the antiquated methods referred to by honourable members opposite. We are importing from overseas, and particularly from Italy, large quantities of sisal hemp, which is used in the manufacture of cord and rope. If , as a result of the payment of this bounty, we can satisfactorily develop the flax industry in Australia, there is no reason why we should not be able, in a very short space of time, to produce all the fibre that we need for the manufacture of the rope, twine, cord, and other associated requirements in Australia, so making ourselves independent of these importations from overseas. That is an object worthy of attainment, one that should have the approval of honourable members opposite. Instead, they devote the whole of their time to making sneering references to the failure, in the past, to produce cient quantity of flax in Australia. I point out that quite a number of local industries,.that are how in a flourishing condition, had in their initial stages to be spoon-fed either by the Federal or the State Governments. They have now become valuable attributes to Australian industry, and there is no reason why a similar story should not be written with regard to the flax industry. The amount of bounty now proposed to encourage the production of flax in this country will not place so heavy a burden on the people as they have to bear in connection with the dairying industry. As has been pointed out Mr Letois. on more than one occasion, the people of Australia are paying from 6d. to 8d. a lb. more for their butter than is obtained for similar butter sold overseas.  tion.",45
183,Mr LEWIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"My authority for that statement is Mr O'Connell, the proprietor of the Geelong Butter Factory. He told me that butter was sold in the multiple shops in London at Is. 2d. a lb. when we in Australia were paying Is. lOd. a lb for The it. Mr SPEAE:ER - The honourable member will not be in order in developing that line of argument very far.",46
184,Mr LEWIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I am endeavouring to demonstrate that other industries which are regarded as worth preserving are receiving an indirect subsidy far in excess of the bounty proposed to assist the flaxgrowing industry. There are no more ardent supporters of the scheme to assist the dairying industry than are some honourable members opposite who oppose this bill. I commend this proposition to the House because I believe that before long it will result in the establishment of an industry which will be of great benefit to this country.  We have heard some interesting and diverse opinions on the merits and demerits of this bill. The honourable members for Corio (Mr Lewis) and Franklin (Mr Frost) have shown that they are wholeheartedly in support of it. On the other hand, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) proved himself to be a ""whole hog"" oppositionist to it . a suffiThe honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis) is in favour of assistance being given to the industry by means of a bounty on linseed and linseed oil, but not for the production of fibre from flax. One could not help wondering whether, subconsciously, the honourable member had made up his mind to support one side of the industry and not the other, because of a fear that flax might in some way come into competition with cotton.",46
185,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That is unjust. I take a broader view than that.  gentleman assures me that my fear is groundless, I shall withdraw the remark.",46
186,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Surely no such assurance should be necessary.  Leader of the Oppositiou said that i bill were passed it would add to the already heavy burden on other industries. So far as I could read his mind, the honourable member feared that at some later stage a heavy duty would be asked for to replace the bounty, and that, in consequence, other industries which use flax as a raw material would be affected. The honourable gentleman evidently feels that this proposal is on all fours with bounty on the production of sewing machine heads with which we dealt a few days ago. But there is a very big difference between the two propositions. In the case of sewing machine heads,, the bounty, together with the duty, represents a protection of 70 per cent, against Britain, and 85 per cent, against other countries, with a deferred duty which would be higher still. Had the two measures been the same; had this bounty been as great in proportion to the value of the product , as the bounty on sewing machines is to the value of the article produced, I should have agreed with the honourable gentleman that it would be dangerous to attempt to establish any industry on such an artificial foundation. But this measure provides only for a bounty of 15 per cent, on the wholesale value of the flax produced for the first two years, 10 per cent, for the next two years, and 7£ per cent, for the fifth year. The bounty will dininish as time goes on. I submit that the bounty proposed in this measure bears a reasonable proportion to the value of the product on which it is to be paid. When the production of flax has increased to such an extent that a bounty is no longer practicable, the natural way to protect it would be by means of a duty. But if the industry can grow to substantial proportions with such moderate assistance as is proposed in this bill, that growth must be on a sound basis and it would prove that it required little or no duty. It would be on almost a competitive basis from the start. On the other hand, if the industry cannot flourish with moderate stimulus, we are better without it. No industry should expect to be permanently spoon-fed. The assistance which is being offered in the measure before us, however, is so reasonable and moderate that we need have no fear that f this the growth of the industry will be artificially forced. The weakest joint in the armour of the Minister in charge of this measure is that, despite the bounty already paid, there has been little or no development of the flaxgrowing industry. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) said that the money already paid by way Of bounty on the production of flax had practically the been thrown away. In my opinion, the industry has a better chance of succeeding in the future than it had some years ago, because of improvements in methods and machinery, of which the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lewis) has already given some details. The honor-, able member pointed out that dew retting is no longer necessary when the fibre is to be used for the making of cordagethe use to which most of the flax produced in Australia would be put. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, the industry is worth assisting further on this low basis of bounty. Whatever its chance of success, it can at lea'st be said to be greater than that of the cotton industry. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) said that Australia imports, every year, goods, both manufactured and otherwise, of which flax forms a part, to the value of £2,000,000. I think that was an over-estimate. For the last four years, the average value of the canvas and duck imported into this country was about £800,000. I am not at all enthusiastic about our being able to produce for ourselves--at any rate under existing economic condition:}-suc h highly manufactured articles as canvas and duck on a purely competitive basis. Nor am I desirous of seeing more industries started in this country on a highly artificial and uneconomic basis. But in addition to the importations of canvas and' duck, Australia imports each year linseed valued at £400,000, and linseed oil valued at £100,000. I submit that whatever difficulties we may have to face, in producing on a competitive basis, such highly manufactured goods as canvas and duck, those difficulties would not confront us in providing our own requirements of linseed and linseed oil.",46
187,Mr FRANCIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Then the honourable member supports my contention.  tations of those articles alone, represent about £500,000 per annum. Importations of phormium tenax from New Zealand represent about £190,000 per annum. That variety of flax has been - excluded from this bounty, because the Tariff Board has not considered this plant when making its investigations. In this connection, I desire to place before the House some interesting facts relating to phormium lenax. In the neighbourhood of Sale, an attempt is being made to produce this plant, which is quite unlike linum usitatissimum because, instead of having to be sown and cultivated with an interval of a number of years between crops, phormiqim tenax is actually planted, by the root, and is of a permanent nature. Some years must elapse before it can be harvested, but when that time arrives, its yield, on suitable land, is very high. In my opinion, jihormium ienax has a better chance of success than has the variety which is to benefit, from the bounty proposed in this bill. I desire to read an extract from the Gippsland Mercury, dated the 13th May, 1930, regarding this matterOn Friday afternoon, an interesting ceremony took place on the morass land which lies between the Glengarry and Thomson rivers, when the first roots of phormium tenax or New Zealand flax were planted. . . . The work of ploughing 200 acres has been proceeding for some time. The. promoters have visions of a nourishing flax industry being established in Sale as the land secured is entirely suitable for the cultivation of New Zealand flax. I p o in to u t that although p h o r m i u m tenax, from as t r i c t b o t a n i c a l p o in to f view, m a y not be a flax, it is generally spoken of as flax, as this newspaper in d i cates. The a r t i c l e continuesAt the invitation of the company a number of public men were present at the function. Phormium tenax is said to be the most wonderful fibre plant in the world, and to yield more fibre from a. given area than any other fibre plant known. The successful establishment of such an industry in the locality will give employment to a large number of persons, and this will also be a further step in the advancement of this district. The following is a short extract from a New Zealand newspaper dealing with the same variety of flax:Quietly and without any fanfare of publicity trumpets, there is going on at Gordonton, near Hamilton, an enterprise that promises to make history in the New Zealand hemp industry. Less than three years ago, a company, called Australian and New Zealand Investments Limited, was formed for the purpose of interesting the investing public of New Zealand aud Australia 'in the scientific treatment of New Zealand flax, with selection of varieties and cultivation as the basis of providing the raw material for production of the hemp fibre in place of the usual method of depending on the mixed varieties of the plant on wild or uncultivated areas. Tho promoters found the New Zealand public somewhat apathetic to their proposals, but were able' to interest several well-known and substantial business men in Sydney, with the result that "" Auzie"" came into existence and was registered in New South Wales with a modeBt capital of £20,000. To finance the area of land on which options were secured, a bond system under the name of "" Hempland"" bonds was devised, and has been most successful. To date over £170,000 has been subscribed in Australia and New Zealand, so that rapid and, to the uninitiated visitor, startling progress has been made in the company's plantation at Gordonton and Kaingaroa North. The company has in hand 4,400 acres, 'of which 1,600 have already been permanently planted-80 0 acres at Kaingaroa and 800 acres at Gordonton-wit h high-grade plants produced from its own nursery of 52 acres, said by experts to be the most up-to-date, comprehensive and successful flax nursery i u New Zealand, and a real object lesson to every visitor to Gordonton. The growers are endeavouring to do at Sale what has been done in New Zealand. Mr W. Petrie, New Zealand Government chief hemp grader, saysI t is generally accepted that the hemp industry is second to none in the dominion. Flax millers and growers now realise that flax-growing will, if properly cared for, be highly profitable. The best thing about flax cultivation is that there will never he any danger of a glut in the market. New Zealand hemp makes the best binder twine in the world, and overseas markets will eagerly snap up every pound we can produce.  flax and hemp as being p r a c t i c all y the same t h in g . He continuesWe are at present unable to supply big orders, simply because we do not produce sufficient. When one remembers the market for Phormium and its popularity, when properly milled, and our present output of only 20,000 tons, it will be readily understood that our total production is only a flea-bite on the world's markets for hard fibres, which is, including Phormium-, approximately 400,000 tons. Then again our fibre may bo manufactured into soft materials for whioh some other fibres are not suitable. There is good reason to think that under proper methods of cultivation it would produce an annual value of milled product per .acre of flax- a figure SD high as to be almost incredible had not the statistical data been carefully examined. At the present time, the industry supports one Family to every 35 acres of milled flax. The world's consumption of hard fibres during 1920 was 408,000 tons, and of soft fibres, 2,220.000 tons, jute comprising 1,500,000 tons. Only 58,000 tons of hard librcs was produced in the British Empire. The only country exporting Phormium fibre is New Zealand. Up to the present, that country is only ab;e to spare about 0,000 tons for export to the United States of America, where >'iio firm, the International Harvester Company, states that if supplies were available could absorb 50,000 tons annually alone. Another extract readsAccording to customs returns, on an average for twelve years, until 30th June, 1029, 5,950 Urns of Phormium fibre (including tow) valued ut £189,823 have beeu imported into the Commonwealth annually-mor e both in tonnage and value than a ll other hemps combined. As an example of its many uses, one northern newspaper company alone, it is stated, consumes approximately £5,000 worth of Phormium lashings and twine annually for tying its newspapers into bundles for distribution. Other newspaper offices throughout the Commonwealth use very little else for the same purpose. f have tried to interest the House in this now venture of the cultivation of phormium tenax, which is being tried out in Gippsland, but which, unfortunately, does not come within the scope of this bill. Mr C. RILKY - Is the honourable member asking for a bounty on that variety of flax?  fact that, the Assistant Minister announced, in the press some months ago, at least as far back as Easter, that a bounty was to be paid on flax, these growers, who have since then planted some 200 acres, would naturally think that they would be included in the bounty. This variety is described in the district as flax, and the growers will feel that some discrimination has been shown if one variety is included and another excluded.  supporting this bounty?  pany which has been floated in the Sale district, is in existence, and is not in the chrysalis stage like a projected sewing machine company of which we have heard so much during the last week or two. I hope that the Assistant Minister, if he decides that the abseuce of a Tariff Board inquiry is an insuperable obstacle in the way of including phormium tenax in this bill, will take an early opportunity of asking the Tariff Board to consider the claims of this variety for inclusion in the bill along with linum usitatissimum. I propose to support the bill, because, in the first place, we import some £400,000 worth of linseed and £112,000 worth of linseed oil. In respect of those two products we might reasonably it expect to compete with importations. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr. Bell), when speaking in support of the bill, said that the Development and Migration Commission had recommended this industry as one which might be very valuable to the State of Tasmania. Then again, I have already informed the House that about £190,000 worth of phormium tenax is imported into this country for the manufacture of binder twines and cordage, and if the Minister should be able, either now or at a later date, to include that variety in this bill, it would give encouragement to an enterprise which, if successful, will render such importations unnecessary. I support the bill because I think that a bounty of .15 per cent., 10 per cent., and 7^ per cent, of the market value is a safe and moderate stimulus to the production of linum usitatissimum, and - should not artificially force the growth of that industry under the hot-house conditions applying to certain other industries for which the bounty or tariff protection is unduly high. If this industry expands with this moderate assistance, it will be something worthwhile, because it should then be able to stand on its own feet, and not require high tariff assistance.",47
188,Mr NAIRN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Perth) [9.10] - The views of honourable members On the subject of bounties seem to be in ratio to the benefits which their electorates are likely to derive from such bounties. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lewis) conveyed that idea when, in support of a bounty being paid to an industry in his electorate, he put forward an argument which, .at any rate, had the merit of novelty. He said that the fact that certain honourable members were active in supporting the bounty was the highest ground for granting it. Those of us who have no electorate interests in the proposed bounty, and are, therefore, free to express an unbiased opinion, prefer to sider this proposal on its merits, having due regard to the prospects of the industry. The honourable member for Gipps into the same category as the honourable member for Corio. I was surprised to hear his advocacy of the proposed bounty. I know the difficulties of this industry, and that it is argued that if the growers receive a bounty of £5 a ton for their they will be able-to carry on the industry successfully. Yet the honourable member was associated with a Government that at one time paida bounty .of £5 per ton for One year and £6 a ton for the next four years to this industry. ' - '  before my day.' -' Mr NAIRN - The honourable member belongs to the party'which'was responsible for that bounty. At that time 63 tons of fibre and 250 tons of seeds were produced. Of course, we cannot forget those 200 acres of Gippsland morass. But there is .the financial aspect to be considered. am pleased that the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Scullin) is with us again, and looking better than he has looked, perhaps, for some months. He looks just like a gentleman who has returned from a highly satisfactory visit to his ""Uncle"". The Prime Minister haswarned this House lately of the serious financial position of this country, and of the need for the greatest care and courage on the part of the Government. He has told us that he has to bridge a gap of £14,000,000. I wish that he would show the courage which a gentleman occupying his position should show, by bridging this gap of £14,000,000, not by spending money on bounties, but by exercising economies.",49
189,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Hon. Norman Makin). - The honourable member's remarks would be quite permissible on the budget debate, but not at this stage.",50
190,Mr NAIRN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I bow to your ruling, sir. But we should apply economy to the system of bounties. We should refuse to grant bounties while this country is in its present financial position. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [9.15] - I congratulate the Assistant Minister (Mr Forde) upon the introduction of this measure, which provides for the payment of a bounty on the production of flax in Australia. I con- am pleased that the Government has thus lived up to a promise that it made on the eve of the last election; unlike its predecessor in office, which had the distinction of making wild and extravagant promises on the eve of an election, and conveniently forgetting them later. This Government is determined to carry out its election promises to assist both our primary and secondary industries. crop, Honourable members know that a number of tariff schedules have been introduced with the object of building tip our tariff wall, and thus ensuring the sound establishment of oiir secondary industries. But, while the party to' which I belong stands for. the adequate protection of our secondary industries, it is not unmindful of the .welfare of those of our primary industries that have already been established, or of the necessity for establishing new primary industries, many of which clamoured vainly for assistance from the previous Government. This Government proved its bona fides in I the matter Of primary production by the introduction of the Wheat Marketing Bill, and other measures designed to assist the primary producer and to increase primary production. I regret that the former administration failed lamentably to assist' many important primary industries. Its failure was the more remarkable in that it was a composite administration, many of its members allegedly being representative of country interests, with sympathy for the man on the land and a desire to extend primary industries. I welcome this proposal. But action should not cease with the payment of a bounty on the production of flax and linseed. The Government should see that the money is wisely expended, and that those who participate in the distribution of it proceed along sound and correct lines. I know that there have been quite a number of failures in the flax industry. After my return from overseas at the termination of the war, I lost a few pounds in a venture in which I risked my money; but that experience has not caused me to take a doleful view of the flax industry. I am more confident that this measure will result in the industry being firmly established. In addition to making the bounty available, the Government should take steps to obtain the advice of some person who is thoroughly experienced in the cultivation of flax, and also the manufacture of the fibre into different commodities. The Assistant Minister suggested that the State Departments of Agriculture might do something in the way of advising and helping the growers; but I feel that a responsibility in that particular direction rests on the Commonwealth Government, and that it would be well advised to secure from Belfast, or elsewhere, an expert in the flax industry, from the growing to the manufacturing stage. I regret that the report of the Tariff Board has remained hidden for the best part of two years, and that the Government which was responsible for the reference of the matter to the board took no action upon its recommendation. I cannot be accused of advancing the interests of my electorate by my advocacy of this proposal. I approach the .matter from a purely Australian point of view. This is an industry which should be encouraged, so that it will become thoroughly established. As honourable members know, it is the oldest industry in the world. Solomon's raiment was made of linen. Early last century, a large area was growing flax in Australia. The efforts of our early Governors were not, however, carriedon by their successors and on account of the indifference of various governments in recent years the industry has not been given the encouragement it deserved. Some honourable members have adopted a doubtful attitude towards the measure, imagining that the industry is not one that should be encouraged. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) referred to the abominable process of retting, and argued that this is not a white man's industry. The growing of flax is engaged in extensively in Ireland, and so far as I know, only white labour is employed. The conditions in Australia are much more favourable than they are in Ireland for the cultivation of flax. We have beautiful sunshine, which can be utilized instead of smoke fires for the ing of the fibre. The honourable member for Henty likened this proposal to the bounty that it is intended to pay on the manufacture of sewing machines, and described, both measures as "" wretched little things"". He, apparently, is concerned only with the wine bounty, which, in one year, involved the taxpayers of Australia in an expenditure of over £400,000 - It would seem that he is not prepared to assist small, struggling industries. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis), who adopted a most unsympathetic attitude, should be the last member of this House to oppose a proposal that will assist struggling farmers and necessitous States. It is well known that Tasmania is labouring under great difficulties at the present time. This is a more practical way of helping that State than the payment of hundreds of thousands of pounds by way of doles. The honourable member for Henty claimed that this assistance would add to the costs of a dozen or more manufacturing industries that are not profitable today. That is rather an exaggerated statement in general terms, and it will not stand analysis. The honourable member for Moreton suggested that the bill should be withdrawn, or that the bounty should be paid, only on the production of linseed. No one who has any acquaintance with the flax industry will suggest that we shauld grow flax only for. the linseed that is obtained. The fibre has a distinct value. A country like Australia, that imports millions of pounds worth of linen, canvas, duck, and other products, cannot afford to allow the fibre to remain untreated. Elax may be described as a poor man's crop. There is no need to have rich soil, or to use fertilizers. I have travelled many hundreds of miles in Tasmania, and can say that there is a striking similarity between that State and those parts of Ireland in which flax is being cultivated. The production of fibre and linseed will help to arrest the flow of imports. There is no justification for the importation annually of £500,000 worth of linseed for the production of linseed oil. The sole idea of those who are interested in the flax industry in Australia appears to dry- be the manufacture of canvas and cordage. I am confident that, when the industry is established, we shall be in a position to manufacture our requirements of not only canvas and cordage but also fine linen. We produce line wools, cotton, bigb-quality wbeats, and many other primary products, and there is no reason why we should not produce good flax. We have country that is admirably suited for its growth. Only by encouraging the industry in its early stages shall we place selves in a position to manufacture linen, of which, at the present time, we do not manufacture sufficient to make a pocket handkerchief. A country that has made such rapid strides as Australia in its textile industry cannot be satisfied Avitb the unsatisfactory position that we occupy in regard to flax manufactures at the present time. If we are to make ourselves self-contained and self-reliant, we must interest ourselves in the production of flax, as we have done with cotton and other products. It is true that very little flax is grown at the present time; but the prospects warrant the assumption that in its production we can eclipse the experience that we have had in regard to cotton. In 1919, the area under cotton was only 72 acres, but five years later it had increased to 50,186 acres. What is possible with cotton is possible also with flax. Several honourable members have referred to the handicaps associated with retting. From my knowledge of the industry, I apprehend no difficulty in that respect. Nor do I share the view that other honourable members have expressed, that the industry cannot be properly established on account of the costs that are involved. An Australian was responsible for the invention of the combined harvester. Who will say that we have not the brains and the genius so to improve existing machinery that we can reduce the costs of flax manufacture? The interests of the growers are to be amply protected, and provision is made for the payment of fair and reasonable rates of wages to the labour employed. Taken by and large, this is a satisfactory measure, and one that will do a great deal to advance our primary and secondary industries. I trust that it will become law, and thus enable us to give to this industry the encouragement that it deserves. Mr O. Riley. Mr.""GREGORY (Swan) [9.30] - It is very interesting to hear from the honourable member for Cook (Mr C. Riley) that he and the honourable members with whom he is associated are anxious to support primary production; but he should 'tell us why they have, in the past, been so anxious to destroy other great primary industries in Australia, which ourhave produced so much wealth for Australia. The wool, wheat, gold-mining, and other industries are suffering today as a result of the policy of this and previous administrations which, by imposing excessive customs duties, have retarded their development. By this means the costs of production have been increased to such an extent 'that it, is exceedingly difficult for primary producers to profitably dispose of their products in the markets of the world. Notwithstanding their close adherence to that policy, we now have this striking exception. Although a measure was passed this afternoon providing for increased rates on mail matter, which will place a further burden on the primary producers, we are now asked to support this proposal, involving the unnecessary expenditure of thousands of pounds. In view of our present financial difficulties, we should show some desire to meet our financial obligations. The honourable member for Cook gave some figures with respect to the area under cotton in certain years, but he did not give us all the facts. He said that the cotton industry in Australia had developed to such an extent that, although there were only 72 acres under cotton in 1919, the area had increased to 50,186 acres in 1924. Why did not the honourable member give us the area under crop in the succeeding years? Mr C. RILEY - I had not those figures before me.",50
191,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"In 1925 the area under cotton had decreased to 40,000 acres, and in 1926 to 18,743, or a decrease of over 20,000 acres in one year. The honourable member supplied only the figures which suited his argument, as did the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Fenton), when I asked him the quantity and value of reapers and binders exported to New Zealand. The Minister gave the value, but, not the quantity, because I suppose the quantity was unacquainted favourable from his view-point. Accordtion, ing to the Commonwealth Year-Book, the figures for the area under cotton in 1927 and 1928 were not available, but there had been a decrease from 50,186 in 1924 to 18,743 in 1926. If upon this measure were to provide for the payment of a bounty on linseed oil proment of bounties. duced from flax, there might be some justification for supporting be interesting to know who is asking for a bounty on flax. If this proposal has any merit, the agricultural departments in the various States should know someAlthough thing concerning its possibilities.

A study of governmental expenditure for the last ten years shows that no serious attempt has been made to reduce our or commitments. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which has exnow been established for some time, could easily place the services of some of its officers at the disposal of Government to report on the possibilities of this industry. The officers of from that department, who .have conducted numerous investigations, and submitted of great value to primary producers, could have made recommendations which would be of greater value than those of the Tariff Board. Possibly, some financial assistance could be given to the State Governments to enable their Departments of Agriculture to provide experimental plots on which an exhaustive examination concerning the possibility of this industry could be undertaken. Such recommendations would be of more value than those which the House is asked to accept.",53
199,Mr MCNEILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Wannon) [9.43] The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) suggests that the Commonwealth should make available to the States a small amount to enable the State Departments of Agriculture to undertake certain experimental work in connection with the production of flax. During the last two years, at any rate, flax has been successfully produced at Colac in the Western District of Victoria, where a sample of flax straw, equal to any produced in the southern hemisphere, has been grown.",54
200,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,On what area?,54
201,Mr MCNEILL,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"On only a few acres, but in sufficient quantities to induce engaged in the industry to erect a factory. Flax production is also being extended, as I understand factories are being estabr lished' at Port Eairy, Koroit, and Warrnambool. The information I have received is that the land in that locality is too valuable for the production of flax; but nevertheless the industry has great possibilities in Australia, particularly at the present juncture when low prices are being obtained for wheat and wool. Flax production, I believe, is going to be one of our valuable industries, and this or any other government would be justified in giving it financial assistance initial stages. Tasmania has an abundant rainfall, and suitable soil for growing flax. It is not a wheat-producing State, and its secondary industries are hampered by the isolation of the island. There is much light, scrubby land which could be utilized for the production of flax, thereby producing much wealth for Tasmania and for the Commonwealth. I am of opinion that we have reached a stage in our development when we must get back to the. land. Unfortunately, Australia is a land-locked country. There are thousands of young men in Australia-man y of them the sons of farmers-wit h a knowledge of stock and of farming, who are denied the right to get on land of their own. There are also hundreds of thousands of men living in squalid surroundings in the city who would be better off out in the country making a decent living for themselves and their families. Flax production is a part of mixed farming, and it should be an important part. I remind the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that there' is in Western Australia a large area stretching from Albany to the Midland Junction in which the rainfall is good, and the soil suitable for growing flax, which it would be better used than left to the growth of bracken and other useless vegetation. The majority of honourable members opposite complained about the Government offering assistance to those who are trying to make flax production successful, but they should bear in mind that it is often necessary to assist even primary industries during their initial stages. This industry, I believe, will be a very important one to the Comthose monwealth within the next few years.",54
202,Mr FORDE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Capricornia-Assistant Minister) [9.50] - After listening to the speeches of honourable members, I am more satisfied than ever that the Government is doing the right thing in having this bill passed in order to give the flax industry a reasonable chance of success. Too many people are postponing the establishment of new enterprises and new industries, hoping for better times, but there is no time like the present for the encouragement of an industry like this, in its which will provide employment for a large number of farmers, and of workmen in the field and in the factory. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) suggested that the scope of the bill should be widened to include phormium tenax which was recently planted and is being grown around Sale, in Victoria. While I am very sympathetic towards this request, I remind' him that it is necessary to refer his application to the Tariff Board, whose favourable report would be necessary before a bounty could be paid. Linum usitatissimum, the variety of flax on which this bounty is to be paid, is something quite different from phormium tenax, which is confined almost exclusively to New land, where it is indigenous. As the of wages and costs of production about the same in Australia as in New Zealand, and New^ Zealand dressed flax is exported from that country at a profit without the assistance of a bounty, it is only reasonable to assume that the phorto mium tenax grown at Sale for fibre only can also be produced at a profit without a bounty. This is borne out by the prospectus of the company known as Fiax Growers and Millers Limited, which is responsible for the Sale enterprise. The prospectus was issued on the 23rd April, 1929, eleven months before the Commonwealth GoBounty vernment announced its intention of bringing down legislation providing the payment of a bounty on flax. It tains a glowing account of the future before the flax industry, and ""makes no mention whatever of the need for a £20,000 bounty. It invites the public to buy £30. bonds, the return on which, it says, will rise steadily from 9 per cent, in the third year to as high as 58 per cent, per annum in the ninth year, at which figure it expected to be stabilized. Representawere tions have been made by the honourable  who is keenly desirous that the bounty should be extended to phormium tenax. In compliance with his request, the matter has been referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report; but provision for it cannot be included in bill. Section 15, sub-section 1 e of the Tariff Board Act states that the Minister 4,000 tons of linseed. shall refer to the Board for inquiry report applications for a bounty for encouragement of any primary or 400 secondary industry in Australia, shall not take action in respect of such matters until a report has been received from the board. I have no intention of evading the requirements of the act in this respect, and therefore I have ferred the request of the interests concerned to the board for investigation. ""We have in Australia a ready market Belgium. for 23,000 tons of linseed per annum, the value of which is £500,000. It would be necessary to cultivate 150,000 acres year to produce this flax, which would processed in Australia for the manuwill facture of linseed, linseed oil, oil Zea- &c. Flax-growing is best carried on as rate a three-yearly rotation crop. Land in are Tasmania and Victoria now used for potato-growing would be suitable for the production of flax, which could be grown in rotation with the potatoes. It will be seen, therefore, that it would be necessary have 450,000 acres of land under cultivation to produce flax each year on 150,000 acres. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) criticized the departure from the Tariff Board's .recommendation of minimum quantities. I poiut out that there are no minimum quantities provided for in the Wine Bounty Act, and in - the Seed Cotton Act. In this case there is a very good reason for the departure from the for Tariff Board's recommendation. The conboard's first recommendation laid down impossible and inconsistent minimum quantities. The quantities specified were worth of fibre, and £70,000 worth of linseed, equivalent to 280 tons.of fibre, and 4,680 tons of linseed. If these conditions were enforced they would prevent is the industry from getting a start. They inconsistent, too, because the Tariff Board overlooked the all-important fact that a given quantity of flax plant produces almost an exactly equal amount of fibre and linseed. Therefore, any minimum quantity should be the same for each product of the plant. In fact, the Tariff Board, in a later report, dated this 18th January, 1929, reduced the minimum quantities to 250 tons of fibre and Moreover, the and Government first ascertained that the the approximate production of 1930 will be tons of fibre, and 380 tons of linseed. and Hence the minimum specified by the Tariff Board for fibre, namely, 250 tons, is already being produced. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that waterretting of flax was done only by low-class relabour, and was confined to Russia.",54
203,Mr GULLETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,I said that the bulk of it was done in Russia. I know that some is still done in Northern Ireland and in,55

Most of the Australian flax be either chemically retted, or decake, corticated by mechanical means. Both these methods have been recently developed, and are much less costly and more effective than the older methods of bogretting and dew-retting. The bog and dew retting methods previously employed in' Victoria were chiefly responsible for the failure of the flax industry there. I am convinced that this industry is on the eve of a new era of prosperity. 1! convened a conference in Melbourne a couple of months ago, at which all the flax interests in Australia were repre sented. The Victorian Minister of Agriculture and his experts were present, and we discussed the possibility of the bounty being of lasting benefit to the Commonwealth. I am satisfied that this measure will have most beneficial results.",55

206,Mr FORDE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The members of that conference, some of whom were growers, have the interests of the flax industry at heart.

208,Mr FORDE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That aspect of the industry has been investigated by experts, and it has been found that the dual purpose plant is most suitable for Australia.
