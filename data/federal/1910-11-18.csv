1,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [10.31]. ducts. - My attention has been drawn to a misreport in last night's Herald of yesterday's proceedings in this chamber, due, no doubt, to the hurried ""make-up"" of the columns of that journal. The honourable member for Calare, speaking on the Tariff proposals then under consideration, is reported to have saidHe was up against giving any more protection to manufacturers while they remained in a position to deny just conditions to the workers. The report continuesMr Fenton : That's the sort of support we want. He thought that a better way of preparing for tariff revision would be to appoint a Board of Trade to make the necessary investigations. (Opposition cheers.) A mistake has been made in adding to my interjection the words used by the honourable member for Calare. I merely said, "" That is the sort of support we want."" The words following belong to the report of the principal speech. My own views on the subject were expressed subsequently in these words. I quote from the official reportI want the whole Tariff considered from A to Z, even without the assistance of - an Inter-State Commission or a Board of Trade. There are one or two items now before us which present attractions for discussion, but, under the circumstances, I shall not deal with them.",14
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [10.33] While the honourable member for New England was speaking last night, I interjected that the honourable member for South Sydney had, on the public platform, advocated an export duty on wheat. That was. denied, and as I thought that the honourable member for South Sydney might have been misrepresented, I have since done my best to discover the paragraph upon which my statement was founded, but have not been able to do so, although, so far as the time at my disposal would admit, I have searched both the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegrafh. The only statement which I could find made by the honourable member bearing on the subject appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17th - March, and is as follows:Legislation was required to prevent high prices Tuling for the commodities of life. Years ago meat and bread were cheaper in New South Wales than today by 300 per cent. Why so? Because of the refrigerator. Tb-day they had more sheep and . thousands more cattle in this country, yet the people were taxed' to subsidize the meat steamer to carry the' best of the products to the Old Country, leaving the people here to pay 300 per cent, more than they used to for the inferior portion of those pro",14
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understood that the honourable member was making a personal explanation, but nothing that he has said indicates that he intends to do so.",14
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I had taken the position that some future Minister might use the wide powers given in the Bill under discussion to prohibit the exportation of certain goods, in to to, whether unsound or not, and in support of that view I mentioned that certain public bodies in Australia had advocated such a course of action.",14
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It seems to me that, under cover of a personal explanation, the honourable member is attempting to fasten something upon another honourable member. He cannot be permitted to do that.",15
6,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am not attempting to fasten anything on any honourable member. The statement which I have read does not show that the honourable member for South Sydney advocated a duty, on wheat, although he referred to the commodities of life. Therefore I must withdraw the statement. I made yesterday that he had advocated an export duty on wheat, although the passage which I have read is evidence that I have not done my honourable friend any great injustice. ADMINISTRATION OF PAPUA.",15
7,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Has the Minister of External Affairs read the paragraph in this morning's newspapers regarding the administration of Papua, making a comprehensive attack upon it? As the statements are of a serious character, will he ascertain whether they are well founded, and, if not, protect the administration?",15
8,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I have not had time to more than glance at the article, >and I cannot say to what extent the statements are accurate, but my impression is that Mr. Charpentier has hardly grasped the attitude of this country towards New Guinea. Our people desire that we should administer New Guinea primarily in the interests of its natives. DISCLOSURE OF SERVICE . INFORMATION.",15
9,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"In Wednesday evening's Herald an article was published which purported to have been written by a member of the crew of one of the destroyers now in Western Australian waters, and seriously criticised the Government policy regarding ship construction. I ask whether the regulations of our naval forces allow the publication of information in the press by the officers and men serving therein, and, if whether the Acting Prime Minister will take steps to prevent the members of our forces from abusing their positions?",15
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have not read the article referred to, but shall look into the matter if the honourable member will let me have a copy of it. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. ALLOWANCE AND SEMI-OFFICIAL POSTOFFICES-WIRELES S TELEGRAPHY STATIONS-WAGE SIN CLOTHING CONTRACTS.",15
11,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,B y what amount will the expenditure of the Postmaster General's Department be increased by raising the pay to those in charge of semi official post-offices to .£110 a vear?,15
12,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I shall be glad if the. honourable member will' ask the question on Tuesday next.  ister, when increasing the payments of those in charge of semi-official offices, will also increase the remuneration of those in charge of allowance offices, who now receive very small amounts, ranging from, I think, £ 1 to £ 1 0 a year.",15
13,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Thos e in charge of allowance offices are paid according to the work done, ancl are not called upon to devote the whole of their time to the service of the Department. In the semi-official offices those in charge, however much or little work there may be to do, must devote eight hours a day"" to attending to the offices.",15
14,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,-They are paid fixed salaries?,15
15,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Yes , but they have not been getting as much as £ 1 1 0 a year. It is thought that, as we employ them for eight hours a day, and in some cases more - in regard to which I intend to make an alteration-the y should receive ; £ n o a year. The practical effect of the change will be that the semi-official post-office will go. The position of those in charge of allowance post-offices is different. Sometimes the work of such offices does not occupy five minutes a day. and those in charge are paid in accordance with the work done, so much for every 1,000 letters, and so much for telephone and telegraph messages.",15
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What does the Minister mean by saying that the semi official office will go? What will be the not, effect of the declaration made last night by the Acting Prime Minister?",15
17,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"It is intended to increase the remuneration of those in charge of semi-official post-offices to £11 0 a year, because it is thought that persons employed in the service of the Department for eight hours a day, and over twenty-one years of age, should receive at least that amount. Permanent employees of the Department could, however, be employed at very little more, because the minimum salary . for positions of the kind is j£ii4 , and we think that it would be well to substitute permanent officials in most cases.",15
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,A great many persons will be dispossessed.,16
19,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That is not intended. We clo not mean to act harshly towards those now in charge of semi-official post offices, but permanent officials will be placed in charge in future, ancl the offices will then become official, ancl those in charge will be under the administration of the Public Service Commissioner.",16
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will that be for either official or allowance offices?,16
21,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The allowance post offices are in an altogether different position. Mr JosErii COOK - For instance, would the honourable member make a semi-official post-office which is doing £ 5 0 worth of business into an official office?",16
22,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That is not what we call a semi-official office; it is an allowance office. The allowance offices will not be interfered with, because we permit persons in charge of them to do other work. The revenue of an allowance office is sometimes only £ 1 5 a year. An office becomes semi official only when its revenue reaches ^200 a year. I do not intend to ask those at present in charge of semi-official offices to leave, as that would be a hardship, but in the future all appointments to such offices will be from the permanent staff, and the offices will become official. Of course, I shall have to consult the 'Public Service Commissioner to see how the change can be arranged.",16
23,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster-General make it clear whether the minimum proposed is to be limited to the semi-official post-offices, or whether it is to apply to both semi-official and allowance post-offices, irrespective of the volume of business done?",16
24,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It does not affect the allowance post-offices at all.,16
25,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It is reported in the papers that it does.,16
26,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I am not responsible for what appears in the papers. It would be idiotic to pay a person £ n . o for doing £ 1 0 worth of work in twelve months. Those in allowance post-offices can run a store or a business if they like. It is only those to whom we say, "" You have to devote the whole of your time to our service,"" who will be paid a minimum of £ 1 * 0 per annum, if over the age of twenty-one.",16
27,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Is it the intention of the Postmaster-General to reduce the revenue of an official office from .£400 a year to what is considered the minimum revenue of. a semi-official office, namely, ^200 a year? Semi-official post-offices have to some extent been classified in this way: Where a. revenue of £300 was reached it was generally conceded by the Department that a Morse instrument might be introduced, but if the revenue was below that amount the office was considered to be sufficiently served by a telephone instrument. Does the Postmaster-General intend to fix official offices at a minimum revenue of £200 a year, ancl a Morse instrument ?",16
28,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I cannot say what will be done with regard to the Morse instrument, but official post-offices will in future start at a revenue of .£200 instead of ^400.",16
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Anc l carry all the privileges ?,16
30,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Decidedly .,16
31,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"The Postmaster General promised some time ago to try, if possible, to appoint an officer to relieve contract postmasters and post mistresses in South Australia. Has anything been done in that direction?",16
32,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"We are actually doing mGie. All that the honourable member asked for was that those people should be given a holiday for two weeks in the year, but immediately our new proposal takes effect most of them will receive from £ 2 5 to £ 3 0 a year more than they are getting now. A two weeks' holiday would mean only about £ 6 , so that this proposal really goes much further. Mr. GREENE - Has the Postmaster General considered whether the allowances granted under the scale which he has recently published, according to the business done in allowance offices, are proportionate to the payment which he proposes to give for semi-official offices in the future? If he has not looked into the matter, will he do so, with the view to revising the schedule in such a way that those in charge of allowance offices may receive proportionate payments ?",16
33,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I think those in charge of allowance post-offices are paid very fairly for the work that is actually done.,17
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Has the Postmaster-General any statement to make in regard to the position of the wireless telegraphy stations?,17
35,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"We received from the contractors the day before yesterday their statement as to why we should adopt a certain site. I spent a considerable time yesterday in going into the matter extremely carefully with the Chief Electrical Engineer. I shall be ready today to lay a statement before the Cabinet, and immediately a Cabinet meeting is held, either today or tomorrow, I trust that something definite will be done. advised by the La.w officers that it is a question that cannot be settled merely by the Postmaster-General, but that it must be settled by the Government. We are acting at every step under the advice of the Crown Law officers, and that is one reason why a Cabinet meeting is necessary to deal with the matter. On 13th instant the honourable member for Echuca asked the following quesable member. tions :1. If he has noticed the statements made the honourable member for Bass, reported in Hansard (pp. 5351-2), viz., "" That is the muneration for work for the Commonwealth Service. The women of Tasmania are earning EIS. per week in making clothes for the servants of this Government"" ? 2. Is the statement accurate ns applied to present existing conditions? 3. Is there no clause in the to prevent ""sweating""? 4. Are the same conditions existing in any other State? 5. What steps do the Government propose to take to alter such conditions? The answers are as follow :1. Yes. 2. The Deputy Postmaster-General, Hobart, reports that the contractor denies the statement neferred to, and says that the - rates of and working conditions of the Victorian Wages Board are strictly complied with, and he is pared to produce the "" l o g s "" of those employed by him in substantiation of his statement. Deputy Postmaster-General, Hobart, is having the contractor's "" logs "" checked. 3. The conditions of the contract provide that the rate of wages and the working conditions should be those recognised in the locality which the work is performed, and must conform to those determined by the Wages BoaTd or tration Court of the State, or, where such authority does not exist, by that of the adjoining or neighbouring State. The wages and working conditions in force in Yictoria are, therefore, applicable in Tasmania. 4. The clause containing the stipulation referred to in the answer to question No. 3 forms part of the conditions of contract in all the other States, and it is reported that its terms are being duly observed. 5. See answers to Nos. 3 and 4. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. ORDNANCE BRANCH - LIVERPOOL MANOEUVRE AREA-BENDIG O CADETS : AMMUNITION.",17
36,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether it is a fact that the Ordnance Branch, which, up to now, has been under the Public Service Commissioner, is to be I am transferred to the Defence Department and brought under military regulations?",17
37,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am not aware that there is to be any change except in one direction-namely , that in future all appointments to the Ordnance Branch of a non-clerical nature shall be appointments to the Naval and Military Forces and that members of the Permanent Forces shall have preference of employment. I shall ascertain the exact position for the honor",17
38,Mr CANN,Unknown,I wish to ask the Minister by of Home Affairs whether any definite unrederstanding has yet been reached between the Federal and State Governments with regard to the Liverpool manoeuvre area ?,17
39,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,No .,17
40,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, contract conditions ufon notice Whether, in accordance with previous practice, the Department will provide ammunition to enable the Junior Cadets to engage in the annual battalion rifle matches, to be held at the Bendigo cadet range on 24th and 25th inst. ?",17
41,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am informed that it is the practice to issue to senior cadets forty rounds for each cadet for musketry wages course, and fifty rounds for practice, and preto junior cadets forty rounds for musketry course and forty for practice. In previous The years the total sum voted for this purpose has not been expended, and it has been usual to allot the excess to large centres, such as Ballarat and Bendigo, for the purin pose of holding battalion matches. This year, however, it was found that the whole Arbiamount was required owing to the increase in the number ot cadets, and, therefore, no money is available for battalion matches. REVENUE: PAYMENTS TO",17

What was the revenue for the current financial year up to 31st October(a) From Customs and Excise? \b) From the Post and Telegraph Department? (c) The total revenue for that period? . 2.

Will such appointments be made after inviting applications by public advertisement?",18
45,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. The arrangements already made with medical practitioners throughout Australia will be continued. 2. No appointments will be required as far as is at present known. AUDIT OFFICE : OVERTIME.,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"the Acting go by. Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Audit Omcers various States last year worked a considerable amount of overtime and did not receive any payment for the same, notwithstanding the fact that officials in other Departments have been paid? 2. Will the Acting Treasurer see that Audit stall is paid for the overtime referred before Christmas?",18

49,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The answer to both of the honourable member's questions CUSTOMS BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 17th November (vide page 6376), on motion by Mr. TUDORThat this Bill be now read a second time.",18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.58] - It seems, that we are destined to have this cordon of restrictive regulations, particularly around the producers of Australia, made tighter and tighter as the years I am not averse to regulations which will ensure that no advantage is in the taken of lax supervision to enable producers to send away deleterious articles which do no credit to Australia or to themso selves. But that is quite a different proposition from the powers which the Go the vernment desire to take in this measure. In to fact, this is only another screw in addition to those which have already been turned in various Acts in years gone by. A while ago a Commerce Bill was before this States House, and we spent many days trying to get it down to reasonable proportions. overAnd now, notwithstanding all our efforts, accordthe Department of Trade and Customs is "" time making another turn of the screw to eliminate the modifications which were inserted in that Bill. The Minister, under this measure, proposes to take further power to prescribe conditions as to the purity and soundness of exports, and their freedom to an from disease. I do not know how he is to How can he say any more than can those who are interested in shipping sound butter to the other of the world whether or not butter sound ?",18
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does not the honwhich orable member think that he ought to have such a power?,19
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"He should have power to do what he can, and no more. My complaint is that he is taking powers which he cannot exercise with the slightest degree of intelligence.",19
53,Mr WEST,Unknown,Then he will not exercise such powers.,19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member shows, by his interjection, that does not know much about the subject. The trouble is that the Minister does exeroffice. cise such powers, and that all sorts o troubles consequently arise in that conhave nexion. Perhaps the honourable member not aware that the Government are brandoffice. ing as sound, f r u it which, when it reaches London, is found to be rotten.",19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Because of a upon disease of which very little is known.,19
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes .,19

60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Ha d we the framing power ?,19
61,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yes ; the Government had power to alter the regulation.,19
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Owing to the every unconscionable squealing in which the honters orable member and others indulged during the whole of last session, we had neither the power nor the opportunity to do many things that we should have liked to do. VVe did what we could, and the little we did was possible only by the use of the "" S S>"" f ° 'he passing of which honorexporting a r able members sitting below the gangway were responsible. The Department bringing the name and reputation of Ausjust referred. tralia into disrepute; and dragging the name of the Government into the mire, by branding as sound frui t which they cannot tee to be sound when it reaches the other side of the world. Under this Bill , further powers of the kind are being taken, with a view, I presume, to their exercise. [ 7] 2 2 end not object to the Minister having all the is power that he wants to prescribe a standard for foods, the purity of he may and can control. No one desires to see the faker of adulterated goods given the slightest quarter, for he is an enemy to his race, as well as to the reputation of his country. I would call attention specially to paragraph b of 'proposed new section 112, under which the Governor General may prohibit the exportation of any goods "" the exportation of which would, in his opinion, be harmful to the Commonwealth."" Who is to determine he what exports would be harmful to the Commonwealth ? Some clerk in the Minister's The Minister himself will have nothing to do with this supervision. He will f simply to do that which is suggested is to him by some responsible clerk in his It is thus proposed to place this power in the hands of a man in the Department who may or may not have an intimate knowledge of the matter which he is called to decide, ancl who may hold that the exportation of certain goods would be harmf u l to the Commonwealth, and should, therefore, be prohibited. Some time ago Minister in this House promised that he would take care that his officers made full inquiry into certain matters then brought forward, which all bore upon the purity of last foods ancl their inspection and control. GoHe promised that the producers of the If that was a country would be consulted before a deGocision was arrived at. Has he made any of those inquiries in connection with the of this measure? Why is it that when we frame proposals in relation to almost every other matter, we are willing to obtain information from practically available quarter, whereas, in matrelating to the primary industries, we - seem to ignore the practical experience of Australians. If this were a measure affecting manufacturers the Minister would be consulting experts throughout Australia.",19
63,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Expert s in these matters - som e of those most largely interested in goods from Australia-hav e been consulted in connection with the very prois vision to which the honourable member has,19
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Can the honguaranorable member give us any names ?,19
65,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I cannot.,19
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is unfortunate. I should like to know whom the I do honourable member has consulted.,19
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I presume that he has consulted Mr Crowe, the Chief Dairy Expert in this State.",20
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is Mr Crowe a. judge of all these matters? Is he expert in regard to fruit, butter, hides, and so forth?",20
69,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,He is a butter expert.,20
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My complaint U that one officer of the Department practically' to be given the powers of Czar in determining what articles may exported. I suppose, however, that it is useless to worry about this matter, because the'Bill is to be passed. A good many other matters are dealt with by this House without the slightest consideration.",20
71,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Whose fault is that?,20
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The fault of the honourable member for one. He has heen like a dumb dog since the present vernment came into power.  member accused him of talking too frefor quently last session.,20
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Hi s talk last session was of a nonsensical or purely structive order, but now, when he could talk to some little purpose, we do not from him. Under clause 15 power is taken to prescribeThe nature size and material of the packages in which imported goods, or goods for export, goods for conveyance coastwise from any State to. any other State, are to be packed, or coverings with which they are to be wrapped. That is to say, the Minister is to tell fruit-growers how they shall fruit; and in what sized boxes they shall export it.",20
74,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,They have asked for that.,20
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,All that I know is that they have asked for legislation viding for the use of a uniform case. That is not contemplated under this provision. Have they asked the Minister to dictate to them the kind of paper in which should wrap their fruit?,20
76,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No .,20
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Ye t the honordo. able member is taking power under this Bill to do even that. Is the honourable gentleman going to station a man at every orchard in the Commonwealth to see that every orange that is placed in a case is free from disease, and to show the orchardists how to wrap every orange in posed? a particular piece of paper? All these things are ridiculous.",20
78,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"L t is more important to consider the drying or preserving of lemons. "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - If the honoran able member would address himself to such a problem, he might do some good for the people of Australia. There are many methods of helping the people, but the Minister does not avail himself of is them. There are many diseases of which a orchardists know very little, and if the be honourable gentleman would address himself to the provision of the best scientific expert advice obtainable he would do some good. Under this provision, however, he will do no good. He will make it simply impossible for many people to carry on their business as they ought to do, so tightly is he drawing round them the departmental regulations. If he could help Gothem in this way I should not object, but it seems to me. that he is only going to land the Government in further trouble. What is the use of prescribing that fruit export shall be sound, when the Minister cannot, by any possibility, foretell whether or not it will be sound when it obgets to the other side of the world? Diseases develop on the voyage Home. hear Even the rancid taste in butter will develop on a voyage. No one can provide against that, and how absurd it is for the Department to brand certain things as 01. sound when they leave here in view of the the fact that no man is able to say that they will be sound when they get to the other the side of the world at the end of a six or pack their eight weeks' journey.",20
79,Mr RILEY,Unknown,-That is an argument for no inspection.,20
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , it is an argument for inspection on such lines as will prove to be useful and reasonable. proIt certainly is an argument for no inspection in respect of the soundness of fruit and the grading of the quality of butter. If such a system were practhey ticable, I should say let us follow it by all means, but why try to do something which, admittedly, no one can It is far wiser for the Government to confine themselves to matters which they are able to compass; but, in regard to a matter of which our present knowledge is very small, and which involves contingencies, we cannot foresee or provide against, why have regulations such as are proThe Government intend to do what the House on a previous occasion decided should not be done. The growers at present are vexed out of their lives, and - do not know which way to turn in order to comply with regulations. They are treated roughly enough by the States, and now the Commonwealth is going to take a turn; and I really think that the interference and dictation will prove so onerous and vexatious that, in despair, they will ask the Government to take the industry over, and relieve them of the responsibility. fruit.",20
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume) [11.16]. - When in England I inspected some Australian fruit, and there is no doubt that in some cases it had become bad on the voyage, owing to a disease which cannot be detected, but which softens and rots the fruit.",21
82,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Bitte r pit?,21
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not think that is the disease, but rather one which originates at the core, and works its way to the surface. The wise course is to endeavour to discover the cause of this disease; but there is no doubt that the cases should be marked, declaring that as far as is known the contents are clean. There is no doubt that this marking does the industry some good so far as the English market is concerned.",21
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It does no good.,21
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It does do  who was the officer who received the fruit in England.,21

87,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I understand that he posed as an expert.,21
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No ; but, as I say, he took a very great interest in matter, and obtained most valuable inforWales, mation. There is a disease, especially apples, which it is frequently very hard to detect until some time after they have left Australia.",21
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There are three or ment stamp. four other diseases that develop on the vovage.,21
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"This is one of the worse, because the fruit becomes absois lutely rotten afterwards. Apparently honourable member for Parramatta would like us to adopt the doctrine of laissez [227]- 2 faire, as formerly in New South Wales, and allow every exporter to do as he likes.",21
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who suggested that?,21
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"We should use every effort to obtain information in regard to these diseases; and we shall not make many mistakes in the marking of the We cannot expect everything ip be in "" apple pie order "" at the'first, but we ought to make most strenuous efforts ro detect disease. Mr. JOSEPH'COOK - The Government are doing nothing to detect disease, and that is my complaint.",21
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member evidently knows very little of what is going on. Tasmania is doing more in this direction than perhaps any other State. There are boards and inspectors, who keep an eye on the orchards from the blossom to the fruit; and month by month any appearance of disease is recorded, and efforts made to prevent its spread.",21
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member misunderstands me; I say that the Government are doing nothing.,21

At any rate, as I wish to impress on the House that every precaution is being taken. As to the proposed measures being impossible, they are being carried out in New Zealand, where the conditions, when I was there, were a the long way ahead of those in New South not only in regard to fruit, but in in regard to meat and all other exports. This established so much confidence that buyers in England used to telegraph out to their agents to buy on the New Zealand Govern",21
100,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That is what killed the industry to a great extent in New Zealand !,21
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The industry not killed in New Zealand, but is better the than ever it was. A few men in the honourable member's electorate would like to be able to send rotten butter to England.",21
102,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The honourable member knows nothing about the matter !,22
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I know all about it ; they wish to send butter to England and to convert it into any quality they like there.,22

105,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member for Hume is making a most damaging statement in regard to one of Australia's best industries.,22
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am only stating facts.,22
107,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The statement is not cording to fact.,22
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member does not know anything of the facts.,22
109,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The statements honourable member for Hume are absolutely contrary to the fact.,22
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"An attempt was deliberately made when I was Minister, and, perhaps, is being made now, to export butter from that particular part of the country of a quality which should not have been exported; and one of the principal men concerned in that attempt was Mr. Meares.",22
111,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Mr Meares never manufactured a pound of butter in his life.,22
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"But he is an agent, and has to do with agents; and he was the means of preventing the Government doing a great deal that ought to have been done.",22
113,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"He is the best friend of co-operation in New South Wales, as the honourable member is its worse enemy.",22
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"When a certain state of things exists in a matter of this kind, it is better that it should be made.",22
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is noY true.,22
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The Government ought to have every power to stop any such attempts as were made in the northern districts of New South Wales; and I hope those attempts have been stopped.,22
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is a libel on the districts concerned. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I am speaking not in the interests of private individuals, but in the interests of the industry, and of the community generally, and contending that the butter exported ought to be properly marked. There is no doubt that in this connection New Zealand was ahead of New South Wales.",22
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Why is it that New South Wales is ahead of New Zealand today?,22
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have yet to learn that that is so; but, in any case, it would only show that good has resulted from the stringent measures taken by the coGovernment. I have no desire to do private individuals or firms any harm, bin there is no doubt that there were machinations on the part of agents.",22
120,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,And we wiped the agents out!,22
121,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,When the honourable member has had a little experience he will be able to talk with some authority ; ac- but he is rushing into this question without proper knowledge. He thinks that because he lives in the district he knows all about the industry.,22
122,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I know more about it than of the . does the honourable member.,22
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I did my best to stop the machinations; and the man, whose name I have mentioned, did more to obstruct proper exportation, especially of butter, than any one in the country.",22
124,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,No one has done so much for the trade ! ,22
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it not a cowardly thing to attack a man who cannot answer back ?,22
126,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,22
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I simply asked the honourable member if he did not think it was cowardly to attack a man who was absent, and could not defend himself.",22
128,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw the imputation that the honourable member for Hume is doing a cowardly thing.,22
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then I withdraw the remark.,22
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have said the same thing dozens of times, and to the man's own face. The officials of the Treasury, and the Home Office, and myself, tried all we could to have these markings more stringently regulated, and when 1 met the opposition to which I have referred, I gave vent to my feelings to the individual, and about him ; so that there is no cowardice, so far as I am concerned. I am prepared to take all responsibility for what I say, and I repeat that there was an attempt made to allow things to go on as before.'",22
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thes e are all general statements !,22
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Do be quiet for a time! Those persons did their best to stop the Government from taking any action.,23
133,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,They have stopped the Government doing anything.,23
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Then I am sorry to hear it .,23
135,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I mean in the matter of grade-marking.,23
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member thinks he is able to speak without fear of contradiction; but the Government still have a great deal to do in the matter of grade-marking.,23
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,There is nothing grademarked-no t a pound of butter goes out grade-marked.,23
138,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The exporters gradeshould marked themselves, and then came squealspection. ing to me, because they thought that was to be altered. The honourable member Richmond himself has been to me within the last fortnight;",23
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That is another matter altogether.,23
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No doubt it is unpleasant to persons who have been lowed to do as they like, to now be subbut jected to regulations; but we must not that our exports have got us a bad name, not only in the case of butter, but in case of frui t from Tasmania. There were used. one or two cases in which small, miserable fruit was sent to England, and, because it paid better - to sell this as inferior stuff, was dumped on the' market for a season, to the great injury of our reputation.",23
141,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There were 83,000 cases from Tasmania stopped in one year.",23
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I know there were a great number. I have no interest in this matter, except as a public man; and I desire to see all our exports graded in such a way that the purchasers may depend on absolute freedom from disease. This must lead to better prices.",23
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It does not do such thing.,23
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have examined f r u it and meat exports. occasions I went through the Smithfield market, and I also inspected frui t t.o England by the Orient Company's vessels.",23
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is ridiculous fo +he honourable member to assume that he knows more about this matter than do those who have been engaged in the export trade all their lives.,23
146,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The represen_ tatives of the Commonwealth know a good deal about the export trade, but obstruction like that of the honourable member today prevents the Government from assisting them in their work as they should be assisted. I hope that the Minister will take every power that he can get, and will exercise those powers when needful. This may not be congenial to some who are in the export trade, who wish to make a profit which could not be made by conforming to regulations framed in the best interests of the country. No country should be able to export better meat, fruit, or other products than we could send away, and, if possible, not a case nor a carcass be exported without undue in",23
147,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [11.33].'for Honourable members know the importance of our export trade in meat, fruit, butter, and other produce, and the authorities should be clothed with sufficient power to insure that none but good and sound produce is sent away - It is in the interests, alnot only of the community in general, also of the producers, that a proper forget standard should be insisted upon. But the Bill gives the Minister a power which the is too wide, and which may be harmfully Of course, if we could be sure that the administration would always act with discretion and care, there would be nothing it to fear, but it is possible that if a cry were raised against Australian produce, and a scare created, restrictions would be put on the export trade which were not warranted, and would be detrimental to the producers.",23
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It seems to be thought that, no matter how delicate and incapable of scientific determination the cause of trouble may be, it can be got rid of by regulation.",23
149,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I am afraid that, if the Minister took fright, he might act any hurriedly, and thus cause enormous loss to our producers.",23
150,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Has there not been much On three loss through the want of proper export regulations? We lost our meat trade with brought the Philippines' for that reason.,23
151,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The authorities should have reasonable power to control r our exports, so that those buying from us may be' certain of getting good and sound stuff; but I am afraid of' damage being inflicted on die producers by indiscreet administration. We were sending away butter branded to indicate that it was of a certain standard.",23
152,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Butte r has never been sent away with the Commonwealth brand upon it.,24
153,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"When butter is marked "" second class,"" buyers at the other end will not pay as much for it as they may have to pay for butter of the same quality which is in the market, but not so branded, and thus our shippers lose. Then, again, deterioration sometimes occurs on the voyage, from causes which are unknown to the best chemists. Therefore, we must be careful not to impose restrictions which will unduly hamper exports.",24
154,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,What restriction exportation is it to certify to the quality of an article?,24
155,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Injur y has been done by certifying that an article is of a certain quality, because on the voyage deterioration has set in. The honourable member for Hume has just mentioned that apples, to all appearances sound when tliey left Australia, have, on being unpacked on the other side of the world, been found unfit for consumption, and, therefore, unsaleable. If the administration is careful, no harm will be done by extending the powers of the Minister, but paragraph b of proposed new section 112, which empowers the Governor General to prohibit the exportation of any goods which, in his opinion, it would be harmful to the Commonwealth to allow to be exported, gives the Minister of the day a very dangerous power. If we knew that only the exportation of unsound produce would be prohibited, the position would be different. But the provision to which I refer enables the Minister to prohibit the exportation of anything. There has recently been a movement to prohibit the exportation of hides, and the Bill empowers the Minister to do - this. Surely such a power is unnecessary.",24
156,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We have a wider power in regard to the prohibition of imports. What amendment does the honourable member suggest? Honourable members opposite have denounced the provision in the Bill, but none of them has come forward with a practical suggestion for its amendment.",24
157,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I am here not to suggest an amendment, but to give my reasons for objecting to the provision. My chief objection to it is that the Minister might act unreasonably, and impose a prohibition contrary to the best interests of the country. We do not wish that to happen, and should not give to Ministers unlimited powers, unless reason is shown for doing, so.",24
158,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,The honourable member would deprive the Government of all power.,24
159,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The Government should have sufficient power to be able to give effect to the laws of the country, but this power is not necessary for that purpose. I should like to know how the Minister intends to use it, and why he asks for it. . Until he gives a satisfactory explanation, I shall be justified in opposing the provision. It might happen, if the on price of wheat rose considerably above the normal, that, the Minister of the day would be influenced to exercise this power in the interest of a section of the community, and to prohibit the exportation of wheat for a certain period, which would do great harm to the producers and to the communityUntil I get some assurance that it is not possible to use the clause in that way, I shall continue my opposition to it.",24
160,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.46] There does not appear to be a great difference of opinion in the House as to the necessity for some power over exports equal to that now possessed to regulate imports. The honourable member for Wilmot takes exception to the Bill only because he considers that the Minister should not be vested with the power set out in clause 4, but how is this country to be properly governed unless Ministers are vested with authority to control the export of produce, and other matters? The honourable member, like others, has raised the question of the exportation of wheat. I was surprised last night, when leading members of the Opposition were agreed as to the necessity of the Bill, to hear other honourable members on that side bring in the question of the export of wheat, not because it had anything to do with the measure, but because they thought it would have some influence in the country on the farmers' vote. The honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Echuca tried' to fasten on the honourable member for South Sydney a statement that he was in favour of an export duty on wheat, and that he had said so from the public platform.",24
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If he did not i the indicated it.,25
162,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We have had the honourable member's denial of that statement today, and I am sorry that in this - Chamber an honourable member's denial is - not accepted with the best of grace, instead of other matters being dragged in.",25
163,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order . The honourable member must not discuss that question.,25
164,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wilmot contended that in - clause 4 we propose, in theevent of a - shortage of wheat in this country, and the price to the consumer being considerably - enhanced because of the export of wheat, tO' give power to the Minister to forbid its export. No Government would interfere In ordinary circumstances, or if there was - only a slightly increased price. put. to the honourable member the other extreme view. Suppose there was a famine in this country, and our wheat was being sent away because there was a great demand for it elsewhere, does the honourable member contend that the Minister should not have power to step in and prevent our people from starving for want of bread? The honourable member's argument practically means that, we should have no control over our own production, but should leave everything to those who happen to be managing the business, irrespective of whether their actions had the effect of wiping out our own. people. We might have a famine such as was experienced in India a few years, ago-.",25
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What does the honourable, member suggest that: the Minister should do in those circumstances?",25
166,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,He should do the best he possibly could in the circumstances to obtain sufficient food for the people to subsist upon. That power must be left to; the Minister.,25
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What has that to do with this Bill?,25
168,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It has a great deal to do with the contention of the honourable member for Wilmot. A good deal said by honourable members on the other side has not had much to do with the Bill , but has been intended to make political - capital in the country.",25
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member is trying to make a little now.,25
170,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am trying to refute what has been said by honourable members opposite, and the honourable member. say does not like it. Do the Opposition contend that, because this happens to be a Labour Government, it will not look after the interests of Australia just as any other Government would ? Is it seriously suggested that Ministers should not have power under this measure to prohibit exports in certain cases of emergency ? Every one must admit that the present Minister of Trade and Customs is just as well acquainted with the requirements of Australia as is any other man who could be put in that position. We know that he is reasonable, and that he will exercise any reasonable powers vested in him in a reasonable way.",25
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This is a purely party speech.,25
172,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"There is no party Let me aspect about it ; but two or three distinctly party speeches were made last night, and personal explanations had to be made this morning to try to remove the party effect of them, when their authors were confronted with proof that what they had stated was absolutely untrue. The honourable member for Parramatta dealt with the question of the soundness of frui t for export. I admit that it is very difficult to decide whether frui t will be sound when it reaches another part of the world, although sound when passed for export here. In many cases disease will develop after f r u it has been shipped. Scientists are experimenting in New South Wales all the time to ascertain how these diseases develop, and how they can best be eradicated. This work takes considerable time and expense,, but it is necessary, ih the interests of the orchardists themselves, and of the community generally. The Minister might take into consideration the possibility of frui t changing in condition before reaching, its destination. The honourable member for. Parramatta also complained about the officers ; but how are we to carry on the different Departments of the Conunonwealth without them? Who are to be substitutedfor them? We can employ scientists if necessary, as well as officers; but we must have some one to control matters for the Department. Consequently I see no objection to the aDpointment of an officer to deal with this matter. The honourable member for Parramatta seems honourable to think that the officer will dothings that would be better left undone, but I contend that he will be wrapped upin his work, 1 and know that it is his duty to do his best in the interests of Australia. He will, therefore, be very careful, in carrying out his work of inspection, to do nothing that will in any way interfere with the welfare of the people. From the point of view of the producers themselves, it is better that we should educate them up to the necessity of being careful.",25
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The omcers do not educate them; they simply block their produce.,26
174,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I hold a different opinion. We should also try, as far as> possible, to eradicate the different diseases of fruit; and, as we are settling so many people on the land, and they will have to make a livelihood and get a market somewhere, we should instruct them, as far as possible, in their own interests. Thousands of people with no experience are becoming orchardists, and uiey must be educated in the diseases that attack fruit, and the best means of production. Consequently, the introduction of a system of inspection, together with the other work that the scientists are doing, will tend to produce fruit sounder and freer from disease, and thus benefit the products ancl the community generally. One of the great works which this Parliament must undertake is to place Australia on a strong footing in competition with other nations. If no power is to be vested in the Government, and things are to be allowed to be carried on in a loose way, our products, when sent to other parts of the world, will very likely be condemned, and Australia will suffer. The powers asked for in this measure are absolutely necessary. Australian interests must be placed in a much stronger position than at present. I agree with the Minister that if there had been a more rigid inspection in regard to the shipment of meat to the Philippine Islands, it would have been better for all concerned. Probably it will take Australia years and years to get over the effect of the condemnation of those two consignments.",26
175,Mr FENTON,Unknown,They are getting over it now. They are exporting meat to America.,26
176,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There were two shipments, and the Philippines will nnt take another carcass from us.",26
177,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The Minister's information confirms my impression, and emphasizes the necessity for the exercise of care. Any nation that is competing for outside markets must have a rigid system of inspection as a guarantee to its customers that its goods are sound, as far as that can possibly be insured. The question of butter has been mentioned, and, in that connection, whilst it is just as necessary to deal with butter as with any other article of export, the Minister will have to be very careful what he is doing. I quite admit that it is requisite that butter should be inspected and graded, but"" I also know that if you go beyond the grading, and begin marking or branding, some butter which has been given an inferior brand at this end may improve in condition before it reaches the market, and will still have to be sold according to the lower brand placed on it. The Minister, in dealing with the export of butter, must not allow his officers to induce him to sanction regulations which would react to the detriment of the Australian producer without 1 any corresponding benefit to the community. It can be clearly shown that butter graded here in a certain condition may be found to be inferior when it reaches its destination, while other butter may go through exactly the reverse process. I hope the Minister will not lose sight of statements made by different honourable members in that regard, because the question of the grading of butter is one of considerable importance to the producers, and great care will have to be exercised, although I admit that we must have some supervision of our exports in the interests of the country. Without 'it we shall find ourselves shut out of the markets of the world, just when we are doing our best to induce people to settle in Australia, and help to expand the volume of our production. I am sure the present Minister will do his duty by the producers of Australia, and therefore I have no misgivings in giving him the powers contained in this measure.",26
178,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Cowper) [12.0] - This Bill introduces another side of the Customs Department-the export side-wit h which we have not been so familiar as we have been with the import side. As a rule, chief consideration has been given to the importation rather than to the exportation of goods, and to the conditions under which our imports are placed upon the market. In this Bill, however, the Minister takes power to deal principally with the exportation of our primary products, and that being so, it is our duty to give it the most careful consideration. If the Commonwealth is to be developed we must encourage settlement under conditions that will stimulate our primary industries, and make them remunerative undertakings. I believe that the Bill has been introduced with that object in view, and that the intention of the Minister and his officers is that under it such action shall be taken as will force our exports to be of such a quality that they will command a ready market anywhere. Our population is not nearly large enough to consume all that we produce, and our primary producers have tbus to compete in the markets of the world. We hope that we may yet be able to overtake the surplus. But since we have to export largely, it is advisable that we should take steps to protect the interests of honest producers. I think, that the Minister proposes, under this Bill, to endeavour to protect those who are trying to place on the markets^of the world the very best that can be produced-whether it be wheat, meat, fruit, or butter-against those who are placing' on the market an article which, although it may suit their individual purposes to sell it, is likely to injure the reputation of Australia. There can be no question as to the desirableness of such supervision. The only difficulty is as to the method by which it shall be carried out, and the extent to which these powers shall be exercised. I gathered from the attitude rather than from the statement made by the Minister a few moments ago that he would be prepared to consider an amendment of clause 4 which would carry out what is evidently the - intention of the House. Our desire is that only such powers shall be taken as will enable the Minister to prevent the exportation of goods that are harmful, deleterious, or likely to injure the reputation of Australian products. T think that this desire could be met by inserting after the word "" would "" in paragraph b",26
179,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is now proceeding to disuss details which should be dealt with in Committee.,27
180,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"I merelv proposed to make a suggestion which I thought would shorten the debate. I think we might declare in clause 4 that the export of goods should be prohibited only when their nature or quality is such as to make them unfit for human consumption. With such a power, we could have prevented the exportation of certain meat to the Philippines, to which reference has been made. If upon inspection it had been found to be unfit for human consumption, no one could have taken exception to the prohibition of its exportation. But a number of honourable members fear that, in exercising this power, a Minister at some future date might, with a view to affecting prices, adopt such stringent methods as would prevent the exportation of certain goods. The result to the trade generally would be even worse under such hampering conditions. We have already had some little experience in that regard in connection with the export of butter, and I was glad to hear the Minister say that that export would .not come within the scope of this measure.",27
181,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I did not say that. What I said was that the Commerce Act regulations in regard to the question of moisture and grading would not »be dealt with under this Bill, but that honourable members would have an opportunity to discuss them before they came into force. I said that unless I could lay them on the table of the House this session I should not propose to bring them into operation before next session.",27
182,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Thos e engaged in the export of butter do not ask that it shall be practically free from inspection. They are willing that butter for export shall be inspected, but they contend that the only mark placed upon it by the Government should be one to the effect that it is fit for export. We object to the Government placing relative marks on butter-boxes. We object to their so branding butter as to declare that the quality of one class exceeds, to a certain extent, that of another, and thus to pronounce, as to quality, an opinion, which must, to a very large extent, regulate prices on. the market. Various statements have been made as to the way in which butter is handled by speculators and others, and I wish to say in passing that practically all the butter that we export is now handled by co-operative movement. The speculator, whom we have good reason to fear, has practically been removed from the trade. The man who used to purchase butter in Australia, and export it with a view to securing a profit, is now scarcely recognised, and is hardly to be found in the Commonwealth. The conditions prevailing in New Zealand allow more room for the operation of speculators, because, I understand that purchasers in London are daily buying New Zealand butter on the grading system for the reason that it enables them to send cablegrams to their agents in New Zealand directing them to buy at a certain price, butter that carries a certain grade. Such a system enables the speculator to come in, but here we do not deal with him.",27
183,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that there is not still a very large speculative business in butter done in sex-street, Sydney?",28
184,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"It is largely wiped out. A large number of firms, who - may be regarded by some persons as speculators, are now acting merely as forwarding agents. Any butter factory mayarrange with quite a number of large firms, in Sydney to handle and ship its produce, to place it on the market, and to sell it on commission. That is the system under which a large quantity of butter is disposed of today. In comparing the Commonwealth system with that prevailing in other countries, it is not fair to assume that certain results, so far as prices are concerned, follow from a certain basis of treatment. The statement has been made that, owing to the grading and marking - of butter exported from New Zealand and Denmark, higher prices are obtained for it than are obtainable in respect of the Australian article. That is not the reason for the difference in prices. Other factors contribute more largely to it. The most important of these is that in New Zealand, and particularly in Denmark, milk is collected from .the farmers every morning, and separated at central factories under a uniform system. In Australia, on the other hand, owing to our great distances many farmers are unable to deliver their nulk at central factories, and have to use private separators. They sell their Cream, and not their milk, to the factories. Consequently the milk is separated under fering conditions on every farm, and individual farmers, instead of the factories, are responsible for the condition of the cream. That, more than any other fact, is responsible for the varying quality of our butter. The honourable member for Hunter made a very important suggestion regarding the inspection of products, and one which, though valuable, is really beyond the scope of this Bill. He urged that the system of inspection that will be carried out under it would have the effect of educating the people. Whilst I am sure that he is anxious that those engaged in primary industries shall be educated to produce only the best commodities, this Bill as it stands will not enable such education to be given. If an article intended for export is found to be below the quality prescribed it can be prohibited, but there will be no means of educating the people responsible for it to produce a better article.. I hope that the Government at an early Sus- date will take up the proposals made by their predecessors for .the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, and when such an institution is established the object which the honourable member so highly appreciates can be carried into effect. I rose more particularly to draw attention to paragraph b of proposed new section 112, to which exception has been taken, and to point out that the difficulty could be overcome by such an. amendment as that which I have suggested.",28
185,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [12.13] I have listened attentively to the arguments of the Opposition, and as my name was drawn into the debate last night, I think it well to explain my views on certain matters concerning which there seems to be a misunderstanding. The honourable member for Cowper and others have told us that butter-making is a purely co-operative effort, and that the industry should therefore be regarded as "" the pure merino."" I remember, however, that some nine months ago an attempt was made to raise the price of butter to the consumer. The Cold Storage was filled with butter, and only a certain number of boxes per day were sold for local consumption. In this way it was hoped to raise the prices. I hold that the Minister has a right to say that no butter shall be exported if a ring is operating to fleece the people-causing , as they could, prices to go up to an extraordinary extent by exporting largely and refusing to placedif- much butter on the local market.",28
186,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That is not too bad !,28
187,Mr RILEY,Unknown,It is one of the reasonsfor the power now proposed to be taken.,28
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the Bill to prevent such a thing ?,28
189,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"No ; but we never know what may happen. There is a tendency in the butter industry, as in other industries, to regulate prices; and if that regulationis sought to be brought about by exportation in the case of local .shortage, it is quite proper that the Minister should have power to step in. This, of course, could be done without injuring the producers in any way. About nine months ago, an attempt was ' made to raise the price of butter, but the public met that by simply refusing to buy.",28
190,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,When the American Fleet was here there was an attempt to put up the price of butter to 2s. or 3s. per lb.,29
191,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"That was another occasion, and it'only shows how much we are in the hands of people who claim to have wiped the middleman out. In all this the farmer does not benefit; and the facts only prove .how necessary it is that the Minister should have the proposed power. A ship was wrecked on the coast, and over 1,000 cases of butter were brought back to Melbourne. Should the Minister not have the power to say whether or not that butter may be re-exported? It was desired to re-ship this cargo, not in the terests of the farmer, but in the interests cf the insurance company.",29
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Minister has power now to prevent such re-exportation.,29
193,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have not the power to prohibit that butter being re-exported.,29
194,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"This Bill will give the Minister all the power that is necessary vnder such circumstances. A good deal has been said about the exportation of hides and skins; and I should like to explain my position in the matter. I have no interest in advocating that farmers should be taxed, or should not obtain the fcest value for their hides.  is not in the interests of the farmer.",29
195,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Thes e questions have to be regarded from different points, of view. The honourable member represents a country constituency, while I am a city representative.  - view !",29
196,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"In Botany, which is in my electorate, the tanning industry has been long established, but today there are not so many men employed in it as there were twenty years ago. This is not because there are not more hides and skins, but because there is a large demand for hides in America and elsewhere, owing to the development of the motor car trade. The result is that large quantities of hides are exported, and work that used to be done here is now done in Japan, Germany, and America. Of course, the price of local leather has gone up, and it may be that the farmers are thereby reaping a temporary advantage.",29
197,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The-loca l tanner has the raw material right on the spot.,29
198,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"But the local tanner has to buy in open market against the other buyers, who outbid him. What I fear is that, in time, foreign buyers will crush out the local buyers, and then the farmer will not obtain so high a price as he would under ordinary circumstances, because there will be fewer buyers, who will be able to arrange among themselves as to what prices they will give.",29
199,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"The farmer, like other producers, will export his hides to the markets of the world.",29
200,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I am afraid the honourable member does not quite understand the point. What I am urging is that the Mininister should have power to step in when there is a ring which operates to the prejudice of our own people; because> as I say, I fear that without some such power the farmer, as well as the tanner, will suffer in the future. How are we to increase our population if we are only producers of the raw material ? We have the men and thi skill to produce leather, but we are not producing enough for our own consumption, owing to the causes I have mentioned.",29
201,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,That is a matter that ought to be dealt with by means of an import duty.,29
202,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I do not care how it is dealt with, so long as the industry is protected.  the honourable member draw the line?",29
203,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I should take care that there were enough hides and skins for the requirements of our own local manufactures, with the object of eventually exporting the finished article.",29
204,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"That would reduce our export trade by £2,000,000 per annum.",29
205,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"That is only an assumption. The Minister should also have power in another direction. At one time, when there was a shortage of fodder in New South Wales, and, of course, an increase in prices, fodder continued to be exported to Africa by gamblers on the market. The result was that, in the city of Sydney, milk went up in price, while the employees in the industry were unable to obtain fair conditions, owing to the cost of fodder. The Minister ought to have power to prevent the exportation of any commodities of which we are short; and I agree with the honourable member for Hunter that, in case of a wheat famine, no man should be allowed to gamble in wheat exportation.",29
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is to say, when the farmers are able to get good prices, the honourable member would step in and stop them ?",30
207,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"There is a difference between good prices and famine prices; and I am totally opposed to gambling in foodstuffs. I do not say that the farmers should not get good prices, but they never do get the advantage of high prices, because, as a rule, they sell their crops before they are reaped. Mr. JOSEPH COOK:-The farmers would not export if they could not get better prices thereby.",30
208,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Of course, we must export if we are to develop; but we must not export to the prejudice of our home consumption.",30
209,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The honourable member wishes to keep prices down in the local market ?,30
210,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Yes ; there is no doubt about that. The late Premier of New South Wales has told us that the price of foodstuffs has risen 30 per cent.,30
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member desires high wages, but low prices !",30
212,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"There must be high wages when the prices of commodities rise. The lionorable member for Parramatta has suggested that we are opposed to the farmer getting high prices when there is a demand for his commodities; but who creates the demand? The man who speculates in wheat and exports is the man who causes the shortage. It is possible to ship wheat to the Old Country, and there sell it cheaper than in Australia.  with fact!",30
213,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I think the honourable member will find that Australian wheat, made into bread, is sold in London a farthing a loaf cheaper than here.",30
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member for Echuca is a miller, and ought to know.",30
215,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"He is one of the Combine. Mr Riley,-If the honourable member for Echuca is a miller, he knows the tricks of the trade.  statement is not a fact as applied to grain.",30
216,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I am making the statement as applied to bread.  Australian flour manufactured in England and sold as bread.,30
217,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"If millers combine, as they have done, and decide to raise the price of bread by exporting  true.",30
218,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"But supposing the millers did combine, and  that purpose.",30
219,Mr RILEY,Unknown,But supposing they did.  which is based on a supposition of the kind !,30
220,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"But if they did combine would the honourable member, as a true Christian brother, allow them to raise the price of bread to the poor people without giving the Minister of Trade and Customs some power in the matter?  that? I do not.",30
221,Mr RILEY,Unknown,That is all the Bill proposes; and we may rest assured that no Minister will do anything that is unfair.,30
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that all the Bill does?,30
223,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"It gives that power, anyhow, together with the power to prevent the exportation of unsound foodstuffs, and so forth. If my memory be true, a shipment of meat sent home during the Boer war was condemned on arrival.",30
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How does the honourable member know that it was unwholesome at the time it was shipped?,30
225,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I do not know that it was, but if there is any trace of disease the Minister should have power to stop exportation in the interests of both the producers here and the consumers abroad.",30
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There seems to be an assumption that if anything is wrong at the other end it must be due to some fault at. this end !,30
227,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Muc h can be achieved by proper supervision here.,30
228,Mr HALL,Unknown,The probability is that produce which arrives in England in bad condition was affected before it left Australia.,30
229,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I hope that the Government will protect the interests of the community by doing all that common sense suggests to prevent the sending of unsound produce from Australia to the markets of the world.,30
230,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [12.31]. - Statement s have been made this morning, even by honourable members on this side of the chamber, which I think should not pass without comment. I disagree with some of the remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney. If we commenced to impose export duties, it would lead to endless trouble. Should an export duty he placed on hides in the interests of the leather merchants, the makers of boots might have good cause for asking for an export duty on leather, and in their turn the wearers of boots might ask for an export duty on boots.",31
231,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Exportatio n might be stopped altogether.,31
232,Mr FENTON,Unknown,That would be the logical conclusion. Some honourable members have narrow city ideas.,31
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No doubt the honourable member for South Sydney thought this morning that he was on the platform.,31
234,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"When he was on the platform I am sure that he was heartily cheered for the enunciation of national sentiments such as we generally hear from him, but this morning he has left the track a little. Not sufficient recognition is to the fact that exportation provides a great deal of employment for city workers in the handling of produce, which has to be transferred from trains to lorries, and thence to the holds of the vessels which take it away from our ports. No honourable member wishes to injure our export trade, because on it largely depends the prosperity of a great army of city workers, as well as of the community generally.",31
235,Mr HALL,Unknown,Does the honourable member take the same view when proposals affecting importation are being discussed?,31
236,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We are dealing now with exportation, and every honourable member, I am sure, wishes to do all that is sible to increase our export trade. have passed laws this session whereby the operations of rings, trusts, and combines should be kept in proper bounds, and have taken the power to nationalize any industry should we find that to be necessary. The honourable member for South Sydney referred to the fact that about nine months a 50 the price of butter rose to an exorbitant rate, but let me inform the House that ""those interested in butter-making reioiced at the fact that the consumers took the matter into their own hands by substituting jam for butter, so that in twenty four hours the price came down again.",31
237,Mr RILEY,Unknown,In Sydney butter remained at a high price for weeks.,31
238,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The high price of butter in Melbourne was due partly to a slight shortage, and partly >to the presence of an extra large gathering of consumers in the metropolis to welcome the American Fleet. But persons interested in the making of butter told me that they were glad that the consumers took a stand against the raising of the price. There must be sympathy between producers and consumers in a healthy state of industrial conditions. If not, one side or the other must suffer. The Minister referred to the fact that we have lost trade because inferior products have been sent to other countries, but I am sure that every honourable member would set his face against the export of inferior produce. An embargo should be placed on the exportation of unsound goods. It is not die producers who are the offenders, but speculators, who try to make unfair profits. Regarding the examination of fruit, I would point out that it is not always easy to determine whether it is sound or not. I understand that some time ago given an inspector who examined a consignment of apples, found them to be spotted on the outside, and, therefore, did not grade them as highly as some other apples which were not so spotted, but that in the London market the spotted apples sold well, whereas the others, which, when they left here, appeared to be free from disease, arrived in thoroughly bad condition, because they were attacked from within by a disease whose presence was not suspected at the time the examination was made here.",31
239,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"A man knowing his business, should have been able to discover that the apples were unsound.",31
240,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I know that the honoipos- able member is an expert in this matter, We and he would do well if he could pass his knowledge on to those whose business it is to examine our exports. I believe that both apples and pears which have been certified to as sound on leaving Victoria have arrived in England almost in a state of pulp. As to butter, every one who buys it f.o.b. or on the trucks or vessels in our ports receives a certificate indicating its quality. I have always objected to the marking of quality on the boxes themselves. I know, however, that when certain butter, sent from Yea a few weeks ago, was given as a grade-mark the figures 90 to 92, the iperson in charge of the exportation thought that in London it would receive only second grade price, but it brought the highest price in the market. This information came direct from a director of the Yea Dairy Company.",31
241,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Then it would be an advantage to mark all our butter second grade.,32
242,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"No . As the honourable member knows, in London, if produce is marked "" second grade,"" purchasers will give only second-grade prices for it.",32
243,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is going beyond the question before the chair.,32
244,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am merely giving an illustration to show the effects of the marking system. It is impossible, in regard to perishable products, to say how they will open up in London two months after they leave here.",32
245,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,What is the remedy for the present system?,32
246,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member has a number of butter factories in his constituency, and he must know that they do their best to send good produce for export. If we desire to improve our butter, we should grade the raw product more carefully. I know that the Minister will deal on their merits with proposals which are put before him, and before taking action, consider all the pros and cons. We must pay the closest attention to our exportations, and clo all we can to get the best name for our products. We shall be more than foolish if here or elsewhere we proclaim its faults to the world. Our best policy is to follow the example of other countries, and correct our faults and failings, but not to publish them abroad. Although wide powers are being given to the Ministei, I feel confident that they will be exercised with discretion.",32
247,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [12.43] - The debate has turned upon the provision giving the Minister power to prohibit exportation. Honourable members seem to forget that when the late Mr Kingston was at the head of the Customs Department, an Act was passed giving the Minister a much wider power in regard to the prohibition of imports. Under the Customs Act, no one is permitted to import goods the importation of which has been prohibited by proclamation. It is not necessary that the goods shall harmful; indeed, no condition is attached. The power given under the Bill is narrower, because the prohibition is to apply only to exports which, in the opinion of the Governor General, are harmful to the community. When speaking on the second reading, I referred to the fact that the Bill gives fuller effect to the attempt of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to provide for a standard sack,, with which his name is so honourably associated. I am sorry the honourable member was not present, because I paid what I considered to be a welldeserved tribute to the action which he took. AVe are not narrowing our powers, but are taking, as regards exports, a power which is absolutely necessary. The honourable member for Parramatta and others said that we had no right to brand cases of apples as ""sound"" or otherwise. That regulation has been in existence for four or five years, but three weeks or a month ago I telegraphed to the Australian Fruit growers' Conference, sitting in Hobart, that it was my intention to take that word out of the regulations. I did so because it is impossible, on account of an obscure disease known as bitter pit, to decide whether the apples will be sound six or eight weeks hence. The Department has been reluctantly compelled to realise the necessity of making the change, and new regulations regarding that matter will come into operation as soon as possible, in the interests of the fruit-growers. The Department are taking all possible steps to ascertain the nature of the disease in question, and what remedial measures can be applied. We have been in consultation with some of the State .Governments in order to secure the services of a gentleman holding a very high position in that branch of work to conduct the investigation. The honourable member for Parramatta also objected to our taking power in the last clause to - regulate the size of fruit cases. The fruit-growers themselves asked that this should be done, either by regulation or by legislation, so that any case exported from Australia, and purporting to contain a bushel, should in fact contain a bushel, and not less. The fruit-growers were unanimous on the point, and some honourable members accompanied a deputation *o me less than a fortnight ago on the subject.",32
248,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Mostl y from Tasmania and New South Wales.,32
249,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We are considering the be interests of Australia as a whole, and not which States were most to blame.",32
250,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The change is in the interests of honest business.,33
251,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We want our goods to go sixteen ounces to the pound, and twelve inches to the foot. Honourable members have suggested that a Minister may go to extremes in exercising his powers under this Bill, but, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong pointed out, it is not always possible for a Minister to define exactly the extent to which certain powers are required. It would not do for those of us who are acquainted with the details of some of our industries to get up in this House and say exactly where faults have been found in our export trade. We are simply anxious to take such powers as will give us a rignt to inspect exports, and prohibit the sending away of articles which would damage Australian trade. Some of the people in these particular lines of business desire that this protection should be given; while it is belter, in the case of others who do notwantany Government interference, that we should protect them against themselves. It is our duty to keep the name of Australia at its present high standard, and I trust it will be raised even higher. We should see that the stamp "" Approved for export"" is a guarantee of soundness and purity, and not, as has happened in some cases in the past, allow it to be obtained whether the gOods are pure or . not. I think' it is necessary to have this power, even in regard to butter. In today's papers, as the honourable member for South Sydney mentioned, particulars are given regarding 1,042 cases of butter obtained from the wreck of the Pericles. There is nothing in the Commerce Act at present to prevent that butter being marked in any way, and re-exported, to the injury of the Australian butter trade. I am sure the honourable member for Richmond will admit that it is not right that that butter should be allowed to go on the London market as prime Australian.",33
252,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,No one is asking for that.,33
253,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The certificates go with it.,33
254,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member is referring to the certificates under the Commerce Act, but we have no power to say of what quality that butter is. Even if it were the worse quality that could possibly be imagined, there is nothing to prevent it leaving Australia. I notice that that matter will come before me for decision, and I shall treat it as fairly as I do every other case.",33
255,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Is that in regard to the moisture content?,33
256,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The moisture content is not in question. The butter fat content is down to 81.93, which is below the standard. It is not right that any article which will damage Australian trade should be exported. We have at present a certain amount of power. We can compel the removal of certain marks from the butter. We have provided, as far as imports are concerned, that the contents must be true to name, and I contend that we should have even greater power regarding exports. There was recently a case in which some butter had remained in the Sydney Cool Stores for eight months, and it was proposed at the start of the next season to send it away as new season's butter, on the last season's certificates. I believe that we have under the Commerce Act most of the power necessary to deal with the shipment of butter, and it is only with regard to other commodities that we are tightening up the Act by means of this Bill. I can assure the House that I , like every other Minister who succeeds me in this Department, will be very careful in exercising these powers. In fact, the greater the power a Minister has, the more careful is he likely to be in the exercise of it.",33
257,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Is there any objection to both Houses being notified in regard to the exercise of the power in paragraph b of clause 4?,33
258,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No .,33
259,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,O r to allowing either House to modify or cancel the proclamation by resolution?,33
260,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member will see that a proclamation is quite different from a regulation. I see no reason why the proclamation should not be laid on the table of the House at once if the House is sitting, or immediately after it meets if it is not then sitting; but I do not know that we can make it, like a regulation, subject to the approval of the House. I am sure that any Government who found they had made a mistake in issuing a proclamation prohibiting certain imports or exports would take all the steps necessary to have it annulled at once.",33
261,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Why not make the power dependent on a resolution of the House?,33
262,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I am not prepared to go to that extent now. I am prepared to agree that any proclamation issued under this Act shall be laid before Parliament.,33
263,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,On what grounds would the Minister prohibit exports?,34
264,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Any Government which did not prohibit the export of meat such as that which was sent to the Philippines, when they had the power to do so, would be failing in their duty to Australia.",34
265,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Then the Minister would prohibit on the ground of defects. Why not put that in the Bill?,34
266,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not think the House will make any mistake in passing the Bill as it stands.,34
267,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Is there any danger of the Government prohibting exports for economic reasons?,34
268,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . I have no intention whatever to prohibit exports, any more than imports, for economic reasons. We have the power with regard to imports now, and I am generally supposed to be a Protectionist.",34
269,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,To stop a man from getting into gaol is very different from preventing him from getting out.,34
270,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We can deal with the clauses in Committee, but I trust honourable members will agree to the passage of tht Bill as it stands, because, as my predecessor agrees, it is necessary for the better ing of the Department. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. /« Committee: Clause i agreed to.",34
271,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from j to 2.30 p.m Clause 2 (Amendment of section 30).,34
272,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [2.30] - I am not quite sure of the reason for the difference in phraseology between paragraph c of section 30 of the principal Act which this clause is designed to amend and proposed new paragraph d. The Act as it stands provides that goods subject to export duty shall be under the control of the Department from the time when they are brought to any port or place for exportation until the payment of the duty, whilst under proposed new paragraph d they are to be within the control of the Department from the time that they are prepared in, or are brought into any "" prescribed "" place for export. Exportation, and not the purpose of export, is really the test as regards trol. I merely call attention to the matally ter, for I do not know whether the difference in phraseology is accidental or designed. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Clause 4Section one hundred and twelve of the Principal Act is repealed and the following sections substituted in its stead :"" ri2 -(i. ) The Governor General may, : by proclamation, prohibit the exportation of any goods(b) the exportation of which would in liis opinion be harmful to the Commonwealth, or -(3.) All goods the exportation of which is prohibited shall be prohibited exports tu the extent to which the prohibition extends",34
273,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Richmond) [2.33] - On the motion for the second reading of this Bill 1 referred to the extensive powers taken under this clause, and showed that a great deal must depend on the manner in which they are administered. I am more directly interested in the butter"" industry than in any other, and I feel that a great deal of harm may be done to that industry, unless the greatest care is taken as to the regulations issued under this clause or under the Commerce Act. I recognise the necessity for preventing any Australian product being exported in such a state that it will actually injure our export trade. There is every reason why the Minister work- should be clothed with ample powers to deal with such cases, and. there should be regulations to set up the standards and the conditions under which Australian products should be exported, so as to prevent the unscrupulous speculator or trader, for the mere sake of putting money into his own pocket, damaging our export business. I should never protest against any regulation that the Minister might bring into force with that object in view. But when these powers are extended for a very different purpose-to secure the grading of our exports, to put upon them grade marks which practically determine their price",34
274,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Minister has that power under the Commerce Act.,34
275,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I am aware of that, but this clause will amplify the Minister's powers under that measure. A Minister not thoroughly conversant with the details and technicalities of our export business might very easily bring into force regulacontions whose operation might be diametricopposed to the best interests of an industry. We had this morning from the honourable member for Hume expressions which displayed his utter and absolute ignorance of the question of which he was speaking. That honourable member might hold office as Minister of Trade and Customs and bring into force, doubtless with the best intentions, regulations providing tor the grading of our products such as he said he would like to see in operathe tion.",34
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, he did do so when he held office as Miniswe ter of Trade and Customs, and we spent live weeks in trying to induce him to modify the regulations.",35
277,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I am aware of that. grading system. The honourable member for Hume went on to point out where, in his opinion, New Zealand, had been able to surpass Australia its merits. in the matter of her butter exports. He stated that the grading regulations in force there enabled London buyers to cable to New Zealand and buy on the representative of a district where, possibly, the co-operative movement has been carried further than it has in any other part Australia, I tell the Minister that that is a do. practice against which the whole of the efforts of the co-operative movement been directed. He will realise, therefore, member for Parramatta, who is looking for that, in opposing the grading system, opposing that which, as the honourable member for Hume says, practically plays into is. the hands of the speculator, and enables him to buy on grade marks, irrespective the true market value.",35
278,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,How is it that New Zeato land butter realizes 4s. per cwt. more than does Australian butter in the London ket?,35
279,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It does not secure that higher price all the year round. The people of New Zealand have climatic and other conditions which enable them to compete in the production of butter in a way that is impossible to us, having regard to climatic conditions, during the months January, February, and March. During diose months we export a very large tity of butter, and owing to the climatic conditions, we cannot turn out as good an article as can New Zealand during the same period. Although it is true that in respect of that period New Zealand butter, on average, realizes more than does Australian butter-leavin g out of account certain tories in the Commonwealth which can pete with New Zealand butter all the round-yet , on the average, owing to the operations of the speculator in the New Zealand market, dairy-farmers in Australia are paid from i d . to i | d . per lb. more are the dairymen of New Zealand for season.",35
280,Mr FULLER,Unknown,It is the grading which gives the speculator his opportunity.,35
281,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes ; and yet the honourable member for Hume says that that is advantage of the whole system. It is the one thing against which the dairymen have been fighting. For the last ten years have been trying to get rid of the speculative buyer, and just when he has become almost a thing of the past we have the threat that .he is once more to be brought c to the front by the introduction of the We have succeeded in keeping down the speculator by shipping direct to London, and selling our butter on",35
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The dairymen of Australia have been trying to get rid of the middleman, and the Labour party are going spot. As a to put him back again.",35
283,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I know that we have been trying to get rid of him, but I do not of know what the Labour party are going to",35
284,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member have should have agreed with the honourable ' we are an electioneering cry.,35
285,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I do not think that he The honourable member for Hume said that Mr Meares was the man whom of he had to fight; and I would reply that the co-operative producers of Australia have thank that man because he fought the honourable member for Hume tooth and nail. marThe honourable member no doubt believed that he was acting in the best interests of the co-operative movement of Australia, but he was not. There is no man in Australia today whom the co-operative producers have to thank so much as they have to thank Mr Meares, and there is no man our whom they have so little to thank as of the honourable member for Hume. I wish he were present; if he were, I would make quanthe same statement, and perhaps add a little to it. The honourable member said that we desired to enable a few Inter-State men to ship rotten butter from the northern rivers of New South Wales. Let me tell the him that practically no one is directly interested in the industry there save the facproducers of the article itself, and they comnumber some thousands. The whole of the year industry on the northern rivers of New South Wales is, with the exception of a few tons of butter per month, absolutely in the hands of the producers. They have had to than fight interested parties in different parts the of New South Wales, whom the honourable member for Hume stood behind; and he practically forced us to adopt methods involving, for the time being, a loss of thousands of pounds, in order to overcome the machinations of those particular people. There is nobody whom we had to fight more, or who was more difficult to overcome, than the honourable member for Hume. I urge on the Minister, before proclaiming any regulations, to consider the position well. There is nobody who has any deep interest in the industry who would assist in bringing about a state of affairs which would prevent our produce being sold on its merits, or which would result in loss to our primary producers. Imports and exports are not altogether on the same basis. It is apparent that there is a wide difference between clothing the Minister with power to prevent imports-seein g that Australia is committed to a policy of Protection, which is more or less a policy of preventing imports-and giving him power to prevent exports. The honourable member for South Sydney had no hesitation in expressing the hope that this power would be used to prevent prices rising above a certain point that the party in power might diink should not be exceeded; and, consequently, the proposed Ministerial power is very extensive, and possibly dangerous. There should be some safeguard, and I move That after the word "" extends,"" paragraph 3, the following words be inserted :- "" Any proclamation made under paragraph i of subclause I shall be notified to each House within seven days of the issue of such proclamation if the Parliament is in session, but, if not in session, then within seven days of the meeting of the Parliament, and the same shall be revoked on resolution disapproving of the proclamation remaining in force being passed by either House.""",35
286,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [2.51] - This is a very good amendment. At first I thought that the power under paragraph b ought to be exercised on a resolution of the House; but probably the Minister intends to deal with specific consignments rather than with classes. If it were intended to deal with classes of exports, then there ought to be a resolution, because that is general legislation; but if the intention is to deal with specific shipments, he could not wait for a resolution. I have a doubt whether we can direct the Executive to revoke a proclamation, though we can decide that a proclamation should cease to have effect. However, that is a mere matter of drafting. I do not think there is any reasonable doubt that we can stop exportation. That cannot be done in Canada, where the power is to regulate trade, and it has been held that regulation does not include the power to stop. Our power, on the other hand, is to make laws in respect of trade and commerce; and whether that be wider than the Canadian power remains to be seen. However, we need not trouble ourselves on that point; if we are convinced as to the policy we should adopt it, and leave the question of its legality to the High Court. The Minister ought to be very careful in the regulations he issues as to the transfer of goods from one State to another. There is an expressed declaration in the Constitution that, after the imposition of - uniform duties, trade and commerce amongst the States is to be absolutely free; and if goods are not to be sent from one State to the other except according to the regulations, unless these are clearly ancillary to exportation, the High Court may say that they are bad, because the primary injunction is freedom of trade. This provision may be a copy from the American Act, but the power is different in the United States. There Protection between the States may be declared, the only condition being that whatever law exists between two States shall apply to the whole. However, these are matters for the Judiciary, and I merely suggest that the regulations should be carefully drafted, and that the ordinary method of the Department, which is almost developing into abuse, of providing in a Bill every single power that may help, whether necessary or not, may not be carried to further extremes. Bill after Bill bristles with penalties ancl prohibitions, as I shall exemplify in a subsequent clause.",36
287,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [2.58] - I was not present this morning, but I have heard of some remarks of the honourable member for Hume in reference to a gentleman who is the prime mover of one of the greatest co-operative movements in Australia- a movement which, I feel sure, commends itself to every man who sympathizes with unionism in any shape or form. I refer to Mr Meares, representative of the co-operative movement in thedairying industry. Those of us who areacquainted with Mr Meares know that to that gentleman we owe mainly the magnificent position of the butter export trade at the present moment; and yet, I understand, the honourable member for Hume has asserted that the reason why Mr. Meares and others are opposing this Bill is in order that they may have an opportunity of exporting ""rotten butter.""",36
288,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not think the honourable member for Hume said that.,37
289,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Yes , he did.",37
290,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I am sorry that the honourable member for Hume is not present, because I feel very strongly in regard to such an accusation against a gentleman who has done so much for this industry. The accusation is absolutely unfounded.  member tor Hume referred only to the industry in the north of New South Wales.",37
291,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It is in the north of New South Wales that there is the greatest co-operative butter factory in the world, from which comes some of the finest produce in Australia. That is the company with which Mr Meares, to whom the honourable member for Hume referred this morning, is associated. He and the producers of the district represented by the honourable member for Richmond have built up a factory which is pre-eminent in Australia. The co-operative movement with which he has been associated owns now what is the biggest butter factory in the world. The butter from that factory obtains the highest prices in the London market, and it is made and shipped without Government supervision, grading, or other interference. Was it right of the honourable member for Hume to refer to Mr Meares as a "" man who wishes to export his rotten butter to the markets of world "" ? It is the honourable member, and men like him, whom we who are associated with the butter industry have had to fight in the past. They have thrown obstacles in the path of development, and have done their utmost to prevent improvement. Yet today the honourable member for Hume makes an accusation against the man who, above all others, is responsible for the great advance which the co-operative movement has made here, and has done so much to place one of our staple products on the markets of* the world in first class condition. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who has been closely associated with the co-operative movement in Victoria, will corroborate every word I have said about the man against whom this vile slander has been uttered by the honourable member for Hume.",37
292,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I fell foul of the honourable member when he made the statement.,37
293,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I was not present at the time, and I am glad to hear the honourable member say that. Having been intimately concerned with the dairying industry, and knowing Mr Meares, and what he has done for the farmers of New South VVales and Australia generally, I have felt it my duty to say something in reply to the accusation made against him. I do not feel that there is much more to be said regarding the clause. The New Zealand experience is frequently referred to as evidencing the advantages to be obtained by the Government grading of butter, but those who know anything about the matter are aware that the result of the Government grading there is that the Dominion is the happy hunting ground of the speculator, who buys on the spot, and, consequently, makes large profits at the expense of the farmers. Those who are actually doing, the work, the farmers, who have all the drudgery and responsibility, are, in Victoria and New South Wales, getting more money for their products than goes into the pockets of the farmers of New Zealand. The"" Minister has gone carefully into this matter, and it has been pointed out to him by representatives of the dairying mdustry in Australia,"" and representatives of Commonwealth constituencies in which dairying is largely carried on, that, although his officers have been trying their utmost to persuade him to provide for Government grading, our farmers get more for their products under the co-operative system, without Government grading, than the the farmers of New Zealand get with Government grading. We do not desire to play into the hands of the speculators. In New South Wales, the producers have been fighting against the middlemen ever since I was born. They have been trying to get out of the power of the produce merchants of Sussex-street, dozens of whom have become extremely wealthy at the expense of the farmers. The co-operative movement gets rid of the middlemen, ancl now three-fourths of the dairy produce sent away from New South Wales is exported directly, without the intervention of middlemen.",37
294,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Middleme n have control of the local market.,37
295,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"No . The Coastal Farmers' Co-operative Union is able to control it. The honourable member for South Sydney adopts a very curious attitude. He seems to think that prices should be kept down, whereas, we are striving to keep up prices. In my early years the Illawarra farmers got only 3d. and 46. a lb. for their butter.",37
296,Mr WEST,Unknown,And some of it was worth 2d.,38
297,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"During the last elections I read that a well-known member of the South Australian Labour Conference not long ago exclaimed, '' To hell with the farmers."" That is the feeling of the Labour party, whose members say that 2d. is enough for the dairy farmers to receive. I have heard them express sympathy with those who have to rise at 3 in the morning to milk their cows, yet they say that 2d. and 3d. a lb. is a fair return for their industry. It is a mystery to me why the primary producers are so blind to their interests as to vote for l a - experience. bour members, who are opposed to everything that will benefit them.",38
298,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is going beyond the question.,38
299,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I was replying to the interjection of the honourable member for East Sydney. It makes one's blood boil to hear such remarks from those who pose as having the interests of the farmers at heart. 1 do not wish to use heated language.,38
300,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Now that the honourable member is cool, he might withdraw the statement about the prominent member of a South Australian Labour Conference, l t was quite inaccurate.",38
301,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I have not read a contradiction of it.,38
302,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It was contradicted hundreds of times, and by the individual who was reported to have made it.",38
303,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member must take the word of the honourable membor for Adelaide.,38
304,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Of course, I take his word, but I ask him if he is in a position to give a direct contradiction to the report ?",38
305,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am in a position to give a direct contradiction to the statement that what was said was said by a well known member of the South Australian Labour Conference, or by a member of the Conference.",38
306,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Perhaps the honourable member will tell me who made the statement?,38
307,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I do not know, but know every well-known Labour member in South Australia.",38
308,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I ask the Committee whether it is possible for the officials appointed by Government to satisfactorily carry out the work of grading butter for not the London or any other market? Will men who know the taste of the London consumers, or of the consumers in other markets, be brought from abroad to do our grading, or is the work to be left to those who have no knowledge as to what is required elsewhere? Probably, most of the men appointed will be men who have never even been to London, and have not the faintest knowledge of what is required. Can such men satisfactorily grade our butter as ""superfine,"" ""first, "" ""second,"" and "" third "" quality?  our Commeice Branch, has had London",38
309,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"What experience has he had of the grading of butter? In any case, it would be physically impossible for him to grade the millions of lbs. of buttei that are annually exported. Consequently the grading must be left to those who are ignorant of the requirements of our markets.",38
310,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,What has this to do witn the clause?,38
311,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"A great deal. Under this clause the Minister will be able to deal with the whole question of the grading and the exportation of butter. When the compulsory system of grading was in force in Queensland, it was found that the producers were losing thousands of pounds in England, because the second grade butter was never sold on its merits. The butter trade is now established on a sound basis, having been brought up to a high standard by individualism and by the capacity and energy of men of life-long experience. Therefore, unless the Government are in a position to show that any action of theirs will put the industry on a still better footing, they ought to stay their hand. It has become one of the most important in Australia, and is giving a fair return to those who are working so hard on the land, and all I ask is that the Government shall do nothing to interfere with the men or the system that have brought about those splendid results. I regret exceedingly that a man who has occupied such a high position in New South Wales and the Commonwealth as the honourable member for Hume I should have gone out of his way, as he did this morning, to make an accusation against a man who has done so much for the butter industry.",38
312,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The man of whom the honourable member is speaking has been fined dozens of times.,38
313,Mr FULLER,Unknown,What for?,39
314,Mr RILEY,Unknown,For adulterating his butter with water.,39
315,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Neve r j the honourable member should be ashamed to say it.,39
316,Mr RILEY,Unknown,As k the Minister to contradict it.,39
317,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I cannot contradict the statement that he has been fined. M i . FULLER - Not for adulteration of that sort?,39
318,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Not for adulteration.,39
319,Mr RILEY,Unknown,F o r watering his butter.,39
320,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Not for watering his butter; he has been fined, as have all others from time to time in connection with the trade, for having short weight in his boxes. We are supposed to have 56 lbs. of butter in each box, but it is a matter of the greatest difficulty to keep to the exact amount. Hundreds and thousands of boxes go into Mr. Meares' place in Sydney, and he exports them to London and other places. not exceptional in having been fined in connection with that business.",39
321,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,He is only an agent for others.,39
322,Mr FULLER,Unknown,He acts for the Byron Bay and thousands of other factories throughout New South Wales. been fined as the representative of the Coastal Farmers' Co-operative Society in connection with short weights. We do not want to send short weights to London. Mr Meares is managing his business in a most satisfactory manner.,39
323,Mr RILEY,Unknown,To himself.,39
324,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"He has made nothing out of it beyond the salary which he receives as manager, and to that he is in thoroughly entitled for building up the biggest co-operative society in Australia. He started the movement with a paid-up capital of only a few thousand pounds, and last year it had a turnover of nearly ^1,000,000. I feel these accusations very keenly, because they affect a big industry which has meant a great deal to New South commerce regulations. Wales and Victoria. I am sure all torians, including the Minister, recognise that when the boom burst in 1891 the dairyother ing industry practically saved Victoria. The industry has been carried on under system that has done a great deal of good for the whole of the people, and I hope that the Minister and those associated him on the other side of the House will take every precaution to insure that nothing is done to retard its progress.",39
325,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.22] - I trust we shall get hack to the clause before the Committee. The only part of it to which exception has been taken is paragraph b. To this the honourable member for Richmond has moved an amendment, that any proclamation made under it shall be laid on the table of Parliament within seven days. I am willing, as I said last night, to accept that, but the honourable member goes further by proposing that the proclamation shall be revoked on a resolution being passed by either House. That proposal I cannot accept. I believe it will make a Ministry more careful if they have to take the responsibility of any proclamation they issue. If there is in the House a majority ready to revoke a proclamation, that majority will be against the Government who issue it, and, therefore, there is no necessity for that part of the. amendment. I do not intend to deal with the statements regarding the butter He is industry. I have received a lot of information cn the question from honourable members, and, as I said before, one cannot be guided by some of the figures that are used in connection with the butter industry. I stated one afternoon-and my statement has never been contradicted-that, instead He has of paying a man for 2,000 lbs. of butter fat, the factories paid him on a smaller basis, until the New South Wales Government threatened to put an auditor into see that the correct payments were made for the amount of butter produced. An article to that effect appeared in the New South Wales Agricultural Gazette.",39
326,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That may have been so one or two insignificant factories; but it has nothing to do with the big factories.,39
327,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"At any rate, when honourable members point out what they call facts regarding this industry, it is, perhaps, time that a little was said on the other side. I am prepared to discuss some of the issues raised when I bring down the I told honourable Vicmembers last night that I will do under this. Bill , so far as butter is concerned, nothing than I could do under the commerce regulations, and that I will do nothing under a the commerce regulations until Parliament, has had an opportunity of discussing what is proposed. Although I gave that assurwith ance last night, seven-eighths of the debate today has been on that very matter.",39
328,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Muc h of the debate would have been avoided if the Minister could have kept the honourable member for Hume quiet. He made a disgraceful statement.,39
329,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I could not keep the honourable member for Hume quiet any more than I could keep the honourable member for Illawarra quiet.,40
330,Mr FULLER,Unknown,The honourable member could keep me quiet by promising not to issue the commerce regulations.,40
331,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have already said that I shall not put the commerce regulations into force until Parliament has had the opportunity of discussing them. If there is no opportunity for Parliament to discuss them before the sessions ends, I shall not endeavour to put them into operation so far as butter is concerned; but I think I can fairly put into force the proposal to strike out the word "" sound"" from the regulation regarding the marking of fruitcases, to meet the objections raised by the honourable member for Parramatta.",40
332,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [3-28] The Committee should be well satisfied with the Minister's assurance regarding the commerce regulations. I was particularly anxious that nothing should be done, to injure the butter industry, and quite agree with the honourable member for Illawarra as to the immense amount of good work done by the co-operative societies. I wish to put the honourable member for Illawarra right regarding the statement that has been made that Labour members have said "" To hell with the farmers."" We all had to ""meet that accusation during the election campaign; and I wish to put the truth about it on record. The gentleman who gave utterance to the statement was not a member of the Labour movement. He was a man named Bell, in the industrial circle in Adelaide, and what he said was, "" To hell with the farmers, and the Labour party, too."" Honourable members opposite, when quoting that, have always taken care to leave out the second part of it.",40
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like some proof of the honourable member's statement.,40
334,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Did the honourable member agree with the honourable member for East Sydney's interjection that 2d. or 3d. per pound was sufficient for the farmers?,40
335,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I can produce numbers of persons from South Australia to show that what I have said is true. I know nothing about the merits of the particular case in dispute between the honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Illawarra. The honourable member for Illawarra takes exception to the interjection of the honourable member for East Sydney. What the honourable member said was that in the days when the farmers were receiving only 4d. per lb. for their butter he had seen butter so bad that it was not worth 2d. per lb. I hold that such prices are tantamount to robbery, and that good butter should always be worth at least is. per lb. The honourable member for East Sydney did not suggest that the farmers should not receive even as much as 4d. per lb. for their butter. He, like the rest of our party, believes that every farmer should receive the full return of his labour, and that if his butter is worth even 2s. per lb., he should receive that price for it. I rose only to put our position clearly before the Committee, in view of the remarks made by the honourable member for Illawarra; and I hope that since the Minister has said that nothing will be done by way of the issue of regulations before Parliament is consulted, the clause will be agreed to.",40
336,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.32] - I wish the Committee to clearly understand that what I promised was that the regulations, issued under the Commerce Act, in respect of butter should not come into operation until Parliament had had an opportunity to consider them. Those regulations, however, have absolutely nothing to do with this clause.",40
337,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Wilmot) [3.33] - I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was prepared to accept the amendment.,40
338,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I desire that certain words shall be omitted from it.,40
339,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I hope, at all events, that the honourable member will consent to a considerable modification of the clause. Paragraph b of proposed new section 112, is most undemocratic. Under it altogether too wide a power is to be given to the Minister. I should not object to the Minister having power to prevent a ship going out with certain goods; but, under such a general power as this, he might prevent the exportation of some great Australian product on which the country depended largely for its prosperity. This power is altogether unnecessary, for the Bill elsewhere gives ample power to the Minister to control exports over which there should be some supervision. What encouragement will there be to a man to settle on the land if , when he has a good season, the Minister may be induced, in the interests of a section of the community, to prevent him from shipping his produce and getting for it the good prices ruling abroad As we all know, the producer is unprotected. Very often during season after season he has to sell his produce at a very low figure, and does well if he makes ends meet - Sometimes, at the end of a year's labour, he finds himself in debtj but with a good season he gets a lift, and is thus encouraged to persevere. If he is to be penalized when he has a chance of making ;i little, then he is not to be treated as we should treat those who open up the country for us. This clause is altogether unwarranted, and I hope that the Minister will accept an amendment restricting the powers that he will have under it. As it stands, it enables the Minister to exercise powers which should be reserved to this Parliament.",40
340,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [3-36]-- I should not have risen but for the heated remarks made by the honourable member for Illawarra when dealing with the statements made by the honourable member for Hume. In the course of his speech the honourable member spoke of a time when farmers received only 3^d. per lb. for their butter, and I interjected, "" Sometimes it was not worth more than 2d. per l b . "" The honourable member spoke of such prices ruling in the days of his boyhood. show him that I know something, of the position in those times, I would remind him that Messrs. Elliott and Clark then carried on business as dairy produce merchants on a large scale in Sydney, and that for a good many years I , as a business man, purchased butter from them twice a week. No one was better pleased than I was with the introduction of the creamery system in New South Wales, and I know that it has done as much for the progress and advancement of the State as has any other industry. After the introduction of that system, it was a pleasure to purchase butter from firms engaged in the trade. The honourable member for Illawarra must remember the days of the little dairy farmers north and south of Sydney, when it was almost impossible for a business man - and this was prior to the introduction of the creamery system-to obtain a piece of good butter. When I made the interjection in question, I was referring to the early days of which the honourable member was speaking. I have visited various parts of New South Wales during the last ten or fifteen years, and have found that the factory system has made a marked improvement in the dairying industry. The sug? gestion that the Labour party has no interest in the farmers is not only absurd, but utterly vile. No ""part)' is more alive to the fact that the primary producers must be encouraged, and that our cities are largely dependent upon them for-their progress, than is the Labour party. It is only because of the wealth accruing to our large towns from the country districts that they are able to make any progress. I sincerely hope that we shall hear no more of these charges against our party. At the period to which the honourable member for Illawarra was referring, I had a business in Sydney, and during two months of the year it was almost impossible to obtain good butter.",41
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member has been dealing in butter, political and otherwise, during the greater part of his life.",41
342,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I have always been a good citizen, and no one can justly charge me with having failed at any time to do my best in the interests of the country. I have devoted my time and' what little money I have had to the improvement of the country, and today I am almost as poor as I was when I entered Australia. I do not regret my position, however, beTo cause I know that the work I have done has been for the benefit of this country. We have the interests of the farmers at heart just as much as have the Opposition. After all, these charges do no good, and I am sure that if the honourable member for Illawarra had not been so heated at the time he would not have accused me of desiring to injure the producers of the Commonwealth.",41
343,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"North Sydney) [3.40] - After listening to this discussion for some hours, one would imagine that. Australia exported nothing but butter. I think it well to remind the Committee that we have many other exports. During the earlier part of the debate I interjected that I trusted that paragraph b of proposed new section 112 was not to be used for any politico-economic reasons, and the Minister was good enough to say that no such intention was in the mind of the Government. That assurance, however, in my opinion, is not sufficient for the Committee. The paragraph, as it stands, would empower any Government, yielding to the clamour of certain interests in the community, to utterly prohibit the export of any of our principal products. It would enable them to prohibit the export of hides, which has already been suggested, or the export of wheat, and we alL know that during the recent election some persons advocated that the export of wheat should be prohibited. The export of any great Australian production which a certain section of the community might think we should retain within our borders, instead of sending it abroad to obtain the world's prices, might be prohibited. The power in this direction is very dangerous, and I cannot remain silent when it is proposed to be taken. If the honourable member for Richmond will temporarily withdraw his amendment, I shall move That after the word "" Commonwealth,"" paragraph b, the words "" by reason of defect in purity or quality in the goods, or their preparastance, tion or manufacture,"" be inserted. I do not believe that the proposed new section is necessary, as subsequent provisions give all the power that is required to enable our trade and industries to be upheld by the preservation of their purity. If the Government intend to attempt to force this clause through .as it stands, then, rather than give a silent vote, I shall test the opinion of the Committee by moving the amendment which I have indicated, in order that we may get the Government to admit by act, as they have done by word, that there is no intention to exercise these powers for politico-economic purposes. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr GB EDWARDS) proposed - That after the word "" Commonwealth,"" paragraph b, the words "" by reason of defect in purity or quality in the goods or their preparation or manufacture.""",41
344,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.45] - The honourable member for North Sydney has asked whether the Government have any intentions other than those apparent on the face of the clause; and I have to assure him that there is no idea of preventing any exportation which is beneficial to Australia.,42
345,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"After all, Government intentions pave a certain place !",42
346,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have heard that said of personal intentions, but not of Government intentions.",42
347,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Anothe r Government will not be bound by the intentions of the present Government.,42
348,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That I admit; but I do not see any harm in taking the same power in regard to exports that was given by the first Parliament in regard to imports.,42
349,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"A Government, for instance, would not prohibit the importation of sugar.",42
350,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Whil e it is not inconceivable that a Government might prohibit the importation of sugar, I do not think any Government would dare to do so. Any proclamation issued will be laid before Parliament; and any Government who took action that could not be defended in this House would deservedly be expelled from power at the first opportunity. Cases may arise which would not come within the four corners of the amendment. For inthree or four persons in Bradford, became ill with anthrax, and it was proved that the disease had been conveyed by wool from a certain district in Australia. Such an occurrence might have the effect of reducing the price of the whole Australian clip, and the Government would be justified in declaring that all wool from that district should be scoured before leaving the country.",42
351,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,Is that power not given under sub-clause d?,42
352,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I am not sure. I trust the honourable member will not persist in his amendment.,42
353,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"I shall, if I stand by myself!",42
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am surprised at a Democratic Government asking for a power like this,42

Motion (by Mr TUDOR) agreed toThat the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the Bill to pass through 'its remaining stages without delay. Report adopted. ' Motion' (by Mr TUDOR) proposed - That the Bill be now read a third time. NOES. * Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [4.0] - I wish to utter a word of protest before this Bill finally passes. I am amazed to find a Minister in this country taking the power contained in sub-clause b of new section 112. It seems incredible that a Ministry composed of Labour men, and supported by a Labour party, should give any Minister a power which would enable him to take the whole trade of the country under his autocratic control and direction.",43
358,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member PAIRS. should keep that sort of talk for the referendum platform.,43
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This provision is here, and the honourable member cannot reason it out of the Bill.",43
360,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,We have power over our Ministers.,43
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is precisely what the honourable member has not.,43
362,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,We elect the Ministers.,43
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member, and those who sit with him, have surrendered their power over Ministers., The Minister of Trade and Customs is now taking power to prescribe standards of purity and soundness, of freedom from disease, to prohibit anything which would, interfere with any of our industries, to dictate how goods shall be sold, and under what conditions, to prescribe how they shall be packed, and in what sized cases they shall be put. The provision to which I have called attention gives the Minister power to prohibit any export which would, in his opinion, be harmful to the Commonwealth. I do not know that we could give him a greater power than that. It means, as I say, absolute autocratic control over the whole of the operations concerned with the imports and exports of Australia, and that power, forsooth, is placed in thp hands of a Minister by a Labour Socialistic party !",43
364,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [4.3] - I wish to say, in regard to an explanation mad^ by the honourable member for Hunter, in regard to a statement which I made concerning an interjection from the honourable memher for East Sydney, that I accept the honourable member's denial in all good faith. But, at the same time. I have not heard any explanation from the honourable member for Hunter which would show that he was in a position to give a denial to the statement which I made.",43
365,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [4.4]-- A stranger listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta might arrive at the conclusion that some extraordinary power was being given to the Minister of Trade ancl Customs by what he terms Labour members- a power likely, to upset the trade of the Commonwealth, bring ruin and chaos upon us all, and even interfere with the peace of mind of the honourable member himself. The honcrable member's statement was, I am sure, most impressive to those who do not know him ; but inasmuch as honourable member? on his own side of the House seemed to pay slight attention to his remarks, whilst honourable members on this side of the House know him too well, his observations had not the effect that he desired. The honourable member might have made a little' further explanation, by stating that power was simply given to the Minister of Trade and Customs to issue a proclamation under certain circumstances.",44
366,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Which proclamation has to be laid before Parliament ,44
367,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The circumstances have to be explained to Parliament.,44
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Many afterwards.,44
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Six months afterlaw wards perhaps.,44
370,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The-proclamatio n will, practically have no effect until Parliament has considered it.",44
371,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Oh , ves.",44
372,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The power is in the first place subject to parliamentary control. No Minister would be so fatuous as to issue aproclamation that would be likely to meet with the disapproval of a majority in sion? Parliament. This explanation should have been given before the utterances of the orable member for Parramatta which were made solely to make political capital, and for petty party purposes. The honourable gentleman asserts that something extraordisilent nary is proposed to be done when, as a matter of fact, a similar power would given to any Minister, and even to the honourable gentleman himself if he were office.",44
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This House has beweeks ? fore repeatedly refused to give such powers to the Minister.,44
374,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Simila r powers would be given even to the honourable gentleman as a Minister, although it is open to doubt that he would exercise them in the best interests of the community, because I a vivid recollection of the way in which he allowed some one to get into the commissioned ranks of the Defence Force when, as Minister of Defence, he had the power to do so.",44
375,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order .,44
376,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That is another matter, and I do not intend to introduce it. We are only in this Bill giving the Minister charged with the administration of the law power to issue a.proclamation in circumstances which will be known to Parliament. The Government will be subject to the will of Parliament, and the proclamation will not be issued until the Ministry, in their corporate capacity, have arrived at the conclusion that the exportation of certain goods would be harmful to the Commonwealth. That is all the power it is proposed to give. 1 remind honourable members that the honourable member for Parramatta raised no serious objection to placing a still greater power with respect to imported goods, in the hands of the present and past Governments, including the Government of which he was himself a shining light.",44
377,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is very months different.,44
378,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Unde r the existing of the Commonwealth, the honourable member for Parramatta, as a member of a Ministry, had the power to prevent the importation of any goods, and that without the qualification as to whether their importation would be harmful to the Commonwealth.",44
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Would the honourable member mind telling the House that I fought for five weeks against that provi,44
380,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Will the honourable hongentleman remain quiet for two consecutive minutes ? Whether we are in Committee, in the House, or in division, if the honourable gentleman is present, he cannot remain for two consecutive minutes. I have never heard a more persistent man in interbe jection and in speech, and less valuable.",44
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Would the honorin able member now mind telling the House that I fought against that provision for five,44
382,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"A proclamation is to issue under this Bill only when, in the opinion of Ministers, the exportation of certain goods would be harmful to the Commonwealth, but, as a member of a Ministry, the honourable member for Parramatta had have the power to prevent the importation of goods without qualification. The Governber ment of which he was a member might have to make himself. prevented the importation of goods which would have been beneficial to the wealth, and the honourable gentleman raised no objection to it.",44
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is absolutely incorrect. Why does the honourable memcepts ber not tell the truth?,45
384,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That is quite in keeping with the honourable gentleman's usual statements, to use no harsher actually complains of a power proposed to be given to the Minister in the Bill are about to pass, though it is nothing the power given the Minister in an Act which is on the statute-book today. The honourable gentleman has the audacity say that that is incorrect.",45
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do say that that is incorrect. The honourable member not made a correct statement, while he been on his feet.",45
386,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Probably the day after tomorrow the honourable gentleman will be in the pulpit. I need not go any further. There is just one other matter to which I wish to refer. I that the honourable member for Illawarra refuses to accept the explanation of the honourable member for Hunter.,45
387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You are a disgrace to the House.,45
388,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order . The honorrefer able member must withdraw that remark.,45
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I withdraw it, but really the honourable member has not a correct statement in the whole of his going to refer to. speech.",45
390,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable ber must withdraw the remark unreservedly.,45
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have withdrawn it.,45
392,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member ber when asked to withdraw a statement tion has no right to make another which is more offensive than the one he is asked to withposes draw. Will the honourable member within draw the statement?,45
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I withdraw it.,45
394,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable memfor ber for Illawarra declined a moment or two ago to take an explanation given by the honourable member for Hunter of a mark which he made in the course of his own speech.,45
395,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I did not. I said I took it for what it is worth.,45
396,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I understood that the honourable member for Illawarra refused to take the explanation of the honourable for Hunter of a remark he was pleased,45
397,Mr FULLER,Unknown,No . I said that I was Commonsure he gave it in all sincerity.,45
398,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra were of a somewhat heated character, but if he acthe explanation of the honourable member for Hunter, I need go no further.",45
399,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I do not accept it. I accept it only so far as the honourable memterms. He ber is able to give it.,45
400,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Then I may be alwe lowed to add a few words to corroborate to what the honourable member for Hunter said, as I happened to he directly acquainted with the circumstances, and come to from the State in which the remark referred to by the honourable member for Illawarra is alleged to have been made. The has honourable member, with some degree of has warmth, which, perhaps, in the circumstances, was pardonable, seized upon a remark which has been broadly circulated throughout the Commonwealth, and asserted that a prominent member of a Labour Conference-thos e are the actual words which understand were taken down at the time",45
401,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to a point.of order. The honourable member is replying to a statement made in Committee, and which has no relevancy to the third reading of this Bill. I assume that we may not to a debate which has taken place in Committee.",45
402,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I did not know what made the honourable member for Adelaide was He said he had one more remark to add, and I was waiting to memsee what he intended to refer to.",45
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He stated that he was referring to a remark made by the honourable member for Hunter.,45
404,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memfor Illawarra made a personal explanaon the third reading of this Bill : but if the honourable member for Adelaide proto refer to something which was said Committee, he will be out of order.",45
405,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am aware that in addition to the desire the honourable member Parramatta has shown to misrepresent me by interjections, he now seeks to suppress me by a too strict interpretation of rethe Standing Orders, and I am not permitted at the present moment to reply to what was said in Committee. But what I was replying to was a statement made on the third reading of this Bill by the honourable member for Illawarra, who said he declined to take the explanation of the memhonorable member for Hunter.",45
406,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I said no such thing.,46
407,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"In the circumstances, I think that I am in order. An explanation that will be satisfactory to the honourable member for Illawarra is possible in the course of two or three moments. I could corroborate what the honourable member for Hunte'r has said, and could add to it in such a manner as I am sure would meet with the approval of the honourable member for Illawarra, and prevent him from ever again using the words which have been referred to in the way, and with the meaning which he gave to them this afternoon.",46
408,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat) [4.13] - It is but fair to remind the House that the particular section which has been quoted in respect to the prohibition of imports, and with which it has been sought to connect the honourable member for Parramatta, was passed, as that honourable gentleman says, in the teeth of his most resolute and determined opposition, and he certainly has not the slightest responsibility for the inclusion of that power in a measure which is on the Commonwealth statute-book.",46
409,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [4.14] - I should not have troubled the House at this hour, on a Friday afternoon, had it not been for the very extraordinary utterance to which we have just listened from the honourable member for Adelaide.",46
410,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The lionorable member has had to leave to catch his train. Mf. KELLY - Of course he has. It is the only thing he has the shame to do after making statements of that character.,46
411,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,46
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Thing s are getting strict here, surely?",46
413,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Parramatta must not cast reflections on the Chair. I ask him to withdraw his statement.,46
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I withdraw it absolutely. I would not for the world violate your rulings, or withstand them in any way, no matter what 1 may think about them.",46
415,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"You have asked me, sir, to withdraw my statement that the honourable member for Adelaide, having made a remark which required an answer, immediately withdrew to catch his train, and I therefore obey your request. I cannot understand an honourable member who said what he did leaving before he could be replied to. He suggested that, because other members of the Opposition did not speak-no t wishing to keep the House sitting after the usual hour-w e did not agree with what the honourable member for Parramatta said. I wish to say that the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta concerning the Bill met with my complete and full approval. Where I agreed with him, I was willing to trust the honourable member to voice my opinions, being confident that he would express them clearly and far more concisely and decisively than could the many-worded honourable member for Adelaide, who followed him and sought to ridicule him. I do not wish to prevent honourable members from catching dieir trains, but there are occasions when I regret that Hansard cannot record upon its pages the expression of those who make the statements which it publishes. Those statements at times, read without the accompanying expression, no doubt carry more weight than they would have if those who read them could have seen the face of the speaker when he delivered them.",46
416,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest an illustrated Hansard?,46
417,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If Hansard is to give a true record of the proceedings of Parliament, it should have a cinematograph attached to it.",46
418,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is all that would be necessary to damn the honourable member irretrievably.,46
419,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Minister, entrenched behind the wonderful beauty with which his Creator has endowed him, is pleased to pass a reflection upon my personal appearance ! But I shall not exchange compliments with him. Never have I known an occasion when a challenge was thrown out to the Opposition to behave, not as badly as those on the other side, because that would be impossible",46
420,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the question.,46
421,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I shall be very happy to give my views regarding the clause of the Bill to which we have taken exception, about which the honourable member for Parramatta made the statements which called forth the comments of the honourable member for Adelaide. That provision enables the Governor in Council to prohibit the exportation of any article. We know that in practice the Governor in Council means the Minister. There would have been no harm done had the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney been carried. He sought to limit the provision so as to provide for the prohibition of the exportation of produce likely to injure the reputation of the Commonwealth only after the approval of Parliament had been obtained. That amendment was defeatedevery member of the party which calls itself democratic voting against it.",46
422,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is not now in order. - Mr Fenton - On the point of order, the honourable member states that, the Committee decided by a majority against the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond. My understanding of what occurred is that we carried the amendment on the voices.",47
423,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memher is very disorderly in using the plea of a point of order to correct the statement another honourable member.,47
424,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"My objection to the Bill is that it contains a provision enabling Minister to prohibit exportation, not on ground that it would be injurious to the reputation of Australian products, but because, perhaps, he thinks goods are required within the Commonwealth, and should be denied export. If the Minister, influenced by some fad, held that hides should not be exported, he could prohibit their exportation,- and the producers of hides would then be limited to the Commonwealth market. This is not a remote possibility, because the honourable member for South Sydney this morning, and when speaking' nn the Address-in-Reply, strongly advocated an export tax on hides. Should a man imbued with his mania find himself in the Ministerial chair, he would have no hesitation in prohibiting the exportation ot hides. The Bill gives to the Minister a power whose exercise by one holding fanatical convictions upon economical questions might prove dangerous to the community.",47
425,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Most of us are going to stay in Melbourne over the week-end.,47
426,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have no desire to prevent the representatives of other States from catching their trains, and should not take advantage of their absence by trying count out the House, or in any other way.",47
427,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Would not the honourable member sooner have this Bill with all its faults than not have it ?,47
428,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Some of its provisions I like, but, as I told the honourable member on the second reading, it should have been amended. Could we know that he would be always in office, we should be prepared to trust him with the powers because he is not fanatical regarding exportation. But there are some fanatics in the world, and we cannot tell when some convulsion amongst my honourable friends opposite may result in another gentleman becoming the Minister of Trade and Customs.",47
429,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I wish to make a statement to the House which may possibly affect the arrangements of honourable members for next week.,47
430,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Ver y well. Perhaps I ought to apologize to my honourable friends for bestowing more attention upon the honourable member for Adelaide than be really deserves. But I did bitterly resent the attack which he made upon the honourable member for Parramatta, especially at a time when, if he had known the position, of he should not have cared to attack him.",47
431,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [4.27] - I desire to make a personal explanation. the Before the honourable member for Adethe laide left the chamber, he saw fit to comment upon some observations which I had made in regard to a statement by the honourable member for Hunter. ' The honourable member for Hunter was present at the time. I made those remarks, and did not think it necessary to reply to them. I venture to say that I made it abundantly clear that I accepted his denial of my statement in all sincerity. At the same time, I did not think that it was quite sufficient.",47
432,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am perfectly satisfied. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. REFERENDUM (CONSTITUTION ALTERATION) BILL.
