2,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to an article published in Mr Horatio Bottomley's newspaper, John Bull, which has a very large circulation, dealing with the case of an exBritish soldier who immigrated to Queens-' land? In this article, which is headed, ""Cheating the ex-Soldier,"" ""Emigrated by the Government and Stranded Overseas,"" it is stated that an ex-British soldier paid Â£85 by way of passage money for himself, his wife, and four children to Queensland; that when he arrived in Queensland there was no one to meet him, that he was stranded, and that all the promises held out as to a grant of land and so forth went hy the board. The man's wife died, and he had to pawn his toolsof trade, and clothing, as well as - his - deceased wife's effects in order to provide for himself and his family. While the article does not charge the Commonwealth with responsibility for this ex-British soldier's treatment, it has a very serious bearing' on the immigration scheme which the Commonwealth is now launching. I should like, therefore, to know whether the Prime Minister will draw the attention of the Direc - to the article, which has created much comment in England!",19
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"My attention was not drawn to this article u n t i l the 'honourable member spoke to me of it . I understand that this is alleged to be a typical example of the treatment of ex-British service men in Australia, and that, as the honourable member saye, the article has attracted some attention and given rise to adverse comment in England. It would be proper for me to say, in the first place, that I do not necessarily accept the statement in this article that promises were made, but the promises, if any, were made hy the State of Queensland, for which, of course, the Commonwealth is not in any way responsible. Secondly, the treatment of this ex-British soldier in Queensland is a matter of which I have no personal knowledge, and I am, therefore, unable to say whether, as a fact, it was as alleged. Speaking generally, I think it well that British people should be told that the Commonwealth Government is not in any way responsible for promises that are alleged to have heen made or for the treatment which it is said has been meted out to this soldier and his family. notice in the article a statement that "" Brisbane is full of out-of-works and returned soldiers without employment.''' - I cannot say whether that is true. If it is, then the state of things in Queensland is very different from that in every other State of the Commonwealth. Lastly,- I want to say, through the press, to intending emigrants from Britain , that the Commonwealth Government accepts no responsibility whatever for the position as set.out in this article. Under the scheme which it is launching, the Commonwealth will see to it that immigrants are not induced to come to Australia by false representations. There is ample room in the Commonwealth for everybody who will work, hut I think I m a y safely say that there is no room here for a man who will not work. Under the Commonwealth scheme, the organization at this end will see to it that a man, hia wife, and dependants who come out here receive a helping hand, and are put into the way of earning a decent livelihood. I shall bring the article under the notice of Mr Hunter, and take such steps as are necessary and proper to set right in the eyes of prospective British immigrants the position of the Commonwealth Government and of Australia generally.

7,Mr MACKAY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice- ' 1. Whether it is true that the war trophies allotted to Queensland arc still stored in Melbourne? '2. If so, what is the cause of the delay in forwarding these mementoes to their various destinations?  honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The trophies are still in Melbourne and Sydney. 2. When the allotment of trophies to Queensland was made letters were sent to the various towns advising them of their allotments and asking for instructions. Two hundred and sixty-seven circulars were sent, but only eightysix replies have heen received accepting the trophies. The delay in transmitting the trophies to the towns which have intimated their acceptance bas been caused through the fact that no decision has yet heen arrived at by the Queensland Government with regard to the payment of freight.",20

The tank is at present in the grounds of the Queensland Museum. The nature of its construction is not such that temporary exposure will do it any harm. 2. Its ultimate disposal will he decided by the Australian War Museum Committee at its meeting on 13th October. QUARANTIN EBIL L. SECOND READING.",21
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.43] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The measure is one which can best be dealt with in Committee, and I do not propose at this stage to offer more than a few brief remarks. There are only three major alterations of Ithe Act here proposed. The Government are making provision for the application of quarantine to parsons landing in Australia by aeroplane. The arrival of Sir Ross Smith and his party, and of Lieutenants Parer and Mcintosh, demonstrates that within a measurable period there may be people landingin our country from time to time by air-way. The routes to be traversed will bring these travellers through the countries immediately to the north of Australia, from which there is, perhaps, more danger of the introduction of diseases than from any other part of the world-diseases , too,"" which are the most menacing to the community as a whole. Eor instance, if we should get Asiatic cholera it will have come, in all probability, from the north; and it is considered advisable that there should be incorporated in the Federal quarantine law power to deal with persons arriving by air. The second major alteration provided for in this measure is one which will give the Commonwealth complete power, in the case of an outbreak of disease, to deal with all quarantine matters and override State legislation.",21
10,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Would this power cover such epidemics as the influenza visitation of 1918-19?,21
11,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It would. Honourable members will recall the faroical state of affairs revealed during that epidemic. The position which arose proved almost intolerable to the travelling public, as honourable members-who , themselves, were subjected to indignities while journeying from State to State-wil l bear witness. Yet the Commonwealth Government were practically powerless to deal with the whole matter in a comprehensive way. We are now proposing to take power, in the event of a quarantinable disease breaking out as between State and State, to effectively override any and all State legislation.",21
12,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The States made it known during the recent epidemic that the Commonwealth Government had not then the power.,21
13,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"'The law did not give us the power which we are proposing to take .now; and I am advised that the alterations set forth in the Bill will, at all events, prevent a repetition of absurd border restrictions, such as occurred a year or so ago. ^ There is only one other major alteration contained in the measure. It has to do with provision for the inoculation of persons undergoing active quarantine restrictions in regard to diseases other than small-pox. There are such virulent plagues, for example, as cholera and typhus. Without doubt-for the war has proved it over and over again-w e can prevent the spread of these diseases by proper inoculation, particularly, of persons undergoing active quarantine restrictions. 'Cholera is one of those diseases in regard to which it becomes urgently necessary to take precautions such as are here proposed; but, as the law stands, we have no power to compel people who are undergoing active quarantine to be inoculated against their will.",21
14,Mr EILEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Is this not taking away the freedom of the subject?,22
15,Mr MAXWELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That is what citizenship means.,22
16,Mr GEEENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"At present, I repeat, we have the power in regard to small-pox. But, concerning other diseases against which vaccination or inoculation has proved effective, it is only right, for the protection of the public generally, that we should also have power to institute compulsory inoculation. Mr TUDOR, (Yarra) [2.50] - I agree with the Minister that this is a Bill which can best be dealt with in Committee, but before we reach that .stage, I shovild like a little information on certain points. The Bill proposes to repeal section 8 of the principal Act, which reads as follows:This Act shall be administered by the Minister for Trade and Customs. I want to know what provision will take the place of this section?",22
17,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The necessity for section disappeared with the passing of the Acts Interpretation Act. The Act must be administered by a Minister.,22
18,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"There are several amendments in. the Bill which are certainly very necessary. For instance, provision must be made to prevent the introduction of diseases 'by persons arriving in Australia by air, because they are bound to pass through what is known as one of the disease centres of the world. I refer to the territories to the north of Australia. Recently I had a conversation with a quarantine officer, who informed me of the steps being taken in Queensland ports to deal with persons arriving from Gulf of Mexico ports by way of the Panama Canal, indicating how much closer we have been brought to the yellow fever zone by the opening of the Canal. I regard expenditure on quarantine as money spent on insurance. The Commonwealth Parliament ought always to be prepared to spend sumcient money to insure the people of Australia against the introduction of disease.",22
19,Mr MARRS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"But under this Bill, shipowners are called upon to pay.",22
20,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The ship-owners are called upon to pay while persons are in active quarantine, but while the quarantine stations are unoccupied the cost of their upkeep falls upon the Commonwealth. The Department must be prepared to provide medical omcers, nurses, cooks, and servants, and all the equipment of a quarantine station at a few hours' notice. It is only right that the ship-owners should pay for the maintenance of their passengers and crews if it be found necessary to place them in quarantine. It is proposed by clause 2 to insert a new section in the Act as follows:(1) Whenever the Governor General is satisfied that an emergency exists which makes it necessary to do so, he may, by proclamation, declare that any or all measures of quarantine prescribed by or under any State Act shall, for sueh period as is specified in the proclamation, cease to have effect, and such measure shall thereupon cease to have effect accordingly. (2) The Governor General may at any time revoke or vary any such proclamation. I am not quite sure whether this Parliament has the poAver to make such a provithe sion. No one in this House believes more than I do in the principle that the Commonwealth should be supreme over the States, but I am not quite sure how far-reaching the recent decisionof the High Court may the in this regard. Certainly, if it ean be interpreted to mean that the Commonwealth Parliament has complete control over the States in health matters, that is just the power this Parliament should have in this respect, because some of the regulations which the States put into operation during the influenza epidemic last year were absurd. Although influenza was endemic in every State, each 'State Government made frantic efforts to keep it out from where it was already well established. I hope that, if the Commonwealth Parliament - has the power which this proposed new section will give them, it will be exercised more wisely than it has been by the States. In this connection we must not forget that, prior to the influenza outbreak, at a conference presided over by the Minister (Mr Greene), the States agreed to give the Commonwealth full control in quarantine matters, but that, as soon as the representatives of the States got away from that conference, they went back on their promises.",22
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Victori a was the only exception.,23
22,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I have not looked into the clause which gives the Government power to inoculate any person who is in quarantine. I could, understand such a power being exercised in order to inoculate persons against the spread of the disease for which they have been quarantined. Mr MASSYGREENE. The power is restricted to such cases.",23
23,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I did not understand from the Minister's remarks that the power was to be so restricted. I understood him to say that persons coming down from. Eastern countries could be inoculated against the spread of diseases prevalent in those countries. Could a person quarantined for small-pox be inoculated for cholera?,23
24,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I do not think so. any rate, that is not what we propose tb do.",23
25,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I think the Government already have the power to inoculate persons in quarantine against the spread of any disease for which they have been quarantined. On one occasion the members of the Commonwealth Pearling Commission, who happened to be on board a steamer on which there was an outbreak of small-pox, bad to submit themselves to vaccination. Personally, I believe in inoculation, and I am only sorry that the ex-Postmaster-General (Mr. Webster), and an ex-member for Werriwa (Mr Conroy), are not here now to say something on the subject. As to the other provisions of the Bill, I shall be prepared to hear the Minister's explanations in Committee. If this additional protection is necessary, I am sure that no honourable member will object to give it.",23
26,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Franklin) [8:1]. - In my opinion, this Bill is necessary, and I hope the Minister (Mr Greene) will give some consideration to the recommendations made on Friday last by the Overseas Shipping Committee. That Committee has gone into the question of quarantine very fully, and has been distinctly told by the representative of the Federated Ship-owners that if an epidemic were to break out again they would simply refuse to undertake the expense entailed by the existing quarantine arrangements.. The liotomahana, I believe, was held up at Portsea for some seventeen days during an epidemic, at a cost of something like Â£1,200, in addition to the usual current expenses. At that time that-, and other vessels were being run by the Commonwealth Government, which had to foot the bill. The Federated Ship-owners declare that if similar circumstances were to arise again,, they would simply lay up their vessels. This, of course, would mean absolute isolation for the north coast of Queensland, the north coast of Western Australia, and Tasmania.",23
27,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Tasmani a looked for isolation, and then growled! Mr MoWILLIAMS - It is the first duty of the Government of any State to keep its people free from disease. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that where disease is present in a State quarantine is worse than useless, At but where a State is clear, that State, in spite of any legislation by the Commonwealth, will endeavour, as far as possible, to keep itseK clear. I hope that when the Bill is in Committee the Minister will propose a clause enabling the Government to enter into such financial arrangements with the shipping and trading companies as are fair to all parties. A vessel with passengers aboard may be suddenly quarantined for a fortnight or three weeks, and we ought not to expect the shipping companies to pay the cost of maintaining those passengers in quarantine. KTo doubt, as the Leader of the Opposition says, quarantine is a national insurance. We issue regulations for the purpose of protecting the people of all Australia from the introduction or spread of disease, and all Australia should contribute to the expense in some shape or form.",23
28,Sir JOSEPIT COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,There is the other view that trade of any kind should carry its own responsibilities.,23
29,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"And also that unless there is some power over the shipping and trading companies they may become careless, and introduce people who will transmit disease.",24
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Quarantin e is a great insurance against the introduction, of disease, and the onus is thrown ou the shipping companies not to introduce it. Mr MoWILLIAMS - I have not suggested for a moment that ship-owners should have any inducement to be careless, or that they should be entirely free from any obligation; but if we attempt to throw the whole onus on them they will decline to accept it, with the result that certain portions of Australia, which depend entirely on sea carriage, will be completely isolated. We have been warned by the Federated Ship-owners.",24
31,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That is because of the cussedness of the Tasmanian State Government; it was not action by the Federal Government that brought that about.,24
32,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If I were to express my opinion of how the quarantine regulations were carried out on a former occasion by the Federal authorities, it would not be found too complimentary. Unless we make some provision such as I have suggested in this Bill, we run the risk, as 1 say, of having certain portions of Australia absolutely cut off from communication.",24
33,Mr MAHON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Do you not think that the shipping companies would add to the cost of passenger tickets and freights?,24
34,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If that were done, people would simply be prevented from travelling at all, and we have no right to prevent them. People are quarantined for the benefit of all Australia, and, therefore, as I say, all Australia should be prepared to bear some portion of the expense.",24
35,Mr COESEE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Wide Bay) [3.9] - As a member of the Sea Carriage Committee, I can say that that body has gone exhaustively into the question of quarantine, and has been told, in no uncertain voice, by representative of the Federated Shipowners, that, in the case of another epidemic, they will refuse to run 'their steamers uuder existing conditions. I am not surprised at that decision, and I hope that the Minister, before we have concluded the consideration of this Bill, will consider the report of the Sea Carriage Committee, which will disclose to him the risks that we may have to run. We ought to deal with this (question of quarantine now, because after an epidemic has broken out, it is too late. The shipping companies are under an obligation not to charge more than a certain rate. No provision is made for the enormous expenditure that would be necessitated if an epidemic occurred again. During the last epidemic the ships running under the control of the Government incurred quarantine expenses to the amount of over Â£20,000, not taking into account the losses through laying up the ships, insurance charges, interest, and wages. The Botomahana alone had to pay Â£1,348 for the benefit of its passengers who were in quarantine. In one instance there was only one passenger on board the vessel, but that passenger had to be placed in quarantine, and the total cost of running the station had to be borne by the shipping control. The steam-ship Wyandra had to pay quarantine expenses amounting to Â£1,942 15s. 9d. Honourable members will see how unjust it would be to endeavour to force any company to run its steamers during an epidemic, and to incur these enormous expenses on account of conditions for which the companies were entirely blameless. It is not as if the disease was being brought to Australia by an overseas steamer. These vessels trade from port to port on the Australian coast, and it is impossible to guard against a passenger coming on board and showing signs of disease when the vessel is at sea. Both State and Commonwealth railways insist upon the passengers paying the quarantine charges. Why should the railways be exempt from these charges and the Inter-State steam-ship companies be compelled to pay them? It has been suggested that portion of the quarantine charges should bo debited to the companies, but that would necessitate allowing the companies to make an additional freight charge, which would be added to the cost of the goods. The merchant would add that extra charge the to his selling price, and the retailers in turn would make their profit on the extra cost. Thus the charge would become a heavier burden on the community than if it were borne in the first instance by the Government: An epidemic of any disease is a national infliction, and the expenses connected therewith should be charged to Consolidated Revenue, so that the whole of the people, and not merely a few individuals, may bear them. The only other alternative is to require the individuals quarantined to pay the expenses. But it was found, on the Queensland border, in the case of railway passengers who were quarantined, that such charges were difficult to collect. Some people' said they had not got the money that was required, and the charges had to be borne by the State. The more equitable way is to treat all alike, and charge all quarantine expenses to the Commonwealth in the first instance. A distinction should be made between steamers bringing diseases from overseas and those engaged in the Inter-State trade; these should be placed on all fours with the Inter-State railways. Nobody can say that the Inter-State steam-ship companies are responsible for any of these epidemics. If the Government consider it right that vessels should continue to run during an epidemic, why should the responsibility for quarantine expenses be borne by the companies? A f t e r all, quarantine is a form of national insurance. Passengers are sent into quarantine for the benefit of the whole community; therefore the whole community should be taxed with the cost. In that way the charge upon the people would be less than if 'the Inter-State steam-ship companies were allowed to compensate themselves by an extra freight charge which must be passed on through the merchants and the retailers, and paid by the consumers, together with the profit on the extra outlay. I trust that the Minister will give serious consideration this matter, and will realise the injustice that will be done to the steam-ship companies, and the risk of the Inter-State trade being discontinued. The steam-ship companies have given ample warning that they will not operate their Inter-State steamers during an epidemic if they are to be penalized in respect of quarantine .costs.",24
36,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Melbourne Ports) restrictions, [3.19] - I am very pleased that the Government have introduced this B i l and I hope the Commonwealth has the power which the Minister says it has. I remember that, during the influenza epidemic, the Premier of Tasmania took a very high stand. The Tasmanian on people were charged with having their heads in regard to quarantine, and when legislation to prevent such a thing recurring was threatened, the Premier of the "" fly-speck "" said that he would repel Commonwealth interference by force of arms if necessary. The Tasmanian Government insisted upon the exercise of its sovereign rights, and would not allow any encroachment upon them by the Commonwealth. Oue result of that action was that there was a great scarcity ,of many commodities in Tasmania, and the State Government theu proceeded to complain of the failure of the Commonwealth to afford the shipping facilities essential to the obtaining of supplies. I mention this only as an illustration of the unfairness and foolishness of the attitude adopted by some State Governments. In February of last year, when the influenza epidemic broke out in this State, the Premier of Western Australia was in Melbourne, and was prevented fro m returning to his home by the Acting Premier of Western Australia, who would not relax the State provisions as to people from Victoria entering Western Australia. The result was that the Acting Premier continued to occupy that position for about seven weeks. That is another illustration of the absurd way in which some States, will use what they claim to be their sovereign rights in order to upset the claims of the Commonwealth. I hope that this will provean effective measure, because I do not want a repetition of what occurred in February, 1919. The day after my return from South Australia, communication between Vict o toria aud South Australia was cut off. There were not manv honourable members about the House, but visitors from other States who were held up in Melbourne were constantly in search of their parliamentary representatives here, and - I in duced them to hold a meeting in the Treasury Gardens in order to discuss their position. That meeting was attended by some thousands of visitors from other States, who, because of the travelling were unable to return to their homes. Many of them were on the verge l , of starvation, and their respective State Governments wished to throw on Victoria the responsibility of providing for their wants. The Victorian Government was not responsible for the embargo placed travelling;, and it naturally refused to lost accept the responsibility.",25
37,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If the epidemic had not appeared here the Victorian Government would have acted as the obher State Governments did. ' Mr MATHEWS - A f t e r the quarantine was lift ed we discovered that there had been cases of influenza in Tasmania, although the epidemic was not as severe there as in the other States. These Inter-State restrictions are quite useless. carry the system to its logical conclusion, in the event of the outbreak of an infectious disease in , say, South Melbourne, residents of that suburb ought not to be allowed to visit any other suburb. If each State is to be shut off in this way we shall next have a proposal that each State shall be divided into districts for quarantine purposes. In connection with the influenza epidemic, there arose in Australia a condition of affairs which, I hope, will not recur. I trust that the Government have the power which they are seeking to exercise under this Bill , so that in the event of another epidemic the position will be better handled, and travellers will have justice done to tbem.",26
38,Mr MARR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Parkes) [3.25] - Every oue will agree with the view expressed by the Miuister for Trade and Customs (Mr , Greene)' that travellers who are likely to spread disease have a right to submit to quarantine and to inoculation. Those who were associated with the Army during the great war are able to appreciate to the full the value of inoculation and vaccination. We are all anxious to keep Australia free from those curses of the Eastcholera and small-pox. Even' in those countries where cholera has been - the subject of much scientific research, a safe inoculation against it has not been discovered. While I was in the East, 98 per cent, of those who contracted cholera lost theiT lives. Only 2 per cent, of the cases recovered. Honourable members therefore recognise how important it is that every precaution should be taken to prevent the introduction of that dread disease into Australia... I desire now to bring under the notice of the Minister the unsatisfactory position with regard to the Quarantine Station, Sydney. The station occupies a most prominent position at the entrance to Sydney Harbor, and although the situation in years gone by might have been an ideal one, the time has come influenza when, having regard to the large population surrounding the area, and particularly to the fact that thousands of people on their way from Sydney to Manly, the most popular picnic resort in Australia, pass it every day, another site should be secured.",26
39,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,'Where would the honTo orable member put the station?,26
40,Mr MARR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Furthe r down, the coast.  member suggest its removal to Canberra?",26
41,Mr MARR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I would not. The Quarantine Station must be convenient for shipping purposes. The New South Wales Quarantine Station for animals is situated at Five Dock, on the Parramatta River, one of the most populous parts of Sydney, in my electorate. There is a macadamized, road leading to this Quarantine Station, over which in many cases stock proceeding to quarantine have to be driven. The Commonwealth, however, will accept no responsibility for the maintenance of that roadway. I recently urged the Government to pay a portion of the cost of its up-keep, but the Department declined to recognise any responsibility in the matter. Honourable members will agree with me, I think, that stations for the quarantining of human beings, and also of animals, should be as far as possible from populous centres. Another aspect of quarantine that is lost sight of in Australia is that diseases may be readily introduced by means of the mail-bags that arrive from different - parts of the world. When mails from oversea arrive at some of our big post offices, the bags are upturned, and as the contents are emptied out the atmosphere becomes thick with dust. Mail-bags coming from the East are closed and sealed, and very often contain much d i rt and will dust. This dust is inhaled by the postal officials, and no measures are taken for tlieir protection. I have even known dead cats to be turned out of mail-bags. MT . MAXWELL - Is there a greater mortality amongst postal officials than among other sections of the community?",26
42,Mr MARR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Number s of postal officials have lost their lives as the result of diseases contracted by them while handling mail-bags. Quite a number of post-office officials lost their lives during the recent influenza epidemic, and the Depnrtment disclaimed any Tesponsibility in the matter. No precautions are taken by the - Department to prevent the dissemination of disease in this way. The fumigating of mail-bags is only a spasmodic operation. My contention is that every time a mail-bag is emptied it should be turned and .fumigated before it is again put into use.",26
43,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"A.r e there fumigating rooms at the various post-offices? - Mr MARR - There may be such a room at the General Post Office in each State capital, but on that point I cannot speak definitely. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has referred to the expense to which steam-ship companies are subjected in maintaining passengers while in quarantine. I hold no brief for the steam-ship companies, but since passengers travelling by rail are maintained at the cost of the Government when they are ordered into quarantine, I think that passengers by Inter-State steamers should also be maintained while in quarantine by the Government. So fa r as passengers from oversea ports are concerned, I think there is a good deal to be said for the point made by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) by way of interjection, that the fact that the shipping companies are responsible for their maintenance while in quarantine leads tbem to take precautious as to the class of people whom they accept as passengers from outside ports. While it is necessary that precautions sliould be taken to prevent the spread of an infectious disease from one State to another. I think that since the people of the Commonwealth are of one race we should afford facilities for travelling under reasonable safeguards, and undertake the maintenance of travellers by rail or Inter-State steam-ship, while they are in quarantine. These are matters that can be dealt with better in Committee thaii in the House, but I hope that the representations I have made in regard to the quarantine station at Sydney Heads will receive the attention' of the Minister, aud that action will be taken by the Goveniment to remove it to a more suitable site, where there will be less likelihood of the spread of disease.",27
44,Mr WATKI NS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Newcastle) [3.32] I should like to refer briefly to the attitude taken up by the Government in regard to passengers on Inter-State steamers that are ordered into quarantine. During the last influenza epidemic many Inter-State vessels were held up, ancl their owners were put to considerable expense in maintaining passengers while they remained in quarantine. I hold no brief for these companies, but since they are in a position to pass on the cost so incurred by raising fares, and thus penalizing travellers, I tliink it would be better for the Commonwealth to undertake the maintenance of all persons held in quarantine. People are put into quarantine net so much fox their own benefit as for the protection of the health of the whole communityj and I feel, therefore, that the cost of their maintenance, while in quarantine, should be borne by the whole community. When a vessel from overseas arrives at a Commonwealth port with persons on board suffering from a quarantinable disease, I think that if the outbreak was the result of laxity on the parr, of the ship-owners or their representatives, the cost of maintaining the passengers in quarantine should be borne by the ship-owners. But it is unfair that persons who, in the course of business, have to travel from State to State, should be called upon to pay fares in excess of those that would be charged but for the fact that the shipping companies are liable for the maintenance of passengers on a vessel ordered into quarantine.",27
45,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,What would be the position of a person who was simply going for a 'holiday?,27
46,Mr WATKINS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If there is an epidemic, I do not think there are many people who will care to go holiday-making.",27
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Many people travelled on holiday during the last epidemic.,27
48,Mr WATKINS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I think the Minister is raising a point which is not worthy of consideration. Why should the Government seek to treat travellers by water differently from travellers upon railways? Even the latter, I hold, should not be compelled to bear the costs of quarantine. But the point is that the costs are not charged to the railways; yet expenses in respect of quarantining a ship's company are to be charged to the vessel. In the light of evidence tendered to the Select Committee on Sea Carriage concerning costs incidental to rmining steamers, I am not surprised that shipowners should threaten to tie up their vessels during future epidemics.",27
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Before framing its report, did the Committee call any evidence from the Director of Quarantine relating to this subject?",28
50,Mr WATKINS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,^No.,28
51,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It would have been advisable to hear both sides of the question. - Mr WATKINS . ^ I do not .think it was necessary to call the Director as a witness. I have nothing to say against the Quarantine Department; it did wonderfully good work during the recent epidemic. But its Director is a Government official, and, so long as some one else foots the bill, he will see that the last Wtter of the law is obeyed. I say that he' would be likely to follow that course, any way, if he were aware that the Government was not being required to pay.",28
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Exactly ! Mr WATKINlS -^-If that interjection conveys a true indication of the viewpoint of the Minister, one can appreciate the reasons underlying his proposal to pass costs on to the ship-owners. - it is not fair to the travelling community. Persons travelling by water should be treated in the same manner as travellers on land, whether by railway, or motor conveyance.",28
53,Mr BAMFORD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Considerin g the risks run by sea travellers, they should receive fairer treatment. Mr WATKMiS - At least the same. If an epidemic occurs, every citizen of the Commonwealth should be treated alike.. If - the authorities force shipowners to tie up their vessels, the whole community will be prejudicially affected.",28
54,Mr MARRS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Wentworth) [3.40] - I join forces with those honourable members who have objected to quarantine costs being foisted upon the steam-ship comipauies. Evidence has been tendered, on behalf of ship-owners, before the Sea Carriage Select Committee, and practically every member of that Committee has appealed to the Minister (Mr. Greene) to study the viewpoint of the companies in the matter of quarantine. Quarantine is a national matter; it is a form of national insurance. Why, then, should the cost be placed on the shoulders of any one section of the community? Most honourable members, I understand, have received a precis setting forth the enormous costs borne by shipping companies during the recent outbreak of influenza. I notice, fr&m the information tendered ,under the heading, ""Statement of Quarantine Accounts Paid"", the following items:Koonda, Â£245; Rotomahana, Â£1,348; Paringa, Â£632; Wainui, Â£596; Viotoria, Â£833; Wodonga, Â£620; Wyamdra, Â£1,942; Dimboola, Â£621; Dvmboola, Â£855. It appears that if a ship lands one passenger in an empty quarantine station, that vessel is debited with the whole of the expense of running the station for that one passenger. This is a most serious matter, and it is indicated that if another outbreak occurs in Australia the companies will be compelled to lay up their ships. I do not blame them. Not only is the question of quarantine charges involved; but what of the general loss in running their vessels?",28
55,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Does the honourable member contend that the companies paid those sums ? But Mr MARRS - Such is apparently the case-o n the face of the statement from which I have just quoted.,28
56,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The companies did not get one penny less as the result of the institution of quarantine.,28
57,Mr MARRS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I understand that the total sum which they' were required to pay was in the neighbourhood of Â£20,000.",28
58,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,'They did not pay anything. The Government paid.,28
59,Mr COBSEB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,But they will not do so again.,28
60,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That is another matter.,28
61,Mr MARRS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,If another outbreak occurs the shipping companies will be required to meet the same total cost in similar circumstances. I agree with the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) respecting the point raised concerning differential treatment as between travellers on trains and in steamers. Why should not passengers actually affected be called upon to pay? Why make the steamship companies meet the cost and let the railway authorities go free?,28
62,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Capricornia) [3.43] - I shall not support the Government in their proposal to secure power to compel all persons quarantined to be vaccinated against the disease in regard to which they have been quarantined. I am wondering just where this business of compulsion is going to lead us. We shall soon be in a servile state, bound body and soul. I do uot desire to cast any reflection on the medical profession, for there are several doctors to - whom I am under a deep debt of gratitude. It must be remembered, however, that there are as many schools of medical thought as there are of politics. Sufferers from nasal catarrh, a very common Australian complaint, will go to some doctors who will conscientiously insist on an operation to straighten the septum. Another, with sore throat, will be urged to have his tonsils cut out, though the profession has not yet decided what are the functions of the tonsils. A sufferer from stomach ache may gc to one doctor who will insist on cutting him open and taking out his appendix; another will recommend a dose of castor oil and a few days' fast. Sometimes the operation kills; more often the castor oil cures. For every doctor who believes in inoculation for the cure or prevention of disease, you can discover another doctor who just as conscientiously does not belL/e in inoculation. I plead for liberty of thought and action. The Government propose that if a boat reaches an Australian port with a case of typhus, or cholera, or influenza, everybody on that vessel shall be quarantined, and everybody-health y and sick alikeshall be vaccinated against the particular disease. That is to say, healthy persons as well as sick must submit, whether they wish it or not, to the introduction into their systems of some poison or other. For the preservation of the liberty of the subject. I hope honourable members will uot agree to the proposal. If persons who are quarantined desire to be inoculated against the particular disease in respect of which they have been quarantined, then, by all means, let them be inoculated. But if a person objects to having his blood poisoned-for that is what it may mean-wit h the virus of that particular disease, why should he be compulsorily vaccinated ? I understand that our soldiers are generally satisfied with the results of vaccination and inoculation during the war. Numbers of them, I have been told, had to undergo one process or the other as often as fourteen and twenty times. These treatments, I am told, were a success.",28
63,Mr LISTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,And were essential.,29
64,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"No one can tell, however, to what extent the vaccinations and inoculations may have decreased the soldiers' vitality and reduced their powers of resistance.",29
65,Mr MAXWELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Bette r to have one's vitality reduced than to lose one's life. Mr HIGGS.^-Very true; but, if the honourable member cares to consult books of reference concerning vaccination, he will be, able to peruse records of dreadful cases where people have had their lives mined - by vaccination.",29
66,Mr MARRS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,But this is an argument which will never end.,29
67,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Tru e again. There are people who favour vaccination and people who are opposed to the process. I have already pointed that out; and I again ask why should those who do not wish to be vaccinated be compelled to undergo - the operation ? Personally, I am quite satisfied to take the chances as I go through life. During the influenza epidemic I had to undergo quarantine at Albury. There I spent a tiresome term of eight days. So far as the efficacy of quarantine was concerned, people were coming and going to and from the quarantine area, and were in daily association with influenza patients. The whole business was largely a farce. We, perfectly healthy people, ran greater risks of ptomaine poisoning, on account of the bad food, than of infection with influenza. I got out of the quarantine area with a clean bill of health, and subsequently travelled through a portion of Queensland. In almost every hotel at which I stayed there were influenza patients. In some there were as many as twenty cases. However, I escaped scot-free, although many doctors, of course, would have vaccinated me if they had had the power. I admit that it is wise to quarantine either travellers on shipboard or contacts in a dwelling where there is infectious disease; but cannot the community be safeguarded by the maintenance of such persons in quarantine until all danger has passed, rather than subject everybody to compulsory vaccination? It is wrong for Parliament to attempt to interfere in this extreme manner with the liberty of the subject. I know, of course, that there are some people who thoroughly believe in vaccination and in jection in connection with the most trivial complaints. That is all very well, and may be of value in the maintenance of their health; but why make the business compulsory? I heard of a man the other day, by the way, who was afflicted with a common catarrhal cold. H is doctor wanted to bore a hole in his skull, but a neighbour advised him not to submit to the operation, but to take a dose of a certain medicine, which I do not - intend specifically to mention. In a few days the sick man was walking about again, enjoying his ordinary good health.",29
68,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Was it a asylum ?,30
69,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"No , it was in a very respectable and intelligent suburb of Melbourne. I am sure that the honourable and medical member who has asked that question knows that tliere are certain doctors in the community who believe, quite conscientiously aud sincerely, that immediately a catarrh forms in the nostrils or ear, relief can be afforded only - by an operation in the forehead, or at the back of the ear. If my honourable friend bas not met any of these gentletine ? men, I can assure him that I have done so. However, there is a difference of opinion among the medical profession i all these questions. It is not more than 100 years-m y historical memory may not be quite correct as to the time-sinc persons were bled for every disease or ailment, whether it was toothache or likely typhoid fever.",30
70,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The life of the heir to the throne of England was lost through his mother, Princess Charlotte, having been bled to death.",30
71,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I know that the honoris able member could quote hundreds of i stances in which people would have covered if they had not been bled death. We have now reached a stage i the progress of medicine and surgery when some members of the profession think that persons ought to be inoculated against every form of disease. I hope the Minister will not press this provision, which seeks to compel every healthy perhealthy son not affected by the disease a house or vessel has been, quarantined to submit to inoculation. I uTge honourable members not to be too ready to i sist upon compulsion. If we go on at this rate, there will soon come a time - when we will all be compelled, as in olden times, to wear only a certain type of clothes, or part our hair in a certain way, or eat only certain foods, or drink specified beverages only. We already have compulsory enrolment, and in some places compulsory voting is enforced. I remember reading of John Ruskin the fact that never in his l if e did he vote for a political candidate, but if certain people had their way they would take a man like John Ruskin by the scruff of the neck, push him to a polling booth, and compel him to vote. Of course, there can be no guarantee that a lunatic compulsory vote will be recorded for a certain candidate, and we know that an individual may escape the compulsory voting provisions by rendering his vote informal; but under this Bill there will be no escape for persons who are placed in quarantine from being inoculated with the vaccine of tuberculosis, influenza, cholera, typhoid, or some other form of disease.",30
72,Mr MAXWELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Would the honourable member compel persons to go into quaran,30
73,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yes , I do not object to that restriction on persons' liberty; but n the danger an individual runs in going into a quarantine station and putting up with the risk of contracting ptomaine e poisoning through the eating of bad food is small compared with the danger he is to run by being compelled to be in oculated with a poison prepared from typhus, cholera, tuberculosis, influenza, or small-pox. Let us bear in mind the fact that some of these diseases are the result of filth or vice. My own opinion that if we would live moderately and n - keep ourselves clean in mind and body, reand if we would not be led away by a to lot of quack nostrums recommended to n us, we would get along much better, even in times of plague. However, I have no desire to be giving free medical advice in competition with the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), but I urge honourable members not to compel people to be inoculated as is profor which posed under this Bill .",30
74,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Wakefield) [3.56] - When the Minister replies, In - hope that he will announce the attitude of the Government in regard to the question of the cost of quarantining. It is outrageous to expect private companies engaged in Inter-State shipping to carry what is a national burden, particularly when ' it may have been incurred through circumstances quite outside their control. I am aware that the cost of quarantining during the serious outbreak of influenza last year was very excessive, mainly owing to the conflict of Commonwealth and State authorities, and some relief, I understand, will be afforded by the passage of this Bill , which will make the Commonwealth the dominating authority should such an emergency arise again, but still every care will need to be exercised, and its exercise will involve considerable expenditure, which it is not right the ship-owners should be called on to bear.",30

There seems to be a wrong impression to the treatment of the steam-ship panies during the influenza outbreak. equalled anywhere else. At that time the vessels of those comUnited panies were under the control of the monwealth Government, and while, no doubt, the charges were debited against the shipping companies, I do not think they really were called upon to pay them. However, I hope the Minister will plain the matter very clearly, so that misapprehension in this direction may be removed. The position is not likely occur again, now that the Inter-State shipping has gone back into its normal channels, but if any arrangement is to made for the future, it is infinitely better that it should be embodied in this B i I can say more about this when the measo sure is in Committee, but I ask the M i ister, when replying, to let the House know the attitude of the Government this respect.",31
77,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Melbourne) [ 4 . 0 ] shall support the Government in the matter of compelling ship-owners to pay everything. I speak as one who has been a medical oflicer on seven lines of steamers, and I can assure the Govern the ment that nothing will make shipping companies more careful about taking diseases on board their vessels than fact that they may be liable to heavy expenses for the maintenance of their crews and passengers in quarantine. instructions as medical officer on board the China Steam Navigation Company's boats were that I was to be most careful in allowing any passenger whatever on board. That was prior to the wise administration of the Philippines by the United States Government, which is standing, not ouly as a bulwark of safety against any enemy approaching Australia, but also as a sentinel i u health matters. Every ship leaving an Australian port for Manila must be visied, not only by the Australian health authorities, but also by the American Consul. Similarly, any vessel leaving Kobe, in Japan, must be viseed, not only by the Japanese authorities, but also by the United States Consul there,- who must also furnish a return of the number of contagious and infectious diseases in the port for the fortnight preceding the ship's departure. The same rules apply when the vessel touches at Hong Kong, it is allowed to call at Manila. But health is looked after so thoroughly as and so systematically by the Americans comthat I have not seen the arrangements I thank the States for the splendid example Comthey have set in quarantine matters. I have had some experience in quarantine. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr . Bamford), Senator Givens, and I , when-, as members of the Pearling Commission, exwe were quarantined, were patriotic all enough to ask to be vaccinated with Australian lymph. But it was not lymph, to it was filth. The temperature of the honourable member for Herbert was 103 degrees; that of Senator Givens was be 104.5, and I was very much afraid that he would lose his l if e ; aud although mine l l . was 1.02.5, my friends tell me that I was bad tempered that I asked them, ' ' For n - God's sake not to bother me, but to leave me alone."" Two officers of this House in who accompanied the Commission were also vaccinated, and although they had - I occupied the cabin which a husband who escaped the small-pox, and his wife, who developed it , had previously occupied on their return from their honeymoon, and although one of the officers had slept in berth in which the patient had previously slept, neither of them had any rise in temperature after vaccination. the They had chosen Japanese lymph for one arm, and American lymph for the other, and in both cases the lymph was perfect. My I do not know whether or not the Australian lymph had deteriorated by being kept at Tdwnsville, but if I am similarly placed again, I shall ask for American or Japanese lymph. I congratulate the Minister upon the improvement that has been made in the quarantine arrangements, with much benefit to those unfortunates who are detained. We must remember that those people are not sent there for any crime, but are merely segregated for the welfare of the community; and I maintain that there ought to be no differentiation in the matter of food or accommodation between first, second, and third class passengers. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) will remember that, on the occasion to which I have referred, I sent some very "" sultry "" telegrams to the then Minister for Trade and Customs, who, strange to say, was my present honoured leader (Mr Tudor).",31
78,Mr BAMFORD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,They were sultry!,32
79,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"And they were justified. Ladies of the second class were called upon to take their baths in a place where the washing was done, and the bathing accommodation consisted of a very small vessel only 10 inches deep. The fool officer of the Department who advised the then Minister for Trade and Customs, said that those ladies were provided with hot shower baths, and I replied that that information was not only inaccurate, but idiotic, inasmuch as there were no such baths. I am glad to say that the saloon passengers had a meeting, and agreed, without a dissentient, to place half the number of baths reserved for them at the disposal of the second class and steerage passengers. As I have said, the accommodation is now much better, but I protest today, as I did then, against any differentiation.",32
80,Mr BAMFORD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Passenger s by sea have you to thank for the expenditure of Â£20,000 in improving the accommodation at the North Head Quarantine Station, Sydney.",32

83,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If Sydney were one constituency, and I had the honour to represent it in this Parliament, I should do my best to have the quarantine station removed from that site, for it is au absolute infamy to have it so near a population of 500,000. Sydney is living on the brink of an inferno, for there is only the thickness of a piece of galvanized iron between the quarantine station and the people of Manly, and school children of the quarantine station actually associate with contacts like myself, and attended school at Manly. I may also say that from Townsville right down to Sydney there was only one doctor who took any antiseptic measures, and that was .the Japanese medical man on board:",32
84,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,He did well!,32
85,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The other elongated doctor, in my opinion, did not know the ABC of the business. I can relate an incident which may cany some weight with the Minister. I was medical officer on board a steamer entering a foreign port, and the captain, acting under the orders of the ship-owners, came to me and said that I was to put down in the record the name of a disease different from that I thought a suspicious case on board represented. To honourable members who know me, I need not say that this I refused to do, and, in consequence, I had a very rough time. In another case, a captain was a little more courteous, and, possibly, a little more astute. There were two suspicious cases on board, and in reference to these the captain said to me, "" Don't you think the illness is so a/nd so ?"" I looked at him, and said, "" Well, I cannot give an opinion at the present moment, but I should.be very loath to say it was."" Luckily, the cases did not prove to be dangerous, and, they having been segregated, we got through without trouble. So far as the English shipping companies are concerned, I have neither respect nor regard for them, though I have for the China Navigation Company, which gave me an absolutely free hand. I ask the Minister to be firm in making the shipping companies pay the expense of quarantine.",32

90,Mr GEEENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Richmond-Minister for 'Trade and Customs) [4.15] - There are only two questions on which I desire to say a few words in reply. Several honourable members doubt whether the Government have the power to do what is proposed, namely, to override the legislation of the States under certain circumstances. I tliink we have that power. Section 51 of the Constitution, which confers on the Commonwealth practically all the powers it exercises, specifically gives the power in paragraph ix. Then section 109 providesWhere a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, und the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. Clause 2 of the Bill providesWhenever the Governor General is satisfied that an emergency exists which makes it sary to do so, he may, by proclamation, declare that any or all measures, of quarantine prescribed by or under any State Act shall, for such period as is specified in the proclamation, notice until it was referred to today. cease to have effect, and such measure shall thereupon cease to have effect accordingly. Inasmuch as we have power to legislate in regard to quarantine, and in view of section 109 of the Constitution. I do not think there is any doubt whatever that this Bill will override any State legislaargument. tion, and that is the view held by our Crown Law advisers. Of course, all such legislation has to stand the test of actual experience, but we believe that the provisions of the Bill will meet such an emergency as arose during the recent in fluenza epidemic.",33
91,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"What would be done with Tasmania, the authorities of which State refusod to permit people to land during that epidemic?",33
92,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The only power by which they could prevent people landing would be that exercised by virtue of the fact that the State had passed certain quarantine laws. Without being able to express a legal opinion, I think that if the authorities of a State tried to prevent a person landing, such a person would, under the provisions of this Bill , have an action against the State Government for forcible detention or something of that sort, andcould proceed for damages. [220]",33
93,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,A person with no means could not do that.,33
94,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The probabilities are that a person of means would take the first action, and once the claim had been upheld by the Courts, a person of poor means could easily find somebody to back him under the circumstances. However, I do not wish to labour the point at this stage, but will reserve anything further I have to say until we are in Committee. I now come to the question raised by quite a number of honourable members as to whether or not the shipping companies should be called on to bear the expense, in the event of Inter-State vessels being ordered into quarantine.",33
95,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,There should be no differentiation between oversea and Inter-State vessels.,33
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I think there is a difference. This question, I understand, is ono that has been investigated by the neces- Overseas Shipping Committee, and I am sorry that by some means or other that fact did not come under my personal I did not know that the interim report of that Committee dealt with the subject, and I had not an opportunity to peruse it. I wish I had had such an opportunity, because it would . have enabled me to for t if y myself with some information and The Ac t as it stands is very clear on this matter. Section 59 of the Act of 1908 provided thatTlio owners and agents of any vessel ordered into quarantine shall supply the crow and passengers thereof with such wholesome and suitable provisions and medicines as are required by the quarantine or medical officer in charge of the quarantine station, or as are prescribed. The Act of - 1912 repealed that section and substituted the following provision :The master, owner, and agent of any vessel ordered into quarantine, or of any vessel from which any person is removed to perform quarantine, shall severally be responsible for(a) the removal of the passengers and crew to the quarantine station; (6) the care and maintenance of the passengers and crew while detained at the quarantine station; (c) the conveyance of the passengers from the quarantine station to their ports of destination; and (d) the medical surveillance of persons released under quarantine surveillance, and shall supply to the satisfaction of the Minister all such service, attendance, meals, and otlier things as aVe required for those purposes, including domestic and laundry service, medicines, medical comforts, nursing, and attendance for the sick. (2) The master, owner, or agent of the vessel may arrange with the Minister for the carrying out of any responsibility under this section, and for the payment of the expenses tliereof, but in any case the Minister may take action if he thinks it necessary to do .so, and any expense incurred shall be paid by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel to the Commonwealth. (3) A passenger shall not be liable to compensate the master, owner, or agent for any cost incurred by the master, owner, or agent under tins section, and any contract or stipulation purporting to impose any such liability upon him shall to that extent be null and .void. That, of course, applies to all shipping. This Bill proposes to further amend that section, by inserting after paragraph ol of sub-section 1 the following paragraphs :(e) The provision of such medical, nursing, and other attendance on the vessel and at the quarantine station for or in respect of the vessel as the Minister considers necessary; and (/) tlic provision of such launch and patrol services and such supervision as the Minister considers necessary to insure the satisfactory performance of quarantine by the vessel and the persons and goods thereon. There is no doubt that, when the original legislation was passed, the intention Parliament was that the owners of vessels coming to Australia from overseas should bear the whole burden of quarantine. I do not think honourable bers who spoke this afternoon the equity and desirability of that provision. It is abundantly clear that one of the greatest precautions we can take against the introduction of disease is to place upon the owners the - for paying the whole of the costs in the event of any vessel bringing disease to Australia necessitating the ship placed in quarantine. The which has been raised this is whether, in the event of an epidemic of disease within the Commonwealthnot necessarily a disease imported overseas, but one that is endemic and becomes, suddenly epidemic--the provision should apply to Inter-State Mr Greene. It would appear that section 59 has been brought under notice by the circumstances of the influenza epidemic in 1918-19, which caused a vast amount of expense and inconvenience. I understand that the whole of that expense was borne by the Commonwealth. At that time the vessels were under the control of the Government, the companies being paid Blue-Book rates for the use of their ships. The Commonwealth had to bear the whole cost of maintenance, and also quarantine. I am sorry that I have not had the chance of refreshing my memory as to the details, but I think I am righ t in saying that when that trouble arose an arrangement was made to divide the quarantine charges, half being debited to the Shipping Controller and the ' other half to Consolidated Revenue.",33
97,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The evidence before the Sea Carriage Select Committee contradiets that statement.,34
98,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Probably , for thisreason: that the Auditor-General in sisted upon our claiming the full cost, and then, after the money 'had been paidinto Consolidated Revenue, making a rebate. In the event of a similar epidemic arising, with the powers which we are now taking to deal with the situation, the farcical condition of affairs which was responsible for nine-tenths of that expense will never arise again. The position was such that, .1 admit quite frankly, the Commonwealth was powerless, and to whatever the States required of of us in regard to quarantine, we were practically compelled to submit. The officers of the Quarantine Department were perfectly satisfied as to the ineffecmem- tiveness and absurdity of some of the question proposals put forward by the States, but we were powerless, and the States, working on the terror of the people, imposed restrictions and incurred enormous exj)ense, which was unnecessary, and, as responsibility events proved, quite futile.

There"" is a world of difference between quarantine under proper conditions and the policy adopted during the influenza epidemic. I hope that honourable members will not be misled by what occurred duringthat epidemic into opposition to the Bill , because I feel certain that, undera properly conducted quarantine system, the same state of affairs would not arise. Suppose that it became necessary, owing to the outbreak of disease in Australia, to institute a rigid system of quarantine between States, and to quarantine vessels indiscriminately-althoug h I think that this is very unlikely- I feel' satisfied that the powerwe now. possess to. remit quarantine charges, orso much of them as may be considered equitable in the circumstances, will be found sufficient to meet the case. No Government would permit the whole of the shipping of any portion of Australia, to be tied up, thus preventing people travelling between States, when that could be avoided by an equitable arrangement. Such anarrangement can be made [220]- 2",35
105,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Would it not be better to make the equitable arrangement before the epidemic occurs?,35
106,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"We have power now to make an equitable arrangement, and we exercised it during the last epidemic. Owing to the restrictions which the Government of New South Wales desired to impose, a number of Intra-State vessels that were voyaging along the coast of that State were quarantined. We undertook the work for the State Government, because we had the necessary machinery at our disposal, and in those cases we remitted one-half of the charges. I do not think there is any doubt that, in the event of such circumstances arising, ih would be quite possible to make a similar equitable arrangement, under which certain charges would be borne by the shipping companies and the rest by the Government. In some cases, perhaps, no part of the charges would be borne by the shipping companies.",35
107,Mr COBSEB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Why not insert - such a .provision in the Bill itself? We should then know where we were.,35

111,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"We do not.

112,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,O r how we could have compelled Victoria visitors from New South Wales during the small-pox epidemic some years ago,36
113,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Quite so. I do not know whether the Minister (Mr Greene) is relying upon a recent decision of the High Court, but I hope it will be found that as the outcome of that decision we have this power in respect of not only health matters, but many other important considerations. If we have, then the fights that many of us put up in connection with our referenda proposals were ce.'sary. .""""Ir. GREENE (Richmond-Minister ior Trade and Customs) [ 4 . 4 0 ] - I do not wish to labour this question, but I hope that I have not been misunderstood. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) says that, if we have the power which we seek to exercise under this clause, then all the referenda proposals were more or less unnecessary, I am led to remind him that the attitude which we take up can be right in regard to only those specific powers which the Constitution vests in the Commonwealth Parliament. Section 109 of the Constitution provides thatWhen a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the .inconsistency, be invalid. That applies only to those matters in respect of which we have the specific power to legislate.",36
114,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,And we have specific power to legislate in regard to quarantine.,36
115,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yes . Paragraph ix. of section 54 of the Constitution gives us power to legislate with respect to "" Quarantine."" The paragraph consists of the one word "" Quarantine."" I hope, consequently, that this will be found to be a valid and effective provision.",36
116,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Franklin) [4.42]. - The Minister, in submitting this clause, is relying on that, section of the Constitution which gives the Commonwealth the power to make laws with respect to quarantine. No doubt we have such a power. There is, however, a very much wider question to be considered, and that is as to whether the States have not the right to protect the health of their own people. That question has been, tested rather freely. I was in Victoria when an outto receive break of small-pox occurred in New South Wales, about the year 1913, and I have a very vivid recollection of the Government of this State refusing to allow any one to come in from New South Wales. Despite this Bill , the same position will arise if a virulent disease breaks out in any .State. In such a case, the Governments of all the other States will very properly take whatever measures they think necessary to protect the health of their own people. I would, therefore, urge the Minister not to rely too strongly on this power. I hope that when we reach a later clause he will see his way clear to provide for such an amendment as a Select Comimittee, representing all sides of the House, has felt it to be its duty to recommend.

I was surprised, however, at a certain statement of the Minister concerning the recent outbreak of influenza. It came as news to me to learn that the Commonwealth Government had paid the whole of the expenses incurred in - connection with the quarantining of ships plying between the mainland and Tasmania, and that they had paid also the expenses of individual passengers on those vessels. I would remind honourable members that persons travelling to Western Australia who were quarantined at Port Augusta had to pay at the rate of 10s. per day. The conditions as between Tasmanian internees and Western Australians were similar. The Governments of those two States had temporarily run amok. They insisted on the observance of certain quarantine conditions. It comes, therefore, as a shock to learn that, while Western Australians were compelled to pay the Government 10s. per day for the provisions existing in the camp of detention at Port Augusta-.for such it was originally, at any rate-Tasmanian s had all their expenses paid. They were put on board ship and taken down the Bay, and their maintenance was made a charge on the Commonwealth Government. The whole thing is unfair, and, had the circumstances been known at the time, there would have been a considerable stir raised in this House on behalf of Western Australian travellers. I speak feelingly, for I was among those who had to pay 10s. per day at Port Augusta. Had I known the facts, such as have now been made public, I would have had much more to say at the time.",37
125,Mr JAMES PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,You might get your money back now.,37

When the influenza epidemic broke out in Queensland, proper supplies of lymph were not to be had. In some cases people who were vaccinated almost lost their lives; others, lost their limbs ;: while othersagain, actually died as the result of: improper lymph being used. Doctors werevaccinating with lymph which had been taken from ai calf only ' six days previously. I know that a case of anthrax occurred in that manner. It was shown that, instead of the lymph havingbeen preserved i u glycerine forabout two nuuitlis,. and retained in cold storage for three months, it had been taken almost direct froma caM which' had been running in a stock-yard , where, some time earlier, anthrax cattle had probably been yarded. It is a fact that, - in Victoria, the germs of anthrax have remained in the soil of a district for.as long as t h i r t y )t*as, and that when stock, have been placed in that district, although it has been unoccupied by cattle for a long while, anthrax has re-appeared.

As I say, it was proved that the lymph had been takenfrom a. calf about six days previously, without having undergone any process of purification.

In regard to vaccines for small-pox, we have at present 500,000: doses actually in stock in the freezing chamber connected with the Institute. I hope that honourable members who have not visited: this institution wil l take the earliest opportunity of doing, so. It - is. one of the finest of its kind in the southern hemisphere.

It appears that after the Commonwealth took over the control of Papua, Mr Wickham applied to exercise his right of purchase, but when steps were taken to prepare the necessary documents it was found that instead of containing 6,000 acres the lease did not embrace more than 1.800 acres.  cf Papua claimed that the islands contained 6,000 acres, while Mr Wickham contended that his lease did not cover mere than 3,000 acres, but a survey showed it did not embrace more than 1,S00 acres. It was this dispute which caused the delay.",39
143,Mr CHARLTON,WESTRALIAN FARMERS,"At any rate, I understand that since then he has been endeavouring to get the freehold of the land in accordance with the terms of his original lease from the British Government, but has been prevented by the provisions of the Papua Act, which came into force in 1906, and prohibited the further alienation of any land in Papua. I understand that the matter was referred to the then Attorney-General, now Mr 'Justice Isaacs, for an opinion, and he held that although Mr Wickham had no legal claim to secure the freehold of this island, because of the legislation passed by this Parliament, from a moral and equitable point of view he was entitled to it .  happened practically amounted to a breach of f a it h on the part of the Commonwealth, which could only be remedied by an Act of Parliament.",39

149,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Y a r r a ) [ 5 . 1 5 ] weeks ago, when t h is Bill was previousl y be for e us, I raised the question of t a k in g .a w e a l th census along with the o r d in a r y census. H o n o r a b l e members w h o were in t h is P a r l i a m e n t in 1914-15 are aware that the Government of the day took a w e a l t h census, in order to ascertain exactly how the people of Australia stood in the matter of assets w h i c h m i g h t be used for the prosecution of the w a r , and , p r i o r to speaking on the second reading of t h is Bill previously, I b a d telephoned to A i r . K n i b b s and asked him whether his D e p a r t m e n t w o u l d raise any objection to the t a k in g of a w e a l t h census a l o n g the o r d in a r y census.. He w r o t e to me in reply as f o l l o w s : With .reference to onr conversation this morning, 1 would like to say that both I and my census staff have had under review the possibilities of taking a thorough-going wealth census. You will remember that the previous one was of a somewhat limited character, owing to the extreme urgency of the situation. Our experience was that, despite the threats of prosecution, the response was very partial, and I can quite understand that you think the occasion of a delivery of schedules to each individual is an opportunity which should not be missed of distributing questions regarding wealth. First of all, it would be necessary that the wealth census should be dealt with quite independently of the population census, ever! if the slips arc distributed at the same time, and we should have to get the population census dealt with immediately and out of the way before going on with the other matter, viz., the wealth census. In order to succeed with the wealth census it would be necessary for the returns to be made through the post, as the expense of retaining the services of collectors while that was answered (in addition to the answering of the population census questions) would be prohibitive. Further, persons-would certainly not give information about their financial position to the ordinary staff collectors, and that puts the question of using the class of collectors we are intending to use out of the question. It is for this reason that the answers would have to be returned through the post, and confidentially to the Statistician, somewhat in the same manner as income and land tax returns are now furnished. The experience in the Taxation Department, which handles returns from a mere fraction of the population, is that it is an expensive busiBILL. ness, and one in which evasion is to a great extent practised. It is probable that persons SJSCOND READING . will not make true returns oven' to the Statistician, because they would be under the impression that comparisons would be made between their statements to the Statistician and those to the Taxation Department, and probably nothing would convince them to the contrary. - So m e Might I add here that a greater number ot people would probably make true returns in a time of national peril than they would make in time of peace,, and that, in consequence, less reliable results could be expected now than at the census of 1915. The data at the last wealth census (war) showed that quite a considerable number of people did not furnish returns, especially, if I remember rightly, in Western Australia, and we should have, therefore, to make the compulsion of returning the paper through the post a very serious one, and ono in which the onus would lie on the person of seeing that the return reached its destination, say, by registration at a post-office. This would, of course, increase the cost. Of course, statistics to insure a real knoww it h ledge of the distribution of wealth could be had by such a wealth census, but will not the income and land tax returns give us, so far as the wealthier classes are concerned, all necessary information? These are now being improved by Mr Ewing, and he is taking into account our requirements in his new statistical compilations. If you wanted only an estimate of the aggregate wealth of Australia, I believe we could meet the requirements by means of the inventory method,- which, you will remember, was sketched out in the report; in fact, the inventory' method is probably, on the whole, as good, if not better, than the other. We have also some check through probates. I might say, also, that we are intending to make an inventory estimate in connection with the population census, the point of time we propose to use being the 30th June, 1920-fiv e years from the date of the previous inventory estimate. General census experience shows that it is undesirable to use two sets of returns, one only of which must bo posted and the other delivered to a collector. I am not sure that you realise the extent to which many persons are capable of failing to do the intelligent thing,, even if the wealth census form were marked, "" To be posted only."" Already we are getting the printing of the forms (copies of which I am sending you) carried out, because some of them have to be despatched within the next few days to their destinations, in order to be in time, and it would be practically impossible in this case to send the wealth forms with them; - hence even in' distribution we could not quite meet the case of simultaneous distribution. For this and other reasons, I am inclined to think that if the Government desires to take a wealth census it ought to be done quite apart from the population census, and, preferably, not within one year, as we will be tremendously occupied on the arrival of the answers to the population census queries. According to Mr Knibbs, it is doubtful and whether we should proceed with a wealth census now; but there is no doubt of need for one.",40
150,Mr BAMFORD,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"""We had one a l it while ago.",41
151,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"It was five years ago, and statistics, to be of any value, must, be capable of comparison.",41
152,Mr BAMFORD,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"What came of that wealth census ? Of what benefit was i Mr TUDOR,-Of very little benefit, if the honourable member means revenue by way of increased taxation. A wealth census, however, allows the whole community to know how the wealth of a country is distributed. I took the trouble the other day, when we were considering the Income Tax Bill , to give some figures I had worked out from the wealth census returns compiled by Mr Knibbs five years ago. Out of a population 5,000,000, according to Mr Knibbs, 2,191,945 persons filled in and returned wealth-census cards, and of that number 1,285,190, or about 60 per cent, those who sent in returns, had practically no assets. We may safely ascent., a very great increase. sume that at least 99.5 per cent, of community under sixteen years of age has practically no assets. Some, .course, may have a few pounds or a few shillings in the Savings Banks; but only the children of wealthy parents are likely to have property, possibly made over them for the purpose of evading the come and other taxation.",41
153,Mr LIVINGSTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Properties be divided for that purpose amongst perinvestigation sons under sixteen years of age.,41
154,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"At any rate, greater part of those with practically assets are probably children; and well known that the poorer section of community show the largest families.",41
155,Mr LIVINGSTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,A person under twenty-one years of age cannot have banking account.,41
156,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,That k not so. There are hundreds and thousands of children and minors with Savings Bank accounts.,41
157,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"My child, at four and a half years, has an account.",41
158,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"And a child of mine has one. However, we have 3,000,000 persons who did not send in returns, and presumably with no assets, 60 per cent, of the 2,191,000 who did send in returns are in practithe cally the same position. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), in his Budget papers, t l e on page 20, shows the percentage of total tax assessed. The percentage remains practically stationary, except in the case of incomes of Â£10,000 and upwards, in /which there is an increase. It is said that the rich are becoming richer, and t ? the poor becoming poorer, and a wealth census would reveal the accuracy or otherwise of that statement. My own belief is that a wealth census would prove the statement to be correct. It is shown that in the case of incomes of Â£200 and under the percentage of total tax assessed in 1915-16 was 3.9, and three years afterwards it had gone up to 4.4; on incomes between Â£ 2 0 1 and Â£ 5 0 0 , the percentage of total tax assessed rose from 4.9 in 1915-16 to 5.0 in the same period; on of incomes from Â£ 5 0 1 to Â£1,000, from 6.6 to 7.1 per cent.; in all these cases the increase has been very small; on incomes from Â£1,000 to Â£10,000, a decrease from of 43.0 to 3 9 . 1 ; and on incomes from Â£10,000 to Â£100,000 .from 18.1 to 25 per It is only the right that we should have another wealth census i u order to see whether the aggreof gate wealth is distributed as in 1915, or whether it is getting into fewer hands. Every one ought to be compelled to send in accurate returns, without any evasion. to Last Friday the Treasurer told us that in - the Government are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds owing to persons evading the just payment of taxation, cannot simply because there are not enough officers. ' I have the greatest confidence in the man at the the head of the Taxation Departno ment, and I know that if it is possible it is to get revenue from those who owe the i the will do so. If there are people who shirk their responsibility by not sending in returns, the fact ought to be made known to those of the community who a have a struggle to keep their heads above water. Of the estimated wealth of Aushuge tralia, of Â£1,216,231,662 in 1915, 40 cent, of the people who 6eut in returns owned Â£1,188,137,031. Then, 906,775 people-that is the difference between 2,191,945 and the 1,285,190, or 17 per cent, of the total population of the monwealth, hold 98 per cent, of the assets, and 83 per cent, of the people not more than 2 per cent. That is why there should be another wealth census. On the other side, that is, the question the income of the community, 18 per cent, of the people got more than 50 per cent, Home and Territories) [ 5 . 3 6 ] cf the income of Australia, and 82 per cent, got less than half the total income. We learn that only 25 per cent, of the adult males i u the community got Â£ 3 per wees and upwards, and about 5 per cent, of the females were paid that amount.'",41
159,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Would those figures apply today?,42
160,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Not so far as the Â£ per week is concerned. Some are obtainabsolutely ing, perhaps, Â£ 4 per week, but this does census. not place them in the same relative position* as in 1915 with Â£ 3 per week. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr portant one. Charlton) has argued that the income tax exemption should be raised so as to place can be considered later. those people in the same relative position as they were then, but I do not think that an exemption of Â£ 1 5 6 would have that effect. It is possible that only per cent. of. the femalesare receiving bers. over Â£156 per annum. As to the ordinary adultmale workers, I think that more than 25 per cent, are, probably, receiving more now, but, even then, they are not in as good a position owing to the decrease in the r>urchasing power of the sovereign. In regard wealth, we ought to have returns much the same as in connection with the toms Department, showing increases or decreases year by year, because statistics are only valuable by contrast. I had i tended moving an amendment providing for a wealth census, but the difficulties pointed out by Mr Knibbs are insuperable. I do not wish to speak disparagingly of the collectors employed-ther are many good men amongst them-but , Sir as a whole, they are not such as we could entrust with returns of the kind. We ought to know what is the trend of wealth, and a census might be taken in every five or ten years. We would be groups. acting unwisely if we allowed a few people in the community to build assets, and permitted a very large per section of our people to struggle along and merely exist. I trust the Government will not lose sight of this; and, if the the Taxation Commission which has beeu appointed can obtain further information Comupon this question, to show by whom the aggregate wealth of the Commonwealth is held, the information will be of service, hot only to Australia, but to the people of in other parts of the world.  - I do not intend to take up much time in replying to the statements which have been made in connection with the provisions of this ' Bill .

The return I e quoted, and which was also quoted by Will i a m Irvine, suggested that numbers from 1 up to 262 should be used in the case of individuals or companies, the showing the amount of income derived the years 1914, 1915, 1916, but not in  up raised by the honourable member was in regard to Information concerning families.

164,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Darlins: Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [5.45] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is only a short measure of a technical character. Under the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Lands Act of 1918 provision is made for the recovery of compensation in connection with land acquired for railway purposes. The Act deals with the method of determining the compensation for the land leased, and - under section 12 it is provided that in the of a dispute between the Commissioner and a claimant as to the amount of compensation payable, the Minister may the matter to a Justice of the High Court, who shall act as arbitrator, and a cerwhose decision shall be final and conproclusive, and without appeal. Section 15 assist in comof the Act providesFor the purposes of this Act, the provisions the law of the State of South Australia relating to arbitration shall apply as Jar as to any - arbitration under this Act. The position is i?hat - a Justice of the High by this Court may be appointed to act as arbiof trator, but when he acts as arbitrator he or is subject to the State law. According to this a State Ac t of 1891, he would be brought under the control of the State Supreme - Court for disciplinary purposes in connection with arbitration matters. It is we considered undesirable - that that should be so, and we are, therefore, amending the law by amending section 15 of the 1918 Act by adding the following provisoProvided that the jurisdiction and powers ot any Court or Judge under that law shall be exercisable exclusively by the High Court or a Justice thereof. This w i l i enable a Justice of the High Court to be controlled only by the H i g Court or a Justice thereof.",43

167,Mr WEST,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,It was not our party was responsible.,44
168,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"No ; the Act was passed in 1918. There is another minor amendment of which I have in given notice, which relates to section 4 of the principal Act. The agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of South Australia and vided for ? Western Australia makes provision for granting to the Commonwealth the land in certain areas on each side of way line, and under the Act plant, buildings, & c , are included in the land vested in. the Commissioner.

This Bill originated in the Senate, and as that Chamber has no constitutional power to appropriate money, the measure has been sent to this Chamber with the that salaries of the members of the Board of Management left blank. This appropriation is necessary to enable me to move when the Bill is in Committee to insert the blanks the amount of salary to be paid to the members of the Board.",44

175,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I ask leave to make a personal explanation. When I was addressing the House yesterday the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) asked by interjection whether the provision in the Bill that if a recommendation of the Commissioner to the head of a Department was not adopted by him, it might be brought under the notice of the Minister, and finally under the notice of Parliament, was recommended in the report of the Economies Commission. I said that I thought that the Economies Commission was favourable to the proposal; but I find that that recommendation is not contained in its report. > In paragraph 33, however, the Commission specifically mentioned the necessity for cases of unnecessary and indiscreet expenditure being brought under the notice of Parliament and the country.",44
176,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Y a r r a ) [5.56]:-Some of us have had a fair amount of experience of the working of the Public Service Act under one Commissioner, and I think we are entitled to ask ourselves where the policy which the Government are adopting will finish. Already this House has dealt with one Public Service Bill relating to the appointment of an Arbitrator. I think the late Postmaster General (Mr Webster) stated that the Arbitration Court had relieved the Public Service Commissioner of a big percentage of his work; but we learn from Mr . MCLachlan that, so far from that being the case, the Court has actually increased the work of the Commissioner. In future the Public Service will appeal to the specially appointed Arbitrator instead of to the Arbitration Court. The measure now before the House provides for the appointment of a Board of Management in the place of the Public Service Com' missioner, and we are promised a further Bill to establish a superannuation scheme for the Service. I hope that scheme will be extended to cover any individual in the community who desires to take advantage of its benefits. There is also to be an amending Bill dealing with the whole Service. I will not say that any one of these measures is unnecessary, but I think we would get on just as well with the Public Service Commissioner as we shall do with the proposed Board of Management. Mr MCLachlan stated, on page 26 of his reportConsideration has been given to the question whether, in view of the ramifications of the Commonwealth Public Service, and the magnitude of the interests to be conserved, any advantage would accrue from the establishment of a Public Service Board of three members in place of the present system of control by one Commissioner. The New South Wales State Service Act is administered by a Board of three members. In Queensland, Public Service matters arc dealt with by a Committee of the Cabinet, while in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia the Public Service is managed by one Commissioner. In new legislation now before the Tasmanian Parliament, provision is made for appointment of a Commissioner, and an Assistant Commissioner. The New Zealand Public Service is controlled by a Commissioner and two Assistant Commissioners. In Great Britain the Civil Service Commission comprises two members, but the functions of this Commission relate mainly to the holding of examinations, and arc not administrative. The Victorian Royal Commission on the State Public Service, reporting in 1917, discussed the general management of that Service, and after full consideration of the arguments for and against the constitution of a Public Service Board, stated that, although a good deal might be said in favour of the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, they (the Royal Commission) were not prepared to recommend any change in that regard. It may be mentioned that for many years the Victorian Public Service was controlled by a Public Service Board of three members, and that this arrangement was eventually superseded by the present system of control by one Commissioner. In my opinion, there are strong reasons against alteration of the present system of management of the Commonwealth Public Service. Control by a Board of three members necessarily involves a more cumbrous procedure than by a single Commissioner, and consequent delays in settlement of questions of administration. In addition, the important factor of direct and personal responsibility would be sacrificed by the appointment of a Board. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the Commonwealth Service differ very materially from those of a State Public Service, seeing that the former Service is spread over nil the States forming the Commonwealth, necessitating the location of a Public Service Inspector in each State, exercising delegated, powers of the Commissioner. In providing for the future administration of the Public Service Act, it would be disadvantageous to establish a Public Service Board, with the consequent inelasticity of control and the diminution of personal responsibility. The existing system of management by one Commissioner will undoubtedly better meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Public Service, provided that the necessary assistance is given him to carry out the duties and extended functions to be conferred upon him. The Minister for Works and Railways, in moving the second reading of this Bill yesterday, quoted from the report of the Economies Commission. There is no man in Australia-indeed , there are no half dozen men-wit h as full a knowledge of the Commonwealth Public Service as is possessed by the ex^Commigsioner, Mr . MCLachlan. He was specially chosen by the present Government for an exhaustive report on the Publio Service. Those of his recommendations which were favourable to' the Government poliÂ«y were quoted by the Minister, but not one woril was - quoted of those portions - of the .reporlt in which Mr MCLachlan - emphatically opposed the proposal to place 'the control of the Service in the hands of a Board of Management.",45
177,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Mr MCLachlan was dealing with another problem.,46
178,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,-He dealt with the Board of Management.,46
179,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,But not from the point of view presented by the Economies 'Commission.,46
180,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I have"" differed from Mr MCLachlan in regard to many things - he has done, but he is a man for whom I haye the greatest admiration and respect; and when he unhesitatingly condemns the proposal to create a Board of Commissioners, Parliament should pause before adopting it. Honourable anembers who are acquainted with 'Sta'te politics know that control of the railways by Boards - of Commissioners has not been 'altogether satisfactory. As a - matter of fact, the Victorian railways were most successfully operated when one Commis.'siomer *of outstanding character dominated .the - other two, thus practically giving control by a single 'Commissioner. T. - refer particularly to the period when Mr. John Matheson, and, later, Mr Thomas T'aitj controlled the Victorian railway service. 'On page 91, in the course of his summary - of - findings and recommendations, Mr MCLachlan sai'dPublic 'Service Administration Establishment of a Public Service Board of tjlvree members would - be unwise, owing to inelasticity of control and diminution of per.sonml responsibility - The 'existing system of - management by - one 'Commissioner would 'better - meet the requirements of the Commonwealth, (provided adequate assistance is afforded him (,p. That is an opinion expressed not many, months ago by a man in whom most 'honourable members have the utmost confidence. He coritinued-*Since 1902 the work of the Commissioner and inspectors has been most onerous and - exacting; - with the development of - the Service, and the increased duties following on arbitration, Â£heir duties have only been carried out with considerable self-sacrifice and devotion of private time.

The 'control - of the C!onrmonwealtih Public l ! Service is now to be 'taken from a single 'Commissioner, 'and is to fee vested in three members 'of a Board which is to be appointed under this Bill. That wil'l have the effect of shelving Ministerial responsibility. Mr 'GREGORY - Unde r this measure, where shall we place responsibility 'for any extravagance in the Public Service?",46
181,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Wit h all due respect to the Economies Commission, there is not a single member of it who is as capable of managing the Public Service as ' is Mr MCLachlan.",46
182,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I am' not suggesting that there is. But, if we - appoint a Board of Management under this Bill, and extravagance is afterwards disclosed in our Public Service, how shall we be able to remedy it?",46
183,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I come now to - paragraph 16 of Mr MCLachlan's findings and recommendations, which readsThe ivhole of the 'Oommonwealtn services s'hould be brought under one authority (-the Commissioner), and, while arbitral and appellant functions should be vested in him, much of the present detailed work of Commissioner and inspectors should be transferred to heads of Departments. Later on, he says The administration .of the Public Service should be intrusted to a Commissioner, -'and provision should be made 'for appointment of an Assistant Commissioner and Seven Public' Service Inspectors, 'the staff being thus in creased by - an Assistant Commissioner and - one additional inspector.

These are Mr MCLachlan's suggestions in - connection with Public Service - administration. There is another phase of this question upon which I should like to say a word or .two. A. great many honourable members - have been loud in itheir praises of the report of the Whitley 'Commission. Now, the Public Service Association has forwarded to every memher of this Chamber a circular letter, from which I extract the following:The Public Services throughout the world have realized of late the necessity_for appointing Boards of Management to control the various Public Services, and on each occasion arrangements have been made for the officers to have representation on the Board. The great Public Service of the United Kingdom, upon which the Public Service of this country is supposed to be modelled, some little time ago appointed a Board on the basis of the Whitley Commission report to control the Public Service. The Board appointed consists of equal representation from the officers of the Service and. equalrepresentation by the Government. Reports to hand from this body show that the results of their labours have proved entirely satisfactory to the Government of Great Britain , and arrangements are now being made in England to extend this principle by having Boards to control the activities oE various Departments. It is proposed to grant .representation to officers on these Boards. ' Our request is that we should have but one representative on the Board of three, whereas in Great Britain they have equal representa- . tion witli an independent chairman nominated by the Government. Surely if such a scheme has proved satisfactory in a large Public Service such as there is in Great Britain it is reasonable to assume that it should be equally satisfactory in such as we have in the Commonwealth. The action of the New Zealand Government is also worthy of note in connection with this matter. In connection with the last vacancy which occurred on the Public Service Board of 'Now Zealand, the Public Service Associations made representations to the Prime Minister of New Zealand with a view to being permitted to nominate a representative to fill the vacant Commissionership. The Prime Minister of New Zealand agreed, and on their Board of Management of three they now have a representative of the officers of the Service. It is also interesting to note that the Western Australian Government has' offered to the State public servants now on strike as one of the terms upon which the strike should be settled the appointment of a Board to control the Service, upon which the officers shall have equal representation. This decision was rived at, it is understood, as a result' of a special meeting of Cabinet. It is unnecessary to quote further instances of a similar nature, it being sufficient to say that even an institution like the English Admiralty, which is, I think, generally admitted to be a - very conservative body, recently appointed a Board to control questions of general administration as apart from policy and also to deal with wages, conditions of employment, &c, for the staff other than the sea-going forces. On this Board of Control of the Department mentioned, the officers have direct re' presentation of equal numerical strength to that of the Department, and in an official pamphlet recently to hand from the English Admiralty, the scheme has heen very favourably reported upon by the Lords of the Admiralty. Under the circumstances, and seeing that the Whitley Commission Report has been almost universally adopted and generally commended throughout the world, the Commonwealth would have an excellent opportunity of not only giving effect to this scheme, but, by so doing, they will set an example to the industrial world. The Prime Minister has frequently referred to the necessity for the employer and the employee getting together for the purpose of dealing with matters affecting industry. If the Prime Minister is sincere in his statements in this direction here is f in opportunity presented to him to put it into practical operation. In connection with the formation of the Whitley Commission, the Minister of Labour, England, wrote to the leading trade unions and employers' associationsI t should be made clear that representation on the industrial councils is intended to be on the basis of existing organizations among employers and workmenconcerned in each industry, although it will, of course, be open to the councils, when formed, to grant representation to any new bodies which may come into existence and which may be entitled to representation. The authority, and consequently the usefulness of the councils, will depend entirely on the extent to which they represent the different interests and enjoy the whole-hearted support of the existing organizations, and it is therefore, desirable that representation should be determined on as broad a basis as possible. The Commission statesWe are convinced, moreover, that a permanent improvement in the relations between employers and employed must be founded upon something other than a cash basis. What is wanted is that the workpeople should have a greater opportunity of participating in the discussion about an adjustment of those parts of industry by which they are most affected. We venture to hope that representative men in each industry, with pride in their calling and care for its place as a contributor to the national well-being, will come together in the manner here suggested, and apply themselves to promoting industrial harmony and efficiency ar- and removing the obstacles that have hitherto, stood in the way. The Government in t e n d to a p p o in t a B o a r d of t h r e e persons to ""manage the P u b l i c Service of the Commonwealth . I am not in f a v o u r of the a p p o in t m e n to f three members to any such B o a r d . But c e r t a in l y the P u b l i c Service should hav e direct representation upon any b o d y w h i c h m a y be thus c o n s t it u t e d. One of the members of the B o a r d should be a p u b l i c servant. That, is a l e g it i m at e request to p r e f e r . When the R e p at r i at i o n Bil l was under consideration in this Parliament., we provided for the representation of returned soldiers upon the Commission which was to be appointed under the. authority of that measure. should not the same principle be observed in relation to our Public Service? three members are to be appointed to the Board of Management for our Public Service, one of them should most certainly be elected by the public servants themselves. The adoption of such a course would tend to the smoother working of the Departments. There is in the Bill only one provision to which I desire specially to call attention- I refer to proposed new section 11, which reads(1) In addition to sucli duties as are elsewhere in this Aet imposed on it, the Board shall have the following duties: (a) To devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of Departments.",46
184,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"To bring about the millennium. Mr TUDOR,-The Bill might as well have provided for that. If the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) had read this clause it would have occasioned him great amusement. Perhaps I may be pardoned for bringing it under his notice. It reads11. (1) In addition to such duties as are elsewhere in this Act imposed on it, the Board shall have the following duties:(a) To devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of Departments .by(i) improved organization and proce(ii) closer supervision; (iii) the simplification of the work of (iv) the co-ordination of the work of the (v) the limitation of the staffs of the (vi) the improvement of the training of (vii) the avoidance of unnecessary ex(viii) the advising upon systems and 'Board by a Minister; and (ix) the establishment of systems of ther the return for expenditure is 'i adequate.",48
185,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,It reads like a political manifesto.,48
186,Mr TUDOR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Yes . If the heads of Wihy Departments do not now perform the duties which I have just enumerated, If their services should be dispensed with . The proposed new section is based upon the assumption that they are absolutely incompetent. I would not like to make that charge against the heads of Departments with whom I have come into contact, nor would the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman). The 'Bill sets out what the Ministry hope to achieve by the creation of the proposed Board of Management. Personally, I believe that we are making a mistake in taking the control of the Public Service out of the hands of one man and placing it in the hands of three men. The Government have affirmed over and over again that closer relations should be established between employers and employees. They now have an f opportunity to give effect to the recommendation of the ""Whitley Commission in regard to their own servants. I regret that this Bill has been brought forward. I believe that instead of making for economy it will make for extravagance. It is proposed that three men shall be appointed as a Board of Management to do work which fro m practically the inception of the Commonwealth has been efficiently carried.out by one man. Believing that this is a mistake, I shall join with honourable members to defeat the Bill , or, fail ing that, to improve it . dure; Mr Charlton (Hunter) [ 6 . 2 1 ] - I join my leader (Mr Tudor) in opposing this Bill . I do not know that each Department, and the abolition there is any warrant for the creation of of unnecessary work: . the proposed Board of Management. It various Departments; seems to me that the Government are going in for the appointment of so many various Departments to actual re- Boards that in this way our expenditure quirements, and the utilization of must be very considerably increased. In those staffs to the best advantage; view of the happenings in almost e v e r j officers: part of the British Empire, I am disappointed that the Government, having dependiture: cided that a Board of Management shall methods adopted in regard to con- be appointed, have not provided for the tracts and for obtaining supplies, representation of the employees on that and upon contracts referred to the Board. I venture to say that no Board on which the employees are not reprcseiited will be satisfactory. It has been check, in order to ascertain whefound necessary in almost every case whore a Board has been appointed to provide for the representation of the employees. 'This Board of Management will be called upon to devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of Departments, and is to bring about co-ordination of work. Who could be better able to deal with those matters than a member of the Public Service selected by his fellow employees for appointment to the Board? A representative of the employees would be. able to look after the interests of servants, and also to assist his fellow Commissioners in promoting the efficiency of our public Departments. If economy is to be secured in those Departments, it is necessary that consideration should be given to the views of those engaged in them. We have, for instance, in the Postal Department officers who have been employed there for very many years - officer s who have been thoroughly trained, and have a complete grip of the whole of its operations. Such men know better than any oue else where savings could be made. But, unfortunately, in the Public Service, as in most other walks of life, no inducements are held out to employees to suggest improvements. believe that savings could be made in many directions if employees were encouraged to make suggestions. In connection with most of our Departments, however, it seems to me that when a man sees an opening to effect savings he is afraid to make a suggestion lest by doing so he might give offence to his superior officer, and suffer accordingly. A public servant who was selected by the votes of his fellow employees to represent them on the Board of Management would be one of the most capable men who could be appointed for the purpose.",48
187,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Onl y the smartest man would be elected.,49
188,Mr CHARLTOK,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Yes ; the man possessing the greatest ability and best adapted for such a position would alone secure the appointment. The Public Service might be left to recommend to the Minister what system should be adopted by them to secure representation on the Board. Their representative might be selected by ballot, pr otherwise. I am convinced that if the matter were left in the hands of the employees, a most satisfactory appointment would be made. In that way a more desirable appointee would be secured from the Public Service than if the selection were left to the Minister. Under the Bill as it stands, the Minister will select the three members of the Board of Management. In making his choice, he will be guided largely by the recommendations of two'or three responsible officers. They will recommend those whom they deem to be best qualified for the position, but, after all, the selection so made will represent public the decision of only two or three men, whereas a member of the Board who - was elected by the employees would be the choice of the whole' Service. It is our duty to endeavour to bring about mutual confidence between employers and employees, and we can best insure the smooth working of this Board of Management by determining that one member of it shall be selected by the Public Service as a man in whom they have confidence- a man who they know will have regard to their interests and those of the whole of the Departments. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to what has been done as the reI sult of the, Whitley Commission. The scheme adopted on the recommendation of that Commission has proved a success in the Old Land. In connection with all our industrial Boards, we provide for the appointment of representatives of the employees, and the day has arrived when we should unmistakably show that we have regard to the rights of employees. By providing for the appointment of a representative of the Public Service on this Board of Management we would show that we recognised that the Public Service of the Commonwealth is in the nature of a co-operative concern. Officers of the various Departments would know that any recommendation made by them to the Board would be of some avail. To-day they have no incentive to make suggestions for the better working of Departments. They carry out the instructions issued to them from day to day, and' tliere their duty ends. They may know that those instructions could be much improved upon, but it is not their duty to say so, and, as a rule, they are . afraid to make suggestions. They have come to the conclusion that, it is their duty merely to do the work allotted to them. That state of affairs should be changed. We are constantly talking about the need for efficiency in our public Departments, and it is certainly necessary that we should aim at efficiency. I do not desire to deprecate the good work of the officials. I recognise that splendid work has been done, and that the men are prepared to do even better work if they are allowed a voice in the management. I hope, therefore, the Minister will recognise the necessity of allowing our public servants to appoint a representative to the Board of Management. The duties of this Board will be numerous and important. It is, as I have said, to devise means of effecting economy and. promoting efficiency in various ways,",49
189,Mr WEST,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,What has the ex-Commissioner been doing all these years?,50
190,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,He admits the necessity of having some one associated with the Public Service Commissioner.,50
191,Mr CHARLTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Did he recommend the appointment of a Board of Management ?,50
192,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,He recommended the appointment of a Commissioner and an Assistant Commissioner.,50
193,Mr CHARLTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I am inclined to think that a Commissioner with an assistant who was familiar with the whole of the ramifications of our public Departments might meet the case; but, if a Board of Management is to be appointed, the employees should .be represented on it. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.",50
194,Mr CHARLTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The Board will be charged with the responsibility of devisthe ing means of effecting economies and prothe moting efficiency in the management the various Departments. This is a very important function. Personally, against the appointment of a Board of Management. I do not think that course necessary; and, moreover, a6 the Chairman will receive Â£2,000 a year, and the ment ? other members of the Board Â£1,500 each, the expenditure, as compared with the salary of the Public Service Commissioner, will be very considerably increased, at a time, too, when we should be endeavourrepresentative ? ing to effect economies throughout the Service. I am not too certain that the Board, if appointed, will do all that is excognised pected of it in the interests of the vice-, because its three members will be appointed by the Government. In supshortly port of this it has, of course, been urged that the Board will stand towards members of the - Public Service in the same relation as an employer to his employees. This contention > was made in another place; but, so far as my knowledge goes, employers in all parts of the Britishspeaking world have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of all concerned to appoint one of their own employees on tbese Boards of Management, as then the ideas in employees are at once reflected in the conduct of an undertaking. There is much to recommend this course. A man who has grown up in the Service understands all its details of working, and is in a better position to advise as to the best line of action to be taken, whereas a man wbo has not had this experience will probably overlook many important points. If a member of the Public Service is appointed to this Board of Management, he - will be in touch with the employees generally, and beable to make important recommendations in the best interests of the Service. It does not at all follow that a representative of the Public Service on the Board would, in effect, be an employee of the public servants, and be expected always to do their sweet will . But even if tliere is something in this contention, the Government would have their two members on the Board, and no harm could be done, because tlieir nominees would always be able to outvote the representative of the public servants. From this point of view, therefore, no serious objection can be urged to appointment of a representative of employees in the Service on the Board. of On the contrary, I think that nothing - but good will be the outcome. I underI am stand that the Public Service in New Zealand has the right of appointing one of its members to a similar Board.",50

202,Sir ROBERT BEST,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"5Ioqyong) i[8.9J| - My honourable friend the lable 'member for Bunter (Mr Charlton) has anticipated remarks which I had in tended to mate as to the piece-meal character - of OUT legislation. When we are called upon, as in 'this Bill, to deal with the Public Service,, we s'hould deal with the Service as a whole. I strongly measure being brought before the House. I cannot see my way clear to support the present Bill, 'because no reasons whatever, that appeal to me as valid, have been urged in support of the appointment of a Board of Management, though it is quite' true, as the Minister has said, that this Bill comes to us upon the recommendation of members of the Economies Commission.",51
203,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,And what about,51
204,Sir ROBERT BEST,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"As against the recommendation 'of the Economies 'Commission there is a recommendation of Mr. for MCLachlan, a man whose - opinion I value very highly, for his is the view of a man with a very great deal of and experience - on this subject. I do not this think there is any honourable gentleman this .Hoiiisc who has had anything to do witli Mr MCLachlan and has not been impressed by his ability .and experience, his extraordinary faim'ess, .amd lanxiety to 'do 'the right thing. By reason 'of his special qualifications, he was appointed to inquire Mto - this very subject, and make a Tecom.inend'ation *o tihis House-as to ""the managewe ment of *he Puhlic Service. And he has the .miost definite 'language declared that it is undesirabi'e to have a Board of Management. On the contrary, he Tirges control by a Commissioner as the wiser system. To the best of my recollection, is we had a Board of Management of three for the Public 'Service in Victoria, with the result that its members fell into the ordinary groove and practically became the Mina branch and Department of the the sugPublic Service.; no innovations and Bill no ideas - of economy were forthwill be coming, with the result that the B'oard 'system was abandoned in favour of in that which now obtains, namely, control by a single'Commissioner. The experience of Australia justifies the belief that by a Commissioner is better. This view is confirmed by Mr MCLachlan, with much experience at - his back. He bonorhas no personal interest, but the public welfare, to serve, and, therefore, we should be prepared to listen to his advice in this matter. Indeed, I venture to say that we dare not disregard his advice. More than that, he has definitely stated his views as to the character of men to be employed, and the salaries to be paid; and these salaries are below those suggested by this Bill. My view is that a Board of Management will get into a groove. Better results may be expected from the 23resent system, with the appointment from time to time of three expert 'business men. to investigate the general management of the Service, and point to any defects. By this process, we may expect to get new ideas and the benefit of an impartial judgment from men appointed fora specific purpose, namely, to make investigations into the general management and the possibility of greater economies in the Public Service. I therefore urge that Mr MCLachlan's advice be accepted. I am greatly concerned over the additional expense which will be involved by the creation of this Board. That expense will not by any means be confined to the appointment of a Chairman at Â£2,000 per annum, and of two other Commissioners at Â£1,500 each. There is involved the creation of a department of administration which will entail greater cost than is justified. We should not have piecemeal legislation. The recommendation of Mr MCLachlan cannot be disregarded. It has not been shown that advantages will emanate from the creation of the Board. Economy and efficiency can be brought about by the appointment, from time to time, when thought necessary, of temporary Boards of investigation to be composed of business experts. There is no need for this costly permanent organization. In the circumstances, I cannot support the Bill.",51
205,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"South. Sydney) [8.17] We have established a Commonwealth Bank, with branches from one end of the country to the other, arid outside of Australia as well. The Governor has been able to carry on a very successful business by the employment of very large staffs. No one can say that, under the sole control of Sir Denison Miller, the Commonwealth Bank has proved anything but a success. I would like to know why it is proposed to disregard the recommendation of Mr MCLachlan, and to appoint a Board of three. Is it because the Public Service Commissioner has had too great an amount of work to do? If so, we have relieved him. We have provided for the appointment of Boards consisting of employees and heads of Departments to sit around a table, and fix working conditions and rates of pay for every Department. Notwithstanding that, we aro asked to appoint an Arbitrator to administer the Service, whose salary will amount ' to Â£2,000 per annum, and on top of that, this Economy Government propose still another Board, which will cost, in the matter of salaries alone, Â£5,000 per annum.",52
206,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Will there be any end to these appointments of Boards ?,52
207,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"No doubt, the Government will come in next session with a proposition to appoint another Board to investigate the administration of this one. There will be a new Department created which, as the. years roll on, will develop and become in itself a huge branch of the Service. If all the Departments are to be run by Commissioners, what is the use of the Ministry? Surely the Ministers and the heads of Departments have some responsibility for their Departments? What have Ministers and heads of Departments been doing that it should now be deemed necessary to appoint this Board? The position is tantamount to a vote of censure upon them. Taking the members of the Public Service as a whole, they are the worse paid individuals in. the community. Unless we are prepared to pay good wages we cannot hope for efficiency. When a man employed in the Service perceives that outside employers are paying higher wages, he loses his incentive to do his best, and, eventually, if the public servant can secure an outside job, we lose him. To illustrate that point, I may mention the case of the secretary of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. That gentleman has been in the Service for some years, and is now about to leave, because he can do better for himself outside. Here he has no "" pull,"" no influence, and he has had to remain where he was put without being able to advance himself. I trust that honourable members will realise that their agreement with the principle contained in this Bill will involve them in the creation of another costly Department to duplicate the work of. the Commissioner and the heads of Departments and M i isters. We have increased the number Ministers during the past few years, chiefly because their work has greatly grown. Surely they, together with the heads of Departments, should be capable of insuring economy and efficiency in Service. There is no need for this B i Can we look for any real economy as result of its being placed on the statuteand book? The question whether good w i l follow its passage must depend to a large extent upon the personalities of the Comstarting missioners. Very likely, some of the sent chiefs of Departments will be appointed to the Board. But, if they cannot bring about economy and efficiency in their present offices, how can we exDo pect them to do so if we merely call them Commissioners and pay them higher salaries? I shall support the proposal the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), who desires that employees the.Service shall be given representation on the Board. I trust that this measure will not be treated as a party matter, but that it wil l be rejected on its of merits. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) [8.25] - Havin g listened the speeches delivered on this measure, honourable members may well ask themAnd selves, "" Where is the Public Service d r if t in g ? "" There arc in the Service the Commonwealth approximately 34,000 one, permanent and temporary employees. that number insufficient? No one will say that it is. Yet, one hears grumbling matter, I believe in paying well. on every hand. In the greab Telephone and Postal branches, for example, there is considerable dissatisfaction. An uess man in Melbourne or Sydney, or in many country centres, will confirm today ? that, and will say that the services were never worse. As for conditions with in the Department, one has only to ask employees whether they consider their positions satisfactory. The best and brightest men are leaving us carry because conditions are no longer attracof tive, and because they are not as well paid as men in similar jobs outside. are d r if t in g from bad to worse. - old days the Public Service was regarded .as the "" b l u e ribbon."" Men fought get into the Service; now they are fightsituation shall be adjusted? ing to get out, and soon there will be ihe mediocrities left. Many servants are n - not getting decent wages, while very of many are being overworked. At the same time others have practically nothing to do, which indicates only one of the many factors requiring adjustment. The whole of the Service should be placed on a righ t the footing. But does this measure reprel l . sent a serious effort to that end ? We a are given to understand that another, an important, Bill is to follow. But l why this procedure? Is it not a case of putting the cart before the horse? In a private business, would a man preselect his overseers before getting his business going upon a proper basis? Why should there be this feverish haste to push the Bill through and to follow it up with another which should really precede it? we not hear it said in the streets,-and reported in the press, that Australia is being governed by Commissions? And is of this system of government by Commis. sions satisfactory? Let us examine the in stupid position which has arisen in the Service. We virtually pushed out Mr . MCLachlan, who was one of the most efficient of our oflicials; and then we lack brought him back again and paid him a big fee to show us what a rotten state the Service is in . Obviously, he was the (Edenbest man the Government could get to to give them that advice; but he was not good enough to keep in the Service. now, apparently, his advice 13 not good enough to be accepted, for the Goof vernment say that, instead of appointing they will select three Commissioners, Is and that they will pay them more than Mr MCLachlan proposed. For that One good man on this job would be worth the Â£5,000 alone if he could put the Service y busion a proper footing. How many public servants have we in the Commonwealth - Mr J^arEs PAGE - On e man in evefy ten you meet is a public servant.",52
208,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Can we tliem all?. Is it fair that numbers those officials, who are earnest and conscientious, should be debarred from We getting a living wage simply because In the there are too many of them in some particular branch or other? Why have we to not the courage to say that the whole This is no only time to put men aud women out into the street; indeed, there is never a time to do that. But mauy would go out tomorrow 'except that they 'are deterred because - fliey 'aTe the* 'supporters of families, and - a-re 'afraid 'to enter the 'labour market. ""Would it not be f a ir to say that, at any rate, there shall be no further appointments to the Service? A good man, well paid, could closely examine the whole business and close the doors of the Service, and see that it was efficiently carried on without requiring any fresh appointments for five years. Such a course of . action would .bring about a proper state of .affairs. I am disposed to vote against this proposal because I think it is unnecessary. We have'had too many Boards appointed, and the results of their appointment have not been satisfactory. There should be more Ministerial responsibility. We should be able to hold Ministers responsible for the work of their Departments, and if a Minister cannot put his Department in order, we should get one who will do so. We are d r if t in g into a state of chaos in the Public Service of this country. We are told that .there is one public servant for every ten taxpayers, but if we take into consideration the fact that there are many persons outside the Public Service performing services for the Government, for which .they are paid, we shall find that the proportion of public servants to taxpayers is more nearly one to five. No .sensible man will say that we can stand this kind of thing much longer. The sooner we take a p u l l the better. I am glad tshat this 'measure 'is not being treated as a party matter, because we all aim at - the one goal, which is to do the 'best thing possible for Australia. We have the best country on God's earth, and *we are doing - our best to "" c r u e l "" it , until people are .beginning to say that Australia is a good place to get out of. We grumble ;at the high cost of living, but is not the piling up of expenditure 'on an inefficient Public Service one of the most f r u it f u l sources of the high cost of living.",53
209,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,And taxation.,54
210,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Taxatio n has been necessary to meet the obligations due to the war, and we .can bear our burden in this regard if we run the country and Public Service on common sense business lines. Our public servants should be able to feel that there is a reward for the man who tries to do good work. We know that good work and good suggestions are not rewarded, and promotion does not :go :by merit, .but iby - seniority",54
211,Mr WATKINS,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,O r by favour.,54
212,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Favor itism - and influence cannot be entirely done away with . They will always count for something, because we are dealing with human beings. I have felt that good men in the Department which I controlled .should be rewarded, but there was no opportunity to reward them. The heads of public Departments controlling expenditure running into many thousands of pounds do not receive as much as men handling comparatively .small businesses in - the different capitals of Australia. The same may be said of men in the lower grades of the Public Service. Honourable members will agree with me that the man is foolish who tries to get his son or daughter into the Post and Telegraph Department at the present time. People come to me, and ask me to recommend their sons or their daughters for positions in that Department, and I te'l'l them that it would be far better for them if they would pub them to hard work outside, as it would give them a better chance for the future. That is not as it ought to be. I am surprised that this Bill should be the forerunner of the principal measure dealing with the Public 'Service. I never beard of .such a thing. It is a case of putting the cart before the horse. I hope 'that the 'Government will reconsider the n.s,tter, - and will bring down the principal Public .Service Bill at once. 'They have obtained 'a report on the Service from a - man whom they discarded 'under the Public 'Service Act . Sir - JOSEPH 'COOK - We did - not discard bim at all. The honourable member - should not put it in that way.",54
213,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"He had 'to go out of the Service on account of his age. I am not blaming Ministers in the matter, but it was certainly their duty to have proposed-an amendment of the stupid Act under which Mr MCLachlan's retirement from the Service 'became necessary. I know that when Sir Robert Scott was Secretary to the Post aud Telegraph Department, I had to fight Mr MoLachlan - for two years to prevent"" Sir 'Robert 'Scdtt being retired from the Service, because he was sixty-five vears of a?e. He was receivins: a salary of Â£1,000 per year, and was entitled, on retirement, to a pension cf Â£ 7 0 0 , and I contended that i u the circumstances it was a foolish policy for this country to discard a man like that with his great experience and mental ancl physical vigour and' costing only Â£300 per annum.",54
214,Mr JACKSON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"What about men have to go out at sixty-five, without a pension ?",55
215,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"There are some men who ought to go out at fifty-five. I have no doubt that the Government have the same object in view in this matter as I have myself, but they have not, in my opinion, proposed the best means to achieve it , and unless some definite argument is submitted in support of the Bill , I shall feel compelled to vote against it . I have said that this is not a party matter, and there has been no warmth shown in discussing it . I believe that the proposal is badly conceived. I do not object to high salaries for qualified men. It is proposed to give these three Commissioners Â£2,500 between them.",55
216,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"No , Â£ 5 , 0 0 0.",55
217,Mr AUSTIN CBCAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"It would be better, in my opinion, to get the best man for the job and give him Â£5,000, and then look to him to put the Public Service in order. What is the position of a Minister of the Crown under the Public Service Act? Even the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), with all his power",55
218,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,I have no power.,55
219,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The righ t honourable gentleman has no power, but he arrogates it to himself, and that is not as it should be. I do not say that unkindly, and the right honourable gentleman, I am aware, does many things wisely .and well ; but is it not an absurdity that the Treasurer should not have the power to put on a messenger without the permission of the Public Service Commissioner ?",55
220,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,He cannot dismiss one.,55
221,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"That is so. A man in any of the public Departments may be guilty of almost any misdemeanour, and yet under the Publio Service Act it takes months to get r i d of him. That kind of thing shows the necessity for a proper measure dealing with the Public Service. There should be positions in the Service - which might be regarded as blue ribbons to which intelligent men might aspire. At one time, a youngster was supposed to have gained a prize if he got into the Public Service, but now people of common sense consider that a parent is foolish who puts one of his children into the Service. I did not have the advantage of listenwho ing to the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) when moving the second reading of this Bill , but I read the analysis of his speech which appeared in the newspapers this morning. There are many persons doing good! work in the Public Service who are underpaid, and there are many others who are overpaid for doing very little. Public servants in the country districts are, in many cases, overworked and underpaid.",55
222,Mr CHARLTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Nearl y all the post- masters are in that position.,55
223,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Men serving in other Departments are also overworked and underpaid. In many of the b i ^ cities there .are hives of public servants, and people wonder what they can be doing. The system is bad, and that is the difficulty. We have heard of men working in adjoining rooms who send documents to each other registered. We are d r if t in g into a very undesirable position, and for this I do not altogether blame the Government. We have been driftin g in this way for the last twenty years,' and with so much experience of the Commonwealth Public Service the Government should be able to devise some better proposal than this. It would be a better plan to postpone the consideration of this Bill u n t i l we have passed the principal measure dealing with the Public Service, as we should then know what we require. The present Act requires to be amended almost out of sight. We should ask the assistance of the public servants themselves. They Bhould have some say in the matter. The time has gone past when men are content to be "" bossed "" and driven like so many sheep or bullocks, and the time has come when they should be given some say in connection with the business in which they are employed. An y sensible man will admit that to give men a say in the management of the"" business in which they are employed will prevent friction and industrial strife. The public servants are human, and when they see men outside the Public Service doing better than, themselves they naturally protest. It seems to me we are reaching the stage, when the only way in which employees can protest successf ully is to cause trouble to the publio. I should like the Government to adopt an altogether different view of this matter.",55
224,Mr JAMES PAGE,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Maranoa) [8.41]. - I listened yesterday evening very attentively to the explanation of this Bill by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) in moving the second reading. I have known the honourable gentleman since he came into this House, and I never heard him when he appeared to be more leg-roped or hobbled. His heart was not in the business. one knows better the growth of the Public Service since he became a member of this Parliament. I have always been against Boards or Commissions controlling Government Departments. In Queensland, many years ago, we had a Board of Comrnissioners of Railways. They managed the railways for a time, but when they went out, Oh, Lord, what a mess they left behind them ! It took several millions of money to put the railways, into a working condition after they had gone. They made strict economy the order of the day. built no rolling-stock during their term of office, and they ran things in such an economical way that when their time was up the railways were run to a stand-still.",56
225,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,As the Post Office Department is now.,56
226,Mr JAMESPAGE,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"It is very nearly, in the same position. The Minister has not told us why this Public Service Board of Management is needed. Honourable members who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament w i ll remember the difficulties with which we were faced i u establishing a Public Service, with men from six different States, i u each of which a different Public Service Act was in operation. There were differences in the matter of emoluments, retiring allowances, and pensions.",56
227,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"And , worse of all, there were accruing rights.",56
228,Mr JAMES PAGE,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"That is so, and our worse experiences in that, connection came from. South Australia. The Government, at the time were fortunate in selecting a man from New South Wales, who did the pick-and-shovel work of amalgamating the whole of the Public Service, and the superstructure of today stands on Mr . Duncan MCLachlan's foundation. that time some members desired that there should be a Commission of three charged with the management of the Public Service, and the matter was fought out more vigorously than honourable members are fighting this measure. It was eventually decided that there should be but one Public Service Commissioner. The Government of the day did wisely and well in appointing him. I do not blame the present Government or any one else for Mr MCLachlan's retirement. He was a stickler for the observance of No the law. If the law said that a man was to retire at fifty-five, Mr MCLachlan said he had to retire at that age, because the law said so, and when his turn came, and he reached the age of sixty-five years, he put himself out. I say that the Government, later, showed wisdom in appointing hi m as a Royal Commissioner to inquire into the whole of the working of the Public Service. Hisrecommendations, are a monument to the thoroughness with which he performed his task. He does not recommend a Commission of three members. They He recommends the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, and I am sure no honourable member would object to carrying out his recommendation in that respect; but the Government, in order to save their faces in regard to their proposal to appoint a . Board of Management, have provided a schedule of duties for them to undertake. For one thing, they are to effect economies and promote efficiency in management. But I want to know what work the administrative officers of the different Departments will be required to perform if all these duties are to be carried out by the Board? Have they not been lacking in some respects if they have not carried out what the Board is to be asked to do? Have not the administrative staffs endeavoured to effect economies and promote efficiency in management? If not, then some man is required, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) has suggested, to weed them out and replace them by competent officials. One Ttian could do it more effectively thanthree. I remember .when Sir WilliamLyne was introducing the Estimates which made the first provision for theHomeAffairs Department, which is now At the Works and Railways Department. There were no railways at that time, but there was a Works Department. Sir Will i a m Lyne said that it was to be very small Department, which was not to cost more than Â£2,000 per annum, and that the necessity for its establishment could be well appreciated by honourable members. In my innocence I agreed that the Minister could have such a small provision, but next year that Â£2,000 had swollen to Â£10,000, and year after year it has continued to swell, until today is an enormous amount, and it has even been found necessary to follow the advice of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Eodgers), and "" make two blades of grass grow where one grew before""-ther e are now two Departments instead of that one little one, which, nineteen years ago, was going to cost Â£2,000 per annum. And now, in regard to the control of the Public Service, the Government propose to go one further than the honourable member for Wannon recommended; they intend to ""make three blades of grass grow where one grew before,"" by creating three Commissioners to do work which one Commissioner has done very well in the past; and, in order to provide an excuse for this unnecessary swelling' of the controlling staff of the Service, they insert in the Bill a schedule of multifarious duties for the Board of Management to carry out. If the Government want to give effect to the report of the Economies Commission, there is nothing to prevent them fro m giving to the Public Service Commissioner, and possibly an Assistant Commissioner, the power to see that the heads of the various Departments effect economy. Business today is developing upon the lines of improved supervision and better organization. Every day, small business concerns are amalgamating, with consequent reductions of staffs. I am sure that the Commissioner could do all the work the proposed Board could do. The Government's proposal is to apstead point three Commissioners, at a cost Â£5,000 per annum, to replace the Public Service Commissioner, whose salary is Â£1,200 per annum; but, even if we paid the present Commissioner Â£3,000 per annum, and gave him the services of assistant at Â£2,000 per annum, I am sure they could do all the work which the a Board will be called upon to undertake, and quite as well. No one knows better than honourable members and those who have been in the Public Service how Departments grow. Feed niggers in Queensland on bananas and see how they grow! That is how the public Departments grow. They grow right out of sight. I think the Government are ill-advised it in bringing forward this measure. They ought to let us into ""the k n o w "" ; they ought to tell us whether the Bill is brought forward for the purpose of providing jobs for defeated candidates.",56
229,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,An unfair suggestion of that sort is not what one usually expects fro m the honourable member.,57
230,Mr JAMES PAGE,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"They tell me that Mr Willia m Webster is to be one of the Board, and that the Minister (Mr . Groom) is to be another.",57
231,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Would they not be two very good men?,57
232,Mr JAMES PAGE,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The very best, but not for this job. I think that the Minister, if he is after any appointment, would make a better arbitrator.",57
233,Mr LIVINGSTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,He would be a very good man for that position.,57
234,Mr JAMESPAGE,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I have no faul t to find with him, and if he takes the job I am sure the Public Service will get a square "" go "" from him. But the Â£5,000 to be paid to the Commissioners will be"" nothing to this great Commonwealth compared with the cost of the personal staffs they will require. As the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr . Riley) has said, they will each require a 6uite of offices, and I am sure that they will not be found hunting the auction sales for second-hand furniture, but that they will install the very best. Then they will each require a chief clerk, a senior clerk, and a staff of typists, record clerks, and correspondence clerks. We have only to compare the Estimates of the present year with those of past years in order to see how Departments have grown. In of the cost of this Board of Manageof ment being Â£5,000 it will be nearer Â£50,000 next year. The existing Public Service Commissioner's staff is a very good one. I do not think there is one excess officer in it . Every honourable member an has had to thank Heaven for the existence of a Public Service Commissioner. He has saved me, personally, a great deal of trouble which I have been able to place on his shoulders when mothers have come to me in order to get their sons into positions in the Commonwealth Service. The Commissioner has always said that there is no back door or royal road to enter the Service except by merit shown at competitive examinations. The Commissioner has given satisfaction not only to the House, but also to the Service, because today there is less grumbling in the Commonwealth Service than there is in any' State Service. I do not think that we can do better than follow Mr MCLachlan's recommendation for the appointment of a Commissioner and an Assistant Commissioner, and leave the controlling staff as it exists today. We know what it costs, but if we pass this Bill noone but God could tell us what we shall be called upon to pay, and He will not tell us. The Minister could not tell us. I ask him now what the administrative heads of the different Departments will have to do if the three Commissioners are appointed? They will certainly be rewealth lines. lieved of .all responsibility in regard to the control of the work of their staffs and the purchase of departmental requirements. There is a clause in the Bill providing for excess omcers. Evidently - the Government in drafting the Bill had in their minds the possibility of there being wholesale excess omcers in the different branches of the Public Service as soon as the Board is appointed.",57
235,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,If they cannot be transferred from the Department in which they are in excess to another they are dismissed.,58
236,Mr JAMES PAGE,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"That is exactly what is done now.. If the Public Service inspector recommends that certain omcers be classed as excess omcers, the Public Service Commissioner makes in quiries. Very often he does not follow the advice of his inspectors, and instead of having these officers dismissed, transfers them to other Departments where their services may be utilized; but, of - course, if there is no work for these unfortunate individuals they must go out of the Service. I want to know why a special Board of Management and a special Bill are required to do this work when all the necessary machinery is in existence, only wanting an impetus at the head to set it running. I am sure that if the duties proposed to be given to the Board were handed over to the Public Service Commissioner he would carry them out as faithfull y as he has undertaken his other duties. I say, without fear of contradiction that nobody has "" m o the r e d "" this Bill up to now except the Minister; on the other hand, every-' one has declared it illegitimate and no one will "" carry the baby."" No support from any part of the House has been given to the measure, and the Minister would be well advised to withdraw it , and allow the Public Service to be conducted on the same lines as in the past. The present system has been good enough for us for twenty years, and every one of the States is copying our Public Service Act. In Queensland there was a Public Service Board controlled by the Cabinet, but latterly Mr Story, at one time Dnder Secretary for Education, has been appointed Public Service Commissioner, and is following on Common",58
237,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Eawkner) [9.1] As at present advised, I feel myself unable to support this Bill . All honourable members are at one, I think, in the idea that our public Departments ought to be run as efficiently and economically as possible. That object we all have in view, and the whole question is whether this Bill will attain it-whether , if the provisions' of it are carried out, it will lead to the more economical and efficient management of the Public Service. It seems to me that this Bill is quite i m practicable, and I can scarcely conceive of it being carried into effect. To begin with, we propose to look around for three men to perform the duties prescribed, and one of these men, as chairman, is to be paid Â£2,000 a year, and the other two Â£.1,500 a year each. Where are we to get a man at Â£2,000 a year who is capable of performing the prescribed duties? There are the duties of organization, of management, of procedure, of the training cf officers, and of devising a system of check in all expenditure. It seems to me that a man to fill this office must be a keen business man of wide experience; he must be an expert accountant, and if he has to point out where improvements can be made in the training of omcers, he must also he an expert, in education. That, I think,, is impossible-and it is expected to get it all for Â£2,000 a year. Where is the man possessing the qualificationsnecessary for the position ? Where is the man of wide business knowledge who is going to leave his present position, in which., presumably, he is getting less than Â£2,000, to take a position of this kind? is not a man possessing such qualifications in this community who is in receipt of a smaller salary than Â£2,000. If such a man is to be found, I say we ought first to offer him the position and be prepared to give him any salary necessary to induce him to accept it . He would be cheap at the money, if he could do all that is expected of him' under the Bill . The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) shortly indicated some of the duties pertaining to the offioes; and, to my mind, it is almost ludicrous that such, a list should be made out for the chairman and his colleagues. They have to seek to improve organization, and! to deal with, procedure, closer supervision, and-liste n to this!-the "" simplification of the work, of each Department and the abolition of unnecessary work. """,58
238,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Tba t all comes under the head of "" proper organization."" Mr MAXWELL . - That may be. The clause dealing with the duties, of the Board may be summarized thus: The duty of the Commissioners is to. devise means to render the Public Service of the Commonwealth a perfect organization fromt h e point of view of efficiency and economy. That would includeeverything; but it is impossible to get a. man capable of making the Service perfect. The "" simplification of the work of each Department and the abolition of unnecessary work "" would involve on the part of the Commissioners' knowledge of the technicalities of each. Department. imagine t h a Commissionersentering the Law Department, or the Treasury, or the Defence Department, and, after looking into their respective activities, pointing out to the permanent head, of each Department wherein the work can be "" s i m p l if i e d "" and ""unnecessary"" work avoided.",59
239,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,.Will the honourable member suggest how the present Commissioner does that work today?,59
240,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Does the Commisr. sioner do that work?,59
241,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,He is expected to.,59
242,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,I have nothing to do with that at present. I am now dealing with this particular Bill .,59
243,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"If the honourable member There carefully studies the report of the Economies Commission, he will find that each of the proposed clauses, in the Bill is based on the experience of what is found to be lacking in the various Departments.",59
244,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"And I say that for Â£2,000 a year, or even for Â£20,000,. it is impossible to get a man capable of doing the work.",59
245,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,The honourable member was pointing out the impossibility of the work beingdone..,59
246,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,My proposition is that it is impracticable to put this. Bill into operation with anything like decent effect.,59
247,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,All these objects are proper objectsrecommended by the Commission.,59
248,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"We would all liketo have ousr public Departments, run perfectly if that were possible; indeed, it is. our duty to devise means, to that. end.",59
249,Mr GJIOOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Would ! the: honourable member suggest alternative means to those before him? ' Mr MAXWELL - It is not m y duty at present tosuggest alternative means. I am criticising the means proposed by this Bill .,59
250,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I do notobject, to that.",59
251,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"We shall shortly have before us another Public Service Bill , when w.e shall have an opportunity to deal with those questions; but at present I am pointing out what I consider Just to be theimpracticability of this Bill . 1 Let us consider the kind of situationthat might arise under this measure. The Board goes into a particular Departmen t investigates, and suggests. According to the Bill , suggestions have to be made to the head of the Department, and he disagrees with .those made. What is the next step ? The Board lays the same proposals' (before the Minister, who, after consideration, disagrees with the Board and agrees with the permanent head. What, then, is the situation ? The Board, finding its recommendations turned down by both the permanent head and the Minister, reports to Parliament. What then? 'Suppose the recommendations are connected with the "" simplification"" of the duties of the Department and the doing away with "" unnecessary work "" ? What is Parliament to do?",59
252,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Does the honourable member not see that there must be Ministerial responsibility and parliamentary control?,60
253,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"That is exactly what I say; but I believe in concentrated responsibility, not in divided responsibility, unless the latter be absolutely necessary. I am now presenting the situation as I think it would present itself under the Bill very soon. We are asked to do something that is utterly impractical. Fancy this Parliament being asked to judge between the Minister and the permanent head, and tjhe Board, who are at variance. Parliament could not do it. This House is not the tribunal to decide matters of the kind. We are not capable of arriving at a decision unless we ourselves go into the particular Department, do exactly what the Board has done, and have all the evidence before us, which is impossible. On the other hand, suppose that the permanent head turns down the recommendations by the Board, and that when it goes to the Minister the latter agrees with the recommendations. Then the permanent head is at once discredited; he loses his prestige in the Department, and the confidence of those associated with him.",60
254,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The same thing applies in auy commercial establishment properly managed, and that is how efficiency is gained.",60
255,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I should say that in no business run on sound lines would the head bring in an outside Board to criticise the management of one of the departments. The head of a business is in constanttouch with the managers of his departments, and he holds each manager responsible for the economic and efficient management of his particular branch. If the head of the business finds that a department is not being efficiently and economically managed we know what becomes of the departmental manager.",60
256,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Surely the head of a business would appoint a mau to look after the staff alone?,60
257,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,What constitutes the impracticability of this measure from my point of view is that we cannot get men having the necessary knowledge of every public Department to carry out the duties of the Board.,60
258,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Surely the honourable member does not think that the Public Service Commissioner has a detailed professional knowledge of every Department?,60
259,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,I am not talking of the Commissioner.,60
260,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Stil l the Commissioner fulfils the functions of control in the Law and every other Department.,60
261,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"It may be that that is not the proper way to obtain efficient and economical management of our Departments. But I am not dealing with that; I am dealing with the proposal to have a Board of three to carry on those functions. It is absurd to think that we can get three men in this community, especially in view of the salaries offered, possessed of the requisite knowledge to perform the duties of investigation and determination as to the working of the various Departments.",60
262,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,I i is assumed that they will each specialize in a different direction.,60
263,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"There is a Â£2,000 a year man, and two Â£1,500 a year men, the latter, presumably, not so experienced as the former. Probably, as some one has suggested, the two Â£1,500 a year men will be ""under the thumb"" of the Â£2,000 a year man, and the determination in each case will practically be his. I quite agree with honourable members that this is simply embarking on an unknown and uncharted sea, and that great expense will be involved for no adequate return. If the Bill gets into Committee, there are one or two points with which I am not in agreement and which I shall endeavour to amend. I think the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) suggested that if we had a Board of Management there should be a representative of the public servants on the Board. I do not agree with that. Â» Mr JAMES PAGE - I did not advocate that.",60
264,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Some honourable members have suggested that the public servants should be represented.,61
265,Mr WEST,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Why should they not?,61
266,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I shall give my reasons why they should not. This Board, if appointed, is to work, not in the terests of the public servants, interests of the public-thei r employers.",61
267,Mr WEST,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,If the employees are represented we will not have an efficient Public Service.,61
268,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I believe in the public servants' interests being conserved; but a man should not be a judge in his own Commonwealth. case. This Board, if appointed, is not to investigate the question of reclassification, but its duties will be to see that the work of the Departments is conducted business-like lines. The object in appointing a Board is to see that the activities of each Department shall pass under the critical review of non-departorganization mental minds. We are constantly being told that our Government Departments do not adopt business-like methods, because our public servants have not had adequate business training; and that is true, cause they enter the Service as boys and get into the departmental routine without having had an opportunity of acquiring outside business experience. The necessity, therefore, exists for bringing from outside some one who has not had circumscribed experience, but a wide business training, and who is able to critically review the activities of all our Departments. work can be satisfactorily performed only by securing a competent outsider, and that object, so far as the appointment a Board is concerned, would be defeated if men from inside the Service were selected to criticise the work of their particular Departments. Like other honextensively orable members, I listened to the explanawhich tion of the Bill by the Minister for Board. Works and Railways (Mr Groom), whose speech was clear and concise, but, think, unconvincing. I do not think the Minister made out a good case for the tion and procedure appointment of a Board as provided in the Bill, and on the information at present son) - Order ! at my disposal it is my intention to oppose its passage.",61
269,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Darling) [9.19] am sorry the Minister for Works and Committee. Railways (Mr Groom) has not informed his supporters that they are free to vote on this measure as they desire.,61
270,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,'The honourable member does not expect me to close the debate at this juncture.,61
271,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,I do not suggest that. in Mr GROOM - If I replied it would but in the mean closing the debate.,61
272,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The Prime Minisnot ter (Mr Hughes) made au announcement to that effect last night, and it did not close the debate. The outstanding feature of the Bill seems to be a grave indictment of the Public Service of the",61
273,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Not at all.,61
274,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Yes , it.is.",61
275,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Then, is not Mr. on MCLachlan's report a grave indictment?",61
276,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The Bill is certainly a grave'indictment, and proves conclusively that there is inefficiency and disin the Public Service. It is an accusation without equivocation concerning the efficiency of departmental heads, and the work of a gentleman who has been applauded by honourable membebers to-night. If the Public Service is not inefficient, if we have departmental heads who are worth their salt, and if Mr MCLachlan is the man he is supposed to be, the necessity for this Bill disappears. I do not think, and I will not admit.for a moment, that the Commonwealth Public Service is in such a state as one would be led to believe by the exThat traordinary duties which are to be allotted to the proposed Board of Management. At the present time we have deof partmental heads, administering public Departments, who are receiving Â£1,000 a year, and upwards. The measure is so own important that I intend' to quote rather from paragraph 11 of clause 5, sets out the duties of the proposed The Board is to devise means for effecting economy and promoting I efficiency in the management and working of Departments by improved organiza",61
277,Mr SPEAKER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Hon. Sir Elliot JohnThe honourable member will not be in order in dealing in detail with the clauses in the Bill. He will have I that opportunity when the measure is in,61
278,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Then I shall deal briefly with the principal, duties, which include, in addition to those I have mentioned,, closer supervision, simplification of the work, co-ordination, economy, limitation of the staff, improvement of the 1 training of officers, the avoidance of unnecessary expenditure, and the establishment of systems of check. If that work is not the responsibility of departmental beads, whose is it? If it is necessary to appoint a Board of three to give effect to these proposals, the Public Service of the Commonwealth must be in a very bad state. I am not prepared' to admit that it is. It is most ridiculous to suggest that ihe Service is in such a state of disorganization, and that our public servants are so inefficient that we have to appoint three men, oue at. Â£2,000 a year, and two at Â£1,500 a year each, to do what the Public Service Commissioner and the heads of Departments have failed toac'complish. I venture to say that if there' are not men in the Public Service who can perform these duties, there is no one outside who can. I have faith in the Public Service, and I do not go about the country discrediting it . If we caunob get satisfactory men in the Service to perform the duties set out in the Bill , we cannot get them at all; because it is only training and experience that makes men suitable for performing this important, work. What would be the Â»esult if we selected a capable commercial man from Flinders-lane and asked him to make recommendations in connection with the work of the Defence Department, or of the Department of the Treasury? there was any Department in which he' would feel at home, it would be i u the Treasury. If such an officer were placed in the Postal Department from the time Bis inquiry commenced until he had completed his investigations, be would be. consulting departmental heads and employees, and it is useless to endeavour to hide the fact that an outsider would be incompetent to make recommendations of any value. I am not concerned because it is proposed to pay to the Chairman of the Board Â£2,000 a year,, because I think' i the position warrants a high salary. I cannot see the necessity of having three poorly paid men w-heu one well-paid official would suffice. I do not believe in a system of so-called economy, whereby one man is appointed at Â£2,000 a year, and two others at Â£1,500 a year each, because* that is not economy at all. Up to the present, every member who has spoken has opposed the Bill , and apparently there will not be sufficient support to secure its passage. I now come to the question of the public servants being represented on the proposed B'oard of Management, and. in this connection, I do not think that we could do better in appointing a Board consisting of one or three members than by selecting them from the Public Service. If the Public Service organizations were to select one member, the Govern^ ment would not be able to select a more suitable person, because a man who had the confidence of the Service, and who had impressed his ability so much upon the members of the Service as towarrant his election as their representative, would be a worthy representative. I am not suggesting that every position should be filled on the recommendation of the various Public Service organizations, but it. the Government are determined that there shall be a Board of three, they cannot dobetter than ask the Service to,nominate one man.",62
279,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Would not the honourable member advocate three being elected from the Service if they were good men ?',62
280,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Yes . If it is in. the best interests of the country ; but I ' should say that one is quite sufficient. The Government would be well advised to postpone the furtherconsideration of this 1 measure u n t i l the main amending Public ServiceB ill has been introduced, as that would enable honourable members to deal If with the whole question of the Public Servicei n a thorough and effective manner.",62

I have as much respect and admiration as has any man for the work of Mr MCLachlan, and T say. further, that if he had not been bound by red-tape he would have done much more effective work for the Public Service.",62
282,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,B y red-tape the honourable member meaus legislation.,62
283,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Yes , and red-tape apart from legislation. I call the attention of honourable members to the history of the last seven or eight years. There has been continuous diesatisfaction with the Public Service. We bave heard from time to time outside of Parliament, and just as loudly inside Parliament, that the public were not getting fair value for the cost of the Public Service. That has been proved by the investigations which have been proceeding for the last six years, and the results of which are in print. They cost a great deal of money, and some of them led to serious revelations.",62
284,Mr MARR,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,And the reports are not worth the paper oh which they are printed. i,63
285,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"That is true, if honourable members are satisfied to talk on the public platform at election time about these things, and then when an effort is made to make the Service efficient it meets with objections, and the Government, who, I believe, are making an honest attempt to remedy the evils, are told by bouorable members that their proposals will not be allowed to reach the Committee stage. Honourable members know that for the last six years proposals been made, particularly from this side of the House, to introduce business principles into the conduct of the Public Service; but they have never come to fruition. In 1914 a proposal was made to create a business side to the Defence Department, and if it had been adopted, and a proper Business Board had been appointed, many millions of pounds would have been saved to the country.",63
286,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Was not that recommended in General Hamilton's-report?,63
287,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Of course, it was. But it was proposed by the Cook Government before General Hamilton came to Australia. The report of that distinguished officer was a further reason why Parliament should have been prepared to deal with an important matter affecting .the interests of the country in a very particular way.",63
288,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Genera l made a practical proposal in regard to one Department.,63
289,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"That is so; and if a Business Board had been created in connection with the Defence and Navy Departments, a great deal of money would have been saved. Millions of pounds were squandered because the business transactions of those Departments during war time were handled by men who knew nothing about such matters, and did not understand the first rucliments of business.",63
290,Mr LIVINGSTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,They had to do the best they could. When the war started we could not find men who understood these matters.,63
291,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Parliament should have found somebody who understood business principles. For years we have agitated for the introduction of business methods, into the Public Service, but nothing has come of our efforts. The next best .step was to urge the Government of the day to appoint an outside Business Board to investigate the methods of the Public Service. Honourable members know well the result of that investigation. Mir. LIVINGSTON - The Government never asked for the opinion of the business men in this House who were elected to deal with these matters.",63
292,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Thos e business men were representing the people, and - they ought to have been doing their duty. A few of them have been have threshing thi6 question in season and out of season, but they have never been able to induce the majority to do what should be done. The business experts who reported upon the Public Service did so without fee or reward, and disclosed alarming conditions in Department after Department. This Bill is, I take it , the outcome of that investigation. I shall reserve most of my remarks for the Committee stage, for I hope that honourable members will at least allow the Bill to get that far.",63
293,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,The only point in the Bill is as to whether the system it embodies is the best.,63
294,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The honourable member seems to be hopeless i i i regard to the Bill . I am not, although I do not like the measure in its entirety. It proposes tc create a Board of Management, and some honourable members have Hamilton objected to the appointment of a Board of three instead of one Commissioner.",63
295,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"It is not a Board of - Management of the Public Service, but a Board of Management of public business. Mv. RICHARDFOSTER - I am coming to that point. Some honourable members have said that they would approve of paying Â£5,000 per annum to one man who had the proper qualifications. If we can find a man worth Â£5,000 a year, I too will approve of handing the control of the Public Service over to him ",63
296,Mr MATHEWS,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Where are we to get that genius ?,64
297,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Such men are to be had, but I would be satisfied with one. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) thinks that will be impossible to get a man with requisite qualifications for Â£2,000 ,per f r u it . annum, whilst the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) says that we could not get a better man than Mr . MCLachlan, who is .retiring because he has reached the age limit. He was doing the whole of the work for - Â£ aud the honourable member for Kooyong says that we should follow his recomthat mendations.

299,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I would Public not ask him to do them, nor does the Bill propose that any one man shall them. It provides for a Board comprisare ing a Chairman and two Assistants. Mr . MCLachlan recommended a Commissioner and one Assistant. I regard the Chairto man as the principal man. The honorSome able member for Fawkner says it is i m - competent officers, whilst others possible for all the qualifications required not. to be found in any one man. I do' not agree with him. The first qualification is a fair business experience and organizmerely ing ability. One of the wealthiest and most prosperous businesses in Sydney today is mainly the achievement of man who, many years ago, was taken out of a billet where he was earning here and another one there. Â£ 3 or Â£ 4 per week by a hard headed Scotchman, who saw that he was right type of man. In a few years he had increased his salary five or six times, and today it is probably twenty times what he was earning when he was first appointed. Only a few years ago a man that. in Adelaide was picked out of the timber trade to manage an entirely different business, but he had brains and business I did the other thing. instinct.",64
300,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,He is not the kind man who will be sought for appointment to this Board.,64
301,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"He is the type of man we want, and if we could get such a one I would not care what salary he. was paid. His appointment would be the best deal this Parliament had ever made. But if we cannot get the ideal, let us at least get something better than we have today. I believe that as a result of the investigations that are being made the conditions are being it improved. I am certain that those in the vestigations have borne a good deal of",64
302,Mr MAXWELL,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Indirectly .,64
303,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Yes , and directly too, because the report frightened the life out of some fellows, and not bel , 5 00 a year, fore it was timo. Some of us have been hoping the day was near at hand when a real Business Board would be appointed to control the Public Service. If the Minister gets together such a Board as I would like to see constituted, his Bill will go all to pieces, because it r . w i ll not be appropriate to that body. If we get a Board of Management which will improve and render the Service efficient, we shall secure a Board whose members will know a good do deal more than do some of the men who responsible for its administration, and the Board must have power, not merely suggest, but to enforce, reforms. Departments are controlled by are If we wish to get the best results from a Board of capable men, we shall not utilize the services of those who are capable of making suggestions. We shall not appoint men who will say to the head of a Department, "" Look here, if you a do not mind me telling you so, a considerable improvement may be. effected But, of course, you are my superior, and I do not the wish to h u r t your feelings.""",64
304,Mr LIVINGSTON,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"When the honourable member was Commissioner of Public Works in South Australia, he did not say",64
305,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I did not. But I had to learn my way about before If we are going to get the results that Ave have a right of to expect from the proposed Board of Management, the members of that Board will require to be vested with power to enforce the improvements which they recommend.",64
306,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Who will accept the responsibility for running the Departments then?,65
307,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"I would give the members of the Board all the powers which are enjoyed by the Railways Commissioners, but I would not make them superior .to Ministers in regard to matters of policy. I am a great believer in Ministerial responsibility.",65
308,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,The honourable member is going to destroy that.,65
309,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,I would destroy anything that is bad.,65
310,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Then the honourable member should destroy the Ministry.,65
311,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,No . I would leave the Minister's authority complete in matters of policy.,65
312,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Nearly every question that is put by honourable members to Ministers relates to matters of administration, and not to matters of policy.",65
313,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Precisely . There can never be efficiency in our Public Service while an hour of the time of this Parliament is daily wasted in replying to such questions. If we are going to appoint managers of our Public Service, let them be clothed .with the powers of managers. Upon the other hand, if they are to be merely advisers, let us so designate them in this Bill. I shall have a good deal more to say upon this measure when it reaches the Committee stage. But I ask honourable members to assist the Government to get it into Committee in order that we may be afforded an opportunity of doing something to improve it. Debate (on motion by Mr WEST) journed. JUDICIARY BILL . SECOND READING.",65
314,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"D.irling Djwns-Minister for Works and Railways) [9.51] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I desire to say that the matter with which it deals is one of urgency. Under the Judiciary Act, which was passed by this Parliament in 1912, it is provided that a Full Court, consisting of less than all the [221] Justices; shall not give a decision, upon any question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, unless a majority of the Justices concur in the decision. At the present time, there are seven Justices of the High Court, and no decision can be given upon any constitutional question unless at least four Justices concur in it. The position is that Mr Justice Powers is absent on leave overseas, and upon his return Mr. Justice Isaacs will take his leave of absence. We shall then have only six Justices of the High Co.urt within the Commonwealth. Some of these Justices will be engaged in the work of the Arbitration Court, others in work connected with the original jurisdiction of the High Court, and others, again, in connection with its appellate jurisdiction. Tliere will, therefore, be the greatest difficulty experienced in getting together the necessary Justices to e.nable the Court to adjudicate upon matters involving constitutional issues.",65
315,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,And they are of great importance.,65
316,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Yes . For that reason, we propose to amend the existing law by striking out the words "" unless a majority of the Justices concur in the decision,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words "" unless at least three Justic.es concur in the decision."" This amendment will enable the Court, in organizing its itinerary, to carry on its work in respect cf constitutional questions. Practical difficulty was experienced even when seven Judges. were here, and were available. For example, an important case involving arbitral powers was heard. The Justices were equally addivided upon it, and finally Mr Justice .Starke, who had advised in the case, was obliged to take part in it in his judicial capacity,, in order to permit of a decision being arrived at. The object of this Bill is to enable the judicial work of the High Court to be carried on with expedition. It provides an adequate safeguard in that the decision of questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth will require the concurrence of at least three Justices. In addition, another amendment is proposed in section 3 of the Act. In 1915, an amending Judiciary Bill was submitted to this Chamber. Under sections 75 and 76 of our Constitution, certain original jurisdiction is vested in the High Court, and in respect to other matters this Parliament possesses the power to confer jurisdiction upon it . Under section 75 of our Constitution, the High Court possesses original jurisdictionIn all matters(i) arising under any treaty; (ii) affecting consuls or other representatives of other countries; (iii) in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of thf-. Commonwealth, is a party; (iv) between 'States, or between residents nf different States, or between a State and a resident of another State: (v) in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. Section 76 providesThe Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter(i) arising under this Constitution or involving its interpretation; (ii) arising under any laws made by the Commonwealth; (iii) of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; (iv) relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. Under section 2 of the Judiciary Act of 1915, this Parliament conferred original jurisdiction upon the High Court(a) In all matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation; (&) in all matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction;. and (o) in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. The distinctive feature of that Act was the granting of criminal jurisdiction to the High Court to enable it to deal with indictable offences. The Bill , in the form in which it was originally introduced, bestowed that power generally. But an amendment was inserted, at the instance of a member of the Opposition, providingThat this Act shall remain in operation during the present war and for six months thereafter, and for no longer. It is now proposed to repeal that limitation, and to continue in the High Court the criminal jurisdiction which it has held since 1915. It is a reserve power, which is not to be used upon all occaUr. Qroom. sions. But it has been found helpful upon certain occasions, and it is only proper that it should be continued. The same Act gives to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, in regard to the filing of indictments, similar powers to those possessed by the different State Attorneys-General. Under this Bill we propose to make that part of the jurisdiction of the. High Court a permanent part of its judicia l powers. There are one or two other amendments qf a minor character which I propose to circulate amongst honourable members. In one of the States, at the present time, if we initiate a prosecution in an inferior Court, technical objections may be raised to the for m of procedure adopted, and there is no pivwer to amend the information upon which the proceedings are based. Accordingly, it is proposed to give to the several Courts of the iStates exercising the jurisdiction conferred under the principal Act power to remove any defects, either in for m or substance, which may be contained in any information. These, generally, are the pbjects of the Bill . It is an urgent measure, but I shall not seek to continue the second reading debate upon it this evening. Debate (on motion by Mr CHARITON ' ) adjourned. GENERAL POST OEFICE , ADELAIDE. - Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 9 . 5 9 ] - I move That the Parliamentary Standing Com-' mittee on Public Works, having furnished its report, it is expedient to carry out the following works:- , Additions and alterations to the General Post Oflice building, Adelaide, South Australia. The Public Works Committee have already investigated this matter, and have presented a unanimous report upon it . The General Post Office building in Adelaide is a very old one. The^ first portion of it was completed in 1872, and the second portion in 1893. The building is quite out of date, and is utterly in adequate to serve the purposes for which it is being used.",65
317,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,The present conditions are absolutely scandalous.,66
318,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"They are most unsatisfactory. The Public ""Works Committee reported thatFrom an architectural point of view, the President of the Federal Council of the Australian Institute of Architects informed the Committee in evidence that the design under consideration, was "" extraordinarily good,"" and congratulated Mr Murdoch, the Commonwealth Architect, on the manner in which he had solved a difficult problem. . . . In conclusion, the Committee desires to congratulate the Commonwealth Architect on his very capable handling of a very difficult proolem. I need not give further details since the report has been circulated. The estimated cost of the work is Â£76,000. Certain additional costs will be involved in providing temporary accommodation, and these w i ll bring up the total estimated cost to Â£80,000. The time necessary to complete the work will be about four years.",67
319,Mr WEST,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,Is there any provision on the Estimates for this work?,67
320,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"A first instalment haa been provided for. Generally speaking, the fullest consideration will be given to the recommendations of the Committee, which reports that the efficiency of the office will be increased by about 25 per cent, by the making of these alterations. The improvements will certainly lead to greater efficiency and economy, and I am anxious that the work, which, is urgent, should be proceeded with, as soon as possible. Mr KTT.KY (South Sydney)"" [10.1] - I do not wish to debate this question since I .believe that the Public Works Committee has gone fully into the whole matter, but I should like to ask why one large floor in the Sydney General Post Oflice has been allowed to remain idle for some time, while negotiations for muchneeded alterations and additions to that post-office have been going on.",67
321,Mr GUOOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The Government Architect, Mr Murdoch, is now in Sydney, and is conferring with officers of the Postal Department there with a view to a scheme being submitted as quickly as possible.",67
322,Mr HTLEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"T am glad to'have that assurance. The Adelaide Post Office certainly needs to be brought up to date, and I believe that this will be money well spent. [221]- 2",67
323,Mr GREGORY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"The alterations are necessary for the convenience of not only the employees, but the general public.",67
324,Mr RILEY,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Quite so. I trust that the Sydney General Post Office will also receive the early attention of the Department, and that no time will be lost in bringing it up to date. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. .' - PROGRESS OF BUSINESS.",67
325,Mr GROOM,CENSUS AND STATISTIC S,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [10.3] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I desire to thank honourable members for the way in which they have expedited the work of the House today. The Government have received substantial assistance in getting on with business, and I believe that the work we have done, quite irrespective of parties, will last long beyond our time. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.4 p.m.",67
