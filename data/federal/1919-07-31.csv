Mr Charlton"" - Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that since the statement made by him in the (House, to the effect that overcoats which retoirired soldiers had bean obliged to hand in to the Department would be restored to. them, many applications for their return have been made to the Department in Sydney, but that the soldiers have been informed by the Military authorities there that they have received no instructions on the subject from Head-Quarters ? Will the Minister look into the matter?",21
2,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I will. COURT MARTIAL ON HMAS. "" AUSTRALIA."" SENTENCES ON SEAMEN-CONTRO L OF THE AUSTRALIAN NAVY-CAPTAI N GXOSSOP.",22
3,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Has the Acting Minister for the Navy received any communication from the British Admiralty in regard to the sentences passed by a court martial on members of the crew of HMAS. Australia? Will he also inform the House when the Australian Navy will again pass over to the control of the Commonwealth Government?  been received from the British Admiralty to the effect that on receipt of the papers relating to the sentences the authorities there will deal with them, and give due consideration to the representations made by the Australian Government.",22
4,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Hav e the papers been sent Home?  Home some time ago. As to the second part of the honourable member's question, I may say that the Australian Fleet will revert to the control of the Commonwealth Government as from tomorrow",22
5,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is it true, as reported, that Captain Glossop has resigned, or intends to resign, because he is dissatisfied with the decision of the Government to have the sentences imposed by him and his court martial analyzed by the British Admiralty, with a view to their remission ?  knowledge, it is not true - that Captain Glossop has given notice of his intention to resign. I understand, however, that, on the ground of ill-health, he has applied for three months' leave of absence. There is no record in the Department of any intention on his part to resign. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. CLOSURE AND "" GUILLOTINE "" STANDING ORDERS.",22
6,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister in charge of the House whether the Government, when they desire to shorten the debate on any measure, will in future avail themselves of the closure standing order, "" That the question be now put,"" instead of bringing into operation ' the "" guillotine "" standing order, which has the effect of depriving the House of an opportunity to divide on certain questions.",22
7,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"^The honourable member is aware of the object of the "" guillotine "" standing order. The arbitrary system of closing a debate by moving, without notice, ""That the question be.now put,"" does not give honourable members an opportunity to discuss the business immediately under consideration. Under the ""guillotine"" standing order, however, honourable members are made aware of the time actually available for the discussion of the measure to which it is applied, and are thus enabled to direct their attention to those features of it which they deem to be most important.",22
8,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,We do not have that opportunity.,22
9,Mr GROOM,Unknown,r-HonoTable members opposite know exactly how they used that opportunity yesterday in connection with the debate in Comlmittee on the Commercial Activities Bill.,22
10,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,I had.no opportunity to discuss that measure yesterday.,22
11,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Then the honourable member should ask members of his own party why that opportunity was denied him. The "" guillotine "" standing order, when brought forward for adoption, was fully discussed in the House, and I see no justification for departing from its use. When better understood,, the standing order is one that I believe other Parliaments will recognise the - wisdom of adopting.",22
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," May I remind the'House that a motion was carried yesterday in reference to a particular measure to which allusion has been made, declaring it to be an urgent measure, and fixing a time l i m it for its discussion. , The closure motion cannot be applied to it in the circumstances. - NAV AL COLLEGE . RESIGNATION OF CAPTAIN GHANT.  ter for the Navy any statement to make as to the circumstances leading up to the resignation of Captain Grant from the position of Commandant of the Royal Australian Naval College?  a statement on this subject.",22
13,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think that statement was made, not in the House, but to the press.  in stating the facts. The papers, speaking from memory, .show that on Armistice night the students at the Royal Naval College were told that they might go out and make as much noise as they pleased, but that they must return within halfan-hour. When this leave expired all but eight ,of the students had returned, and a few minutes later only two had failed to return. These two were found standing near the canteen, each drinking a glass of beer, but the papers, distinctly show that .they were not intoxicated. It was open to the Captain in charge of the College to apply to these two youths any one of three methods of punishment. He chose to adopt the most extreme formthat of dismissal from the College-bu t this could not come into operation without the consent of the Minister. He dismissed the two students, who were in their fourth year, and subsequently representations were made to me by one of the boys, who came all the way from Queensland to do so. Before that, however, when it was first reported to me that there were three methods of punishment toh'at might have been adopted, I had suggested by letter that a severe reprimand would be sufficient, but the head of the College would not budge from his position. It was just about that time that one of the boys-h e ought really to be described as a young mancame down from Queensland. may say that neither of the youths in question was a Victorian, nor the son of a member of Parliament, as the newspaper had declared them to be. A f t e r seeing the boy who came . from Queensland, I instructed him to go back to College, and at the same time informed the College authorities that both were to be permitted to undergo their fourth-year examination. I may inform honourable members that at the time the examination was in progress; and I also arranged that they should be examined on the same papers as had been used for the other students. As a result of this, the Captain in charge of the College resigned. The boys were examined, with the result that one passed and was transferred to a ship on the high seas; while the other failed. In any case, both of these lads would have lef t the College immediately after the examination-in the case of success, to join a ship, or in the case of failure, to abandon a naval career. It will be seen that the argument that the dismissal of the boys was necessary because they might contaminate the other students did not apply. I have, I think, stated the whole case.",23
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Did any other fourthyear students fail at this examination?  hand. NAVA LMEN ON LEAVE. DEFERRED PAYMENTDELAYED .,23
15,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Is the Acting M in ister for the Navy aware that a number of men from the Australian warships, who are on leave and visiting their homes in Western Australia, have - been waiting in Perth for several weeks, in fact for over a month, for the deferred pay to which they are entitled? Will the Minister see that this money is paid immediately ?  that these men had not been paid. I shall make inquiries, with a view to expediting their payment. DEFENCE POLICY. SPEECH BY SENATOR PEARCE.",23
16,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"It is reported that recently in London Senator Pearce. 1 after a visit to France, stated that the destruction in that country pointed to the lesson that the only way to defend Australia is to defend it on enemy soil. As that involves a departure from the tradi tional policy of Australia, which is one of defence and not of offence, does the Government propose to reconsider the whole question, and declare a new policy ?",23
17,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I did notice the paragraph in the press; but I do not see-that an alteration in the policy of the Government is involved in the slightest degree If we continue our present policy, and by an attack on some island or other placed a short distance from Australia, we could at any time save this land from invasion and devastation, we should be failing in our national. obligation if we did not appeal to our men to defend the country at that point of danger. LETTERGRA MS FOR NORTHERN Acting QUEENSLAND.",24
18,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the mail service in Northern Queensland is very irregular, .will the Postmaster-General consider the question of extending the lettergram system? Mjr. WEBSTER - Unde r the law, no differentiation can be made as between the States, and I am bound to obey that law. NORTHERN TERRITORY: ADMINISTRATION.  Minister for Home and Territories been drawn to a paragraph in the Argus this morning to the effect that Mr Atlee H u n t is to administer the Northern Territory from Melbourne until the term of Professor Gilruth has expired ? If , as ' I suspected all along, Mr Atlee H u n t is to ably administer the Northern Territory from Melbourne, why has the M in ister appointed another Administrator ? Mr ' GLYNN - I have not seen the paragraph referred to. The term of Professor Gilruth as Administrator expires in about six months from the 1st June. He is now taking a vacation; and in the meantime there are a great number of orders and other formal documents which have to be signed by some one. We have appointed a director of the A d visory Council who may, from experience, be found sufficient to cope with the business in the Territory without the usual Administrator, and in the meantime I have declared by Ordinance that the Secretary to the Department shall be appointed Deputy Administrator. His functions, however, are not to be in practice those of an administrator, b ut simply have reference to such matters as the signing of formal documents - I cannot t do all that work myself, though the control of the Territory rests with me. Mr 'PAGE - Whoeve r gave the Argus the information did not explain that.",24
19,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Of course, phraseology is sometimes unintentionally misleading. PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE MB. POYNTON'S MEMBERSHIP.",24
20,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I notice in the Orders of the Day that the name of the  ton) still appears as a member of the Public Accounts Committee. I understood the honourable gentleman resigned some time ago, and I should like to know whether the appearance of his name in the list is in order.",24
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I received and reported to the House the resignation of the honourable member referred to, and sent it to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) . The name of the honourable gentleman still appears on the Orders of the Day because he has not been discharged from the service of the Committee, and the name cannot be removed until this is done. It is a matter that rests with the House, which appointed the honourable gentleman. ADMIRALJELLICOE ' S REPORT.",24
22,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,Is the Acting Leader of the House in a position to i u form us on what date the Government expect to receive Admiral Jellicoe's report ?,24
23,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I am not yet in a position to give that information. I understand that Admiral Jellicoe will be in Sydney in about a fortnight .,24
24,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Will he report before he goes back to England? ""'",24
25,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Acting Minister  that he expects a progress report before Admiral Jellicoe leaves New Zealand, which will be in the middle of August. NA CHARGE S.",24
26,Dr MALONEY,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"H as the attention of the Acting Attorney-General been drawn to the fact that exorbitant in terest, amounting to 330 per cent, in some cases, is being charged by money-lenders? Before the War Precautions Act is finally disposed of, will the Minister consider the making of a regulation limiting the amount of interest that may be charged by the.se harpies?",25
27,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"This matter has been - the subject of legislation in several of the States. It is purely a State concern, and it would be inappropriate to attempt in a general way to regulate interest charges under a Moratorium Bill that refers only to mortgages current during the war period - Mr SAMPSON asked the Minister reWAR SERVICE HMS.",25
28,Mr RODGERS,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"I observe from the contractual arrangements - made between the Commonwealbh Government and the Commonwealth Bank, that the management of the housing scheme will be in the hands, and to a great extent at the discretion, of that institution. In view of the fact that the Commonwealth Bank has practically no organization outside the larger centres of population, can any arrangement be made whereby the existing organizations of the State Savings Banks throughout the country can undertake this work in conjunction with the Commonwealth Bank? If not, do the Government propose to arrange with the Commonwealth Bank for the establishment of offices in every big provincial town in order to insure that the requirements of country districts may be dealt with expeditiously?  tion of which notice was given by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Sampson), I intend to give to the House, this afternoon some information upon this subject. If the honourable member for Wannon will place a further question upon the notice-paper, I will furnish him with afuller reply tomorrow.",25
29,Mr RILEY,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"Is it a fact that Colonel Walker, who has been placed in charge of .the housing scheme, finds himself .at a dead-end because of the attitude of the Timber and. Brick Combines ? What are the Government proposals for enabling returned soldiers to get cheap homes?  made at the present time, and some arrangement is being evolved to meet the circumstances. . Mr MATHEWS - As there is a great deal of discontent over the delay in getting the war service homes scheme into operation, will the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation make a statement as to the .possibility of progress being made in the near future?  the Minister, and see if it is possible to make such statement. Later: presenting the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Whether the arrangement made with the Commonwealth Bank includes the calling for tenders, letting of contracts, controlling the construction, 'and carrying on the work generally of the erection of homes for soldiers and their dependants under the Commonwealth War Service Homes Actt 2. If so, does this arrangement mean that the administration of this Department has passed from Ministerial control .to the Commonwealth Bank? 3. If not, how far has Ministerial control been reserved under the agreement with the Bank?  honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The Bank acts aB agent for the Commis- sioner, and, inter alia, and subject to the provisions of the arrangement, is empowered to(a) purchase vacant land; - (6). purchase land and dwelling-houses; (c) erect' dwelling-houses; (d) sell land and dwelling-houses; (e) grant leases of land or land and dwelling-houses; (/) advance moneys; and (</)- effect insurances in satisfaction of individual applications; but the Bank is not empowered to operate in regard to group building erected in anticipation of applications'. 2. No. Tho administration of the War Service Homes Act is vested in the Commissioner; and power is given him. under that measure to make an arrangement with any prescribed institution for it to discharge certain functions. 3. See 2. Any control exercisable by the Minister has not been diminished by the agreement referred to. SEAMEN'S STRIKE. RELIEF OF DISTRESS.",25
30,Mr BAMFORD,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"H a v in g regard to the serious situation in the north of Queensland, I am justified in again asking the Leader of the House if , during the last twenty-four hours, there have been any fresh developments in connection with the seamen's strike?",26
31,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,There have been no fresh developments. The Government are still awaiting the report of meetings which have been held by the Seamen's Union in each of the States. No definite information has yet reached the Government.,26
32,Mr TUDOR,EXORBITANT INTEREST,Is the Acting Leader of the House in a position yet to make a statement relative to - the allocation of money for the relief of distress caused by the strike?,26
33,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"The Commonwealth Government did make available the sum of £1,000 as a preliminary step in connection with the relief of distress in Melbourne and suburbs. Subsequently the question of relief generally was considered, and a scheme drawn up whereby the Victorian State Government and the Commonwealth Government arranged for the relief of distress where necessary, the cost of same to be borne equally by the two Governments. Under the existing scheme relief depots have been established, wherever necessary, in Victoria, and the arrangements are working satisfactorily under the supervision of Commonwealth and State Governments' representatives. The Governments of the other States were informed of the arrangements made in Victoria, and they were asked whether they would be prepared to enter into similar arrangements in their States. The reply received from New South Wales was that the proposed arrangement was accepted, and that the State Government would be prepared to provide half the sum necessary up to a maximum of £5,000 as its share. Replies received from other States were as f o llows :Queensland - Governmen t already has elaborate machinery for distribution of relief, and prefers that any relief given should be through medium of existing machinery, which has been found sufficient for all State purposes. t P South Australia - Positio n not acute. Any relief required has been afforded by State authorities. In circumstances, not disposed to vote any sum of money for purpose suggested by Commonwealth, but willing to co-operate in distributing any money authorized by Commonwealth - Government. Western Australia - Sugges t that existing machinery be used. State is agreeable to pay half. Tasmania - Repl y was received on 9th July that no unusual distress existed at .that date.",26
34,Mr BURCHELL,EXORBITANT INTEREST,-Has any money been made available for Western Australia yet?,26
35,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"I do not know if money has actually been made available for Western Australia, but if necessary it can be supplied at once.",26
36,Mr WATKINS,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"Seeing that so far Newcastle has not received more than £250 out of the £1,000 made available^ would it not be better for the Commonwealth to retain a little control over the destination of the money, instead of simply advancing it to the States for distribution ?",26
37,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"The New South Wales Government has accepted the proposal of the Commonwealth Government, but I shall have inquiries made into the aspect of the matter raised by the honourable member. The desire, of course, is to have equitable distribution. 1 WHEAT POOL.",26
38,Dr MALONEY,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"A l t h o u g h it is frequently stated that the Wheat Pool account has been overdrawn to the extent of £17,000,000 or £18,000,000, no statement is ever published regarding amounts that are to the credit of the Pool. Sir Joseph Carruthers, of New South Wales, has pointed out that the publication of such information has an effect on the value of wheat scrip, which is often sold below its real value on account of the credits of the Pool not being known. I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether, when in formation is given to the press as to the amounts overdrawn, he cannot also state what credits are due to the Wheat Pool?",26
39,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"I quite appreciate the significance of the honourable member's question. In reply to the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson), a definite promise was given yesterday that certain inquiries would be made in relation to a similar matter. .« REPATRIATION . GRANT TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES.",26
40,Mr LYNCH,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"In connection with the grant of £500,000 to shire and municipal councils in order to provide employment for returned soldiers, a difficulty has arisen owing to the fact that the period allowed fpr the expenditure of the various sums of money has almost expired. Some time elapsed before the local authorities could get a definite assurance from the Government as to the amount of money that would be available, and a further delay took place in getting the teams of men together. Now, when the work that was put in hand is half finished, the grant from the Commonwealth is to eease because the prescribed time limit has been reached. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation if arrangements cannot be made for an extension of the time ?  quiries from the Minister for Repatriation, and endeavour to give the honourable member the information later in the day. ELECTORAL REFORM.",27
41,Mr HIGGS,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"""Will the Minister for Home and Territories take into consideration the advisability of acquainting 'honourable members at an early date with details of any proposed amendment of the electoral law in the direction of altering the basis of representation in the Senate?",27
42,Mr GLYNN,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"I shall be glad to communicate the information to honourable members at the earliest possible moment; but I cannot make any statement yet, because the Bill has not been finalized. SURPLUS DEFENCE STORES. Mr FOWLER,-T t is reported in ths press that woollen and other goods no longer required by the Defence Departsentative ment are being distributed to the various charitable institutions in Melbourne. I view of the fact that no such distribution has taken place in some of the other States, notably ""Western Australia, will the Assistant Minister for Defence see'that a similar allocation take3 place in all the States on a proportionate basis?",27
43,Mr WISE,EXORBITANT INTEREST,I shall submit the suggestion to the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell). RELEASE OF INTERNEES.,27
44,Mr SINCLAIR,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"Hav e the Government considered the question of releasing at an earlier date than the actual declaration of peace, which may be some time ahead yet, such internees as were to have been liberated on that occasion ?",27
45,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"Certain inquiries which are being made are not yet quite completed, but an announcement will probably be made at a very early date as to the policy 'the Government will pursue in regard to the matter of internees. GALLIPOLI LANDING.",27
46,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EXORBITANT INTEREST,Has further consideration been given to the question of issuing a special decoration to soldiers who were present at the landing on Gallipoli?,27
47,Mr WISE,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"I have not heard of it, but I shall ask the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell), and let the honourable member know if anything has been done in the matter. LONDON WHEAT BOARD.",27
48,Mr HIGGS,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"Will the Minister leading the House be good enough to lay on the table the names of the Wheat Board who sit in London, and of which, T understand, Mr Fisher is chairman?",27
49,Mr GROOM,EXORBITANT INTEREST,"I shall make inquiries, and furnish the honourable member with the names. NA STATES.",27
50,Mr FENTON,COMMISSIONER IN THE UNITED,"Has the Acting Leader of the House noticed the report of a speech' by the newly-appointed repreof Australia in the United States, in which that gentleman is ren ported to have said that "" hands off trade and commerce "" would be one of the best policies that Cabinets or Legislatures could pursue? Does that mean that the policy of this Government is to allow t r a d e and commerce to carry on it so w n f r e e course, whether it is l e g it i m at e or ill e g it i m at e t r a d e?",27
51,Mr GROOM,COMMISSIONER IN THE UNITED,"I noticed the brie f report to w h i c h the honourable member ref e r s , but , as the honourable member knows, it is not advisable to express a n o p in i o n o n a condensed report of any person's utterance. The Government is c e r t a in l y not in sympathy with a n y t h in g in the nature of w h at the honourable m e m ber terms "" ill e g it i m at e "" trade and commerce, and intends to enforce the existi n g Federal legislatio n w h i c h is directed against T r u s t s and Combines who m a y seek to in d u l g e in . such trade. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that many primary producers, including wool-growers, graziers, and wheat farmers, owing to the ravages of the drought, have paid a larger amount in income tax for the period of the war than they have received in income? 2. If go, will he consider the necessity of amending the Act so that the incidence of the income tax may be more equitable, and that the average operations for three or five years, with power to set off all losses, be the basis for the assessment of the tax?  the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It would not be possible to ascertain the fact suggested without careful examination of every primary producer's return which has been lodged with the Commissioner of Taxation. It is possible, however, that in some cases the fact suggested does exist. 2. The Government will have inquiries made.",28

Has this credit balance, or any part of it, been used to finance the 1917-18 or 1918-19 ""pools""? 5. Is so, is interest being charged against ' these ""pools""? ' 6. As the Wheat Board is stated to be acting as trustee for the wheat-owners, why has the money received for this "" p o o l "" not been distributed? 7. Is it the intention of the Government to make good, the losses Sustained by the various "" p o o l s "" caused by what is alleged to be the negligence of the servants or agents of the Wheat Boards? 8. W it h reference to the balances of wheat . on hand shown in the last statement issued by the Wheat Board, will the Board certify that these balances actually exist, or are they assumed balances? 9.

What is the calling or occupation of each such person in the community, N if any?  thp information asked for would entail considerable time and labour?, and in the interests of economy it is considered that the expense should not be incurred unless it can be shown that the information would be of such value as to justify tha cost of its preparation. TRADE WITH GERMANY.",28
53,Mr FENTON,EMPLOYEES DRAWING ADDITIONAL,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that trade relations have been resumed by Great Britai n and America with Germany? 2. Is it a fact that there"" is now a serious competition by American buyers with.

56,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYEES DRAWING ADDITIONAL," As there are no means by which the growers of oats, peas, and potatoes who actually used new cornsacks purchased from the Government can be traced, it is not considered to be practicable to include this class of producer in the proposed distribution of the profits.

They are, in consequence, suffering very great inconvenience indeed. It will be necessary for some of them, at an early date, to be given monetary assistance. Honourable memibers on both sides, and honourable members of the Senate also, have, with me, been doing their utmost to secure pasSUGAR. sages to Tasmania for these people. We have been working with this object in view for some time. There seemed to be some probability that a means of transferring these people to Tasmania 'would now be provided; but only this morning I learned that the Rotomahana, which was to sail tomorrow for Tasmania, is to be delayed u n t i l Saturday. The delay may be further prolonged, and these unfortunate people be still left in the position in which they are at the present time.

A man who secured employment in PAPER. Tasmania came over to Melbourne to take his wif e and family of eight children back with him. He has been unable to return to Tasmania, and, in the meantime, has spent £60. I received a wire this morning from Hobart in the following terms:Appreciate your efforts obtain assistance Government for stranded Tasmanians. - My mother and father stranded since May. In view of the high cost of living, it is clear that, no matter what the financial position of these people may be, they cannot go on living hereindefinitely when - they are earning nothing, and when their businesses in Tasmania are being neglected, and there are probably no returns from them.. These stranded people have my heartfelt sympathy, because no - one has suffered more than I have from the - terrible isolation of Tasmania. I would - not again pass through such an experience - as I have 'had for worlds. It was. something dreadful for me to be stranded here, and unable to get to my home in Tasmania when I should have been there. I have, therefore, the greatest sympathy with others placed in a' similar position, who have been held up here for months. Preference in securing passages to Tasmania has rightly been given .to returning soldiers, and the civilians who are stranded here have not one woi-d of complaint to make on that account. Still, something should be done to afford assistance to these people. I impress upon Ministers the importance of this question, and I suggest that they should immediately get into communication with the Government of Tasmania, and see whether, in conjunction with them, something cannot be done to enable these people to reach their homes. I should like the assurance of the Minister in charge of the House that the Government have - already been in touch with those in authority in Tasmania, or have made arrangements themselves to relieve the disFleming, W.

He is kind and courteous and 'willing to help every person, whether rich or poor, in any way that he can.

The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) has given notice of a subsequent amendment, PATBS. to secure representation of the workers upon this Committee, and, in his absence, I understand some other honourable member will move the amendment.

The personnel of the Committee in accordance with this constitution is as follows :Chairman, the Minister for Customs (Mr. Greene).

Mr Holdenson represents a proprietary company engaged in the manufacture of butter. And the next Victorian representative is Mr H . W .

In fact, there are two people who fix the price >of butter in Australia These are Messrs. Meares, of New South Wales, and Osborne, of Victoria. When they talk, up goes the price of butter.

This Committee has full and unrestricted authority as to how much butter, cheese, and other dairy produce shall be retained in Australia, and much shall be exported; and they may create an artificial scarcity at any time.",40

140,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"It is the danger of these artificial scarcities, and the fact that they have been created, that have brought about very considerable profiteergreat ing, and given rise to the increased prices so prevalent of late. I in that vite the Minister (Mr Groom) to look at the matter from that point of view. I protest against the suggestion from the other side that we on are trying, to bring down the price below a fair and reasonable price to the producer. I have heard no suggestion of the kind, nor do I believe it would be made by any honourable member. While we on this side agree that the workers in any industry should receive the full product of their labour, we do not limit that to' manual employment or any particular industry. The man who is producing on the land is as much entitledperhaps, in the first case, more entitledto the full produce of his work as any other in the community. But to suggest for a moment that the carrying of this is amendment would affect the price of butter is an argument that is demolished by the Minister himself, who has said that there is nothing the Committee can do that does affect the price. The suggestion, therefore, ""goes by the board""; it came with particular ill-grace from honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), in view of the fact .that a few days prior to his election the Government increased the price of butter by 2d. per lb. Of course, that gave the butter in his constituency excellent cause to support the Government candiddate; and this was one of the clearest case3 of political bribery I have seen in",40

I submit that the amendment is perfectly relevant because of the fact that this Committee have unrestricted authority to export or keep in Australia what they choose. They are authorized under-the regulations to provide supplies for Australia, but those supplies may, according to their opinion, be or small; they can say how much shall be available for Australia, and, on quantity, the price will be regulated.",40

144,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I invite honourable members to look at that portion of the Bill in which are specified the duties of the Committee. Those duties, are so wide in regard to the control of supplies that the question of price must inevitably enter into their work. They may not have the actual fixing of the price, but the quantity available on the local market is what, to a large extent, determines the price; and they can export as much as they choose, maintaining in Australia such a supply as generally will suit their particular purposes. If we are to believe honourable members opposite, the law of supply and demand will come, into play, and the price will be determined by the quantity available. I do not believe that the law of supply and demand will operate at all.",41
145,Mr LIVINGSTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,What will operate?,41
146,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The convenience of the producers in the industry. The Committee have also power to procure supplies of dairy produce, and put them in cold storage; and this is a useful thing for the purpose of steadying the market. One of the most irritatin g experiences in the ordinary affairs of life is the jumping of the market, and the law of supply and demand, if allowed to operate, has the effect of depressing or raising prices. But the introduction of cold storage has revolutionized the whole system. sequence is that the Committee, with the power to purchase and put in cold storage, have unrestricted opportunities to manipulate the business in their own interests. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) has said, their interests are all selfish. Their own pockets' are the only considerations that will in fluence them. Having powers of purchase, storage, and export, they will manage the business, not - in the interests of the public, but to their own advantage. That they should fix an unpayable price 13 not contended or expected. I would .be the last to ask any producer to accept an unprofitable price for his goods. But the fact I am stressing is that the persons who will control the home supplies, cold storage, and export, have only one point of view, and that is not the public point of view. The protection of the public interests should be our first consideration. Regulation 20 in. the first schedule provides that the Committee may fix Lhe rates of commission which agents may charge, in connection with the sale of butter and cheese. The Committee is composed largely, and may. at any time be composed, exclusively, of men who are speculators in the butter and cheese business.",41
147,Mr GROOM,A NATIONAL SENATE,On the Committee are men representing the producers and cooperative companies.,41
148,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"All the persons on the Pool are dependent upon commission as well as profits, and they may fix their commission at any figure they choose. In fact, the commission may be increased to such an extent as-to seriously increase the price of the commodity. Although the Committee will have no authority under this Bill to proclaim the actual price of a commodity to the public, yet by the operation of many varied authorities they can so control supplies and fix the rates that the public will be lef t without any protection. Is the M in ister (Mr Groom) aware of the recognition of this principle by other countries? In the Mother Country, by specific act of the Government, not only have they placed representatives of consumers upon the Food Commissions, but they have also placed women upon those bodies. No proThe conperly-constituted Committee, charged with the management of food supplies, can be efficient unless it includes at least one woman. Not only does the farmer's wife often know more about his business than does the farmer himself, but it is certain that in order to arrive at the point of view of public interest in connection with these matters, it is essential to get the woman's point of view. The average housekeeper knows more about the price of domestic commodities than does a man, and could' give useful information to the Committee from her knowledge of the actual facts of life. We might well follow the example of the Mother Country by appointing to this Committee somebody who would have regard to the interests of the public as distinct from the interests of the producer. The two interests are not necessarily in opposition, but we should have a means of conserving the interests of the whole of the people in stead of only one section of the people. The amendment is worthy of serious consideration, and particular attention should be paid by the Government to the right of housekeepers to representation on the Committee.",41
149,Mr FENTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Maribyrnong) [4.37]. - I , too, make a plea for the consumer. Were I one of those who represent the producers on the Butter Pool, I should gladly welcome a representative of the consumers. A f t e r all, the representatives of the producers should not be antagonistic to their best customers-the consumers. Under the Wheat Pool wheat required for gristing in Australia is sold at a price lower than is obtained for wheat sold to other parts of the world. Whilst we have provided that butter shall not be sold in Australia at more than the prescribed price, the Butter Pool Committee will be able to control quantities, and in than way practically control prices. There is a great, temptation to export butter in the fact that the price in Great Britain is from 200s. to 250s. per cwt., whereas butter is being sold in Australia at 170s. per cwt. About twelve years ago, if a dairyman obtained on the English market 120s. per cwt. for his butter he regarded himself as a very favoured in dividual. To-day he receives in some in stances more than twice that amount. A Committee that represents merely the producers, even though its members be of honest intent, may be inclined to allow too much butter to be sent abroad, because of the higher price obtainable in other countries. In ' o r d er that the Committee may be kept in check, and prevented from sending too much butter out of Australia, the consumers ought to be given representation. I have heard producers protest strongly against the various Pools because they fix the prices in the local market, and l i m it the export. They claim that if the commodities had not been controlled by means of Pools, greater quantities would have been exported, - and the producers' would have received a bigger return. But that policy would have left the local market short, and prices would have soared to such a height that it would have been impossible for butter to .be used in the average home. I remember that when the American Fleet was visiting Victoria, the price of butter rose to 2s. 6d. per lb. The consumers took a stand against the inflation of prices! They went on strike for one week. The result was that the cold stores were being filled and the agents were in a dilemma. I am not blaming the farmer or the butter factories. The fact is, that the agents thought they had - a chance of exacting an exorbitant price from the comniunity, and increasing their commission proportionately.",42
150,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,A NATIONAL SENATE,"You know that that has not been done, in connection with the Butter Pool.",42
151,Mr FENTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I am giving an in stance of what-has been done in the past. I believe that if the consumer were to ref r a in from buying meat and other commodities in regard to which he is being exploited, he might be able to bring about the same happy result as was achieved in connection with butter prices on the occasion to which I have referred. But the Government, who profess to have regard for the interests of both consumers and .producers, should not allow such a situation to arise. Why should there be any objection to allowing the consumers representation on these Committees as has been done in Great Britain? I believe that every regulation included in this Bill for the guidance of the Butter Pool Committee was drawn up by the Committee itself. Regulation 13 of the first schedule readsI t shall be the duty of the Committee(a) to provide, as far as possible, butter and cheese for consumption in the Commonwealth; (b) to make such arrangements as it deems necessary with regard to sales of butter and cheese to the Imperial Government and other sales for export. There are other provisions enabling them to store butter and allow it to go into consumption as they think fit. The Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) said, in reply to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor), that the Butter Committee did not ha\'e auy power in regard to the price of the commodity, but regulation 11 contains the following:Provided that the Committee may exempt from the provisions of these regulations(a) such small manufacturers as it thinks fit; and (6) sales of butter and cheese direct to suppliers. That gives the Committee power to grant certain exemptions. I have no complaint to make *as to that. Suppliers of milk to cheese factories and cream to butter factories should not be denied the right of obtaining cheese or butter at wholesale prices from the co-operative concerns in which tliey are shareholders. It has been said that there are no butter speculators on the Committee. I would like to know the names, of the Committee. It is right that the Government should have a representative on it. ' Mr TUDOR - The Government have three representatives-Messrs . Wilson, and Galbraith. The Commonwealth Dairy Expert has a voice, but no vote, on the Committee.",42
152,Mr FENTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The Acting Attorney General cannot convince, the people that it is right to exclude representatives of the consumers, whose interests are so much concerned. Where would the producers ho but for the consumers? Butter ought to be sold to the people at a price within the reach of the poorest in the community. No honourable member would deny to the primary producers a fair deal. I believe that tliey only desire a fair deal. I remember how disgusted they were on the occasion of the visit of the American Eleet, when the price was raised by the butter agents. The producers simply ask for a fair average price throughout the seasons of the year, which will enable them to put their industry on a better footing, while giving them a fair return. The bulling and bearing of the market price of foodstuffs is one of the most criminal actions of the day, and the general public will be amazed to learn that the reasonable request put forward today that the r-onsiimers should have representation on the Butter Committee has been refused by the Government.",43
153,Mr GROOM,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The regulations in the I schedule were not framed by the Butter Committee, as the honourable member has averred. They were framed by Mr Whittrm, the officer in charge of the Department. Mr Fenton"" - He must have been exceptionally conversant with the operations of the dairy industry to frame them without any help from those concerned in it. It is quite evident that Messsrs. Osborne, Meares, and others have had some say in the framing of these regulations. It is quite right that an officer of the Government should consult those most . vitally interested in framing regulations dealing with their industry. At the same time, the butter producers do not 'form the whole of the community. The consumers form the greater portion of the community, and they are the best customers for the producers. I am sure that if the latter were allowed to express an Meares, opinion they would vote solidly to allow the consumers to be represented on the Butter Committee. These are times of , suspicion, and prices are soaring. We ought to do something to allay that suspicion, and no better method can be adopted than by appointing representatives of the consumers to the Committee controlling the butter industry. If Ministers do not accept the reasonable request put forward"" today, they will stand condemned in the eyes of the general public. .",43

The English price is very high, seeing that a few years ago 120s. a cwt. on the English market was regarded as a golden price for butter. The dairymen participate in the enhanced price obtained in England, and there might be a tendency on the part of the Committee, which represents only the producers, to export more butter and make the commodity scarce on' the local market. A representative of the consumers on the Committee could act as a policeman to watch their interests if any such attempt was made.",45

He knows the quality of butter and what its price should be; he is there as a representative of the Government, and supposedly as a representative of the consumers, and it is absurd that he should have no vote. Honourable members on the Government side who profess to represent the producers, and, I hope, the consumers as well, should be the first to agree to our proposal.

Many of us, including the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) know the trials and troubles of tliose who have to work on farms.",46
183,Mr GROOM,A NATIONAL SENATE,Does the honourable member suggest that the Butter Pool gives the producer too much?,46
184,Mr FENTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I am not saying so. The honourable member has answered his own question. There is seething discontent throughout the community, which is made more bitter simply because the consumers are given no say on the Boards and Pools which deal with their food supplies. Our request is absolutely just, and is, not put forward from a party standpoint. Why cannot the Government accede to it? I have shown that the producer is well represented on the Pool. I have given the names of its members, and I have said nothing against. their qualifications, but it is an absolutely lop-sided body. Even if our proposal is agreed to it will still be lop-sided, because out of eighteen men, sixteen of whom have votes, we are asking only for three representatives of the consumers.",46
185,Mr MAXWETX,A NATIONAL SENATE,It will be lop-sided still.,46
186,Mr FENTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Yes , but not to the same extent. The representatives of the consumers may have an opportunity to show, by quoting a division list, how they made a protest against the action of the majority.",46
187,Mr GROOM,A NATIONAL SENATE,Oaa i you show me any particular act of the Committee that has been detrimental to the interests of the consumers ?,46
188,Mr FENTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,Eve n if I could not that would be no argument against putting three representatives of the consumers on the Committee.,46
189,Mr GROOM,A NATIONAL SENATE,It would be an illuminating fact.,46
190,Mr FENTON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"It might be, but it is no argument against the representation of the consumers on the Pool. Not one of these bodies can be considered complete unless the consumers are represented on it. This Butter Committee will control the destination of the butter produced and the amount to be kept in cold storage for Australian consumers. They will decide, how many tons shall be shipped abroad to the order of the British Government or other persons, and how much butter shall be sent to China, Java, Japan, and other countries. I , therefore, contend that there should be representatives of the consumers upon the Committee.",46
191,Mr WEST,A NATIONAL SENATE,"East Sydney) [5.16] - My contribution to this debate will be very brief. I have risen chiefly to show that the action taken by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) meets with the approbation of more than one member of the party on this side. These Boards and Committees watch the interests of the primary producers of the country, and they have done it so well that the consumer has been bled to such an extent as to be shocked at the way in which the Government have dealt with him. Not long ago butter was selling at Is. 10^d. per lb. in Sydney, and yet, withini a month, two steamers left that port each with a cargo of 700 tons of butter.. In view of the high price of butter in the city, the people of Sydney could not understand how that could be, ,and no one could make tbem understand it. Ministers tell us that these Boards have nothing to do with fixing prices, but they are past masters in seeing that there is an insufficient supply of the various products under their control for local sumption, and when there is a scarcity of any product in the market its price must go up. All through the Government have shown too great a desire for the protection of vested interests whilst allowing the general community to suffer. When people connected with particular industries are placed on Boards controlling the products of those industries, it is only natural to assume that they will look after their own interests. Since the 17th May, 1917, the Government have, zealously guarded the interests of those whom they represent. They have missed no opportunity to serve them. This could not be in the interests of the general community. I have always believed that the primary producers should not be expected to endure the life which many of them have to live, and to cope with their misfortunes without reasonable emolument. It should not be forgotten, however,, that people engaged in businesses in the cities also have misfortunes to face. The Government, by their anxiety to consider the interests of those who assisted them at the last elections, have supplied the Opposition with good campaign material which will be available when next go before the country. They have been so persistent in the course they have followed that it is useless to expect them to adopt a different course now, as they probably will not consider it expedient at the eleventh hour to take up a different position. I endorse the action of ray Leader on this occasion; it will show that, however the Government may disregard the interests of the masses, honourable members on this side have not lost their sense of duty to the people as a whole. I venture to predict that when the next elections take place the Government will regret that they did not give consideration to the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition.",46
192,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Melbourne) [5.23] I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.'] It seems to me that today we have another evidence that this Parliament is in its dotage, and is not carrying on the business of the country as the majority of the people outside desire. con- It is well known, and at meetings and elsewhere, vehement expression is given to the belief, that the Government must accept the whole of the blame for appointing in charge of the Butter Pool eighteen men whose natural sympathies are on behalf of the interests they represent and against the interests of the consumer. The policy of Protection that is called for today is very different from that which was advocated in the past. The time was when the New Protection was sneered at by honourable members, many of whom have disappeared, and some of whom are behind the Government today. The New Protection policy was that the producer should be adequately protected by the assurance of fair prices; that the seller, the intermediary between the producer and the purchaser, should have a chance of making fair profits, and that the great mass of the people should also be protected by a price list. The adoption of that policy would prevent the profiteering that is rampant today. No honourable member on the oftier side can deny that the cost of living is unduly high. we In dealing with the question of butter, it should be remembered that the great market of. the dairymen and small farmers is to be found here in Australia. Fourfifths of the butter produced in this country is locally consumed. I remember that on oneoccasion a man of rugged speech and splendid eloquence, when ad- « vocating the protection of the interests of the community, was asked where the producers would find their markets. In reply, he placed his hand upon his stomach, and said, "" Here is one market, and I have seven little ones at home who will find seven other markets for the produce of the country."" The Government have nominated eighteen men to control this Pool, and not one of them is a representative of the consumers. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has suggested that three representatives of the consumers should be appointed to the Board. They would, if appointed, have only offlie-sevefflith of the voting power, and surely the representatives of the producers and sellers could have no objection to that. I have in my possession a book upon the Trusts of Australia. Some honourable members on the other side liave sneeringly asked, "" W h e r e arethe profiteers?"" They have only to go outside, and they will get their answer from the humblest girl who earns her living in a factory, if they ask her what she pays for her blouses or her stockings.",47
193,Mr WATKINS,A NATIONAL SENATE,What is the quality'!,48
194,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The rotten at the present time. Let honourable members opposite ask those heroines of human life, the mothers of families, who today have to make 30s. go as faras £ 1 went some time ago, where the profiteers are, and tliey will very quickly telf them. Some one has blamed the great wool-growers for the extortionate prices charged for tweeds and woollens a.t the present time. But the great wool kings, one of whom is present, will agree with another of them, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner)-, when he said that the man in the pastoral industry who could not succeed with a flat rate of. 15^d. per lb. for wool ought to get out of the industry. We know that when wool is sent to Europe, people have to pay for the d i r t that is in it . The wool kings affirm' that they are not responsible for the high prices of woollen goods. They receive a flat rate of Is.. 3£d. per lb. for their wool, which is, I think, a very fair price. But, obviously, such a rate does not explain the excessive cost of every article of woollen material that is in daily use. Manifestly a very considerable leakage must occur between the wool grower and the consumer. Why do not the Government fix prices for woollen goods which will be fair to the consumer ? By way of illustration, let me point to the position of those unfortunate returned soldiers who were .inveigled' into weaving what is familiarly known as ANZAC tweed. If any of those men received a pension on account of his war services, the amount of that pension was deducted from hi3 earnings at the tweed factory. Such a statement seems almost incredible,- but everybody knowsthat it is a fact. Thus, if a man were in receipt of a pension of 15s. per week,, he was allowed to earn only an additional 27s. per'week. Some timej ago the State W a r Council deemed it advisable toi withdraw from this tweed factory the gentleman who was in charge «of it. Thereupon the Repatriation Department took <»ver the factory, and sue-, ceeded in making a pretty muddle - of the whole business. All that these returned soldiers asked for the splendid handwoven tweed which they produced was 2s. per yard as it left the factory. But the Repatriation Department stepped in quality is and said, "" No. We will pay you that amount only after the cloth has been shrunk. n Now a yard of cloth off the loom will shrink, perhaps, to the extent of a quarter or a third . 1 The Department, therefore, was snipping from these returned soldiers - assumin g that the cloth sustained a shrinkage of 25 per cent - n o less than 6d. per yard. That is an instance of the contemptible meanness of which the Department is capable. It also permitted the Government Woollen Factory to supply yarn which was viler than shoddy.",48
195,The CHAIRMAN,A NATIONAL SENATE, I miust ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the amendment.,48
196,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"We are also assured that the meat kings are in no way responsible for the high prices of meat, and that those prices'are due to charges in curred between the time when the meat leavesthe hands of the producer and the period when it reaches the consumer. I havehere a very illuminating work nupon The. Trust Movement in Australia, by Mr H . L . Wilkinson, a scientific man, who is M.C.E. of the Melbourne University,. A . M . , . Institute of Civil Engineers, London, and who gained the Harbison and Higinbotham scholarship at the Melbourne University. He puts the case in such an admirable way that I would strongly recommend every honourable member to make a study of his book.",48
197,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,I bought a copy of that book. I gave7s. 6d. for it .,48
198,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,I am sure that the honourable member: never spent 7s. 6d. more wisely;,48
199,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I recommend every honourable member to buy, not to '(borrow, a copy of it .",48
200,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Mr Wilkinson, upon page 99 of his book, says The following paragraph appeared in the Melbourne Argus, a journal generally opposed tc any interference with private industry. The figures quoted clearly show the abnormal increase in the price of bread in Melbourne during the past six years. It will be seen that the price of flour has actually decreased 5 per cent., whilst bread has increased 50 per cent. Wages have certainly increased, perhaps, 20 per cent., but that probably represents less than an increase of 10 per cent, in the cost of production of bread. What an advance of £d. per 4-lb. loaf of bread actually means to the master bakers is shown in the following figures :"" It is estimated that an ordinary bakery nses about 5 tons of flour each week, a good many using 10 tons, and some of the largest manufacturers as much as 20 tons. From a sack of 150 lbs. about forty-nine large loaves of bread are made, and from a 200-lb. sack about sixty-five loaves. This is a moderate figure which can be taken as an average, though frequently sixty-six loaves are obtained. . . . "" It is a number of years since bread was. retailed at 7d. per 4-lb. loaf in the northern inner suburbs, and at that time flour was from £12 to £13 per ton. A comparison of the Victorian Mill Owners Association's quotation for flour, and the ruling price of bread, at the end of July for seven years past is given below : End of Flour July, (Per 200 lb.) (Per 4-lb. Loaf.) 1907 ... £9 5 0 :.. 51d. to 6d. 1908 ... £9 10 0 ... 5d. to 6d. 1909 ... £11 10 0 ... 5£d. to 6|cl. 1910 ... £9 10 0 ... 5id. to 6£d. 1911 ... £8 0 0 ... 5jd. to 6d. 1912 ... £9 5 0 ... 6jd. to 7d. 1913 ... £8 15 0 ... 7d.""",49
201,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,Who made the money?,49
202,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I can assure the honourable member that just as-I wish to see the wheat-farmers of Australia obtain 4s. per bushel at the station for their wheat, so I desire to give the dairy farmers of this country an adequate return for their labours. Ib seems to me that occasion the Government are adopting a dog-in-the-manger policy. has been suggested to them that out of a list of twenty-one names submitted for their consideration they should select only three representatives of the consumers. Yet they decline to accede to that suggestion. They themselves do not command a seven to one majority in this House, and surely they might exhibit some little generosity in this matter. If the Government agreed to enlarge the Committee by the appointment of representatives for the consumers, from eighteen to twenty-one, the consumers would then have only one in seven. ' In Victoria more than half the total population is grouped in Melbourne - and suburbs. It cannot be said that they produce the dairy products of - this country, but they are the consumers, and therefore should receive consideration. If we include the.population in the larger provincial towns, full y three-fourths of the population are, strictly speaking, consumers, but under these regulations they will be absolutely disfranchised from representation on the D a i r y Produce Pool Committee. I cannot understand this absence of the spirit of fair play on the part of honourable members opposite, because I am quite satisfied that in private business arrangements they would be will in g to grant fair representation to all interests.' And in this matter we are not asking for fair representation at all. We are only asking for some representation.  Bread state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.]",49
203,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"What I have said regarding butter applies equally to cheese production. Four-fifths of the total product of Victoria is consumed in Melbourne and suburbs and the larger towns, which, as I have already said, represent three-fourths of the population of the State, and as consumers these people are certainly entitled to representation. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) would be willin g to submit the names of nominees if the Government would be so magnanimous as to on this grant the consumers, though, three-fourths of the population, only one^seventh of the It representation.",49
204,Mr RODGERS,A NATIONAL SENATE,But in this case it is the producers' own commodity. That is the whole point of the argument.,49
205,Dr MALONEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I am appealing for the representation of the consumers. Not one honourable member on the other side has yet attempted to defend the Government proposal, which will disfranchise 75 per cent, of the people of Victoria, who are the consumers of these products.",49

It was then stated that the prices formerly fixed hy the wholesale merchants covered the cost of delivery to retail shopkeepers, but that the practice had been discontinued, so that the retailers have to make good the difference, and Mr Will liams was complaining about this matter before the Prices Commissioner. pointed out that the butter factories were making enormous profits ranging from 19 per cent, in the case of the Gippsland and Northern Company to 32 per cent, in the case of the Western District Company, and 91 per cent, in the case of the Victorian Butter Factories These figures, I remind honourable members, were presented by a man who is certainly not a supporter of the Labour party.",50
207,Mr FLEMING,A NATIONAL SENATE,A r e they co-operative concerns ?,50
208,Mr TUDOR,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I believe they are, but co-operative concerns have no more right than an individual trader to rob the consumer. No person or concern has a right to make such enormous profits at the expense of the people.",50
209,Mr FLEMING,A NATIONAL SENATE,"But in order to get the real profits allowance should be made for the capital cost of cattle, land, and equipment.",50
210,Mr TUDOR,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The honourable member may be satisfied that the producers are making a profit on stock and plant as well. Last week there was a prosecution in Adelaide in connection with the mixing of butter and margarine. report of the Court proceedings statedADELAIDE, Tuesday - In the Adelaide Police Court today the Murphy and MCCartney Proprietary Ltd., of Adelaide, were proceeded against on the charge of having on or about November 6 sold an article in'imitation of butter, which at the time of the sale was con tained in a package whereon was not placed the legitimate brand or mark indicating the nature of such compound. Francis J. Van Cant said in evidence that he had been in the employ of the defendants as manager of their margarine department. He had made a class of margarine known as butter substitute. When he first made one of these samples, Mr J. G-. Murphy saw it, tasted it, [417]- 2 - I de- and remarked, "" How would that margarine show when mixed with butter?"" Witness replied : "" It would stand 15 per cent, without chemical detection."" Later witness was called into the presence of Messrs. Murphy (2), Anderson, and MCCartney. That evening Mr Anderson and witness mixed 12 boxes-si x of butter and six of margarine. One day Mr J. 6. Murphy said to him : "" Two lots of the mixture have been held by the Customs. You had better take the blame for them if anything come out of it. I will give you £500 and a trip to Belgium if you do'so."" Witness : '.' No you don't. I have only made the margarine, but I did not sell it.'' He Under cross-examination by counsel for the defence, the witness said he was now engaged in the margarine business under the name of Belgian Margarine Company. Counsel - Did you get anything extra for doing work which you believed to be dishonest I Witness - I was paid £5 per week overtime. Counsel said Van Cant's evidence had taken him by surprise, and he was granted an adLimited. journment to consider the position. Another case of fraud which came before the Victorian Chief Justice was re* ported in the Age p i Saturday last. The Chief Justice (Sir Willia m Irvine) denounced the whole transaction in unmeasured terms. The producers, of course, were not the guilty parties, but the - consumers have been the sufferers. We have representatives of a dozen different butter districts in this Parliament. At one time. I knew these gentlemen in t imately, for while I was Minister for Customs they wore the carpet to my office at door almost bare, coming so often with their requests. We had the Vice-Chairman of the Butter Pool here today, but he will not speak. No honourable member opposite has yet advanced an argument against my amendment. All we have is the word of the Minister (Mr . Groom) that the Government will not agree to it , although', as the honourable The Argus member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has pointed out, the consumers of Australia take four-fifths of the total butter production. Surely they are entitled to representation on the Committee. Evi dently honourable members opposite think : they are not, so that apparently ends the matter. No doubt they will vote with the Government. They must not forget, however, that the day after tomorrow will surely come. Although they may be in a majority today, and, as was the experience thib afternoon, may gag honourable members on this side on grievance day, and will not say one word themselves on behalf of the consumers in connection with this Dairy Produce Pool, the numbers will not always be with them. Had a Butter Pool been formed when I was presiding at the Customs, and had 1 appointed eighteen representatives of the consumers, to the total exclusion of the producers and selling agents, there would have been an outcry from honourable mer.ibdrs opposite. Yet they refuse to grant consumers rany representation at all. Wo know, of course, why honourable member? are dumb. If those behind the Government say anything at all, they do not go further than this: "" The time is not ripe, but it might be well to consider giving umployees a greater share in the management of the business."" As for that latter project, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) introduced a proposal - last night, based upon a system of profit-sharing, and every honourable member except one on the Ministerial side voted against the proposal. We hold that there should be srifficient butter retained in Australia to keep the price normal; but no honourable member oppposite will say anything. The Minister, no doubt, sends round word by his W h i p - "" Shut up ! Leave this to the Minister. My back is broad enough to carry it all. I will bringmy legal skill to bear, and will tell them that the consumer is not entitled to representation."" We are merely asking that three among the 21 representatives appointed shall directly represent the consumers. H a d we asked for equal numbers, my request would not have been unreasonable.

Most of the pastoralists and graziers live in the city, while their stations are looked after by managers, rouseabouts, and other station hands; and this Government interference is on behalf of those who conduct these activities. If the Government accept the amendment, and allow representatives to be nominated by the employees, they will be giving a practical demonstration of their belief in the W h it ley report. Rather than discuss the question which occupied us last night, - we should take the present opportunity to see that the wool-top operative is represented on the Wool Poo! as one of the producers, so that his rights may be ascertained and recognised in regard to any profits that may accrue. If the Government force the amendment to a division, they will show that they are not prepared to give this section of the community a right to which they are entitled, and the blame will rest with them.

The argument I have used seems to me to be unanswerable. Many people have spent anything from £300 to £1,000 on plant, with which they have been able to make a living hitherto, but of this they axe now deprived by the Committee's reguSpence, w. G. lation prohibiting them from buying more than £ 1 0 worth of wool at a time. As there are several other points on which we should like an expression of opinion I simply submit the amendment., NOBS. Mr LYNCH (Werriwa) [7.58] -^As one of the first members to voice the grievances of country wool-buyers in connection with the administration of the Central Wool Committee, I think the amendment has much to recommend it . We quite recognise that that Committee PAIRS. is doing good work, and that it has introduced a scientific system of classification sadly lacking i i i the marketing of our clips before the purchases by the British Government. But there are "" spots on the sun,"" and there are very serious spots on the administration of the Committee. Their policy in regard to country wool merchants shows that they subscribe only to the principle of centralization. We vainly strove to save country wool busi- I nesses that had' been built up, some of them by strenuous effort for over f if t y to years, but we found that the laws of the bond Committee, like those of the Medes and We had purmany deputations, but our efforts were We have endeavoured to get from the Committee a pTOO.f of the for closing up . country wool businesses, or restricting legitimate buying by people who. were a great aid to the struggling small settler during long i th years. We showed in vain that by the wool of the small growers being brought together in a central warehouse by count r y merchants, and there being classified of and marketed in the bulk, the working of the., scheme would hft b.en.efited. seemedthat oply the.interests.of the great; wppl-brokers of, the cities were thought: worthy, of conserving. grpw,er is cqmpellecj to market his wqql, in, small quantities. A , charge is then ""^ftflft against the wool for its. classification before it is,put on. the. floor for-apt-; praiseinept, and it is subjeqt, to commis sion at the higher ra,tes. That would, have, been avoided if the wool had been sol$ to country, buyers, because they would. have, put it arrto larger quantities, and commission, would have been paid at. the lower, rates. The real advantage of. the o\d. system, was that the small grower, was. a^e to sell his wool direct to the country rrj,erchnnts. and get ready money when, he needed it . Under the present arrangement he must send in only small quantities of wool, as the country, buyers canuO t. acquire lojbs of a greater value than (£%0. There is no legitimate reason why that anomaly should continue, or why the small shops should be closed up, or why the small buyer who went about the country with a horse and waggonette, and served in a useful capacity the struggling "" cockie "" should be knocked on the head, in order to further the policy of constantly greasing the f at pig. I trust that the amendment, which will express some measure of justice to small buyers and growers, will be carried.  honourable member for Werriwa has made out a very good case for the middleman. During the last five weeks I have heard the middleman flogged by honourable members on both sides of the Blouse. He deserved all he. got.",54

As I was saying, I was very much, impressed by the arguments of the young and vigorous representative of Maranoa, who has had such ripe experience of pastoral matters, but when I heard the vivacious and practical cockie from Werriwa (Mr Lynch) I was entirely overborne' by the logic of his practical mind in analyzing - the real import of the amendment. The honourable member was the real upholder of the true Labour principle in what he said, and for once in his life my exuberant friend from Maranoa was throwing in his in fluence with the reactionaries. - quite clear that what is intended to the' accomplished by the amendment is that small growers of wool throughout the country may be enabled to deal directly and in a convenient manner with small buyers of wool, who can go to their very doors for small consignments and enable a swift and practical deal to be made. The present position gives an undue power and influence",56
236,Mr BILEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,And monopoly,57
237,Mr BRENNAN,A NATIONAL SENATE,"And monopoly-to those very large concerns whose ramifications the Labour party is desirous of curtailing. Being a practical farmer of many years' standing, and for years taken an interest the propaganda . for . the conservation of farmers' rights and interests, I am quite prepared to lend my. wholehearted support to the amendment. It is in harmony with the policy of the Labour party to protect the small farmer against the depredations of those large combinations of capital which' from time immemorial have sought to oppress him. I am unconvinced by the argument of my friend from Maranoa, and although a loyal supporter of his in every division in which I have voted in this chamber, except one, I feel that I must, altogether forgetful of party ties, cross the floor and vote in fraternal sympathy with the honourable member for Werriwa.",57
238,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Grampians) fS-20] The arguments which seem to have converted my honourable and learned friend (Mr Brennan) to support the amendment are such as, if he gave them a little further consideration, would make him more antagonistic to it than he is now favourable to it . He has spoken as if the amendment were intended to deprive rich and wealthy combines of a small portion of the power which they possess, or to take away from them some emoluments they may derive from the handling of the clips of small wool-growers. Many honourable members are evidently under the impression that when small country wool merchants buy wool from small growers, they, in some way, prevent it from being passed through the great wool warehouses owned by big firms. If that were the case I could well underI t is stand the attitude taken up by several honourable members who are supporting the amendment. Therefore, it is necessary that I should explain the position. Under ordinary conditions the great bulk of the wool grown in Australia is consigned direct to the wool-selling brokers who handle it , and in whose warehouses it is appraised. If , instead of this wool being sent direct to the big brokers, a considerable portion of it is bought by country wool merchants, it simply means supporting an absolutely different set of middlemen, because every bale of wool bought by these country wool merchants has still to be appraised in the having wool-selling brokers' warehouses in in exactly the same manner as if the wool were consigned direct to the wool-selling - brokers by the growers.",57
239,Mr LYNCH,A NATIONAL SENATE,"A 'man who sends in three or four bales is charged 2^ per cent, commission, whereas if a dozen small lots are put into one, making a big consignment, the charge is only 1^ per cent. Mr JOWtETT - That is the case; but there seems to be a misconception upon - that point. Under the present system of appraisement, the consignment of the man with 10.0 sheep is appraised to the fullest extent, according to its intrinsic value, just as if the lot represented the wool off 10,000 sheep. Before this system came into operation, there was great need for small country wool merchants, because in the big warehouses small lots of wool were described as star lots, and were sold under totally different conditions from those attaching to the sale of larger lots. It has been a matter for reproach for many years past that, owing to the great power- I think too great powerexercised by the wool buyers in the wool markets of Australia, particularly in Sydney and Brisbane, small lots of wool had to be sold at different times, and in a different auction-room from the big lots. In .Sydney and Brisbane, the buyers would not even allow the small lots to be shown in the same part of the warehouses as the big lots. That state of affairs continued until the Central Wool Committee took charge. In those days, the small wool-grower seldom got the f u ll intrinsic value of his wool; but, from the moment the operations .of the Central Wool Committee commenced, exactly the same method of appraisement was applied to the smallest wool-grower in Australia a3 applied to the largest grower, and"" the small man got the full value of his wool, just as if he had consigned the wool off 10,000 or 100,000 sheep.",57
240,Mr HIGGS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Who prevented the small grower from getting the full value, unless it was those big combinations which would be affected by the amendment?",58
241,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The wool buyers did. The wool buyers of Sydney used to go to Brisbane and dominate the trade there also. In fact, they told the wool brokers that they would not buy in their auction, rooms unless all the small lots of wool were relegated to a different auction room and a different part of the warehouse. Under that system the small grower seldom got the full value of his wool, and it was quite natural that there should come into existence a large number of country wool merchants, who bought up small lots of wool, sorted them, and put them into bigger lots for consignment to the metropolitan wool brokers. As the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) has said, the small wool-grower does suffer a disadvantage at the present moment, owing to the continuance of one of. the customs of the trade which might, perhaps, have been altered. Many trade customs have remained untouched, (because the scheme has always been regarded as a temporary one. The grower of wool who forwards a lot valued at less than £200 pays a higher rate of commission than is paid by the man who consigns a larger quantity. I would be very glad if that charge could be altered.",58
242,Mr LYNCH,A NATIONAL SENATE,Is not the small grower charged ^d. per lb. for classification?,58
243,Mr RICHARD EOSTBR,A NATIONAL SENATE,"He pays it in some States, but it pays him handsomely to do so.",58
244,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Some charge may be made when wool has to be resorted, in order to make it fit for appraisement. Although the small wool grower may now be at some disadvantage in having to pay a slightly higher rate of commission, what would he be obliged to pay to the country wool merchant to enable that gentleman to get his profit? It must be remembered that this merchant has to send the wool he purchases to be appraised, and has' also to pay commission, and is thus' compelled to get his profit in between the grower and the Central Wool Committee. 'The small grower would probably pay to the country wool merchant very much more than he would pay in the commission referred to by the honourable member for Werriwa. When a grower sends to Melbourne or Sydney, he has his wool appraised at a fixed flat rate; but if he sells to a country merchant, he never knows whether he is getting the ful l value for his .wool. The country merchant knows much moTe - about the value of wool than does the small wool-grower.",58
245,Mr LECKIE,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Indi) [8.29] - Appa rently the middleman is an obnoxious character if he is a small man, but is a very excellent fellow if he is a big man. Also it would appear that the small ""cockie"" is an infernal fool; that, after all these years, he is quite ignorant of the fact that he has been using a public convenience to get rid of his small lots of wool at a loss to himself. Small wool buyers visit every country district. After every shearing there are a number of stragglers with a few bales of wool.",58

The Government madeNOES. an' arrangement' regarding the control of the sugar supplies of the Commonwealthduringthe war-,- but the agreement with* the Colonial Sugar' Refining' Company might-well be reconsidered now to-the advantage of the people of Australia'. I circulated an amendment to provide that r whatever rebates were allowed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to its: agents should also be allowed to all othersdealing in sugar, but unfortunately the amendment was not' reached during trie! Committee stage. The u n for t u nate result of the existing' arrangePAIR. ment is that the Colonial Sugar Refining 1 Company practically dominatesthe wholepositioniit amuch more severe way than ever' it did before', although during the! whole''history of the industryi t has effecpertually' dominated thesituation. Under the agreement, the company receives £1 13s . lOdl per ton for shii>ping charges 1 on raw sugar,- harbour dues, exchange, insurance, sacks, - landing, and' w h a r f age. I i i also' gefe £ 1 15s. 2'd. per ton; for, refining' charges', and 7s. per ton for selling charges. It receives, in addition,. . £1"" per ton, andthereis nothing to show that charge is for . If can only be meant to cover some equivalent for' tliefact that the company' 'surrendered its profits during the' progress of tliewar, and' operated only under the direction of the Government. Even at this-juncture the operations of the'company miglltf well be the subject of very elbse inquiry,, because the whoreof/Aiisflralia-is under its> - and. domination. The Australian people must willbuy sugar'practically at the price the com'-' 1 pany stipulates; OB' db without it if thecompany sochooses. It is true that the people are getting sugar at Sid. per lb., owing to the control by the Commonwealth over the industry. That control ends very soon, and there is no evidence of anintention on .the part of the Government tosubstitute any other system of control. Although the company wasable to supply, and did supply u n t i l recently, A l quality sugar at 3 i d . per lb., according to the agreement, honourable members now see everywhere, on the tables in their own home3, in the dining room of Parliament House, and in the restaurants in the city, brown sugar that ought to be sold for at least i d . to I d . less per lb. retail, and yet the full price is being charged for it . The price which was originally meant to be imposed as the maximum has now become the minimum for ordinary household purposes. This is evidently and obviously an .underhand method, adopted with the connivance and knowledge of the Government, of supplying the public under the agreement made by the Commonwealth with an inferior article at the highest price allowed.",59
249,Mr BOYD,A NATIONAL SENATE,Is that how Governments are going to run socialistic schemes-by robbing the people?,60
250,Mr FINLAYSOJST,A NATIONAL SENATE,"That is evidently the idea which the present Government curtly have of running a socialistic scheme, and it is because I consider that idea wrong that I am raising the question now. is not a new question. The Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes), in 1911, drew pointed attention to the position, of Colonial Sugar Refining Company in a ford. He saysstatement, in which he saidThe Colonial Sugar Refining Company has a practical monopoly of the sugar industry in this country. It is the distributor of fined sugar; all consumers of sugar, rich popr, great and small, must buy their sugar from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company or go without. Efforts to get sugar elsewhere are put down with an iron hand, as the Austies tralian Jam Factory found to year, when, for attempting to deal elsewhere, they were met with a demand that all their foreign-grown sugar should be drawn from Colonial Sugar Refining Company, they would, be fined £2,000 by an increase in price o,n the remainder of their requirements of Australian-grown sugar. That, was not a single instance; either. Mr ""WATKINS - That was "" direct action.""",60
251,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"It was ""direct action "" of the worse kind. I have here areport of an interview with Mr MCPherson Robertson, the well knowTi confectioner of this city, which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of 30th June, 1910: Speaking to a representative of the newspaper on'the subject of the price charged to manufacturers for sugar, he pointedout how u n fair ly the company treated its own customers. He - saidThey treat us in the most autocratic way. Up till Inst year they demanded cash within fourteen days. No pay within fourteen days, no more sugar. Then suddenly they reduced the term to seven days. I can pay for sugar in any way that is demanded, but I do not Like to be treated too dictatorially. The price went up at the end of last year. The company ascertained then that I had a few tons of sugar in stock, and tliey actually charged me the increased price on my own sugar that I had paid for. We are helpless. They are masters of the situation. They send me a contract, and I return it, simply saying, "" I have no alternative but to accept your contract in detail."" It was suggested that that wa3 a complete surrender, and Mr MCPherson Robertson went on to say- . It is most complete. We have always before had yearly contracts. This time they intimate that the contracts are current only till next October, with the intention, I suppose, of further raising prices. This A Royal Commission was appointed in - 3:912 to inquire into the sugar industry, very and I quote the following from a the minority report signed by Senator CrawMost of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's sugar is sold to wholesale firms, to which discountsare allowed, according' to the quantity purchased and the time within which repayment is made. The wholesale distributors, and in turn, allow their customers similar, but smaller,, discounts owing to the lesser quantities purchased. All deliveries are made direct from the refineries, and only in such quantias are necessary to meet purchasers' curits cost this rent requirements. Senator Crawford, expressing an the opinion as to the reason for doing busiotherwise ' ness in this way, saysIn this way speculation is checked, and allpossibility of a ""corner"" in sugar prevented: The company is enabled to maintain supplies: for all. its customers, keep its refineries and' employees working throughout the year, and give its Australian suppliers of raw sugar the full benefit of any increase in market values which may arise. That may be so, but it also has this effect, that when any of the manufacturers or merchants of this country try to buy i m ported sugar at a cheaper rate, paying the duty imposed by the Commonwealth, which is the only limitation upon the in troduction of foreign-grown sugar, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company steps in, and says, "" If you buy any foreign sugar, we will refuse to supply you with any Australian-grown sugar."" The Company lays down the law to the distributors ©f this country, and says that, in no circumstances, shall they buy sugar from any one but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",60
252,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,"That is what all Trusts do. Mr FIN'LAYiSON - Of course; that is one of the methods of the Trust. The position is that 'the whole of the sugar industry is practically within ambit of this one company. are plenty of sugar-growers, though, unfortunately, many of them are under the control of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. There arc quite a number of crushing mills that are not directly under the control of the company. But there are only two refining, companies in Australia-the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Millaqui n is Sugar Refining Company. The latter is a very small affair, comparatively, but these two have"" the only plants whole reason. available in Australia for the refining of sugar. I do not know that that would be is. a serious disadvantage if some encouragement were given by the Government to millers to turn out an improved milled sugar. It is not necessary that we should have refined sugar. Except that it is fashion to prefer a white sugar, Ave might, possibly with better results, use a brown or grey sugar. But here we are, through the operations of the Colonial the shortage. Sugar Refining Company, with its capital available, the use it makes of the Customs Tariff, and the strangle-hold it . has upon the merchants and distributors of this country, compelled to accept its dictation without any apparent means of redress. The amendment I hoped to be able to submit on this question would have worked out in this way: that not only should those people whom the Colonial Sugar Refining Company select be allowed to distribute sugar, and, therefore, be allowed to obtain a rebate, but - at the will of the Government any merchant dealing in sugar might be at liberty to claim, the rebate and secure a supply of sugar for distribution. The agreement which the Government are operating with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company not only continues, but strengthens the hold of the company upon distributors of sugar.",61
253,Mr BAMFORD,A NATIONAL SENATE,To what rebate does the honourable member refer?,61
254,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The discount rebate given by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to large distributors. I am not now referring to retailers, who have a case of their own, and'a very good case. I do not think that the retailers are being fairly treated under the agreement. They the are compelled to sell sugar at a cerThere tain price. Probably, that is the explanation of the fact that householders are now getting an inferior sugar aud having lo pay for it the high price which has been fixed.",61
255,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,A NATIONAL SENATE,Does the honourable member refer to the brown sugar ?,61
256,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,Yes .,61
257,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The reason that supplied is that there is no white sugar available, because of the strike.",61
258,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,That is not the,61
259,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,A NATIONAL SENATE,I know that it,61
260,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"He r e we are in Australiaat present faced with a shortage of sugar. There is not enough Australian sugar available this season to meet the our own requirements to the extent of anything from 80,000 to 100,000 tons, lightand the Government have arranged for the importation of sugar to make good",61
261,Mr CORSER,A NATIONAL SENATE,A certain quantity was brought over from the previous season.,61
262,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"That is so; but,' unfortunately, there is still a serious shortage. There are many explanations, but they have nothing to do with my argument. The point is, that the Government are importing anything from 80,000 to 100,000 tons to make up the shortage of locally-grown sugar, and the whole of that imported sugar will be distributed through the agency of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and only the chosen representatives of that company will be given the opportunity to distribute it .",61
263,Mr BAMFORD,A NATIONAL SENATE,How does the honourable member suggest that it should be distributed ?,62
264,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Why should not the Government permit supplies of that imported sugar to be available to any merchant in Australia dealing in this commodity, and on the same terms as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company allows to the merchants distributing for it?",62
265,Mr BAMFORD,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The honourable member suggests that the Government should themselves become distributors? - Mr FINLAYSON"" - Certainly ; or, as an alternative which might be more easily given effect, they should insist-that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company shall not discriminate in the distribution of the imported sugar. The difficulty is that the company exercises suchi a discrimination that it holds a threat of a very serious kind-that of interference with business and the service of the community-ove r these men, who would otherwise be in clined, particularly in existing circumstances, to exercise some independent action, and make some effort to supply the requirements of the country in sugar.",62
266,Mr CORSER,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Does the honourable member not know that all this is done on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, and under their instructions?",62
267,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,Yes ; that is what I am complaining of.,62
268,Mr CORSER,A NATIONAL SENATE,It is not for the benefit of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,62
269,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,Who gets the discount that is not given to the small merchant?,62
270,Mr CORSER,A NATIONAL SENATE,Everythin g goes to the Government. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is paid a fixed sum for its services.,62
271,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I have already pointed out that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company gets so much a ton for refining, 7s. per ton for distributing charges, and £ 1 per ton for services not specified.",62
272,Mr CORSER,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Oh , yes; they are clearly specified.",62
273,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,I cannot find that they are. What is the £ 1 per ton paid for?,62
274,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Are we to understand that the Commonwealth - Government discriminate between large and small merchants, and charge the small merchants more than they charge the large merchants ?",62
275,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"No , the Commonwealth Government makes no discrimination, but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company does.",62
276,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,A NATIONAL SENATE,On behalf of the Government.,62
277,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,"The Colonial Sugar Refining Company act under the authority and control of the Government, and my complaint, therefore, is against the Government, and not against the company. The past records of the company go to show that it has exercised a very severe discrimination. The Government have simply said to the managers of the company, "" You take charge of the distribution of sugar,"" and the company has continued its previous methods. It is able to do that, because it has had unlimited control without any Government supervision. I say that the Government are now responsible because they have authorized the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to distribute sugar under the agreement. I contend that the Government should intervene on behalf of the people, and see that every merchant dealing in this commodity shall be given an equal opportunity with those favoured by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",62
278,Mr CORSER,A NATIONAL SENATE,Is the discount not based on the quantity purchased?,62
279,Mr JOWETT,A NATIONAL SENATE,Why should it be? Why should not the small merchant get the same terms as the big one?,62
280,Mr FINLAYSON,A NATIONAL SENATE,The honourable member for Hunter informs me that the Minister for Trade and Customs has stated that he has agreed to something in the direction I recommend.,62

I am not complaining very much of the ingForexpenses company as such. I have, on previous 'from occasions, pointed out what grip it has on the country, and the effect of the operations of such a monopoly on the consumers. B ut to-night my complaint is against the Government, which is conrebate, trolling the company under an agreement. To-day the ccmpanj' is, to all in tents and purposes, a Government Deor partment, and I say that the Government are not .giving a fair deal .either to the of wholesale merchants, the retailers, or the o r consumers. It is unfortunate that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), who controls this particular Department, is not in his place tonight, but the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) knows the anybody, and he is perfectly aware that the public are not being protected in the way It started that they ought ""to be. It is no reply to my argument to say that we are .getting cheaper sugar in Australia than is any other .country in the world. That circumstance, gratifying as it is, is entirely due to. our fortuitous position. It is absot is lutely due to the fact that we are a of sugar-producing country, and are pro- tected by distance and the cost of carf o lriage. It is surely right for the Government to put all distributors upon the same level, and to give to the public the as very best that is within their power.",64
297,Mr CORSER,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Wide Bay) [9.8] Evidently the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) is labouring under a misapprehension. The last agreement .. 625.000 made with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is dated 31st January of the present year. Amongst other things it providesThe company shall be paid by the Government in respect of all raw sugar shipped by it to the refineries, a shipping charge of 32s. £6:000,000 l i d . per ton of sugar, and such charge shall marine insurance dues, exsacks, landing charges, and wharfage. . . .

The actual cost of such packages shall be as ascertained from the books of the company, and shall be a separate allowance chargeable by the company to the Government. The Government have handed the control of sugar, on the basis of these fixed payments, to the Sugar Refining Company. The latter has very short of sugar today. entered into a business transaction the Government in which every portion of the management has been decided including the means of distribution. company is compelled to supply the necesthousands' sary quantity of sugar for the ments of the public of Australia. Jess many honourable members know on 26th June, 1918, it was that the Government had a representing six months' supply of sugar. When it entered into this last it had six months' surplus hand, and it had to deal with that plus, and also - with the sugar which would be grown ""within the following two years. But when the year closed, it was found that the surplus was not as large as anticipated. The surplus did not represent cent, for prompt cash. a suppiy of six months, because the factories throughout Australia had many large orders to execute that, consestorage, quently the demand which they upon the company for sugar had been greater than was ever expected. company had a considerable hand, and that surplus would not have been reduced much had the seasons come up to anticipations. But last owing to frost, the drought, cyclone-the harvest was smaller was expected, and that reduced the quantity on hand very considerably, result that the Colonial Sugar Company advised the Government it would be necessary to purchase sugar overseas. It has purchased cient sugar, it is thought, it to tide over until next crop is available. When the ment entered into the with the Colonial Sugar Refining pany, under which the latter had to maintain ""supplies sufficient to meet requirements of the Commonwealth, Mr Corser. was obviously not just that anybody else should be permitted to step in and disorganize its arrangements. Hence it took over the full control of sugar in the Commonwealth. Having purchased from the Queensland Government, it also bought in Java all the sugar that it thought was reover quired to make up the deficiency. If the Commonwealth had not had the company Colonial to act as its agents, we might have been It would with have cost £51 a ton to bring sugar into Australia. upon, The Mr BOYD - There would have been of tons brought in at £20 a requireton.

The question of co-operative companies buying largely, and getting the same terms as the wholesale merchants has also been raised; and I remind honourable members that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) has intimated that an arrangement has been made under which cooperative dealers may buy on exactly the same terms as the wholesale merchants.",66

Of course, we know that the legal gentlemen have said it is within the competence of this Parliament to deal with the matters mentioned in this Bill. We do not know, however, whether or not they were asked if it would be within the competence of Parliament to pass legislation dealing with these matters for a greater length of time, or in respect of other commodities - I regret that the Government did not see fit to put this position before their legal advisers, particularly in view of the fact that prices are continually going up; and II say that if this Parliament does not grapple with the problem, it will he handled by the' States.

I object the third reading of the Bill, because does not contain an amendment providing that the port of Rockhampton shall a centre for the appraisement and sale wool. The honourable member for Gramof pians (Mr Jowett), who is a member the Central Wool Committee, will recolwould lect that we endeavoured last year to have Rockhampton made a wool appraising Australia centre. Wte failed, but I believe that i Government had not applied the guillotine to this measure, we might have induced a majority of the Committee to support an amendment, 'making Rockhampton and the port of Newcastle wool appraisnecessary ing centres. Honourable members will agree that we ought to avoid anything in the nature centralization. If Australia is to advance wool-growers-thos and expand as it ought to do, and if industries are to develop as we hope they will, we must try to create new centres activity. Rockhampton is the central port of Queensland. It is the chief city in the Central District of that State. Queensland might very well be divided into three States. If that were done, then Central Queensland, covering an area of about 200,000 square miles, would make a very fine State, possessing geographical and climatic features different from those of other parts of Queensland. I dare 60 per cent, of the wool grown in Queensland comes from the Central District, and is sent down to Rockhampton. I We are entitled to have wool appraised at that centre. I object, therefore, to the reading of the Bill passing in this way, since we have not had an opportunity discuss this very importantquestion.",69
336,Mr RODGERS,A NATIONAL SENATE,All pooling systems repractically compel centralization. That is why we wish to get rid of the Pools as,69
337,Mr HIGGS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I am aware that the honourable member has taken a stand in of reasonable employment being to given to the smaller men. Some men hope to see the millennium, and I at one time that it would be reached in my the time. Although I know that society will to evolve in such a way that a great deal of in unnecessary work now done will be to avoided, and the people so engaged found it employment in the general scheme of a millennium, we are as yet, perhaps, a long be way from that happy time. I am not too of anxious to see the whole of the business Australia concentrated within the conof trol of a few Pools. I do not think it be a good thing for the country, nor do I think it is in the interests of that the wool industry should be f the managed and controlled by a few people. It may suit the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) and other big pastoralists to have certain large firms operating these Pools, and it may appear to some people that we should crush out the small country wool buyer in order, as they say, to do away with of middlemen. But we must not forget that e who breed sheep and her raise flocks and herds-ar e not the only producers in the industry. Henry George, of a political economist whose opinions were at one time very much favoured by many that members of the present House, has urged the distributer is also to a certain extent a producer. The man who distributes goods over the counter may be held to be a producer.",69
338,Mr WEST,A NATIONAL SENATE,We cannot do without him.,69
339,Mr HIGGS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"We cannot. I also object to the third reading of the Bill, say because the Central Wool Committee have cut out the small country buyers of wool. The small wool-growers would not be disadvantaged in the slightest degree if small country wool buyers were allowed to operate; they would still be able to send their wool direct to the big operators if tliey preferred to do so. Small country buyers would be of service to the small wool-grower, or "" cockie farmer "" as he is known. The "" cockie fanners "" could please themselves whether they sold their wool to them or sent it direct to the great operators who are managing the industry. I object to this motion, because I think there should have been afforded us an opportunity to consider an amendment, of which notice was given, providing thatAfter the State Committee has ascertained that all local fellmongers have been supplied, any surplus skins may be sold, but shall be sold only to or through or with the consent of the Commonwealth Government. A number of other ' amendments might' have been made if the Government had not applied the guillotine. The institution of Parliament is being brought into disrepute, not, as the honororable member for Hindmarsh (Mr .

I hope his ' Rockhampton constituents will remember that the honourable member spent nearly two days over some impossible amendments about the A u d itor-General, and occupied so much time in that way that now he has lost his opportunity to move an amendment for their benefit.

All these axe purely boards of management; and it is absurd, in the circumstances, to engraft the W h i tley report on the measure. I merely desire to point out the political methods of my honourable friends Opposite in their desire to put the party on this side in a false position.

355,Mr WATKINS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"At a cost of something like 2s. 6d. per bale. Thousands of pounds were spent in building stores round the .port of Sydney for this wdol, while suitable buildings were standing empty at Newcastle. We are prevented from having a discussion on this amendment; but if out friends opposite are seriously inclined to consider the producers of wool, it is not too late now to providb appraisement centres as required. There is not now the - excuse there might have been during the war period for bringing the wool 'to as few centres as possible, in. order to use the shipping to the fullest advantage. So long as.the snipping coin-, panies which carry wool, or; anything elsei a-re. allowed to use the Government railways - to> getgoods taken to one common centre, they will not avail themselves of other ports. This centralization ]iolicy has been the curse of the country from the beginning of Australian constitutional government. In New South Wales the railways all'converge on one port, and the same remark may be made of Victoria. It is time that this, or some other Government, did what is possible to prevent this centralization. ask the Minister to consult the Central Wool Committee, with a view to having wool appraised at-the natural port of the district in which it is grown. LJ - Qolonel ABBOTT (New England) [1Q..5]:-We must recognise that, under, present circumstances, a . Bill such as that, before the Committee is necessary. It is impossible to pass from a state of war to a state of peace by a mere wave of the han.d. I do not believei n price-fixing, ordinarily, but our primary industries are of such magnitude and. ramifications that it is. necessary, at the present time, to have some sort 'of governmental control and - organization, in order to prevent their future being jeopardized. Although there have been certain shortcomings in connection with the management of the Wool Pool, yet, when viewed broadly, it must be recognised that its creation was one of the finest things ever done for Australia. Had we not had this control of the wool industry, and the contract with, the Brutish Government, would - have been in a difficult position-, .and - would have had ' a much greater problem to solve in regard to the payment of our war bill. necessary that we should know what is. to happen to the wool-producing in dustry in the twelve months following the ratification of peace. According:to a report published today from the Central Wool Committee-The quantity of appraised wool now-in the Commonwealth awaiting - shipment - overseas - is12X.266 ibales of the season 1917-18, and 1,211,427 bales of the season 1018-10, or a totalof 1,338,093 ibales, representing a value of, approximately £28,772.027-. carj-.y-ovcron 30,th June,- 1920; of appraised wooll for* shipment be considerable-and ' there? is a probability of this being the .case-it will constitute a serious menace to the resumption of auction sales during the first season following the - termination of the control .period. Honourable members can realise what the difficulty will . be in regard to finding:a market and shipping - our wool overseas- immediately the agreement with the British Government ceases.",71
356,Mr WATKINS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Is that a reason why the honourable member should penalize his constituents to the extent of 2s. 6d. per I bale by concentrating all the appraisement work in Sydney? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT --If I had m y way, there would be several appraisement, towns in my electorate. The report oifthe-Central Wool Committee continuesAnd the Comimi.ttce warns wool-growers of., the-position that .is likely to arise in market-, ing the Australian clip for the season 1920-21 iii the event of a large carry-over of Imperial Government woplS.. Therefore, the continuance of the Wool Pool is absolutely necessary. But there are some things in regard to the control by the Central Committee to which I : take strong exception. There is i u the policy of the Committee too much centralization. Wle talk every day about decentralization; but the power given to the Central Wool Committee is adding to the. evil of centralization. That body has been able to knock out every small wool buyer in the country. In many, little* towns throughout Australia, and particularly in my electorate, there were wool scourers and tanners, and persons who Australia were engaged in buying in small parcels""and classifying - and dealing with wool I«could enumerate half-a-dozen towns in my electorate in which a considerableI t is amount of ready money was earned and spent in connection with wool transactions. Buyers - with vans travelled thedistrict, and bought the single bales from , the "" cockies,"" and picked up odd linesof beeswax, horschair, hides and sheeprskins. That wool was. brought into* a town , where there was a small, scouring plant,' whichi provided employ-ment .for-- a certain number of men:There --was also ai tannery: . But a regu-d Should the lation issued by the Central Wool - Com-' militee limitedthe operations of these*small buyers of wool to lots not exceeding £10 in value.",72
357,Mr FLEMING,A NATIONAL SENATE,"And we have not been told why it is necessary to do that. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I can say why it is unnecessary to do it . Under the present system, if I have f l ' 5 worth of wool for sale in the country, 1 must ship it to Sydney or Melbourne. If that wool had been classed in the country, scoured, bulked with other wool, and made into a decent sample, it would have been carried ou the railway at truck rates when it was sent to Sydney. the Central Wool Committee is paying ordinary bag rates for unscoured wool, 75 per cent, of which, in some cases, is filth. The effect of that policy is to take money out of the pocket of the small "" cockie "" farmer. We are continually advising the Government to put men on the land. A great many people have an idea that farming and grazing is the only industry in which a man does not require knowledge and experience. What is the greatest cause of centralization today? When country boys and girls leave school, the only place in which they can find employment is the ordinary general store. It is necessary for boys or girls with any ambition to go to the city to get further ahead. If , on the other hand, industries are established in country towns in which technical training is required they will remain in the country, and not flock to the cities.. Fully 75 per cent, of the money received in country stores goes back to the city. In a little town of '5,000 ' people, with which I am acquainted, there are thirty or for t y men employed in a boot factory. That industry is doing more for decentralization than all the rest of the establishments in the town, because it serves to keep the young people from the city and finds them local employment. Every time the Central Wool Committee shuts down a country industry it is adding to that great curse of this country-centralization . We must give encouragement to our boys and girls to remain in country districts, but we can only do this by providing work for them there. The action of the Central Wool Committee has the opposite tendency. The work of woolscouring and tanning is being centralized in the cities where the wool is appraised, adding to the employment there, and depriving country towns of industries which could very properly be carried on in them. I have not the time nor the opportunity to refer to butter and other matters, but it seems to me that this Bill is necessary, and that, although it is not perfect, it is in the circumstances as perfect a measure as can be got. It is remarkable that, although honourable members of the Opposition have raised objections to it , they did Instead, not appoint any one to represent the in terests of the growers on the Wheat Pool which their Government established. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that it is a matter of absolute i m possibility to deal with profiteering and the high cost of livin g u n t i l this Parliament receives from the people of Australia by means of an amendment of the Constitution extended powers to enable it to deal with trade in the different States, and all the complex questions arising out of the commerce of a continent.",73
358,Mr MATHEWS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Melbourne Ports) [10.20] - Wit h some surprise I listened to the passionate and violent attack made by the Acting Leader of the House (Mr . Groom) on the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). The honourable gentleman said that my leader knew that the fixing of prices could not be perpetuated by the Commonwealth Government. But I maintain that if our authority to fix prices can be extended unt i l August or September of next year, it can be extended for another ten years. There are not two honourable members who believe that this Parliament has the constitutional authority to pass this Bill and extend our power to fix prices u n t i l August or September of next year. According to the Acting Leader of the House, the Bill is to be confined to a few commodities over which control, was exercised during the war ; but I contend that if the Constitution permits us to deal with those things we can constitutionally extend our control over other articles. In regard to both these matters the honourable mernber was not only unfair to the Leader of the Opposition, but had no ground for the points he sought to establish. I was waiting to hear a statement from Ministers as to whether it was intended to seek further powers from the people at the next election with a view to dealing in a comprehensive way with the exploitation of the community. Every day the newspapers tell us that profiteering, which is the cause of all industrial unrest, is being carried on in an extensive way in all countries of the world, and that every Legislature is being entreated to take steps to prevent it, yet our Ministers give us no hint that they intend to apply to the people for power to deal with it in a proper manner.",73
359,Mr OONSIDINE,A NATIONAL SENATE,They are keeping that proposal up their sleeves.,74
360,Mr MATHEWS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"I do .not know whether that is so, but there is every evidence that an election will be held at an early date-probabl y this year.",74
361,Mr YATES,A NATIONAL SENATE,"As soon as ""Billy "" brings his programme back.",74
362,Mr MATHEWS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Yes, as soon as the. Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) returns there will be wars and rumours of war. He has informed us that he is coming back to flight his enemies - on both sides, I presume. As with the K i l kenny cats, there will only be tails left at the end. I know him, and if he is defeated in getting his desires, come what may, he will be uppermost. He has control of the House, and he is the only man in Australia who can appeal to the Govern or-G eneral.",74
363,Mr SPEAKER,A NATIONAL SENATE, I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the Bill.,74
364,Mr MATHEWS,A NATIONAL SENATE,He will not be able to ask the people for further powers to deal with profiteering and the fixation of prices at the next election unless a Bill to amend the Constitution is brought in very shortly.,74
365,Mr SPEAKER,A NATIONAL SENATE,I am afraid that that matter has nothing to do with the third reading of this Bill.,74
366,Mr MATHEWS,A NATIONAL SENATE,"Of course, I must bow to your ruling. During the whole of the debate the question of the exploitation of the people has been discussed, but the Acting Leader of the House (Mr. - Groom) said that under the Bill the policy of fixing prices could not be perpetuated. My answer to that is that there is evidence all over the world of the necessity for giving this Parliament power to extend the controls exercised under the Bill. The only way to do this is to make preparations for appealing to the j>eople. Profiteering is going on all over Australia. Contracts were made by the Government during the war time in the interests of the people and to prevent profiteering. If that was good for the country while the war was on, it will be good for it for all future years; but the Government are not sincere. They are looking only after the interests of a few in placing this Bill before the House. If they desired to do what was essential, with their knowledge of the industrial and commercial troubles caused all over the world by profiteering, they would take action to secure for this Parliament the power to deal with the whole subject constitutionally and comprehensively. As it is, they have never given us even a hint that tliey intend to apply to the people for that power.",74
367,Mr RILEY,A NATIONAL SENATE,"South Sydney) [10.27] I regret that I had no opportunity to move in Committee an amendment of which I gave notice, but I ask the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Groom) now to consider the purpose of that amendment, which was to insure that all fellmongers in the Commonwealth shall be fully employed before skins are allowed to be exported to other parts of the world. That is a fair request, because every honourable member wants to see local industries kept at full speed. Will the honourable gentleman give instructions to the Wool Committee that the local fellmongers must be fully employed before any skins are exported? The fellmongers in my district, and other districts, are not getting skins, because dry skins are being exported. That should not be the case in a country like this. I believe the Ministerial party, as a whole, will endorse my remarks. All the work that can possibly be done in this country should be done before we allow our raw materials to - sent abroad. Surely the intention not to. bring into existence a Wool Board that would destroy our secondary indusnote tries. I do not believe the Board inment. tended to do so.",74

The motion submitted affords the House an opportunity to that it does not approve, of the policy erecting buildings of a Federal character in the city of Melbourne.

379,Mr CHARLTON,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,Of course it can; but the Minister must know that the reference to the Committee must come from this House.,77
380,Mr GROOM,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,That is so; bu t the Public Works Committee can report whether the proposed work should or should not be carried out.,77
381,Mr CHARLTON,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,I admit that.,77
382,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,The Committee may complain that the proposal is not in the public interests.,77
383,Mr CHARLTON,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,"Probably the Committee may do so. But if we agree to a specific reference to the Committee it will not be justified in going outside that reference, as in this case, to look for other sites upon which the proposed building might be erected. I direct the attention of honourable members to the terms of the motion. It readsThat, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public I Works Committee Act 1.91.3-14, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report thereon, namely, Erection of Commonwealth Note Printing Offices on the site recently acquired in Victoria-parade, Fitzroy, Melbourne. The site has already been purchased, and evidently without referring the matter of suggest its selection to the Public Works Committee. A f t e r the purchase of the site the Government submit this motion, and I contend that if it is carried the Public Works Committee can inquire only into the suitability of this particular site for the building. The Committee can report, whether, in its opinion, the proposed building should be erected or not. But that will not bring us any nearer to the Federal Capital. I say that it should be left an open question whether these factories should not be established at the Federal Capital. If that is not done,, what is to become of the Federal Capital? House Personally I do not anticipate that I shall ever get there. I shall certainly have a long innings as a member of this Parliament if I do. It is the duty of this Parliament to make provision for its establishment at the Federal Capital. There is, in my opinion, no justification for submitting this reference to the PublicWorks Committee in the Way proposed by the Minister. It should be left an open question with the Committee, whoshould have the righ t to go to Canberra, or anywhere else, to make investigations .as to the beet site for the proposed building. That the Committee should have the fullest scope for inquiry is in the in terests of the Commonwealth. I do not know of any reason why the Commonwealth notes could not be printed at Canberra. They could be printed thereas well as here.",77
384,Mr TUDOR,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,I think that stamps are to be printed also.,77
385,Mr CHARLTON,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,"The r e is no reason why the stamps also should not be printed at Canberra. Many other factories that have been established elsewhere might have been established at the Federal 1 Capital. If we ever do go to Canberra, and make it the Seat of Government, how can we get people to come there if every Commonwealth factory is established elsewhere. If it .is the intention to remove these factories subsequently to Canberra, I can only say that that is not a wise policy to pursue. I am one of those who believe that, if we establish these factories and offices here now,, they will remain here for all time. Inorder to test the feeling of the House>. and to give the inquiry by the Public Works Committee a wider scope, I move That all the words after the word ""offices,"" line 7, be left out.

387,Mr RODGERS,NOTE AND STAMP PRINTING,"Wannon) [10.48] On Thursday last the Acting Minister for  this House a shipbuilding programme, covering the Government shipbuilding operations up to date, and embodying as a first instalment, an expenditure of - £10,000,000. That statement has arrested public attention in all the States more than has any other recent Ministerial pronouncement. It suggests the creation of another huge Department of State, whether it be approved or not by Australia as a whole, and the magnitude of the undertaking warrants the House being afforded an opportunity of exhaustively discussing it. This is not the time for a private member to initiate any such debate. I merely rose to ask the Minister if he could fix a date when this House will be afforded an opportunity of carefully examining the whole of the shipbuilding proposals of the Government. No Bill has yet been presented giving the Ministry authority for the construction of these vessels. All that has been done has been by way of administrative act. Now that we have reached the post-war period, I think we are entitled to ask for a disclosure of the entire policy of the Government in this connection. At any rate, I am not prepared to take a bite of £10,000,000 off a nationalization proposal without first being afforded the fullest opportunity for discussing it. The purchase and construction of the vessel to which we previously agreed was recognised as a war-time necesPRO- sity. But we are now entitled to the clearest declaration of policy before any further step is taken. Whilst Parliament is sitting I cannot sanction the construction of £2,000,000 worth of ships as an Executive act without first securing legislative authority for it. I enter my emphatic protest against the adoption of any such course.  ister for the Navy) [10.52] - On e would think that the announcement of the shipbuilding programme of the Government came before the House last week for the first time. As a matter of fact, with the exception of five vessels, the constructional programme, involving an outlay of £10,000,000, to which the honourable member referred, was placed before the House last session.",78

The article is published in the English Review, and in it the writer shows just what the effect of private enterprise has been since the period when the control of shipping was relaxed.
