Petitions received. PEARL-SHELLING INDUSTRY.",14
1,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I wish to know from the' Minister of External Affairs if his attention has been drawn to a paragraph in last Saturday's Age in .which Mr Troy, a member of the Western Australian Parliament, complains of the Government of that State approaching this Government with respect to Asiatic labour for pearling, an industry employing 135 whites to 2,105 Asiatics, which in ten years has given the State only ,Â£6,863 ui revenue? Mr. Troy remarked that he did not think' that such an industry was worth having. Is the Minister aware that in Queensland the position is similar to that in Western Australia, the pearling industry there being almost wholly in the hands of Asiatics? What, if any, steps does the Government intend to take to place the industry on a White Australia basis?",14
2,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Herbert drew my attention to the paragraph which he has quoted. The conditions under which the pearling industry is carried on are the same in Queensland and Western' Australian waters in so far that Asiatic labour is employed in both cases. But in - other respects there is a difference. It is possible, for instance, that the industry would continue - to be carried on in Queensland waters if we refused to give permits to Asiatics to be employed in it ; un- but I question whether it would continue to be carried on on the north-west coast of Australia if permits were refused. The whole matter is beset with considerable difficulty, and I may say that so far as the policy of the Government is concerned, we have under consideration the question whether it is possible to secure any improvement in the direction desired by the honourable member. NA AUSTRALIA.",14
3,Mr JOHN THOMSON,MISLEADING INFORMATION ON,"I wish to ask the Minister of External Affairs if his attention has been called to the following cablegram from London, dated 5th of this month: Mr T. A. Coghlan, the New South Wales Agent-General, has been employing his activities in examining the books dealing with Australian geography which are in use ID the London County Council schools. Forty books were examined, and Mr Coghlan reports that the majority are misleading, and convey a very false impression. He says that it is almost useless to continue the press campaign to advertise Australia while school books are so defective. Will the Minister, through his Department, take steps to correct these misrepresenta'tions and see. that the young people in England who may later be desirable immigrants shall be given correct impressions of the geography and conditions of tralia ?",15
4,Mr BATCHELOR,MISLEADING INFORMATION ON,The matter to which the honourable member refers occupied my attention only this morning in conral sidering the preparation of an up-to-date map of Australia for supply to schools in the Old Country to give pupils more acThe curate information.,15
5,Mr MATHEWS,MISLEADING INFORMATION ON,"I ask the Minister of External Affairs, without notice, ther he has observed that it is not only geographical and historical text books pubment lished in England that Australia is presented, but that Conservative writers in Australia also misrepresent our conditions in the Old Country.",15

9,Mr TUDOR,LABOUR MEMBERS AND OUTSIDE,"I shall make inquiries on the subject, and if the return proves to be a light one, I shall comply with the honourable member's request.

10,Mr FULLER,LABOUR MEMBERS AND OUTSIDE,"1 direct the attention Ausof the Prime Minister to the followingstatement, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of last Thursday:- . It is understood that the extension of the FedeCapital territory at Yass-Canberra for which the Commonwealth Government has applied toNew South Wales will practically increase the site area from 000 to about 1,000 square miles. State Government has also been asked t<> increase the grant of land at Jervis Hay to atwut 10 square miles.

11,Mr FISHER,LABOUR MEMBERS AND OUTSIDE,"I have not myself made any communication to the press regarding the matter. Communications are passing between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government .of New South I Wales relating to the matters referred to.

Does that expenditure f all on the Post and Telegraph DeRAILWAY. partment, and, if so, why is a distinction drawn between the clock in Melbourne and the post-office clock in other towns?",16
21,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The distinction beto tween the Melbourne Post Office clock and other post-office clocks is that with when the Commonwealth took over the post-offices, we undertook to maintain and keep lighted the clocks alieady in exisin tence, but a rule was laid down that no clocks should be provided or maintained at the expense of the Department.",16

PAPERS. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member having notified me privately the of his intention to ask this question, I have received the following report from the Director-General of Works, Colonel OwenI have looked at this building, and think it l would be an advantage, from the Commonwealth point of view, if the portion in occupation for post and telegraphs be handed over to the municipal council. The rooms are not suitable for the purpose, and there is not any way of conveniently extending the post office. I consider the rent asked by the Council is excessive, ""and, on the whole, advise that the Commonwealth should obtain the site and erect a post office on it.",16

If so, does this apply to all post-offices ducted by the Railway Departments in the various States? '",17
30,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as folit low : 1. The office at the Sydney railway station is not a post-office, and, therefore, no provision is made for the registration of letters thereat. This office is purely for the transaction of telegraph business, telephone conversations, and the sale of stamps. 2. Provision for the registration of letters is made at all post-offices conducted by railway officials in the various States. BUTTE R EXPORT.",17

Every facility will be afforded to exporters, provided they comply with the reasonable requirements of the law, and we may avoid a repetition of the abuses occasioned by the shipment of butter prior to analysis. I may add that the GovernAnalyst, with further experience, has modified the opinions expressed by him in June, 1904. NA ALIENS.",17
33,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice I. Is it compulsory or optional for the Commonwealth to take action under section 8 of the Immigration Restriction Act with regard to the deportation of aliens convicted of criminal ofno provision is fences in Australia? 2. In view of the statement of the Minister rail- (vide Melbourne Age, n t h inst.) that certain cases of this kind mentioned in Western Auscontralia had not been brought under his nptice, is there any machinery by which all such cases are brought under the consideration of the Commonwealth authorities? 3. If such machinery is in existence, why has failed in respect of these Western Australian cases. If not in existÂ« nee, why not ?",17
34,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The answers to the honourable men.ber's questions are as follow :1. Reference to the section will show that action on the part of the Government is optional. The law does not refer to all criminal offences, but only to crimes of violence against the person. 2. There is such machinery. 3. I have no evidence that i i has failed. I do not know what the Western Australian cases are to which reference is made, but if the honourable member will supply particulars, I shall have inquiries made. Seeing that the provisions of the Federal law are not applicable until the expiration of any sentences of imprisonment that have been imposed, it is possible that the persons alluded to are still in gaol.

I do not think there will be any objection to this motion, which arises from the fact that the President of the Senate and Mr. Speaker are joining together to accord to honourable members the courtesy of asking them to dine in the evening. It is desirable that we should meet in the morning, and sit until, say, the evening dinner adjournment. Question resolved in the affirmative. LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL. SECOND READING.",18
36,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Wide Bay - Prime Minister) [3.28] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I submit this motion with a feeling of hope' that it will help to promote industrial progress, the social welfare of the people, and the safety of the Commonwealth. It is not a taxing measure, but one to give the Executive power to do certain things necessary to insure the payment of any lawful tax on unimproved land values which Parliament may in its wisdom from time to time impose. ' This is not the first time that this Bill has been before the House of Representatives. As some honourable members, at least, may remember, a similar measure was presented at the first sittings of the last session of the last Parliament; and I put the position mildly, when I say that that Bill had an exceedingly cool reception from a large majority of honourable members. The Government who dared to bring it forward were summarily dismissed for their temerity.",18
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The then Government were in a minority, and that is why they were dismissed.",18
38,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That was a time of sudden and great political changes of opinion, which by the operation of a well known law, caused some friction, and not a little heat. Since then an appeal has - been made from the Parliament to the [57]- 2 electors, in whose name alone we could come into this House, and pass laws for the good government of the people-wit h the result that one of the most notable political reverses known to history took place. Every seat in the Senate was won by candidates who supported the principle of this Bill. Every member of the Labour party who was in the last Parliament successfully appealed to his electors, and was re-elected, whilst fifteen candidates supporting this policy captured adjourn until seats from their opponents. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Why revive these painful memories?",18
39,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That verdict of the people must be obeyed, and that is one reason why honourable members have to be reminded of it. I should like to do the Leader of the Opposition the justice of saying that I have never, to my knowledge, heard him denounce the principle of unimproved land value taxation in itself. I have read a number of eloquent speeches delivered by him during the Federal campaign, and at other times, and have found him always affirming the principle of unimproved land value taxation; but in this House he has qualified that affirmation by saying that the Federal Parliament, from his point of view, is not the most desirable one to impose it. Circumstances, however, have changed. He himself, if I correctly judge speeches made by him during the last Federal election campaign, pointed out that if the State Parliaments failed in their duty in this respect he was conscious of the determination of the people of Australia that it should be undertaken by the Commonwealth Parliament. If I can interpret his views correctly, it seems to me that, of recent years more particularly, the trend of his thoughts and convictions has been in the direction of asking the Federal Parliament to perform this necessary public duty in the interests of the whole of the people, and the protection of the general welfare of the Commonwealth.",18
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Does the honourable member think that that is a good argument to support his case?,18
41,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not wish either to quote or misquote any one for the sake of finding an argument to support my case. The principle of this Bill does not rest upon any argument that I might put forward. It has been affirmed, with one exception, by every State of the Commonwealth, and particularly by the Dominion of New Zealand. That being so, it cannot be said that the principle itself is at stake. As the right honourable member for Swan knows, his leader himself affirms it, and therefore it is only a question of how it may best be carried into effect. If we previously had any doubt as to the views of the Leader of the Opposition on this question, that doubt was entirely set aside during the course of the honourable member's speech on the Address-in-Reply. In that speech, he really pointed out that the time had come when this duty had to be discharged by some one, and that this Parliament would have to undertake it. Further, by way of criticism of the Government's inaction in this regard, he asked why this Bill was not made the first business of the Parliament. Obviously the first business of the Parliament had to be of another kind, for the financial measures were more pressing. The trend of the honourable member's mind, however, is shown by the fact that he actually asked why the Government did not make this their first measure. I did not at that time-no r do I now-mak e any retort. It was not because of any fear as to the result that it was not given preference of all other Bills.",18
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Did the honourable member gather from the query to which he refers that the Opposition were anxious that he should bring forward this Bill, and pass it?",19
43,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Yes .,19
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That , at all events, was not my desire, nor do I think it was the desire of any other honourable member on this side.",19
45,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"If-honorabl e members turn to the report of the Leader of the Opposition's speech on the Address-inReply they will find that he asked why this Bill was not proceeded with on the first opportunity. It is not my business, however, to arrange matters for the Opposition ; if differing views are held by them, I am not responsible. is hardly necessary to remind honourable members that practically the whole of the public estate is in the hands, and under the control, of the State Parliaments and Governments. That is an undeniable fact, and it is not for this Parliament to criticise in any way the manner in which the State Governments have carried out their functions. It is our obligation as the Parliament of the Commonwealth to guard the interests of the whole of the people, and in the exercise of the powers given to we are called upon to deal with this Bill, providing, as it does, for direct taxation- and, in my opinion, that power is specifically given to this Parliament-it is our public duty to do so. I , like many other honourable members, have been a member of a State Legislature, and those who have had a like experience will remember that, during the last twenty, and more particularly during the last ten, years, the State Governments have added to their Lands Departments a new branch. In other words, until some twenty years ago, the Lands Departments of the States were almost entirely engaged in disposing of the lands of the States to people who desired to obtain them in fee-simple. About twenty years ago, it was discovered by the statesmen of several States that, although the lands were largely in the possession of the people, or held under leasehold, the actual settlers were being 1 dispossessed because of the monopoly of lands in the form of large estates. They then set up a department within a department. One set of officers dealt with the disposal of lands not yet sold, whilst others attended to the buying back of lands that had been sold. We find this anomaly in this young country of ours-that in nearly every State of the Commonwealth, a number of officers are engaged in disposing of Crown lands, whilst a number of others are engaged in valuing and buying back lands already sold by the State. The question is not what has been paid for the repurchase of these lands. What I want to bring home to myself and to honourable members is: Why should it have been necessary in a young country, so sparsely settled as this, for the State to recover for the use of its own people lands that were parted with only a few years before? The honourable member for Darling Downs will know that his own father, during his later career in the Queensland Parliament, was associated with me and others in fighting this question of the breaking up of some of It the Darling Downs estates. Long before I came into existence, the late Mr Groom had been fighting that battle, which today has still to be fought. I do not wish to traverse the domains of State action, but my trouble is tha: the States have not ended their difficulty by repurchasing estates, breaking them up, and allowing them to be aggregated again.",19
46,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,But the honourable memi f ber must admit that in the Darling Downs us the breaking up of estates has been an immense aid to land settlement and progress,19
47,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The lands Darling Downs are pretty well broken up now, are they not?",20
48,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I think not. I do not want to go into details, but I may mention that in my own electorate-o n the Burnettmore people have been settled on one bit of land along the Kilkivan-Kingaroy railway, in five years, than have been settled on ten times the area in the Darling Downs during the last twenty years.",20
49,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Still , the population of the Darling Downs has been trebled since the policy of breaking up estates was entered upon. The Prime Minister knows that.",20
50,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The population has certainly been increased, and all honour to those who took part in breaking up the estates. The honourable member is hardly old enough to remember, but he may have heard of the statement that used to be made by a distinguished representative in the Queensland Parliament about the Darling Downs, that the land there would never grow a cabbage. That, however, is another matter, and I do not intend to discuss it further, I may be drawn aside into a general discussion of the land question, instead of simply explaining a measure containing machinery provisions to enable the Administration to collect taxation on the unimproved value of land. The same principle of breaking up large estates has been adopted in nearly every other State. In South Australia, from which some of our ablest representatives come, the Government has repurchased lands with the greatest advantage to settlement, as the honourable member for Angas will know. The same remark applies to the State in which' we are meeting, although I believe that Victoria has been less successful in its repurchasing policy than have other States. New South Wales has been struggling with this question. My honourable friends from that State will recognise that that is the best term to use. In my opinion, New South Wales has not succeeded as she might have done.",20
51,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Ne w South Wales has settled over five thousand families in about five years.,20
52,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I speak from what I . have read in the official papers. As far as I can make out, in New South Wales there are about ten times more people clamouring for small holdings than there are areas available upon which they can earn a living. The principal point to which I should in the like to invite the attention of honourable members regarding this policy of buying back estates is this : I have grave doubts whether it is desirable for the State Governments to become land agents for the re-purchase and re-sale of lands. This policy opens up a question of very grave difficulty, and a question of serious economic and political importance-as to whether gentlemen representing the public should use the public purse to go into the land market for the purpose of buying and re-selling, without making that necessary provision which would prevent not only monopolists, but boomsters from using the public credit and gaining personal advantage from the necessities of the people.",20
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The honourable gentleman is dealing with land policy now, and that is a matter which we cannot touch.",20
54,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not wish to dwell upon it, except to say this-the justification for this Bill is the necessity of the Government to have the machinery to enable them to impose any taxation they think or desirable on the unimproved value of land. Incidentally I may express the opinionit is a personal opinion, but it is an opinion that I believe every thinking man and woman in this country must hold-that the incidence and effect of unimproved land value taxation in every country where it has been applied, has been to make lands available on more reasonable terms for the people who desire to use them. If honourable members are in any doubt upon that point, they will be convinced if they look up the official reports published in New Zealand, and even in some of our own States. This portion of my speech is in no way out of touch with the principle of the Bill.",20
55,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Hav e the conditions changed since last year, when the honourable member brought in the other Bill?",20
56,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I understand that the present season is a very good one. I hope that the conditions in Australia will never change except for the better. Regarding this measure and the lands over which we have taxing power, I think it is inadvisable for the National Parliament to shut its eyes to the facts of the case. Up to the present time there has been expended in the public interest ^250,000,000, which has added to the value of the public estate. There has also been expended about ;Â£i 50,000,000 out of revenue derived from the sale of land. No less than ^400,000,000 of public money has been so expended. In the meantime the public estate is being sold, and not only are future generations to be burdened with the payment of the principal and interest, but they are also to be deprived of their natural heritage. I hope that within a few years this Parliament will face this question in its broadest aspects, and see whether it cannot do something lo prevent the unearned increment from falling into the hands of private persons, because, in my opinion, it belongs to the whole community. The Continent of Australia comprises practically 3,000,000 square miles. It is said that one-third of that area is practically in the temperate zone, that the rainfall is good, and that the greater part of the lands is passably good. Yet we find an exceedingly small number of persons settled on them. I have been over the semi-tropical and tropical portions in North-Eastern Australia. I know that while a great deal of that land is exceptionally good a large portion is passably good, with a fair rainfall.",20
57,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Very little of the land north of the tropic of Capricorn is alienated.,21
58,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The honourable member has got into his mind the idea that I am seeking to hit at somebody.,21
59,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Oh , no.",21
60,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I am not. I am dealing with a general principle. In all the settled parts of Australia the lands which . are in private hands have been well chosen. It is no reflection upon our race to say that they know good land when they see it. It is not so much the area of land which has been alienated as the strategical points which have been secured which have caused the great difficulty in land settlement. But my theme at this moment is in another direction. I wish to indicate that not only have we a country containing good land and enjoying a fair rainfall, but that we have good land in latitudes which in other countries are practically unhabitable by white persons. We, in Australia, are fortunate in having one of the healthiest parts of the world, although it is in that zone. From time to time public men who have travelled through Australia have declared that it is almost marvellous that such is the case. It was reported in the press, only today, that Dr Elkington, Chief Medical Officer in Queensland- a gentleman who used to be Chief Medical Officer in Tasmania, and who, above all persons, should be able to give an unbiased opinion-state d that he had just returned from the far North, where people were no weaker in stamina than those in the south of the continent, and where the youngest children were not suffering in anyway as the result of excessive heat. These remarks, of course, were made by. Dr Elkington in reply to Mr Foster Fraser's statement that Australian people were becoming decadent, and likely to become unfit to develop the country. My honourable friend, the member for Kalgoorlie, has reminded me that Dr Elkington has recently been to Thursday Island, the most extreme north-eastern point which he could visit. From personal knowledge and statistics, I know that children born in our tropical parts have a better chance of life than have children born in the southern or temperate zones It all goes to show that this is a country which any native might reasonably be proud of, and which any body of men ought to be proud to become citizens of. If , in carrying out the will of the people, we can bring these facts before the world, and do anything by our legislation and administration to induce persons living in. more densely populated countries to come here and throw in their lot with us, we shall do something worthy of this Parliament.",21
61,Mr HEDGES,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The honourable member said that there are 700 applicants for one block of land now. How is he going toalter that?,21
62,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I did not say so.,21
63,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That statement was made by the honourable member for East Sydney.,21
64,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I should remedy that condition of things by having 700 blocks for the 700 applicants. Honourable members are, of course, aware-indeed , alii men, whose opinions are worth having, de-, plore the fact-that our towns have been, increasing in population at a greater ratio than the settlements in the country districts. In an exceedingly able and statesmanlike speech delivered by Mr Watt, Treasurer of Victoria, in August last, when moving the second reading of - his Land Tax Bill, he pointed out that Victoria had during the last twenty-eight years, lost population by excess of emigration over immigration-that is, compared with the natural increase by excess of births over deaths. As regards the allotment of the increased population, amounting in all to 425,000, three-fifths, or 261,000, settled in the count}' of Bourke, that ""is, in and around Melbourne, a very startling fact, which gives us cause to be apprehensive of the future. In 1908-9, the population of New Zealand was 9.75 to the - square mile, and that of the Commonwealth 1.47 to the square mile. In that year 37.2 per cent, of the inhabitants of New South Wales were living in Sydney; 43.2 per cent, of the inhabitants of Victoria in Mel-bourne; 24.93 P cent, of the inhabitants of Queensland in Brisbane; 44.52 per cent, of the inhabitants of South Australia in Adelaide; 19.47 per cent, of the inhabitants of Western Australia in Perth; and 22.39 P cent, of the inhabitants of Taser mania in Hobart. In other words, 36.35 per cent, of the total population of the Commonwealth was living in our six capital cities, while only 7.67 per cent, of the total population of New Zealand was living in Wellington.",21
65,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Why does the honourable member confine his comparison to WellingStates, ton?",22
66,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Wellingto n is not the largest city in New Zealand.,22
67,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I make the comparison with Wellington because it is the capital of the Dominion. In Germany, they are very careful to obtain correct statistical information, showing the relation of the population of the towns to that of the country, so that they may know what the trend of population is. We should take equal care to learn the exact facts regarding our population, so that we may draw right deductions. Of the total population of the Commonwealth in the year I speak of, 49.6 per cent, lived in towns having populations of 5,000 and upwards; 34.1 per cent, .in cities of 100,000 and upwards; 8.3 per cent, in cities whose population was 20,000 but less than 100,000; 4.4 per cent, in cities whose population was 10,000 and less than 20,000, and 2.8 per cent, in cities with populations of 5,000 and under 10,000. Mr Watt, in his statesmanlike utterance, gave a number of statistics which were very startling. According to him, in 1880 the agricultural holdings of Victoria numbered 47,050. Selection and alienation increased this number by 16,334, and closer settlement and re-purchase by 1,295, making it ^4,679; but, because of the aggregation of estates, it was at the time he spoke only 56,065; that is, 8,614 estates had been swallowed up in the process of consolidation.",22
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Is the Government going to prevent that ?,22
69,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,We must try to do so. We must co-operate with the States in the matter.,22
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Are the States cooperating with this Government in regard to the proposal under discussion?,22
71,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I hope so. er,22
72,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"In South Australia we tried, as far back as 1885, to prevent the aggregation of estates, and Mr Mirams moved in that direction in Victoria.",22
73,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I know that the views of the honourable member for Angas on this subject are very broad. It is creditable to the people of South Australia that they dealt with this question a generation ago. Much of the prosperity of their State is due to their far-sighted land policy. They are not as greatly blessed with good land as are the people of some of the other but their policy has been a wise one, and they have benefited accordingly.",22
74,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Has not the use of fertilizers had something to do with the prosperity of the State?,22
75,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The engineer and the chemist now aid the agriculturist much more than was the case twenty years ago, and they will do so in a still larger degree in the near future. One of the captains of the American Fleet said, when at Albany, that the so-called sand-hills there would, when their nature was ascertained, be found to contain some of the most valuable land in Western Australia.",22
76,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That has already been proved to a large extent.,22
77,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I am glad to hear it. I have been over the country referred to, and had the opportunity to state, on the authority of an expert, that this so-called sandy, barren land would yet be as fruitful as much that is now thought to be better land. Mi. FOWLER - I hope that the Prime Minister will not create the impression that all the land of Western Australia is barren.",22
78,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,It is too late in the day to reflect on the productiveness of the land of Western Australia.,22
79,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,O r on that of any part of Australia.,22
80,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not say that. Had the honourable member been a member of a State Parliament when the renewal of leases was being asked for, he would have heard it stated that, in some localities, grass would not grow for periods of ten or fifteen years, though later, when such land was on the market, it might have been described as a Garden of Eden. Watt referred to the fact that during the period of which he was speaking, the railways of Victoria had been extended from a mileage of 1,052 to a mileage of 3,447; that is, the mileage had been nearly trebled, and he innocently expressed the opinion that that might have been expected to increase settlement, which, as a' matter of fact, has decreased.",22
81,Mr DEAKIN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The memorandum attached to the last Bill, which gives some facts of this nature, is not attached to the present Bill.",23
82,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I am sure that the Attorney-General, who drafted it, is quite prepared to stand by it.",23
83,Mr DEAKIN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,It is not going to be reissued ?,23
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The elections are now over.,23
85,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"If any honourable member desires it, the Government will see that the memorandum is re-issued; information such as it contains cannot be disseminated too widely.",23
86,Mr DEAKIN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The fact that it has not again been published is not a repudiation of it? The Government have not abandoned it?,23
87,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Nothin g could be better than the manner in which Mr Watt put the facts with which he was dealing.,23
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,He understood the question. Why was it taken out of his hands ?,23
89,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I hope that the honourable member will live to be capable of making a similar statesman-like utterance. I wish to read Mr Watt's remarks, because the Commonwealth Hansard circulates more widely than does that of the State, and what was said affects Commonwealth, as well as State, interests. Watt saidThe six States have sold up to within eighteen months ago 123,000,000 acres of land, and, strangely enough, they have got from the buyers ^123,000,000 in round figures, or an average of Â£ 1 per acre. Now, according to the very lowest calculation, which I shall have to deal with later on, the value of Victorian land, which represents only one-fifth of the quantity sold in Australia, is much greater than the amount the States got for all the land that has been sold since the British Government opened Australia. In other words, the figures may be put somewhat in this way : One hundred and twenty-three million pounds was the price paid for the whole of the land that has been sold in Australia; Victoria only represents one-fifth of that area, and Mr yet her lands today are worth ^127,500,000 in unimproved value, or ^4,500,000 in excess of the price paid for the whole of the 123,000,000 acres sold in Australia. It is perfectly clear from that statement that the unimproved value of land in Victoria amounted to ^Â£4,500,000 in excess of the total amount received from the whole of the Crown lands alienated in the different States. I cannot pretend to be able to state the position more clearly and effectively than Mr Watt has stated it in these remarks, and that is an additional reason for my quoting his observations dealing with Federal matters. But he went further in recommending his Bill to the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. ' He uttered a warning to the LegislativeAssembly and to the Parliament. Hf? said in effect, "" Unless this Parliament is prepared to deal with a land settlement: policy in some effective way, such as I have indicated in my Bill, I venture to say that another Parliament will be called upon to carry out that function of government. ;r I make no apology for the following further quotation from Mr Watt's speech, which will be found at page 859 of the Hansard - of Victoria for 31st August, 1909. He said I say quite plainly that if the States of the Commonwealth do not make some attempt to gain population and to settle the large estates now practically untenanted, the Commonwealth will be justified in stepping in and doing the worl: by direct taxation. Nothing could be more omphalic and direct than that. Although Mr Watt may have had in mind another Chamber of the State Parliament when he gave that warning to his own Parliament and the people of Victoria, that in no way affects the mandate this Parliament has to proceed with the settlement of this question. Honourable members are aware that notwithstanding that warning, the coordinate branch of the Mr Legislature of VictDria put Mr Watt's measure on one side.. That is another reason why this Parliament should deal with the matter without further delay. There is a table which I should like to insert in my speech for the information of honourable members. It will be seen that it deals with the area of land in the Commonwealth alienated, in process of alienation, under lease or licence, and unoccupied, and gives the percentage of the total area lands. taken up. This is the tableAlienated. of Lease or Antes. Acres.

I have also the following information with respect to New South WalesDuring the period 1906-8 inclusive, ings in New South Wales (i.e., those of 1,000 acres and over) increased in extent at the rate of 1.3 per cent., and the smaller holdings rate of 5.8 per cent. Mi. GLYNN - The figures the honourable gentleman has given are of no use, because Tax Bill. there are not 13,000,000 acres under agricultural settlement altogether in Australia. and have taken out the figures also. The figures quoted refer to different classes of land.",23
90,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That is quite true.,24
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,On e thousand acres speech is regarded as a very small area in some parts of New South Wales.,24

99,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,How is it that the large holdings in New Zealand have not been broken up as rapidly as in Victoria if the large holdland tax there has been a success?,24
100,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I was hoping that ai. at the least members of this House who represent Victorian constituencies would have read Mr Watt's speech in introducing his Land,24
101,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I have read the speech, I shall be prepared to give them later on.",24
102,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Mr Watt in his compared the development over a long term of years of New Zealand and Victoria, which are practically of the same area, and showed that the comparison was' invery unfavorable to Victoria.",24
103,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,In what way?,24
104,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"As regards increase of 2.4 per wealth, population, exports and imports, number of cattle and sheep, and everything makes for wealth and prosperity from land, a national point of view.",24
105,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,We can beat New Zeain very nearly every respect.,24
106,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I give the following information with respect to land under cultiIn New South Wales the area under crop decreased from 2,840,235 acres for 1905-6 to 2,717,085 acres for 1908-9. In Queensland there was a similar decrease from 566,589 acres for 1903-4 to 550,753 acres for 1906-7; and also to 535,900 acres"" for 1908-9. In South Australia the area under crop decreased from 2,369,680 acres for 1900-1 to 2,321,812 acres for 1908-g. In Western Australia, however, the area of land under crop increased from 201,338 acres for 1900-r to 586,489 acres for 1908-9. The honourable member for Perth will no doubt be glad to note the figures for VVestern Australia.",24
107,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,And we have only just started.,25
108,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I venture to say that honourable members are pleased to hear of abundant prosperity in any State. I am happy to be able to say that any report of the progress and prosperity of any part of .the Commonwealth has been received in this Parliament with the greatest pleasure by honourable members representing every portion of Australia. Perhaps it is not unfitting diat I should here make one remark on this matter' from a national point of view, and it is that I hope the time will scon pass when the various agents and Governments charged with the management of their own affairs will seek advantage for their own particular State at the expense of the good name of other States in the Commonwealth. I need not say more on the matter at this stage. I think the time has come when we should take a national rather than a provincial view of the affairs of Australia. Perhaps honourable members think that it is time. I dealt with the provisions of the Bill, but I propose first of all to submit the following brief summary of information upon land taxation enacted or proposed:Commonwealth Proposals -Â£5,00 0 exemption, then a graduated scale starting at i d . ; Â£5,000 to Â£10,000 unimproved value, and rising by Â£d. up to 6d. on estates of Â£80,000 and above, with i d . extra in all cases without exemption for absentees. New South Wales - Unifor m rate of i d . in Â£1 on unimproved value. Victoria - Unifor m rate zÂ£ per cent, on capital value, with 50 per cent, increase on absentees, but a Bill under consideration for a graduated tax on unimproved values starting at Â£d. in the Â£ 1 from Â£500 to Â£2,500, gradually rising until it amounts to 3d. on estates valued at Â£80,000 and upwards. South Australia - Graduate d tax of Â£d. in Â£ 1 to Â£5,000, and i d . above Â£5,000 on unimproved value-absentee s 20 per cent, increase. Western Australia - Unifor m i d . in Â£ 1 On unimproved value of land not improved; Â£d. in Â£ / on unimproved value of land where improved; absentees 50 per cent, increase.

New Zealand,-Unifor m tax of i d . in Â£ 1 on unimproved value, and additional graduated tax of r-i6th of i d . Â£5,000 to Â£7,000, rising till it amounts to Â£ 2 ios. per cent, on estates over Â£200,000; absentees 50 per cent, increase. These are the various taxing measures in existence and - proposed. In 1908-9 tax collected in New Zealand yielded out Â£604,900, and in the Commonwealth States as follows :- , New South Wales ... ... Â£80,794 Victoria ... ... ... 85,559 South Australia ... ... 92,158 Western Australia ... ... 33,120 Tasmania ... ... ... 59,651 Total Â£351,282 In 1904-5 the land tax collected in the Commonwealth was ,Â£599,554.",25
109,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Has the Prime Ministergot the amounts in the case of the municipalities where the rates are based on theunimproved valut?,25
110,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I Have not all the amounts in connection with local government taxation. In the case of Queensland the local taxation has been assessed on that basis since 1891.,25
111,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Can the Prime Minister give us the amounts collected in New Zealand?,25

I feel, however, that I am taking up too much time in this, perhaps, rather tedious introduction of the Bill.",25
113,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"As the Prime Ministerdoes not appear to expect much revenue from this Bill, why not combine acreagewith value?",25
114,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I hope the honourable member is not under that delusion, because I do desire revenue, and I have never uttered a word to the contrary. Unimproved"" value taxation is a sound principle, and. while the incidence will tend to break uplarge estates and help to develop the counthe try from an economic point of view withany other embarrassing conditions, it is aproper kind of taxation for the purpose nf raising Commonwealth revenue. Honourable members will see that the taxation applies not only to large estates, but to city and town areas, and, therefore, could not be justified alone on the ground of breaking up large estates. The object of the Bill is to provide machinery for a progressive tax on unimproved land values throughout the Commonwealth. Absentees will be penalized to the extent of a penny in the pound, with no exemption. Though the tax itself will be proposed in another'Bill, it is well - known what the intentions of the Government are, seeing that they were announced almost in their complete form at Gympie, and were discussed on every platform during the recent elections.",25
115,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Was the 6d. mentioned in the Gympie speech?,26
116,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,It was not.,26
117,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"It was mentioned during the elections. Mir. FISHER-At any rate, it is not disturbed.",26
118,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Fourpenc e was contemplated both in Mr Watson's scheme and in the Prime Minister's scheme.,26
119,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not desire to involve Mr Watson in any way with proposals made while he was out of the Commonwealth, because the responsibility rests entirely with the party now here, in clause 12 the following are exempt from :rie tax : - Charitabl e or public educational institutions, local or public authorities acting under a State Government, savings banks regulated by a State Act, religious bodies, public libraries, show grounds, public teries, public gardens, recreation grounds, Teserves and roads. Part IV. provides that returns are to he furnished by taxpayers each year, and the Commissioner has power to make valuations, or obtain valuations made by a State, or authority under a State, and to make assessments. Clauses 24 to 26 deal with the ownership of lantl for taxation purposes as between owners of freeholds and lessees, in order to prevent double taxation. Clauses 27 to 30 deal with mortgages, mortgagees, trustees, and equitible owners, and no deduction is allowed for mortgages, which are not liable, - except in certain cases. Trustees are liahle, hut are to be. jointly assessed for different heneficial holders. # equitable estates or interest in land are liable to assessment, but legal owners are to be deemed the primary taxpayers, and - ihe equitable owners the secondary taxpayers. It will be seen that there is not to be double taxation. By clause 51, married women are taxable, and husband and wife as joint owners of land owend by either. Clause 33 makes joint owners liable.",26
120,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,What will be the position in regard to leaseholders?,26
121,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That is a matter which will be more properly dealt with by the Attorney-General from a legal point of view; he, of course, will take a large part in the discussion in Committee, and I am sure that the legal members of the House will get every satisfaction from him. Clause 35 deals with land owned by companies, and clause 37 is important as providing for mutual life assurance societies and trustees for individuals, except in the case of land acquired under mortgageVarious provisions are made for the freeholder in a primary sense, the leaseholder in a' secondary sense, and so on; but on these points the Attorney-General will speak with more authority than myself. Part V. deals with appeals to the High Court against assessments by the Commissioner, and give the Justices power to make rules of Court regulating practice and procedure in relation to appeals, such rules to be gazetted and laid before Parliament. Part VI . gives the Commonwealth power to acquire land in the event of wilful undervaluation to evade taxation. For this purpose the Commissioner must apply to the High Court for a declaration, and upon such declaration the Commonwealth may acquire the land, subject to all leases, mortgages, and other charges, and compencemesate the owner. The State Government is to be notified of land acquired by the Commonwealth in this way, and if the State requires the land, it is to be conveyed, on payment of amount of compensation made to the owner, and all costs and expenses. If the State does not require the land, the Commonwealth may use or dispose of it. Part VII . deals with the collection and re-' covery of the tax, which will be due and payable each year, on a date to be gazetted; and, in default of payment, 10 per cent, will be added to the tax. The land tax is to be a first charge on land, and continues liable by any purchaser or holder, so long as it remains unpaid. This is provided for in clause 52. No charge is made Owners of against a bond fide purchaser, if due inquiry is made by him, and there is no notice of liability. Clause 55 makes the taxpayer, liable for any deficiency within three years; and by clause 56 the taxpayer is entitled to a refund of any amount paid in excess in the same period. According to Part VIII . , a Commissioner, or an authorized officei, is to have free access, at all times, to all lands, buildings, books, documents, registers of deeds, documents of title, and so forth, for the purpose of valuing, inspecting, or ascertaining ownership, and also to make extracts or copies if necessary. The Commissioner is empowered to call any person .to attend and give evidence, verbally or in writing, on oath, and to produce books, and so forth. Under clause 62, the Commissioner may release a taxpayer, wholly or in part, in cases where it is shown to his satisfaction that the taxpayer has become bankrupt or insolvent, or suffered such loss that the exaction of the full amount of the tax would entail serious hardship. Penalties are provided in clause 63 for obstructing or hindering officers in discharge of their duties. For this particular offence the penalty is Â£ 5 0 . For refusing to attend and give evidence, or to produce books and documents, when required, or making false returns or false answers, there is, under clause 64, a penalty of Â£100. Then, according to clause 65, there is a penalty of Â£500 for understating the values of land, and, in addition, the offending taxpayer must pay an amount equal to treble the tax which would have been evaded if the understatement had been accepted. Where the value returned is less by 25 per cent., than the value as assessed by the Commissioner, this is deemed to be understatement with intent, unless the contrary is proved. For wilfully evading, or attempting to evade, assessment, die penalty is Â£50 0 and treble the amount evaded. fraudulent evasion, lands may be forfeited by proclamation by the Governor General. Clause 70 gives the usual power to make regulations. Of course, I may be asked what amount the Government expect to realise from this taxation. And, while that is not a matter which need be discussed on a machinery Bill, I may say that we anticipate receiving about Â£1,000,000 during the financial year, if the Bill passes.",26
122,Mr GROOM,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Will the tax be imposed sions.' as from ist July last?,27
123,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Speakin g from memory, I - think that there is in the Bill a clause which provides that the tax shall be imposed as from ist July.",27
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Retrospectiv e lation again.,27
125,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The right honourable member should be the last to say that.,27
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I say so deliberately.,27
127,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"In nearly every case, legislation of this kind dates back from the beginning of the financial year in which it is passea. Sir JOHN FORREST.^NO, that was not done in Western Australia. We began at the half-year.",27
128,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I reiterate my opening statement, that this Bill, if passed, as 1 think it will be passed, will lay down a foundation upon which we shall build legislation that will not victimize, or even seriously embarrass, large holders of land because they are large holders.",27
129,Mr DEAKIN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Has the honourable gentleman incidentally mentioned the maximum rate to be imposed?,27
130,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I have.,27
131,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The tax is not retrospective, but the valuation is to date from the beginning of the financial year.",27
132,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"In any case, I think it will be reasonable to start as from the beginning of the financial year. In answer to the honourable membei for Ballarat, let me say that the maximum rate will be 6d. in the Â£ 1 , and that that rate will not apply except to estates reaching up to the approximate value of Â£80,000. This Bill will lay the foundation of legislation which will not seriously interfere with large holders if they wish 1.0 continue as such. One of our great hopes is that it will convert the larger areas into smaller areas, and bring about closer settlement.

Honourable members well know that, even if we derived from this tax Â£1,000,000 per annum, that amount will have been more thanswallowed up by defence expenditure this year.

134,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I have not yet even a rough estimate that is worth putting before Parliament. I think that the cost legiswill be exceedingly heavy; but not so heavy as it would have been had the measure been drafted in a different form.

That procedure will be subject to such gentle pressure as will be effecapplied. tive. In other words, my opinion, as a layman, subject to what the Attorney General may say, is that there is no compulsion, so long as the people do the work voluntarily. I have here an Imperial document, which I do not intend to quote, but which throws some light on the subject. The authorities of the States where land taxation measures were in operation were asked if holders had any difficulty in assessing the unimproved and improved value of their lands, and, speaking generally, according to this report, which was asked for by the Imperial Government, they have no serious difficulty.",27
135,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,There is not the slightest difficulty in South Australia.,28
136,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,We are glad to have that assurance from the honourable member.,28

138,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The burden of the statements in this Imperial report is that owners had little difficulty in stating the correct value of their land and improvements ; but that they had a tendency to place too large a value on the improvements. In the aggregate, however, they approximate to the actual value of the land and improvements for reasonable sale purposes. I have spoken far longer than I had anticipated, and I feel that I have delayed honourable members far too long.",28

141,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Bendigo) [4.53]-The strong opinion I hold as to the unreasonableness of this Bill, and the scheme that it proposes to bring into operation, is my only excuse for making anything like an extended criticism of it - When the debate was adjourned on Friday last, I had completed a summary of historical cases derived from various countries in which experiments of a Government or a State note issue had been tried and found wanting, and had resulted in bitter experiences to the people, and national disasters to the communities which indulged in them. Those disastrous results were felt, not only in monarchical kingdoms on the Continent of Europe, but also in the Democracies of the West, and particularly in the thirteen original colonies of America. The experience of those thirteen original colonies, coupled also with that recorded in the history of the United States of America during the Civil War, affords much stronger proofs of the unwisdom of a paper currency than does the experience of other countries of non-British origin.  rency issued on the same basis as that of the Commonwealth will be?",28
142,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Substantiall y the same basis-the credit of the nation. My The deep convictions on this subject originated in my studies of the state of those American colonies before federation. The conflicts of State laws, and the disastrous results of paper money in those original States, were among the strong contributing causes to the establishment of the American Union, in which there were distinct prohibitions against the issue of paper money by the States, and an absence of anything like federal authority. I should like to refer to the dismal record, not only in John Fiske's Critical Periods of American History, from which I made one quotation last week, but also in Bancroft's famous History of the Constitution of the United States. In volume i , page 234, of that great work, Mr Bancroft says thatIn the conflict, the arguments against paper money were stated so fully and so strongly that later writers on political economy have added nothing to the practical wisdom of the thoughtful men of that day. I should certainly be prepared to give greater weight to the conclusions, studies, and results of historical experience, as expressed by Mr Bancroft, than I would many of the so-called illustrious and tinguished philosophers. History, we come into close quarters with it, is capnitv. able of affording us a more valuable guide and warning than are the speculations of money philosophers. At page 240, Mr Bancroft says that during that struggle versy, "" the mind of the country bent itself with all its energy to root out the evils paper money."" The people found thatPaper money drives specie away; that new issue hastens its disappearance, destroythese ing credit and creating a famine of money; that every penalty for the refusal to accept paper money at par lowers its worth, and the heavier .the penalty the more sure is decline. They saw the deathblow that is given to credit, when confidence, which must be tary, is commanded by force. They saw that the use of paper money robs industry, frugality and honestv of their natural rights, in of spendthrifts and adventurers. Then again, in volume 2, page 135, Mr. Bancroft states thatHistory cannot name a man who has gained enduring honour by causing the issue of money. Wherever such paper has been employed, Queensland. it has in every case thrown upon its authors the burden of exculpation under the plea of ing necessity.

146,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I admit that it of is a question of argument as to what would be a necessary safeguard and gold backing every for the notes issued. But, at any rate, notes were issued upon the confidence and security of what were then practically sovereign colonies, . which afterwards be that came. States of the Union. Yet these semithe sovereign colonies were not able to maintain the security of their notes which went volunforth into the community, and which led to such ruinous and distressing results. I ' will endeavour to distinguish, as far as I behalf can, between the cases covered by those extracts and the provisions of the Bill before us. But I should like, at this stage, to deal with the justification founded upon alleged modern precedents derived from paper the Dominion of Canada and the State of I remember that this agitapresstion for paper money in connection with Federal politics began with appreciation of on the Canadian note scheme. But the DoI t minion note scheme has not been copied in their the scheme under consideration. An enthe tirely different scheme has been embodied in this Bill. Let us see, by a brief examinis the ation of the Dominion note scheme, how it affords any reliable precedent or jusUnder the Canawise dian note scheme, provision is made that well Dominion notes may be issued to any for amount, and that they shall be legal tender. Secondly, security for the redemption of the notes up to 30,000,000 dollars, equal to 25 per cent., in gold and Canaof dian bonds, is provided by the GovernThen the Dominion notes are Their brought into circulation in a peculiar wav ; and - throug h the agency of the banks. ProHenry vision is made that the issue and redempWiltion of notes is to be carried out at branch offices at Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, St. John, Winnipeg, Victoria, and Charlottetown, or arrangements may be made with the chartered banks for such redemption. The question arises: How did the Government of Canada induce the private banks to take charge of the Dominion note currency? It is quite plain that some mandatory or coercive provision had to be devised to induce them to take paper currency issued by the Government and place it in the hands of the public. The Government could not have secured its purpose without the intervention of banking agencies or organizations. Accordingly, a section was inserted in the Act providing that chartered banks should hold not less than 40 per cent, of their cash reserves in Dominion notes ; and arrangements were made for me delivery of the notes to any bank in exchange for equivalent specie. That was a peculiar arrangement- a real stroke of genius-o n the part of the Canadian Government, which, by so doing, withdrew the dollars that were held in reserve in the vaults of the chartered banks to meet their liabilities with their depositors and noteholders, and placed them in the custody of the Dominion. So that, instead of the banks holding 40 per cent, in dollars, the Government gave them Dominion notes; and these Dominion notes were to be held to be as good as gold for the purpose of security to the customers of the banks. The banks did not suffer pecuniarily by that transfer. They were not deprived of any of their assets, because they were allowed to substitute Dominion notes for dollars. Meanwhile, the Dominion Government had the advantage of the possession of 40 per cent, of gold in their Treasury, and were able to utilize this money for their own purposes. That is entirely different from this proposal, as I shall show presently. Then, as another means of placing the Dominion notes in circulation among the people of Canada, a section was introduced to the effect that any chartered bank, when making any payment, was, at the request of persons requiring payment, to pay the sum-that is, the whole sum, or part thereof not exceeding 100 dollars-in Dominion notes of the - value of one, two, or four dollars each, at the request of such person. were two methods by which Parliament of Canada launched the Dominion note scheme. I apprehend that section 72 of the Canadian Bank Act which I have just summarized, has been introduced into this Bill by the Prime Minister for the same or a similar purpose. The result has been in Canada that a large number of Dominion notes have been issued from time to time. I believe that at the present time there are no less than Â£17,000,000 in Dominion notes outstanding. Of that sum between Â£14,000,000 or Â£15,000,000 are held by the banks under the 40 per cent, reserve condition, but only about Â£3,000,000 are actually in circulation among the public of Canada. The exact figures have been supplied to me by Mr Knibbs, in a communication dated 30th April of this year. I will quote them. They are: Dominion legal tender notes, held by the banks, Â£*4Â»872,7&i; in circulation, Â£3,023,699; chartered bank notes in circulation, Â£15,867,761. So that, notwithstanding the fact that Dominion notes are legal tender, and have been issued under the authority of the Canadian law, notwithstanding the fact that the banks are compelled to hand Dominion notes over the counter upon the demand of any customer, they are only in circulation among the people to the extent of Â£3,000,000 sterling, whereas the chartered banks have in circulation notes to the amount of over Â£15,000,000.",29
147,Mr FRANK FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Is there any tax on private notes in Canada?,30
148,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"There is no tax under the Dominion law on the private circulation of the banks. That, undoubtedly, is a very important fact. But what I wish to draw attention to is this : Here, on the one hand, are Dominion notes backed up by all the resources of the Government of Canada, by the public credit, the taxation power, and the property and strength of the community, yet with all these securities the public have only accepted across the counters of the banks, and through the various channels of circulation, notes to the amount of Â£3,000,000 odd; whereas chartered bank notes which are not so backed up by the public credit, but only by the securities of the banks, are in circulation to the extent of nearly Â£16,000,000 sterling. It is the opinion, however, of many Canadian banking experts, that the stipulation of the Bank Act Those that 40 per cent, of the cash reserves of the the banks shall be held in Dominion notes, is a serious blot upon the Canadian currency system. I could quote authorities adversely criticising the system. But I am not here to denounce the Canadian system. I wish merely to draw attention to the difference between the Dominion note system and the proposed system under consideration. The Dominion notes circulate concurrently with the notes of the chartered banks. The Dominion notes are not intended or designed to drive out of the market, so to speak, the notes of the chartered banks. There is a competition tween the two kinds of securities, consequently we are enabled to see which class security or notes the public prefer.",30
149,Mr WISE,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The facts show which notes the banks prefer to put out.,31
150,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,But the public have a right to demand Dominion notes over the counters of the banks. Mr KING O'MALLEY.'- I have had both.,31
151,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Dominio n notes are regarded as no better than the notes of the chartered banks. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They are both good.,31
152,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"They are both good; and evidently the Dominion note has not been used for the purpose of estab- assets. lishing a Government note issue in order to monopolize the whole paper currency, but merely for the purpose of withdrawing the 40 per cent, of gold reserve fiom the vaults of the banks, and placing this money in die control of the Dominion Government, who may utilize it as they think fit. There may be some arguments, and strong - arguments, too, in favour of that system. At any rate, there are many persons whose views and sympathies are in the direction of those of the Government and the Labour party, who prefer the Canadian system as a ready means of raising money for the mse of the Government to the scheme embodied in this Bill. I submit that whatever its merits or advantages may be from thf>. Ministerial point of view, this Bill cannot derive any substantial argument in support of it from the Dominion note'system. I now come to the second precedent which it is alleged affords support in favour of this scheme. It is said that it is founded on the Queensland Bank Note Act. It is claimed to be founded on the precedent which was established in Queensland in 1893, and which is still in force. I should like honourable members to note the difference between the Queensland system and that which is embodied in the Bill. The former is limited, to a certain extent, and the safeguard of 25 per cent. of gold backing is included within the four corners of the Act, but it was not formulated adversely to the banks. It vras brought into operation as an assistance and a relief to the banks. At that time the banks were, no doubt, in a very precarious condition, it may be, through injudicious management of inherent difficulties, or imbeperfections of organization. At any rate, the banks had got into difficulties, and the of Government decided to come to their aid. They found that the best way to come to their aid, without wiping them out, was in the form of the scheme embodied in this Bill. The readiness with which the Queensland banks acquiesced in the scheme and assisted in bringing it into operation showed that they did not view it as having been launched adversely to their interests, or intended to obliterate them.  come to their assistance.",31
153,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Yes , but that was because of a peculiar stress of circumstances. At that time there was a struggle amongst the creditors of the banks as to who should share in the distribution of the Unfortunately, according to the law of the day, the holders of bank notes had no priority or preference in the distribution of the assets, and it was a struggle for life on the part of note-holders. That was owing to the fault of the Queensland Parliament in not having made provision for the protection of bank note-holders, as provision has since been made by the Legislature of every State. At the time the scheme came to the assistance of the banks in Queensland, and it has worked since with their concurrence. But it is very different from this scheme in its relations to the banks. I experienced some difficulty in finding out the law and the practice, and, therefore, I sent yesterday a telegram to the Premier of Queensland. To-day I received a reply, which, I think, illustrates and explains the nature of the Queensland scheme. It reads as follows :Re Treasury notes when first issued, opportunity was given to banks to obtain notes to a limited amount based on their respective previous note circulation, on payment of one-third in gold, the balance being treated as fixed deposit bearing interest at 2 per cent. This was by agreement with the Treasury, not under any regulation, and only the three banks having head offices in Queensland availed themselves of the arrangement. It would seem, therefore, that the State notes were not mandatorily imposed or enforced on the banks. An inducement was held out to the banks to take the notes and to utilize them for the purposes of circulation. The Government considered what was the average of paper in circulation, and decided, apparently, that they would only insist on the banks paying for the notes handed over to them to be placed in circulation to the amount of one-third in .gold. The whole of the issue was not to be paid in gold, as provided in this Bill, but only one-third of the issue was to be handed over to the banks to be paid for in - gold. The rest of the issue is taken over by the banks as a deposit, as though the Government were lending the money to them. It is treated as gold, and the banks pay interest to the Government to the small extent of 2 per cent., by agreement.",31
154,Mr CARR,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,It is treated as gold because it has Government credit behind it.,32
155,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Yes , the banks, in the meantime, have the distinct advantage of borrowing money from the Government at the small interest of 2 per cent.  Sir' JOHN QUICK - Apparently , the banks will not use the notes. They have got them cheaply enough. ",32
156,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"What the honourable member means, I suppose, is that the public do not use the notes.  he must specially ask for them.",32
157,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"At any rate, in - Queensland the banks get notes equivalent to gold. That is a distinct gain to the banks. It is no wonder that they have .shown no hostility to the scheme, because they get the money at 2 per cent., and place it in circulation, and, by so doing, of course, to a very large extent, co-operate with the Government in placing the State note issue on the market. There seems to be a reciprocity of advantage between the banks and the Government. In my telegram to the Premier of the State, I asked him to tell me the profits of the bank note issue, and in reply he saidProfit about twenty-five thousand per annum derived from interest on notes so advanced and interest on surplus gold invested in Government - securities, less administration expenses, which amount to about two thousand eight hundred per annum. Average circulation about one and a-half million, issue last year for gold three hundred and seventeen thousand; gross issue, including exchanges, seven hundred and seventy thousand. That, I suppose, leaves a profit of a little over Â£22,200 on the issue, after paying expenses. The Queensland Act contains no section similar to the one in the Canadian Act which I read, making it mandatory on the banks to pay the State notes over the counter on demand. That is left optional. It is another concession to the banks. It is another reason, no doubt, why they cooperate with the Government to help to make the note issue a success as far as they possibly can, consistent with their own interests and the* Government's. The banks ought to have the right, if they have any sovereigns in their coffers, to pay their customers in gold. Why should they be compelled to pay notes merely because such are demanded? They may be demanded for public convenience, I admit. If notes were demanded for public convenience, no doubt the banks would be quite willing to pay for notes to meet public convenience in the future as in the past. But the section which I referred to, and which is repeated in this Bill, makes it an obligation on the part of the banks, whenever a demand is made by - a customer, to pay over State notes, whether they may be accidentally short of them or not. Although the banks may be prepared to give gold and make other provision for the accommodation of the public, yet it js made in this Bill, as in the Canadian Act, a penal offence on the part of the banks if they neglect or refuse to pay notes across the counter on demand. I fail to see why it has been found necessary to include in the Commonwealth Bill a penal provision which is not contained in the Queensland Act. The Queensland note system is said to have worked successfully. It has resulted in the issue of a million and a half of State notes on the money market, and it has not been found to work"" adversely to the interests of the note issuer. Therefore, I think that there ought to be some explanation of the inclusion of this clause, which I am told will, if enacted, operate most adversely and most inconveniently to the various banks of Australia. It may operate on them very prejudicially by compelling them to keep large issues, not in order to meet average public requirements, but merely because some stray customer may come in and demand a certain number of notes. It is one of the most oppressive and burdensome clauses in the Bill. Certainly-and I assume it is not put there for the purpose of worrying and oppressing the banks-it ought to be modified before the scheme is sanctioned. Let me now point out some of the difficulties and expenses 1 of a State note issue. According to the telegram which I read, the bank note issue of Queensland costs no less than Â£2,800 a year, worked in connection with a public, Department. As the result of my inquiries, I am of opinion that a Government Department cannot manage a note issue as successfully or economically as the banks. No Government has the equipment, nor have Government officers the knowledge of trade requirements possessed by the banking institutions and those controlling them. Some bankers are of the opinion that the administration of the Commonwealth note issue will cost not less than 10 per cent, annum on the value of the notes in circulation, without taking into account the outlay on paper, engraving, and other expenses. It is thought by some that the cost of paper and engraving will be not less than 4s. per cent., or Â£8,000 a year on a circulation of Â£4,000,000, while others put the cost at 3s. per cent. It has been estimated that with a note circulation of Â£4,000,000, and a gold reserve of Â£1,000,000, the Government would gain, allowing 3 per cent, interest, Â£90,000 a year, but, according to competent judges, the cost of paper, engraving, outfit, safes, strong-rooms, books, clerical assistance, &c, would in the first year amount to Â£16,100. One correspondent informs me that at the lowest estimate the expense would be Â£1.0.000, without taking into account the cost of strong-rooms, safes, stationery, and the especially careful supervision that would be needed. If the Government gained Â£90,000 by the issue of Â£4,000,000 notes, with a Â£1,000,000 reserve of gold, and the cost of controlling the issue was Â£16,100 for the first year, the net gain would be only Â£73,900. In the second year the cost of administration would be lessprobably Â£14,000-making the net gain Â£76,000, but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania the banks pay taxes on their note issues to the amount of Â£70,598, while the Queensland Government makes a profit of Â£22,200 on its note issue, so that in all the people of the States gain Â£92,798 a year under the present system. If the Commonwealth substitutes for this system one under which the gain will be only Â£76,000, there will be a net loss of Â£16,798. These figures are based on information received from authoritative sources, and, I think, cannot Sir John Quick. refuted; I present them for considerationand criticism. Apart from the reasonswhich can be urged against the Bill regarding the possibility of danger in the future, there are practical reasons why we should not make the proposed change. It is unthinkable that under present conditionsthere would be anything unsafe in a Commonwealth note issue. Our political institutions are working smoothly, our credit is good, and our finances are on a sound basis. But it may happen in the history of the Commonwealth, as it has happened in the history of the States, that bad timeswill come. I do not wish to utter per Cassandra-like prophecies, but we must not ignore the possibilities of the future. War may arise, either in the distant or in the near future, or other causes may conspire to depreciate our currency. Should national disaster occur, the note-holders would at once present their notes to the Treasury, to demand gold in exchange, and it would be impossible for the Treasury to redeem more than one-fourth of them. It is not enough to have regard to the present state of affairs. A note issue should be backed up with a stronger gold reserve than 25 per cent. A paper issue secured and backed with only a small reserve in coin, in addition to the public securities and credit must in the course of years prove unstable and depreciate. The effect of making the notes legal tender will be to create two forms of legal tender, a gold and a paper, and in the competition between the two, should difficulties arise, the paper legal tender will depreciate. The best Government securities do not possess the value of gold coin, and only a gold coin backing can give a note issue full security and the confidence of the public. That proposition is supported by the fact that the value of all Government securities fluctuates. So-called gilt-edged securities, such as Government debentures, and even consols, fluctuate in value, because of the state of the market, but still more because of the international outlook.",32
158,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Does not gold fluctuate in value?,33
159,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Not appreciably; it stands like a rock unmoved by stormand tempest, because it has an intrinsic value apart from its currency value. All Government securities, however, are affected by financial and political considerations, and even consols, which have the credit of be the Empire behind them, stand at nearly 20 per cent, below par. May it not therefore happen that if we substitute a State note issue for a bank note issue, the notes may depreciate as even the best Government securities do? It is said that the Commonwealth notes will be backed with the resources of the Commonwealth, and, no doubt, while the outlook is peaceful, and our circumstances are good, everything will be well. But when in adversity the holders of these notes rush to the Treasury to obtain gold there will be financial crises. A paper legal tender can never possess the same intrinsic value as a gold legal tender, and in the competition between them the gold tender will appreciate .and the paper tender depreciate. Furthermore, no law can compel the seller of a commodity to give the same - value for paper as he would give for gold. That has been the experience of all countries which have had paper currencies. The time may come when these Australian notes, and it may be the Dominion notes, - or the Treasury notes issued in Queensland, will, if the countries concerned have to go through the stress and storm of financial - adversity, yield in value in the same way as the securities of private institutions - yielded, diminished, and failed. It is a surprising circumstance that, notwithstanding the teachings of history, and the bitter Â«xperience of other countries, we still find enlightened communities disposed and willing to enter upon dangerous experiments on - which others have been wrecked in years gone by. It is the duty of those who do - not view this proposal with confidence to utter a word of warning, and to direct attention to some of the important considerations to which I have referred. Having done that, the responsibility will rest, not with us, but upon those who have command of the affairs of the Commonwealth, rand are at the helm at the present time. Shope that during the progress of the Bill through Committee, when attention is drawn to some of the clauses, such as that requiring banks to have a certain minimum of notes at all their branches, a disposition will be shown by the Government to consider the details of the measure in a fair and reasonable .spirit, and see whether something cannot be done to minimize the inconvenience, .and to remove the serious hardship which I feel this measure is likely to place upon many of our financial institutions. As a matter of fact, I know that although banking and other financial institutions of Australia are openly and loyally acquiescing and showing every disposition to yield to the law of the land, there is in many quarters serious misgiving and distrust as to what may be the real effect of this system when brought into practice on such a large scale as is here proposed. It is to be hoped there will be found to be no justification for this misgiving and distrust, although we cannot but regard this proposal as a very big and trying experiment, and one which will tax the resources of banking institutions. They will have af once to pay off all their existing notes in circulation, and find the necessary funds to buy Australian, notes from the Government, in order to introduce them into the currency. The demand upon them may to some extent invade the ordinary resources of the banks available tor their customers. The bringing of this scheme into operation, involving as it does the withdrawal of so much money from circulation and placing it in the hands of the Government for utilization in the form of a loan, in reality, although not in the legal sense of the term, must inevitably lead to a contraction of credit for some time, and to considerable financial trouble, if not emhave barrassment, to banking institutions, and those having financial relations with them. There are many members even on this side with whom I have the honour to agree on many subjects, who do not take so adverse a view of this Bill as I do, but it is the duty of each honourable member to unhesitatingly state his views upon so important a question. I think that this Bill involves a leap in the dark, and that it will lead to trouble, dangers, and disasters undreamt of and unexpected by its framers.",33

The debate on both sides has proved intensely interesting to me. I have enjoyed it very much, and it has proved very instructive. It is clear that honourable members on both sides who have spoken on the question must have been at the pains of considerable research. The question is one to which I have given consideration for about twenty years, because I have always held that much depends on the control of the money volume of the nation. In.reply to the honourable member for Richmond, T should like to say that this is not a party question. We are free on this side to act and to argue as we please'upon it. In anything say I shall express my personal opinions, without respect to the party to which I long.

Ona very important feature of the measure that it proposes for the first time in history of this Parliament a means of giving the Commonwealth a loan of from small Â£4,000,000 to Â£7,000,000. without in the terest. I make that admission freely. am glad, and not ashamed, to be able make it, because I realise that it strikes at the root of the capitalistic system. Capital is of no use but to earn interest, which is merely rent on capital. In reply to what has been said by the honourable history. member for Bendigo, I may say that we have already in Australia borrowed about ,Â£251,000,000, and a measure of this description should enable us to make considerable saving in interest. Every twenty-five years under the system hitherto adopted we have paid back the amount of credit: Â£251,000,000 in the shape of interest, and have still owed a vast amount. If we could raise some of the money we require without interest, we should remove some the burdens from the shoulders of the at present heavily-burdened taxpayers of the Commonwealth.  securing money without interest?",34
161,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not say port that we can. But as this great Commonby wealth progresses we can continue the issue of Australian notes in larger volume, and thus secure the use of some money without having to pay interest for it. We could put this money to the credit of a fund for the purpose eventually of liquilast dating the State debts. The honourable member for Echuca, who is so anxious to interject, will have an opportunity to reply to me shortly. I therefore take his interjections, intended, as they side-track me. I have no doubt that this proposal hits very hard the Rothschilds, purpose. Vanderbilts and Morgans of Australia, that is why the honourable member desires to side-track me on this important issue. I think we shall be able, to save the monwealth an immense amount of money by the adoption of this system of securing monev without interest, and using it in way I have indicated. I do not believe that it is the intention of the Government I to use the money which will be at their disposal under this system for defence or bepublic works. I am not in their confidence not in the matter, but I hope they have no such desire. Another important aspect of question is that the proposed increase the currency cannot fail to open the channels of progress. It must provide a is hettermedium between producer and prothe ducer, and between producer and consumer. We suffer at the present time from the amount of gold in circulation, and obstacles to the free interchange of I products under the existing system. We fo know that the currency of the nation is its life's blood. If it is limited, trade is restricted, and the restriction of trade brings about such disasters as we had to face in 1893, and in other periods of our We in Australia represent a debtor nation. Great Britain is our creditor. We have borrowed an immense sum of money amounting, as I have said, to a about Â£ 2 5 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Mr KING O'MALLEY - An immense",35
162,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That is so, because we have received what we have borrowed in the shape of goods, and not in. - of the form of gold. Great Britain, however, insists that, so far as we are able, we shall pay back what .we have borrowed in gold, and shall pay our interest also in gold. This is the reason why it has been, so difficult for us to liquidate our. big interest bill. We should not mind the exof our gold, if we had left a medium < which we could secure a free interchange of products. The proposed issue of Australian notes will supply us with that medium, and we shall not suffer as we have done in the past from the shipment of trust gold to the Old Country -1 notice that year we shipped from Australia gold to the value of Â£15,000,000. Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - It was shipped no notice of to pay interest. are, to Mr Laird SMITH - I am aware that the bulk of i i was shipped for that I ask honourable members to and imagine the folly of paying Â£10.000,000 in interest every year with gold shipped from this country, when, by the adoption Comot such a system as that now proposed to be introduced, we might have so largely reduced our interest bill. Now, where is the the vast amount of gold which we hear so much about as being behind the existing note issues of the banks? This is what Mr Knibbs says on the subject, on page 848 ol the Official Year Book of the CommonwealthCirculation of Specie - Many conflicting mates have from time to time been made as to the amouni of coin in private hands. the general manager of one of the Sydney banks estimated the coin in private hands in New South - Wales at only Â£725,000, while the estimate of the Deputy-master of the Mint for the same period was Â£4,416,000, the truth lying, no doubt, somewhere between those two estimates. 1906 the Deputy-master of the Perth Mint conducted an inquiry with the object of obtaining information on the condition of the currency in Australia. His estimate was :-Sovereigns , Â£2,500,000; half-sovereigns, Â£500,000; silver and bronze coin, Â£1,200,000. This estimate appears, however, very low, amounting only to a little over Â£ 1 per head of the population. That is the wonderful gold backing that we have for the business carried on in Australia The coin in private hands amounts, however, only to a comparatively small part of the total coin in the country, the value of coin held by the banks during the quarter ended 30th June, 1909, being Â£24,943,910, of which amount, according to returns embracing more than three-fourths of the banks, it may be said that Â£23,738,000 was held in gold, Â£1,171,000 in silver, and Â£35,000 in bronze. To the active currency must be added the notes in circulation, which for the same period amounted to Â£3,510,629,. exclusive of Queensland .Treasury notes, Â£1,554,720, viz., Â£799,085 held by banks, and Â£755,635 in circulation. Again, turning to Mr Knibbs' work, we find that the total amount of gold and bullion in the banks in 1908, for the whole of Australia, amounted to Â£24,931,560. With this amount of gold, the volume of business transacted at the Sydney banks' exchange settlement, and the Melbourne Clearing House, at which institutions settlements are effected daily between the banks doing business in New South Wales and Victoria respectively, the total clearances in Sydney in 1908 amounted to Â£227,736,000, and in Melbourne to Â£221,354,000, or a total of Â£449,090,000. Where is the gold at the back of all this paper currency ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is",35
163,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Of course it is. The whole of that business is conducted on the faith of the people in those institutions, and on the faith of the people in each othei. Where is the gold to give us, as one newspaper said, seven sovereigns for every note issued? MACLeod estimated that the credit resting on Â£110,000,000 of actual coin in Great Britain amounted to Â£10,890,000,000, or about Â£100 of credit for each Â£ 1 of coin. Flurscheim, an up-to-date man from Germany, where there is a big State esti- banking institution, who is accounted one In 1892 of the best writers on the subject, and who has done so much for New Zealand, said that MACLeod made an over-estimate in these figures, and that the credit, instead of being as Â£10 0 was to Â£ 1 , was about In Â£ 2 0 to Â£ 1 . Even on these figures, it will be seen that there is Â£ 2 0 of credit to every sovereign in existence. The Director of the United States Mint estimated the debts of the world, payable in gold in 1893, at Â£12,000,000,000, while the stock of the world's gold amounted to Â£716,521,000. As I said before, this business rests on the good faith of the people in the banks; and immediately that good faith is broken, we have periodical disasters under our present system. Much has been said, particularly by the honourable member for Bendigo, about the standard value of gold. As a matter of fact, as Flurscheim points out, gold has no standard value. That writer asks what we would think if, when a rich peison entered a shop to buy a yard of cloth, the shopman at once stretched the yard stick. But that is precisely what takes place with regard to the gold currency. In the last thirty years, Flurscheim says, gold has appreciated in value by 100 per cent-ever y new machine, every means invented to make the production of one man easier, appreciates the value of gold. Yet honourable members opposite speak as if the value of gold was absolute, and, as if by following certain scientific precepts, it is possible for everybody to get gold and become rich. But, as Ruskin said0 Men nearly always speak and write as if riches were absolute, ai:d it were possible, by following certain scientific precepts, for everybody to be rich. Whereas riches are a power like that of electricity, acting only through inequalities or negations of itself. The force of the guinea you have in youT pocket depends wholly on the default of a guinea in your neighbour's pocket. If he did not want it. it would"" be of no use to you; the degree of power it rot! possesses depends accurately upon the need or desire he has for it-and the art of making yourself rich, in the ordinary mercantile economist's sense, is therefore equally and necessarily the art of keeping your neighbour poor. That is the reason the Opposition are against the proposed note issue; they cansee that, by the monopoly in gold, the poor man lacks his share. I make no pretence to be original in my opinions on these points,, and I present to honourable members the. words of the Slade professor at Oxford, as Mr Ruskin then was. I could further support my case by quotations from writers whose opinions have been misrepresented toy honourable members opposite. For instance, Mill was misquoted-he never meant to convey the meaning imputed to 'him by the honourable member for Richmond, when speaking of the elasticity of the currency. What intelligent man would contend that Government notes will not have all the elasticity of private notes? Immediately there was an over-issue the notes would return to the Commonwealth Treasury, and the Treasurer would thus know when to hold his hand; in other words, the Government will have every power that bankers pretend to have. As to possible crises under a Government note issue, we know that, whenever there is a - crisis under the present system, the Government has to come to the rescue of the private institution. In 1847 there was a terrible crisis in England, but it was by the repeal of the Peel Act. All that was necessary was for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to issue Â£400,000 in notes, - and the distrust came to an end. The people rushed the gold back into the banks, - declaring that all they wanted was confidence in the institutions. In New Zealand, in 1900, advances were made by the banks amounting to Â£17,000,000, or, including the savings banks and the note issue, to over Â£22,000,000. On what was that paper money issued? According to Flurscheim, they then had in New Zealand Â£3,000,000 in gold, but the Bank of New Zealand was about to break when that statesman, Richard Seddon, came to the rescue. He lent to the bank Â£2,000,000, .and, in addition, the Government and the public each took 500,000 shares at Â£1 - each, and thus saved the situation. According to the returns, the Bank of New Zealand in July last paid a dividend of 10 per cent, to the Government and 12 per cent, to the outside shareholders, the Government, for a reason I do not know, being restricted to the smaller payment. The New Zealand Government insisted on this bank being practically managed by the Government, with the splendid results I have shown ; and I commend the facts to the honourable member for Bendigo, who - expressed the opinion that a banking tution cannot be managed by a State. Japm, at the present moment, is carrying on banking business through the Government ; and we should do well to copy that country. In a book entitled The Uprising Mr Laird Smith. of the Many, by Mr Charles E. Russell, we read :Hence it (the Government) arranged to keep in its own hands the control of the Japanese banking business. This is effected through three great institutions, all practically owned by the Government : the Central Bank of Japan (the leading bank of issue, and the Government's financial exponent); the Hypothec Bank, whose function is to care for agricultural interests; and the Industrial Bank, whose specialty is to supply manufacturing concerns and to foster trade extension. Besides these, the Specie Bank of Yokohama has special functions in looking after foreign commerce. Through these institutions the Government has in its control the vital supply for every commercial interest of Japan. Immediately the Government get control of the money volume, commercial institutions and business people are no longer at the mercy of a few private individuals, who, under the present system, are acquainted with the business of all other men. In Tasmania, recently, after I had spoken on this subject at a public meeting, a gentlestayed man said to me, "" I am with you every time, though I was opposed to your party until I heard you on the banking question."" This gentleman went on to say that he had borrowed Â£200 from a bank, and, for no reason that he saw, he was suddenly called upon to reduce it to Â£ 6 0 . This he was successful in doing, thus showing that his credit was sound; but 'he did it at great inconvenience to himself. Is it good for a country that a power like this should be in the hands of the few? I think I have shown that we need not worry about the security of our notes, but I may mention a greater one. A man who does a week's work for two one-pound notes, and a ten shilling note is adding to the true wealth of the country, because, for every two pounds paid to him, he creates six pounds worth of wealth. According to Mr Sidney Webb, the Lecturer on Political Economy, at the London College, the workman only gets one-third of the wealth he produces, though there are others who say that he only gets one-twentieth. American statisticians have gone very deeply into this question; and, according to figures that have been presented to me, the wealth of the American nation, in 1850, was $8,000,000,000. The producers' share was 62 \ per cent., and the nonproducers' share 37J per cent. insti- In i860 the wealth had increased to $16,000,000,000. The producers' share, however, had fallen to 43I per cent., while the non-producers' on the other hand had increased to 56^ per cent. This growth continued until, in 1900, it was estimated that the wealth of the country was $100,000,000,000. The producers' share in that year had fallen to 10 per cent., and the non-producers' share had gone up to 90 per cent. These figures will give honourable members some idea of what the control of the money volume means to the actual producer and the worker. I come now to what I regard as the unjust criticism that has been levelled at this Bill by references to the greenbacks of America. Why did not the Opposition refer to the bank established by Hamilton, and successfully conducted in America during a time of trial ? Instead of doing so they elected to point to the issue of greenbacks, which, by-the-bye, was designed to provide money for war purposes. We do not propose that our money shall be wasted in killing our producers. We have no such design. Another point which honourable members opposite have forgotten to mention is that the American greenbacks would not be accepted at the local Customs House, the reason for their refusal being that the authorities desired to obtain gold to pay for the gold they had borrowed abroad. It was that which led to the position which the greenbacks occupied, and I think it was most unjust for our opponents to make such comparisons. Then again, I would remind the House that the State note issues of other countries have been made at a time of great distress. France, for instance, was in revolution, and other cases in support of my contention could be readily quoted. The position in the Commonwealth is wholly different. Australia is in a prosperous condition, and I think that it wili be still more prosperous when we put this vast sum of money into circulation. In some of the States not only bank notes, but the cheques of certain people, are legal tender. I know of two gentlemen in Tasmania whose cheques are only presented to the banks when the writing upon them is becoming so indistinct or defaced that there is a likelihood of the bankers refusing to honour them.",36
164,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,But they are not legal tender.,38
165,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"They are practically legal tender, and the sound credit of the gentlemen concerned is the reason why they are. I am told also that in Queensland IOU's, or what are known locally as "" shin plasters, ' are passed from man to man. They are used as legal tender for the reason that there is not sufficient gold in the country to enable the business of the country otherwise to be carried on. The sooner we make ample provision for carrying on our trade and commerce the better for all concerned. I think that I need say no more on this question. Indeed, it is hardly fair that 1 should discuss it at greater length in view of the fact that so many of my own party wish to speak to it. I have said sufficient 1 hope to convince honourable members opposite that we know something of this question, or that we have endeavoured, at all events, to secure a knowledge of it before addressing the House. I have listened with great interest to the criticisms in which the Opposition have indulged, but have not yet heard any reason to change my mind with regard to the desirableness of this Bill. The honourable member for Parramatta said of our party: "" There is not one of vou over there capable of running a bank.""",38
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I did not say anything of the kind. What I did say was, ""You could all run a bank.""",38
167,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,On e need not work in a bank in order to obtain a knowledge of banking. All that is necessary is to secure an overdraft. It is in such 'circumstances that the knowledge is obtained.,38
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I am with the honourable member there.,38
169,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"There is no doubt about it. I have behind me an exbank manager who is always prepared to supply me with information upon this question. He has stood by me well. We have often exchanged thoughts, and once, when I was on the wrong track, he put moon the right one. I shall always be thankful to him, and since he is now retired, I see no harm in mentioning this fact, although I shall not disclose my friend'sname. With all due respect to bank managers, however, let me say that a bank manager does not require to have such aknowledge of the commercial world as honourable members of the Opposition wouldimply. He needs only to know when to"" pull the strings."" He must know towhom an overdraft may be safely given,, and he must be prepared to obey the instructions of his directors. When the Bank of Van Diemen's Land failed, the trade of Tasmania was paralyzed, and I 1 feel constrained to ask the honourable member for Richmond what becomes of the assets of a bank when it closes its doors? The assets of the Bank of Van Diemen's Land have not yet been liquidated. In* many cases, as soon as the bank had closed its doors, farms were not worth the amount that had been advanced upon them.",38
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,A bank would not be a bank if it could immediately realise its assets.,39
171,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Then , may I ask, what of this security of which we have heard so much? I can speak feelingly on this phase of the question, because I had in a certain institution that closed its doors every shilling that 1 possessed. I , like others, was left helpless, but the bank directors, who had large overdrafts, are walking the streets today as big as ever they were. Some of them did their best to defeat me at the last general election. The Bank of Van Diemen's Land paid a dividend a few days before it closed its doors, and yet honourable members opposite insist upon talking of the safety of the note issues of the banks.",39
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Did the honourable member get his money?,39
173,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Not a shilling. I had placed it on deposit with the AngloSilting Australian Bank, and when it closed its doors I was practically penniless. At that time, after paying my way, I was in the"" habit of allowing myself 2s. per fortnight as pocket money. On the Saturday before the bank suspended payment, I purchased a book for is. 6d., thus reducing my pocket money to 6d., and on the following must do as best we can without them. Monday morning, when the bank closed, I found myself with only 6d. to carry on to the next pay day. Can honourable members wonder why, in such circumat stances, I should favour a Commonwealth note issue? "" In view of such an experiparently ence, they may well understand how I preciated the references made by the honsubject orable member for Richmond and others to the wonderful security which our banktion. ing institutions offer. Where was the sestatement, curity in the case of the Anglo-Australian Bank ? Where is it now ? That institution - never paid one shilling to those who had - placed all their hard-earned earnings deposit with it . In the case of the of Van Diemen's Land, many people who had invested in its shares never got - penny for them.",39
174,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Did the honourable member get a higher rate of interest from - the Anglo-Australian Bank than he could have got from a sound banking institution?,39
175,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I was induced to deposit my money with that bank bebers, cause of the higher interest that it offered. That experience, however, taught me a lesson on the interest-earning question that I shall not forget. I am not ashamed to make this admission. My eyes at that time had not been opened as they have been since by the reading of Labour literature. It was before the advent of the Labour party in Tasmania. Since then I have studied the banking problem, with the result that my eyes have been opened, and I am not likely to be caught doing the same thing again. Nearly every one now asks for a State Bank, in which he may deposit his money, and I hope the day is not f a i distant when we shall have one. This Bill , providing, as it does, for a Commonwealth note issue, is only the forerunner of a National Bank, and I hope that within the next three years we shall have one in existence, running side by side with our private financial institutions. The people will then be free to make their own choice, and I venture .to predict that they will unhesitatingly avail themselves of the Commonwealth Bank. suspended from 6.26 to 7.45 p.m.",39
176,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Fawkner) [7.45] I am sorry to see such a poor attendance on the Ministerial benches. I hoped that we should have present some of the leading authorities of the Ministerial party. But they are conspicuous by their absence. We I congratulate the honourable member for me Denison on having at any rate studied the question at issue. He gave us his views considerable length. He has not only read considerably on the subject, but aphas hail practical experience of apa disastrous kind. He grappled with the in real earnestness. I was glad to hear him say that this is not a party quesI trust that that is a bond fide and not merely a piece of claptrap. Certainly we are dealing with a most important question. I hope that honourable members opposite will look at it from an on Australian point of view, and not purely Bank from a party aspect. The matter lies at the root of all our prosperity. Any wrong a which we may do will affect the credit of the whole Commonwealth. It is said that when his Satanic Majesty is out for real mischief he generally poses as an angel of light. That is just about what this Bill does. It looks a harmless, taking sort of measure, but I can assure honourable memas one who has had considerable financial experience, that if passed in its present form it will do more harm to Australia than any measure that has been brought before this House. Therefore, I hope that when I make the suggestion that the Bill should be referred to a Royal Commission, to be inquired into thoroughly before anything is done to saddle Australia with an experiment which has broken down in every other part of the world, the proposition will be favourably received. There has been a feeling in the minds of all of us perhaps- I entertained such an idea myself until I looked into the matter carefully --that the currency is a sort of royal prerogative. But when I came to study the subject, I found that what really happened was this : When civilization was in its primary stages, barter was the only method of carrying on business between man and man. A person would, for instance, give a pig in exchange for a suit of clothes. Later on it was found more convenient to exchange commodities for a certain amount of metal. The metal, of course, had to be weighed and assayed by the individuals giving and receiving it. A further step was taken when it was discovered to be more convenient for the ruling authority to put a stamp on a piece of metal to certify it as being of a certain weight and value. That is the way in which the metallic currency became part of the Royal prerogative. I desire to quote a passage from a leading authority on this question. Tooke, in his History of Prices, volume 5, section 8, brings out an aspect of the question that is worth thinking about from an educational point of view. I do not know that it is possible for us to educate honourable members opposite on this subject, but we may as well try to throw a little light upon it.",39
177,Mr WEST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,We are trying to educate the Opposition.,40
178,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Not in finance, I hope! This is what Tooke saysI t has been contended that the function business of issuing notes is the indefeasible attribute and prerogative of the Sovereign State. This dogma proceeds on the ground, that inasmuch as the coining and the issuing metallic money is an attribute, or province, or for currency purposes. privilege of the State, so also bank notes, being, by the definition of the school (Currency School), held to be money, the creation and issue of them ought, by parity of reasoning, to sidered as ""coming under the province of the Government. . Now, for this assumption there is not a shadow of foundation. The function of the Government in regard to the coinage, as eonducted by the Mint, is simply to certify the correctness of the piece of metal submitted. The Government does not issue the coin in proper sense of the word issue-it does not create. The province or function of the Go. vernment in regard to coinage, as conducted by the Mint in obedience to the prescribed regulations, is simply to certify by a stamp, bearing the effigy of the Sovereign, the weight and fine, ness of the piece of metal to which it is applied. That passage contains a very sound definition of a metallic currency. The Government undertake the coining of metal for the convenience of the public. Of course, whenever the Government can do anything for the convenience of the public it is proper that they should do it. If any honourable member can prove to me that a Commonwealth issue of bank notes would be for the convenience of the public I shall gladly give way. At present I am of the contrary opinion. I believe that it will not suit Australia in any way for the Government to issue notes. It ought to be the function of the Government to control the bank note issue and so see that it is safeguarded. But that is not the proposition now before us. MACLeod, another very eminent authority, in his Theory and Practice of Banking, says The stamp on the coin is the guarantee that it contains a certain weight of bullion. It is clear that the sole object of coining was to save the trouble of weighing, and that though the prices of articles were estimated in figures, it was the essential part of the understanding that these figures denoted certain specific quantities of pure metal. That passage explains how Governments came to take charge of the metallic part of the currency.  not apply to silver.",40
179,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"It applies'to silver as token money to a certain extent. Everyone knows who takes a silver coin with the King's head stamped upon it, that the coin contains a certain amount of pure metal, and represents a certain value in exchange.",40
180,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The honourable member does not ,say that a sovereign contains noor thing but pure metal, does he?",40
181,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"No . A sovereign or is not pure gold, but is a certificate of of value. Pure gold would be too soft to use I cannot help thinking that the system at present prevailing in Australia is working remarkably well. be conThe Prime Minister, when launching this Bill, said that he was not going to attempt to justify the proposed new system on a profit-making basis-that the Government to did not expect that the Commonwealth would make much, if anything, out of the any issue of notes. I entirely agree with the honourable gentleman. We must remember, serious of course, that in Australia the people reproposal. ceive through their State Governments, Â£80,000 per annum from note* taxation, we add to that the cost of issue and districause, bution, it will be found that there is very little, if anything, in notes from a comgo mercial profit-making point of view. course, it ""must not be forgotten that this proposal would give the Commonborrowing. wealth Government Â£5,000,000 to handle. That is to say, it is expected that the note issue will be Â£7,000,000, Â£2,000,000 coin kept in reserve. In other words the Government will have Â£5,000,000 to play with. But we must set against that the tremendous deteriorating effect that Â£5,000,000. this proposal is likely to have upon credit. Australia, as honourable members opposite have admitted, is a borrowing crisis. country. We must be exceedingly careful of our credit. Already the Times, the great London journal, has pointed out in somewhat alarming manner that Australia is launching out on a very dangerous course. We must bear in mind the effect that such warnings will have upon the holders of tralian stock all over the world, and chiefly in Great Britain. This experiment is likely to have an exceedingly injurious effect future loans. Within the next twenty years Australia has loans to the amount of about ^Â£200,000,000 coming due. We have to settle that account. Another thing to repanic ? member is that if we are going to make anything of Australia, and settle ten fifteen million of people on our soil, we borrow a tremendous amount of money. Our present system of legislation deprives private enterprise of many opportunities that are open to it in other countries. That means that the Governments, Federal or State, will have to build railways, construct waterworks, and do most of the other things that are necessary for civilizing this counhave try, and making it fit to be occupied a large population. We cannot carry all these works from the proceeds of taxation. If we attempted that, private enterprise would be still further stricted. If we are going to settle a notes are absolutely safe. large population in Australia within the next ten or fifteen years, we shall have borrow a good deal of money somehow. Privately or publicly, loans will have to'be raised. We are not an old country, but a young one. Anything which damages the credit of Australia in any way a disastrous effect upon our prosperity. From that point of view alone the most Mr Fairbairn. consideration should be given to this Although honourable members opposite may think that it is easy to take if this loan of Â£5,000,000 for nothing-be after all, it is a loan- I am convinced that it would be far better for us to straightforwardly to the Mother Country Of and borrow Â£5,000,000. We do not know what mischief may underlie this method of The proposal of the late Government was to borrow Â£3,500,000, with total a 5 per cent, sinking fund. That would less have wiped off the debt in sixteen years. We do not know where we are likely to stop when we adopt this method. At present the Government are going to obtain But they may not stop our there. I am afraid that there will be fresh issues of paper currency in times of That is the great difficulty. I have already said that, in my opinion, the present system is-and I think that history a justifies the statement-absolutel y safe. The Prime Minister stated as one of his objections to that system that in the. great crisis of 1893 a few notes were sold by Auspersons who were in a panic at less than their face value. That is the only time in the history of Australia when there has upon been any default by a bank.",40
182,Mr FRANK FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,What about the Government assistance to prevent further,41
183,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I intend to deal or with that point later. I think it an must entirely proper thing for the Government to do. In the great crisis of 1893, people got frightened of their own shadow, and exchanged their notes for sums which were entirely below their face value. When the Prime Minister was submitting the Bill, he asked, "" What about the deposits at call; would not the deposit-holders the same claim as the note-holders? "" by We all know that at present there is beout tween Â£20,000,000 and Â£30,000,000 worth of gold in the banks to secure note issues of a little over Â£4,000,000,' so rethat of course, in normal times, the The Prime Minister pointed out that in a crisis the to depositor with money at call would come in and swoop away the gold, leaving the note-holder unsecured. In the first place no respectable bank would allow a crisis to run so far as to jeopardize its note issue; must have it never has been done.",41
184,Mr FRANK FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,What about the crisis in America?,41
185,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"It never has been done, and it never would be done. The banks have been, and are now, willing to make a further provision.' In 1901 the Australian Bankers' Conference submitted to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth some suggestions. Their first suggestion wasThe banks to issue their own notes under uniform Act, Treasury notes in Queensland to be discontinued. Maximum of notes to be limited to the amount of coin and bullion held by each bank in the wasCommonwealth.",42
186,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,But they went. further than that.,42
187,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I intend to quote the other suggestions. In 1901 the bankers said, "" We will hold a pound's worth of gold for every Â£ i note that we issue."" They felt so secure of their position that they said, "" If a great crisis comes, as it came before, and we are compelled to shut our doors, we shall have enough gold in hand to pay the notes at once."" That suggestion on their part ought to have received far more serious consideration than it did. Their second suggestion wasNotes to be a first charge. Of course, that idea is pretty well carried out in the legislation of most of the States. In Victoria, for instance, an Act was passed in 1887, and re-enacted in 1890, as the Banking and Currency Act No. 1164. Section 12 of part 2 of the Act saysNotes payable to bearer at sight or on demand issued in Victoria . shall in the event of such company being wound up or such firm or banker being insolvent be a first charge on the assets in Victoria of such company . . . not being the subject of any mortgage pledge lien charge or other security in favour of any other creditor.",42
188,Mr WEST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That relates to ""Victoria only.",42
189,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Yes . There is a similar enactment in each of the other States, but I have not had time to refer to the Statutes.",42
190,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The New Wales Act is even stronger, because the note is better than a first charge. It is unlimited liability on shareholders outside the assets.",42
191,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"We are now dealabove ing, I take it, with a suggestion to better the currency, and I am putting forward alternative suggestion which was made in 1901 by the bankers to the Commonwealth Government. Their first suggestion was keep a sovereign for every Â£ 1 note which they issued, so that if a bank issued million Â£ 1 notes, it would have a million sovereigns against them by contract with the Government, and when its coffers were reduced to a million of coin it would have to close its doors if such a horrible event ever occurred. Their second suggestionwas to make the notes a first charge on the assets, and I have been able to show what a the first charge, in effect, is in Victoria. The third suggestion which the bankers made to the Commonwealth Treasurer The notes of all banks to be exchangeable for gold at par at the chief banking office of any bank in the capital city of each State, and to be free of exchange at any banking office in the Commonwealth.",42
192,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That is the Canadian system.,42
193,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The banks have been greatly twitted with the fact that until recently their notes have not been free of exchange between one State and another. ,42
194,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That has been the case until recently.,42
195,Mr WEST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Unti l the Prime Minister delivered his speech at Gympie.,42
196,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"No, before that time.",42
197,Mr WISE,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,In Victoria exchange has been demanded within the past two months.,42
198,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I think that honourable members will admit that that was not altogether the fault of the banks. I wassurprised to find that their very liberal suggestion was made so long ago as 1901.,42
199,Mr WEST,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"They have talked a lot, but done nothing.",42
200,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"No . The banksmade some suggestions to the Commonwealth Government, but the latter took noaction. Their fourth suggestion wasGuarantee fund to be established under trust. Each bank to contribute 5 per cent, on its circulation. The funds to be invested in Federal securities, and income, less expenses, to be paid to the contributors for amounts respectively contributed.",42
201,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That is the Canadian proSouth vision.,42
202,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Evidently the an bankers founded their suggestions a good deal upon the Canadian system. I cannot understand why a guarantee fund over and the gold which they were to keepshould be required, but tney offered to proan vide it. Their fifth suggestion wasBanks to pay 2 per cent, per annum on their average note circulation. to The State Governments did not forget that little suggestion. I think that they have one all come down upon the note circulation"" for 2 per cent. I do not think that anybody has an objection to that. The issue of notes is a prerogative which the banks have no reason to expect to enjoy except in respect of the benefit which they do to the people of the States.",42
203,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,But the public pay the duty.,43
204,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Of course the public do everything j we understand that. At any rate the banks do not expect to get any profit out of the note issue. And, as I have shown, they do not. The Prime Minster stated that this is not a profit-making Bill ; that the points to be kept in view are that the public will be convenienced to a greater degree, and that great safety and security will be insured under this scheme. What I am trying to show is that the existing system is infinitely more convenient to the. public and infinitely securer than the system covered by the Bill. Another suggestion which I think it is not out of place to mention here, as we are dealing with the currency question, is the following, which is contained in the letter sent to the Government by the bankers in 1901An emergency Act to be passed for making notes throughout the Commonwealth legal tender for a period not exceeding six months at any one time. The Act to be dormant till called into force by the Governor General in Council at the request of a majority in number of the banks. Now many honourable members opposite have been making a great deal of the fact that in a crisis the Government have always to step forward and save the banks. The great crisis of 1893 was allowed to proceed to greater length than would have been permitted in any other civilized community. In that year the Government practically stayed the crisis. That, in my opinion, is always the proper action for a Government to take. It is the only authority which can effectually so act. I am not against the intervention of the Government in such circumstances. But we have to bear in mind what happens at such a time. The banks have a great number of deposits at call, and some deposits are continually maturing. Suppose that a large number of individuals suddenly lose confidence in an institution. They do not apprehend, perhaps, that if the institution is a good one, they will eventually lose their money. What they are afraid of at the moment is that some persons may get ahead of them, and obtain their gold, and that they will have to wait for months, perhaps for years, before they can secure gold or get any substantial payment. At the time of the great crisis the idea was very well put in the press in this way: "" If a great number of persons are assembled in the town hall, every one of them has the right to go out, but they have not all the right to go out at once. If they all attempt to go out at once there will be a catastrophe, and a panic."" So in the case of a financial panic we find the whole of the people wanting to' get their cash at once. Everybody is aware that the banks must invest money for long periods. It is not possible for depositors to get their money all at once, and therefore a panic occurs. Everybody rushes to get out his money, and who is going to say when a panic shall cease? The only possible authority to do so is the Government. I recommend the suggestion I quoted, to the serious attention of the Prime Minister. Having had a Jittle banking experience, I expected that one of the first things which the Commonwealth Government would do would be to introduce legislation dealing with panics.",43
205,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"In my speech I stated that that matter related to banking, and that later a Banking Bill would be brought in.",43
206,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I am glad to hear that statement, because it is a matter which needs to be considered very carefully. In order to safeguard the public, I further suggest that any bank requiring this assistance from the Government should be required to have had for at least three years prior to that date a Government audit, so that the Government may know when it is asked to extend this great consideration to a bank, that it is dealing with a solvent concern. The great curse to the better class of banks in the great trouble of 1893 was that, while some of them were not solvent, others worked out disastrously for the depositors. It was held at the time that if the panic had been stayed earlier many of the banks would have been saved, and a great deal of suffering would have been prevented. The subject should be dealt with in any comprehensive banking measure. If honourable members think that the notes issued by the private banks are not properly secured, they have only to ask the banks to properly secure them. The banks are prepared to keep a gold sovereign for every Â£ 1 note issued, and we shall be to blame if the bank note issue is not made absolutely safe. Except for what the Government may gain from the handling of some seven millions of money, I cannot see any proposal in the Bill which will benefit Aus- revolution ? tralia, while many of its provisions will do injury. In the first place, the Government note issue will lack elasticity. The Government will issue notes to an arbitrary amount, some Â£7,000,000 worth, and ,Â£7,000,000 worth of gold will be withdrawn from circulation to pay for them. The banks will have to give a sovereign for every Â£ 1 note they take. The present note system is elastic. The average circulation of bank notes is about Â£4,000,000. A great many notes are issued at busy times, such as harvest time, and sent into the country to the branches of the banks. The money is needed there then, and there is less temptation to steal notes than to steal gold. As the notes go out of use, they get back to the banks, and are withdrawn. This arrangement suits the public well. Until the Prime Minister had his interview with the bankers, I do not think that he knew that his proposal would deprive the banks, and therefore the public, of about Â£3,000,000 of what is called "" till money."" His first proposal was that there should be an issue of ,Â£4,000,000, but I think he did not know about the need for till notes until he had met the bankers.",43
207,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The honourable member in error. I have understood this system since 1893.,44
208,Mr KELLY,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The Prime Minister did currencynot learn anything from his meeting with the bankers.,44
209,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I should not like to think that. I find that I can always learn something from my interviews with others, though occasionally it is to my disness of a great country. advantage.",44
210,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I told the bankers that the issue would go up to Â£10,000,000 nations, within a few years. 1 said that without of any one asking me.",44
211,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I was frightened the of that. The admission is a very notegentlemen worthy one. We are on the road to ruin, but I did not know that the end was so near. If the Prime Minister did not learn anything from his interview with the In bankers, he may learn something from experience of other countries. I shall wander through long records, but shall congress tent myself with two or three extracts. In by France, according to Conant, the issue of creased paper money has cost the people about business Â£1,798,200,000.",44
212,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Since when? Since the,44
213,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That is what has been written off French bank notes in perhaps 150 years. Now the issue of notes is done through the Bank of France, which many persons regard as a State institution, though it is no more a State institution than is any of our banks. Its shares are held by private persons, and its profits are received by them, though the.bank is under Government control. I have no objection to the Government controlling the bank note issues; in fact, to do so is within the province of a Government, and Commonwealth banks wish it done. They would like it to be insisted that a sovereign should be kept for every Â£ 1 note issued. They also desire that in times of panic their notes should be made legal tender for a period not exceeding six months. According to the Prime Minister, the Commonwealth is to issue Â£10,000,000 worth of notes in no time.",44
214,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I said within a few years.,44
215,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The issue will amount to Â£100,000,000 before we are much older.  is sanction an issue of only Â£7,000,000.",44
216,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Le t me read what President Garfield said regarding paper Legal tender notes are the devil manifest in paper, for no ms.n can foresee what mischief they may do when they are once let loose. . There never did exist on this earth a body of men wise enough to determine by any arbitrary rule how much currency is needed for the busiThen on the 7th June, 1870, he saidIn the first place, it is the opinion of all and it is the almost unanimous decision all statesmen and financial writers, that no nation can safely undertake the supplying of its people with a paper currency issued directly by officers of the Government. And, to apply that principle to our own country, let me ask if believe it to be safe to subject any political party who may be in power in the Government to the great temptation of overissues of paper money in lieu of taxation? times of high political excitement, and on the eve of a general election, when the there might happen to be a deficiency not in the revenue of a country, and Conwere called upon to supply that deficiency additional taxation, the temptation would be overwhelming to supply that deficit by an inissue of paper money. Thus the whole of the country, the value of all contracts, the prices of all commodities, the wages of labour, would all depend upon a vote in gress. For one, I dare not trust the great industrial interests of this country to certain and hazardous chances. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Pape r money won the battle of Waterloo for England, and the battle of .Gettysburg for Lincoln.",44
217,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I am surprised at the statement, because I have always looked upon the honourable member as a man of light and leading on financial questions. I could read similar extracts by the hundred, and I challenge honourable members to cite any favourable experience with State paper currencies. Queensland has a population of about 500,000, and her note issue goes back only a few years.",45
218,Mr KELLY,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Besides , Queensland is not an isolated country.",45
219,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"No . A rotten house can be kept standing if it has good buildings all round it. If the note issue of the State were doubled or trebled, there would probably be trouble there like there was in the Argentine. Reference has been made to Canada. I shall not quote figures, merely wishing to point out that the Canadian issue was not made voluntarily, it being forced on the Government. The bank note issue was in a rotten state, trade was stagnant, wages were down to next to nothing, and the population was starving. Therefore, the Government had to interfere. What it should have done was to say to the banks, ""You must either get proper security for your notes, or of business."" That is what we should do. The Canadian note issue has been only partially' successful. The people are depreciate not satisfied with it, and eventually, no doubt, what will be done will be to require the auditing of the books of banks desirbut ing Government protection in times of crisis, and to allow such banks as may be confice sidered reliable to issue notes against gold.",45
220,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The honourable member keeps coming back to what the Government should do.,45
221,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The Government twitted of a country is, after all, established for mary producers of meat, wool, hides, and the benefit of its people.",45
222,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,And so is the currency.,45
223,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That is so. Any other statement would be ridiculous. What we are asked to consider is whether the public is better served by the present note issue than it would be by that proposed by the Government. The need for the elasticity of a note system is a difficult thing to grasp thoroughly, but I think Con- have shown that there can be no elasticity such unwith the Commonwealth issue, whereasthere is great elasticity with the present issue, under which, when notes are nolonger required by the public, they disappear. Under this arrangement the people are not robbed of their gold. The honourable member for Denison said that there is not nearly enough gold in the country to do its business. Well, the proposed issue of Commonwealth notes would make things worse, because it would keep a large amount of gold out of circulation. Now when a note is redeemed the sovereign which protected it goes into circulation. The subject is one which requires a lot of thinking, and the advantage which itselasticity gives the present system is onewhich should not be lightly passed over. I wish now to refer to the question from, the point of view of the civil servantsThere is no doubt that the civil servants: will be paid in these Australian notes, and if they should become depreciated they may have to be content with 15s., or, perhaps, only ios., for their jQi.",45
224,Mr WISE,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The credit of the country must be very poor if the honourable member thinks he is justified in crying stinking fish in that way.,45
225,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I challenge the honourable member to mention any country in the civilized world where a paper currency has not depreciated. go out Mr FRANK FOSTER - The Queensland Treasury note has not depreciated.,45
226,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not wish to this country-n o man less. I am a loyal Australian to the back-bone,I do wish to warn my fellow countrymen and women against this terrible sacriof the credit of the country. The civil servants will be paid in these Australian notes for certain; they cannot refuse them, because they will be legal tender, paid by their employers. They must take them whether they are good or bad. I am often with the fact that the great pri1 tallow, in the Argentine, are placed at a great advantage as compared with Australian producers, since they pay their employees in the depreciated notes of the country, and in silver, and receive gold for their produce. It has always seemed to me that, from the employers' point of view, that is a splendid thing; but what about the poor worker? The honourable member for Flinders has just reminded me that the I salaries of members of Parliament will be paid in these Australian notes which may ""become depreciated. The Argentine is a rich country, and we should not hesitate - to learn a lesson from it. I do not spurn the experience of other countries as some honourable members do. The premium on ..gold in the Argentine is something like 400 per cent., and workers there are invariably paid in depreciated notes, whilst the producers get gold for their produce. They are thus able to produce with what is practically sweated labour much more cheaply - than can the primary producers in a country where business is done on a gold basis. 'Though I am a primary producer in Australia, I hope that that kind of thing will not occur here, and that every man who does a pound's worth of work in Australia will receive a sovereign for it. The system of currency we have in operation at present, properly safeguarded by Government control, with which I entirely agree, is the best system to adopt. I should like to direct the attention of honourable members to what happened to the Indian pensioners. They had a contract with their - Government, and one would think that nothing could be more sacred, which stipulated that they should be paid in rupees. The rupee was at the time worth 2s., but its value has since fallen to is. 3d. or is. 4d., and,, as a result, these Tndian pensioners, who after bearing the heat and burden of the development of the country expected to pass their declining days in peace and - comfort, receive only is. 3d. or is. 4d. for every 2s. which is due to them.",45
227,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,As the result of a metallic depreciation?,46
228,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Yes .,46
229,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Is the depreciation of gold utterly impossible?,46
230,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Is not a paper currency much more likely to depreciate than a silver currency? I mention the case of Ihe Indian pensioners as a striking example of what we may expect from this proposal.,46
231,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Migh t I say that our silver is in exactly the same position.,46
232,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"That may be so, but the honourable gentleman is aware that, In Australia, silver is only legal tender up to a very small amount.",46
233,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,U p to Â£ 2 .,46
234,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Yes , and that is what protects us. Spain has an unenviable reputation in connection with its currency, and if we are to adopt the Spanish system of finance we shall have troops of speculators coming here from all parts of the world to take advantage of it. I beg honourable members to pause, and think seriously about the proposal now made. We have a currency which has done splendid work in Australia. We have an offer from the banks to secure that currency on a gold basis of pound for pound. The only advantage to be derived from the proposal now before the House, though I do not regard it in that light, is that the Government may be able, under it, to secure some Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to play with. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is all we are asking; we will hold the reserves.",46
235,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The Government would do much better if they adopted the straightforward course of asking for a loan. It is expected that Australia will continue to be a borrowing country for generations to come. The spirit of our people is well known; and we can employ, not only our own money, but the money of other countries. I ask honourable members to consider the enormous accumulation of wealth in older countries which must be put to use somewhere. If those accumulated funds do not come here to stimulate our industries, they may go to the Argentine, to America, or to Canada. If we shut out that money we shall be shutting out people as well, because people must follow . capital. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Capita l follows people.",46
236,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The honourable member is at liberty to put it any way he likes. If these accumulated funds are not invested in Australia we shall not only lose the benefit which must follow from the spending of the money here, but must put up with the drawback of its expenditure in countries which are our competitors in the markets of the world. We shall be in the position of an army cut off from its treasury chest, because competing countries are our enemies in trade. It cannot be doubted, that if the accumulations of wealth in the older countries of the world are invested in countries which are our competitors it will have a very prejudicial effect upon ours. It has been said that this is not a party question, and I agree that it was not made a party issue at the last elections. I can say that I never heard about it at all during the elections. I do beg the Government to take the matter seriously into their consideration, and to agree to appoint a Royal Commission to look into it. Do not let us do this thing in a hurry. Surely Australia is not in urgent need of Â£4,0.30,000 or Â£5,000,000. A man of the commercial experience of the Minister of Home Affairs should be able to get Australia round a little corner like that. This proposal involves a great change of principle and a change from a system which has served Australia well, and which might be made under Government control to serve Australia much better in the future. We are in this measure taking a leap, I cannot say in the dark, because we have the light of the experience of other countries to guide us, and it shows that disaster has followed the adoption of similar proposals elsewhere. I again ask the Government to give the matter further consideration, and have the question thoroughly considered by a Royal Commission before this Bill is taken to a further stage.",46
237,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Hindmarsh) [8.40]. - I hope that the House will not deal with this question from a party point of view : at any rate to the extent of misleading the public outside. The currency, both metallic and paper, is certainly one of the most important matters with which Parliament can deal. The history of our own country has shown-and we do not require much proof of it-that it .is the working classes who suffer most from any tampering with the currency which has injurious effects. We are credited by honourable members opposite with knowing very little about the subject we are debating to-night. All I have to say in reply is that, it would be singularly unfortunate for the Labour party in Australia to hold any unsound principles of finance, because it is the workers upon whom they depend who would suffer most as the result. But, instead of having any fear in that direction, I am prepared to support the Bill with a very light heart feeling as convinced as I am I am speaking that Australia has nothing to fear, and everything to gain, from it The last speakei quoted from the late President Garfield. What I protest against in this debate is the practice of quoting from the speeches of public men and writers without giving the full text of their observations, and without reference to the circumstances in which they were made. President Garfield, for instance, when he made the remarks which have been quoted, was speaking at a time when there was a very strong feeling as to whether a gold or a silver standard should be adopted in America. The silver gang were anxious that the silver standard should be adopted, whilst sound men, as they have been all over the world for the last 600 years, were in favour of a gold standard. The gold men won, to the honour and credit of the United States. The late President Garfield was at the time referring to the paper issue which had been in existence in the United States, and which he condemned, the inconvertible paper currency-the American greenback. In reply to the statement that paper currencies have always broken down, let me say that I know of only three instances in which that has occurred. The first was at the time of the French Revolution, when the assignats were backed with the property of the aristocracy of France. That was the main security behind the inconvertible paper then issued. But let us have a little charity in referring to these things. We should ask ourselves what France had to go through during that terrible trouble. 1 should give very little credit to any man who would point the finger of scorn at the French in such a terrible misfortune. It was not surprising that, in the circumstances, the French should have made a big mistake in the issue of paper money. If we take again the instance of the United States of America, honourable members opposite have little to be proud of in their references to the paper currency of that country. Will they J:ell me how the Federal Government of the United States could have carried on that four years' war, or how they could have won at Gettysberg, Vicksliurgh, and Fort Hudson, and driven the Southerners back, without their paper issue ? Let us take pleasure in the fact that in our own country we have never had to face a disaster so terrible. God grant we never will, for I do not know what our statesmen would do in such circumstances. We that should judge by the circumstances of each case; and the American greenback has - no more to do with the question before us than has the man in the moon.",47
238,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The greenback preserved the Union !,47
239,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Quite so-it put the Southern insurrection down.,47
240,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,And the French assignats saved the liberties of Europe!,47
241,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I quite agree with the honourable member. But my argument is that these were exceptional cases, brought about by great convulsions; and honourable members have no right to speak to the people of Australia of a possibility that they may suffer because it is now proposed to have a Government note issue. Whatever side of politics we may be on, we have no right to use language or make speeches calculated to induce our countrymen and countrywomen to feel that any weakness in our financial institutions, or the proposals of the Government, are likely to cause the loss of their small earnings and investments. ought to be some things above party warfare, and this is one of them. I do not speak with much authority as to the Argentine note, but from what I have read that note is practically issued by land syndicates and made a legal tender. It is utterly impossible to have a note issue based on land or anything else but gold, and I have no - doubt that, if we knew the truth, the Argentine note is a swindle, as land jobs - generally are. And we need not go to the Argentine to find land swindles; we may find them nearer home. I dare say that many honourable gentlemen opposite would be quite prepared to let the Government, or anybody else, bring out a note issue in support of a land transaction; but, in any case, such notes have nothing to do with'the subject before us. The best argument of honourable members opposite lies in their question, why we desire to make an alteration now when, as they say, everything is going smoothly and we are all 'happy. I am rather inclined to think, however, that things in Australia are not so satisfactory as they ought to be; and, because of that, I am prepared to support this Bill. There is one fact that appeals, not to rich merchants, great commercial men, or traders, but to thousands and thousands of men and women who work all over this country. Until the Prime Minister made his Gympie speech, the banks charged 2J per cent, for cashing their own notesa piece of barefaced plunder.",47
242,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,It is exchange.,48

249,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"It is worse than I thought.  5 per cent, on one's own cheque.",48
250,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Is this anything but impudent, barefaced robbery ? It is There because the Government have given certain power into the hands of the banks that we are at the banks' mercy. They have the currency practically in their own hands, though it is sanctioned by the King's Government. The note issue is purely a banking control, and workmen who have to travel from State to State have to pay this charge, although the notes are the banks' own. Honourable members opposite have said, "" Do not forget what you are losing; if you pass this Bill the States of Australia will lose Â£80,000 a year."" It strikes me, however, that the banks get that Â£80,000 out of the public before they pay it over to the States. This plunder of ?l per cent, has nothing in common with the exchanges between country and country; no honourable member on the other side will tell me that it is anything like the exchange in high commerce; indeed, high commerce could not bear it. It may further be asked, why make a noise about this charge of T.\ per cent, when it Has disappeared? But why did it disappear? It disappeared simply because of the Prime Minister's Gympie speech; and we have no guarantee whatever, if this Bill were withdrawn and a Royal Commission appointed, that it would not be re-imposed tomorrow or next month. So far as I am concerned, I shall give the banks no chance to re-impose this charge; I believe, with Bismarck, that the best policy is to hold our position strongly, and not give the "" other fellow "" a chance. That is my chief reason for supporting the Bill.",48
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Is that all ?,48
252,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"No , it is not. It is very desirable that, as the Crown holds the metallic currency, it should also hold the paper currency. I can see no reason for a distinction; and when the Government are backing up the paper currency with a 25 per cent, gold reserve",48
253,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,It is not sufficient.,48
254,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Before I sit down I shall quote an authority, who holds that the gold reserve should be 33 per cent., or one-third, but I have no doubt that 25 per cent, is ample on a note issue of this character. Our friends opposite ask why we should interfere with the banks when they are perfectly sound and everybody prosperous. But I do not know that everyof body is prosperous.",48
255,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The Prime Minister says so.,49
256,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Then I hope the Prime Minister is correct. There are tain fixed principles in this world; though we may change our language and our civilization very largely, and do great many things, banking we shall ways have with us. Right down to the earliest times we find, in every civiliza- "" Just you wait."" tion, some' system of banking. What is the principle of banking? A banker is a dealer in credit, and he must not deal dead securities. That principle was true of - the Bank of Venice, of the Bank of Genoa, and of the Bank of Amsterdam, and it is true of the Bank of England day, and should be true of every bank Australia. Do the Australian banks in dead securities, or in live securities? do not know, but I do know that before 1893 they dealt in a good many dead as securities. There are very large land and financial associations and companies in tralia-ther e are some in my own State-th organized capital of which exists for the purpose of dealing in dead securities; I ask whether there is not keen competition between these companies and the banks. Are there any of the more spirited of banks that are not dealing very largely in dead securities? To what extent that going on? I do not know. The honourable member for Fawkner said he will was very anxious there should be a Gociation. vernment audit of the books of the banks, and so am I . If I had my way, I should not allow a bank trade that was not subject to a ment audit. I have no objection to private, independent auditors being employed well; but the people of this country ought to know, as it is their only security, there is a genuine and not a sham audit. make no charge against the banks. My security, position is that I do not know. Honourable members opposite-the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Fawkner-ma y be able to tell me to what extent Australian banks deal in dead secuas rities. In proportion as they do so deal, they are not as stable as they should be. AVe know that the banks have in the past dealt in dead securities; they may do so again, and it is the duty of this Parliament to give the most effective guarantees to the issue of gold it would disappear. people of Australia against a panic such is as occurred some years ago. We cannot, course, prevent a panic, but we can take means to very quickly bring it to a close. There has been a great deal of talk about the present bank notes being a first charge upon the banks. Of what value is that toa poor man with a bank note in his pocket cerand the bank door shut? The honourable and, member for Fawkner would say, "" My . good man, do not worry, the. notes are a a first charge on the bank."" ^ But ,"" the alman says, "" I want to change the note""; and to this the honourable member replies, During the waitingthere is always some spirited enterprising-, individual who comes along and is ready .toin offer 18s. for the note. Honourable members opposite-, when they deal with a subject of this character, show that they are not acquainted with the real factstoconcerning the lives of the working in people of Australia, who . largely havedeal to do with the creation of theI wealth of the country. Of course, the note is ultimately redeemed; but so long: we have banks issuing notes, so long will it be possible for people to be placed in theAusposition I have indicated. And I contende that the Federal Parliament has no right to allow such a state of affairs to prevail. and That is the strongest argument in-, favour of a Government note issue. What will be the effect of that issue?the The effect will be that, throughout the length and breadth of the land, is Australian notes will supersede the private bank notes, and the Australian notes-be legal tender, with no fear of depreI was not only surprised, but pained, at the remark of - the honourable member for Fawkner that public servants to might be paid in Â£ 1 notes, which Governwould fall to the value of 15s. What could so depreciate the notes?' as Why do honourable members make such assertions? Let them give us some proof that of their statements ? Let them show us I why these notes, having behind them the integrity, honour, and prestige of the King's Government in Australia, together with a gold backing of 25 per cent.,, should fail ? Surely the honourable member for Fawkner, who has a reputation a commercial and business man, cannot believe that it is possible for such notes to depreciate? What would an over-issue-' of notes mean? It would mean that they would simply be returned to the Treasury. On the other hand, if there were an over-"" The bullion dealers would obtain possession of it and export it. Gold, when converted into sovereigns, is a standard and a measure of value; but it is also a commodity just as lead, wheat, or any other product of this country is. I could understand the contentions of some honourable members opposite if it were proposed to have an inconvertible paper currency. It is beyond the ingenuity of any man to ascertain the amount of an inconvertible paper currency that any country could absorb; but a State note issue with a gold backing is bound to work according to the principle to which I have referred. The older I get the more convinced I am that there is nothing new under the sun. When something that is believed to be new is proposed, we make a great noise and indulge in much beating of drums, as if it involved the coming of the end of the world, and yet when we inquire we find that that of which we are frightened was adopted perhaps hundreds of years before, and that nothing serious happened. No one is asking the banks to circulate notes at all. There is nothing in this Bill requiring them to do so. It is open to them to issue gold. They will be under no penalty-and I would be the last to suggest they should be-for doing all their business upon a gold basis. If they wish to deal in notes, what will they have to do? They will have simply to go to the Treasury with a thousand pounds in gold and purchase notes to the extent of Â£1,000. That, we are told, assumes the force of law. I do not think it does. What is the difference between what the Government is proposing to do, and what the goldsmiths of London, of the Netherlands, and the Low countries did in the middle ages before banks had commenced operations? In those days it was neither convenient nor safe to walk about the streets of London, or of any other big city with a quantity of gold in one's possession. There was not the efficient police force we have today, and the man who did such a thing ran a good chance of receiving a crack on the head and being robbed of his gold. In such circumstances, therefore, men took their gold to the goldsmiths, who issued certificates to them, with which they were able to trade. The certificates of the goldsmiths of the Netherlands were good in London, just as the cheques of a well known firm, or the notes of the Bank of England, are. Mr KING O'MALLEY - O r a bill of exchange.",49
257,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not know so much about bills of exchange. Everything depends upon whose they are. There is really 110 difference between these goldsmiths' certificates and the notes which the Commonwealth proposes to issue. We have practically been travelling in a circle since those days. This practice on the part of the goldsmiths was really the origin of the banking institutions. The Venetians saw that they could do as the goldsmiths did in issuing certificates. They therefore accepted their customers' money, traded with it, ancl whenever their customers wanted it,, it was there for them. It was, in reality, a banking principle, and a principle that still holds good. I can see no objection,, but one, to this Bill. There can be nodoubt that the real reason for the objection of the Opposition to it springs largely from party considerations, ancl from what I describe as the conservative instinctsof the British people. We get into a certain groove and find it hard to leave it. Our fathers were in the same groove and we have followed them. It may be clearty demonstrated to the people that they can do better by taking a new course, but they do not like to get out of the old rut. We on this side know, for instance, that a proposal may be made to interfere with the customs and habits of the working people, and that although there is not very much in it, the very fact that it will mean a change of custom will cause those who make the proposition to experience far more trouble in carrying it into effect than they would have in bringing about a change of a more serious character. You may tax the people indirectly to the extent of ios. per head, and they will not make one-tenth of the noise that they will do when ycu propose to interfere with one of their settled custom's. We have become accustomed to a banking system which is part and parcel of bur Australian life. The banks, of course, have been issuing notes for benevolent reasons ! They are very benevolent institutions! I have not had any practical experience, but those of my friends who have do not tell me tl at they found them benevolent. Honourable members opposite, however, say that the banks have been flooding Australia with their notes, and have lost money in doing so. They say that the note issue has been a nuisance to the banks",50
258,Mr SCULLIN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Ye t they do not like losing it. .. Mr ARCHIBALD - And yet they do not like losing it. I am inclined to think that it has been a very good business line for them; that it has paid them well, and their noise today reminds me of the complaint of Demetrius the silversmith, and the cry, "" Great is Diana of the Ephesians."" I hope honourable members of the Opposition will take up my challenge, and point to any country having a note issue similar to that proposed by this Government- a note issue with a gold reserve behind it-that has suffered from such a system. - I am not referring to an issue of inconvertible paper money. It is not to our. credit to refer to our neighbours who have had the misfortune to have to face such an issue. What I ask honourable members opposite to do is to quote a parallel case to our own, and give any sane reason why a similar note issue should depreciate to 15s. in the Â£ 1 . I know of no such case, and I do not think that any honourable member of the Opposition is prepared to take up my challenge.. Many authorities have been referred to during this debate, of certain of whom I do not think much. Tn fact, I am inclined to believe that 'some of those who quoted them are greater .authorities than the authorities they quoted. I take this opportunity, however, of calling attention to a passage from a work by Thorold Rogers, the Oxford professor of political economy who enjoyed the distinction of being a Radical, and lost his chair because he was. He was succeeded by another man, but Oxford found it necessary to'reinstate him, because a better man could not be secured. He is the only political economist of whom I know who puts labour first and capital and land second. I have been familiar with his works for agreater number of years than I should like to mention, and I have never seen anything that he has written challenged or refuted. I wish that the young men of Australia would undertake to make themselves familiar with the works of Thorold Rogers. If they did so, they would lay down for themselves a foundation of knowledge that would be useful to them in every walk of life, and they would at least have the pleasure of holding sound views on important questions of today. It is a mistake to imagine that principles are not enduring. Undoubtedly principles are lasting. It is only when one gets away from them and comes to questions of expediency that one goes astray. The principles relating to the question with which we are dealing-the principles underlying currency and banking-ar e as true today as they were a thousand years ago. I quote the following from the chapter on "" Paper Currencies,"" in Professor Thorold Rogers' work, The Economic Interpretation of HistoryThe ingenuity of modern society is turned in all directions towards making its metallic currency as efficient as possible, and it strives with' equal assiduity to make its paper currency as efficient as possible. It follows, therefore, that bankers cannot put more paper money into circulation than the public need. If they make an excessive issue, the excess comes back instantly to themselves, as the parties responsible for the engagement which the note implies. Again, if the community requires more paper currency than the banks are able or willing to give, either by legal restraint or by caution, the community wil l discover some paper substitute, which it will employ in lieu of notes. Thus, fifty years ago, bills drawn by the Manchester house of Jones, Loj'd, and Co., on the Lon-. don house of Jones, Loyd, and Co., performed all the functions of a note currency in Lancashire, and brought no small profit to the ingenious firm, of which the head was the late Lord Overstone. It . is sometimes alleged that paper currency has as effective an influence over prices as a metallic currency is admitted to have. But this is an error. Gold and silver influence prices when they are adopted as co-ordinate currencies in proportion to the cost at which they are acquired, the cost of acquisition being also affected by the cost of their production, when that cost conforms to the ordinary conditions under which industry is carried on. But neither cost of acquisition nor cost of production affect, to any sensible degree, the value of a note. Notes arc the representatives, the reputed equivalents of metallic money, and their acceptance and circulation at the full value of what they represent, depends on the conviction that they can bechanged into money at the pleasure - or convenience of the holder. If they cannot be so converted, and still keep up their full credit, as happened during the first eight or ten years of the Bank restriction of 1797, it is due to the fact that the public knows them to be amply covered, and, therefore, agrees to use them as currency at their full nominal value. If such an issue is in excess, or is not sufficiently covered, the note is sure to be discounted, as happened during part of the last ten years in which the restriction endured. But it is said, by virtue of discretionary power r f issuing notes, a bank can practically coin money, and so by supplying an excess of money, give occasion to wild speculation. This is a confusion between money, paper and metallic, and credit. If a bank could coin metallic money, it could as soon create an excess as it could by issuing notes. It would do nothing by such an act. If the money were in excess it could go out of the country. If the notes were, they would come back to the bank which issued them. No power can make any people take and circulate more money than they want. Of course, I do not mean that bankers should be allowed to circulate what paper they please. Banks can assist rash speculation by granting indiscreet credit, though there is less likelihood that they will do so than other traders will, foT it is a fundamental rule in banking to deal with easily convertible securities only. will discount a three months' bill having known names on it, because the security is short; it will not advance money, if it be wise, on the mortgage of real estate, however ample the security is, because the term is indefinite, or, in banker's language, a mortgage is a dead security. But banks may be deceived by fraudulent bills, or may be under the impression that the return will be quick, when it turns out to be delayed, or they may give credit to those whom they believe to be solvent, when they are not so. Credit may then raise prices, but it does so only because it is believed to be money, or to have money behind it. Generally, however, if not universally, the rising market precedes the indiscreet grant of credit, for the prospect of exceptional profit must needs go before the attempt to gain it. I do not deal with the cases in which credit is continued, after it is shown to be undeserved or incautious, where, I mean, the banker thinks that he can by timely help recover what is in danger. seldom successful, and is technically called throwing good money after bad. deal with fraudulent banking on the part of the banker. This is a crime, though it is not punished always as it deserves to be. speaking of business carried on by honourable and prudent men. Neither note issues nor credits can be based on anything but money, or upon securities convertible into money with the least conceivable delay. Suppose, for example, that a bank has liabilities in the shape of customers' balances, and notes to the extent of a million. have one-third of its liabilities ready at hand, in the shape of money, of Bank of England notes, or of deposits similar to those of its customers in the Bank of England or at call. may have another third in Government stocks, on which it can borrow if it needs, or sell. It may have advanced the residue on commercial bills, which, in a strait, are also negotiable, ' though not as speedily or as safely as the securities which I have referred to. What I desire to point out in regard lo that passage is this : Here is one of the greatest authorities who has written on this subject stating that the necessary reserve against a note issue should be not less than 33 per cent. I give due weight to that authority, but, at the same time, point out that it is held by many persons having practical knowledge that a reserve of 25 per cent, is ample. In fact - I have not the quotation with me just now, but I have been blessed with a good memory-Si r John Lubbock, now Lord Avebury, some ten years ago said that only 3 per cent, of gold was necessary for carrying on the normal trade of England. In other words, 97 per cent, of the transactions of England can be conducted with not more than 3 per cent, of gold. To be fair to the House, I have quoted the opinion of Thorold Rogers putting the margin at 33. per cent., but nevertheless I feel convinced that 25 per cent, is ample security. There Thus a bank is one matter which I should like the Government to take notice of. As the honourable member for Fawkner has suggested, there may be times of crisis and panic. I hope we shall never see such times again in Australia. But still they may occur. What is possible then? In such an emergency the Government would easily be able to get over the difficulty that occurred if there were a section in the Act such as the Prime Minister has promised to consider and deal with later on. I hope that he will deal with it speedily. Personally, I think that no harm would be done if such a provision were placed in this Bill. There should be power for the Governor General, after the Treasurer of the Commonwealth had consulted with two or three of the leadThe effort is ing bankers, to declare Commonwealth Nor do 1 notes legal tender for three or six months. If this power ought to be intrusted to the Government, why should we leave it to be I am dealt with later on? We never know when unfortunate events may happen. A crisis might occur when Parliament was in recess Of course, if Parliament were sitting, I have not the slightest doubt that a Bill would be put through as speedily as posI t should sible. But it is not wise to take the risk of having to collect members of Parliament from all parts of Australia to deal with an emergency. We have an example It in the case of the Bank of England. The Bank of England is looked upon-and rightly-as one of the greatest and soundest. banks in the world. I thoroughly believe that it is so. I have always pinned my faith to the Bank of England. It may be regarded as being partly a State bank, though it is really under the control of a' number of proprietors, who draw ample dividends from its trading. To all intents and purposes it is in a real sense what its name implies-the Bank of England. Its Governors have on all occasions given wise counsel to various Chancellors of the Exchequer, and it has always been an advantage to them to be able to consult with the managers of this great institution. What has been the case in regard to bank notes in Great Britain? I will not go into'the history of Peel's Act, but honourable members may know that Sir Robert Peel acted upon the advice of Lord Overstone in framing that measure. Lord Overstone mixed up the cheque system., which he had originated, with the note issue of the bank. T suppose it was feared that there might be an overof issue of notes, and therefore the note issues were restricted. The power to issue notes was taken from country banks and in the trusted to the Bank of England. AH the banks that went out of trading, so far as Bill goes through. their right to issue notes was concerned, handed over to the Bank of England the right to take up the notes which they had been in the habit of issuing before they closed down that part of their business. Power was also given to the Chancellor the Exchequer to suspend the bank charter arid to allow other things to be done the approval of the Government, in order to meet a financial crisis. Sucli a crisis, and this is within my recollection, occurred in 1859. Another crisis occurred, as I recollect well, in 1867, when the. banking firm of Overend, Gurney, and Company smashed. Those monwealth bank. who were born in London and were living and working there at that time, well know what panic and disaster occurred. At time Mr Gladstone gave authority to suspend the charter of the Bank of England. to do so. He authorized the issue of Â£1,000,000 in notes, with the result that the rush was right stopped. Within three hours after the news party is was circulated the panic was at an end. Prime Minister, That shows the advantage of a power of gramme, like thathaving this character.

259,Mr FRANK FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,In propping up private issue.,53
260,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"The fact that a private note issue was sustained is the point. The saving of the credit of the State prevented an immense amount of suffering to comparatively poor people. It is no doubt true that the proprietors of the banks were for most part rich men. I do' not wish it be understood that I desire rich men lose their money, but 1 do say that the loss of a thousand pounds to a rich man is not more than equivalent to the a pound to many a poor man. It is the poor who suffer most in times of financial crisis. The workers feel the pinch. I ask Prime Minister and the Attorney-General to look carefully into this matter before the The Government know that I am not an alarmist. I do not say that any crisis is likely to happen. But I should like to safeguard the interests of the people in a matter of this kind just as if we were actually faced by a crisis. I of intend to support the measure. I give a hearty support to it. The only other point with which I have to make in regard to it is that, in my opinion, the Government will find that there is an element of weakness in their proposal, inasmuch as a currency of this kind should be attached to a bank. I believe that the Government are strongly in favour of the establishment ot a ComBut I venture to say that, whether they like it or not, the very fact of the issue of these notes will compel that them to take steps in that direction.

G. B. EDWARDS (North Sydney) [9.29] - In rising from this side of the a House to give my hearty support to the measure now under consideration, I desire to say that the ""main principle underlying not it is one to which I can give complete adherence. I can do so in full consistency with views that I have previously expressed in this House and elsewhere, and also in consistency with views that I expressed be the fore the electors. My only regret is that to the extension of my support to the Bill to brings me out of accord with my own party. But it is one of the glories of our party that we can differ as to details and yet work loss together for a common end. The Bill before us is one of the measures which, whatever Government were in office, would have had to be enacted. Its aim is to secure national control over the currency of the country. As to the exact means by which this control should be - exercised there may be a variety of opinions. Upon the details of the Bill itself I hold the right to differ from the Government. But as a matter of principle, I hold that the Government of the Commonwealth ought to control the currency; and if there be any profit-thoug h the Bill is not introduced for that reason-it should ibelong to the Commonwealth. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to take this step in the interests, and for the protection, of the people, and to enable the - commercial operations of - the whole community to be carried on with safety and - confidence. I believe that no man in this House has a greater right to call himself a Nationalist than I have. It is sometimes claimed by honourable members opposite that it is their distinction to be Nationalists. Perhaps there is something in diat contention. I have had to regret that the party with which I have been associated in politics have inclined too little towards Nationalism in their view of some questions which must necessarily come before this Federal Parliament. In defining my own Nationalism I take the Constitution that has been given to us by its framers, the fathers of our Federation, and I say that, within the ambit of that Constitution, I am prepared to exercise every right which it confers upon us. Not only would I do so much, but I think it - distinctly necessary that we should. The framers of the Constitution had thoroughly considered what they were doing. They allotted certain powers to this Parliament. It was not intended that those powers should remain in the Constitution without ever being exercised. Therefore, I fully approve of the Prime Minister's brief statement, that the Bill is well within the four corners of the Constitution, and that it had evidently been intended by the founders of the Federation that this particular power should be exercised at some time. I ask myself this question, "" Can it be considered that the Government are acting too hurriedly, if nearly ten years after the Federation was inaugurated they come to the Parliament and ask for wide powers to institute a. national currency and take control of it?"" And I am forced to admit that if it was ever intended to exercise the power, and I believe that it was, the sooner it is exercised the better for us, and, as I hope, before I sit down, to be able to show, the better for the banks, too. I have lo admit that, theoretically, I go almost further than the most advanced member of the Labour party in my notions about money. I am a paper man. I believe that paper is the money of civilization, that the higher the civilization the more paper it will use, and that the highest civilization will use nothing but paper. At the same time, I recognise that in the case of many theories which we have it is not expedient, probably not safe, to put them into execution before the world is ripe for them. I feel very certain that this question of paper money is becoming more and more important, and that the world is growing gradually more and more willing to listen to the arguments of those great thinkers who have been pressing it upon its consideration. The whole question is undergoing a rapid transition. There are many theories of currency which are now developing, and which may shortly be expected to crystallize, into generalizations of law, and on these we can found by deduction from history, experience, and commerce, legislation which will enable us to use only paper money, and yet be thoroughly sound. The argument of my honourable friends on this side is that all history is strewn - with the wreckage of many currency systems based upon paper. That is only too true; but if we went on a railway line and saw a. lot of wreckage, would we condemn the system of railway travelling? On the contrary, would we not ask, "" Has there not been some defect in the locomotives which produced this disastrous effect ?'' So it is with regard to paper money. The honourable member for Fawkner has given a number of historical instances where paper money has been unsuccessfully used. He has given, or briefly referred to, other instances where it has been unsuccessfully used at a period in a nation's stress, when it had to be used for national preservation. I shall be able to show that without its use it would have been impossible to preserve the union of the mightiest Federation that speaks our tongue. But we must not ""take the defects of a system for the system itself, and we must ask whether the laws which the advocates of paper currency point out must be observed have been observed in those instances where the currency has notoriously failed. I take it to be almost axiomatic that a paper currency without an ounce of gold backing, made a definite legal tender, and not issued in excess of the requirements of the community for whose service it is issued, can never fail, and that the reason why paper currency has failed, as it has notoriously failed, has been that in nine cases out of ten it has been issued in excess of the requirements of the country-throug h the exigencies of unwise or unjust Governments - and so has brought disaster. But, in any case, we can get a good system of currency in a variety of ways. This evening the honourable member for Fawkner pointed out several ways by which we could make an arrangement with the banks to get a thoroughly sound system of currency, and said that the banks were ready to meet us and make some such provision. In the Library I can find works by very able, general writers on this subject, who point to the fact that, the world, there are fourteen or fifteen different systems of currency based upon this or based upon that-tw o metals, one metal - and all of them operating with fair success. It is not in these differences that we can find any assurance of the success of a currency. But we can find it in the honesty of a Government, and while the failure in the past has been notoriously attributed to the dishonesty of Governments, in my opinion we are approaching in the world's history a period when we can rely upon the honesty of a Government to control this great engine of commerce, and to make it safe and firm for all the purposes ofmodern civilization. If it is stated by the speakers from this side that the banks can regulate the currency of the nation better than can the National Government, why should not the banks, as the last speaker asked, control the metallic currency ? In a minor degree the same circumstances exist. They say that there is a large profit on the paper currency. There is a considerable profit on the silver currency, which I had to fight for years in this House to get. It is only a question of degree whether we should take the profit of a forced loan on the silver currency or whether we should take the profit of a forced loan on a paper currency.",53
262,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"After all, there is no forced loan. We cannot get enough silver for the people's requirements.",55
263,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I am using words which have been used in argument against the Bill. If the banks can control the necessary paper currency, so much better than can the National Government, then certainly the former can control the metallic currency better than* can the latter. I had the pleasure of seeing with you, sir, the other day, the famous Mitchell Library, a treasure house of all the important documents and articles which refer in any way to the history of Australia.' In that magnificent and rich collection, bequeathed to the nation by one of its most patriotic citizens, there is a number of old colonial tokens, nearly 300 of them, and many of which I remember using. In the far away days of my boyhood those copper coins were legitimate currency - We accepted them one from the other, they passed like wildfire amongst us, and served the purposes of currency very fully. But there came a time when a panic set in about these tokens, and the Government had to step in and stop the issue of them. Now they in would have been as sound as gold or paper so long as the national faith in them had been kept up. Again the very cause of their downfall was the over-issue of them, and just as the private tradesmen in over issuing copper coins brought them down like a house of cards, so any Government which over-issued paper could bring clown that system. If we were to adopt some of the suggestions made to us by the. opponents of the Bill, and simply seek to leave the benefits of the paper currency with the banks, we could arrange, as they suggest, with the banks to give so much a year to the Federation for the right to issue the paper money, subject to such control as the Government or the Legislature chose to impose. But, then again, if that is sufficiently good, why not sell the right to issue the metallic currency ? I undertake to say that no honourable member on either side of the House, and no member of the community, would agree to the nation handing over \o< the banks the control of the metallic currency which is already exercised by the Federal Government. Now the authorities in favour of State control are not so few as some of my honourable friends think when they quote the names of this, that, and the other great writer and politician in favour of it. Mr Gladstone, than whom I should say we could not have a better authority, was not only a great thinker, but the most practical statesman whomEngland has seen for the past century, at any rate, in dealing with State financial and banking questions. When the bank charter was being revised.in 1866, Mr Gladstone said distinctlyAll the profits of the bank-note issue belong to the State, and, what is more important than the profits, the responsibility of issue belongs ..State. I had marked a long passage by John Stuart Mill to quote, but the honourable member for Richmond saved me the trouble by reading it the other afternoon in a speech to which, by the way, I should like to bear my testimony of appreciation, although I differ from his deductions. It was a splendid speech coming from a new member, and the House is to be congratulated upon having as one of its members, a gentleman who displayed such a wide knowledge of his subject and dealt with it so ably. . In reading the passage to the House the honourable member set forth how Mill admitted that the convenience of this system of paper credits was so growing that the profit from it was great and likely to be greater. Mill went on to say that that being so, he thought that the profit should belong to the State, and later he modified that opinion somewhat by the statement that if in the multitude of the very onerous duties which Governments find themselves compelled to discharge they found sufficient time to deal with this matter, he thought that they ought to do so. He made that qualification, and also a further suggestion, similar to the one which has been made from this side, that the Government might go to a bank and say, "" We give you power to issue so much paper money under certain restrictions as to reserve and so forth, provided that you give us Â£14,000,000 without interest."" That, however, was only one way of getting both control and profit, but the honourable member for Richmond drew the deduction that Mill's whole argument was in favour of the latter course. I say it was not, because Mill states that if the Government, with its multitudinous and onerous duties, thinks it right to take the matter up, it should do so. I. should like to point out the real political character of Mill. He was the chief exponent of the laissez-faire system, and when a man, who wishes to restrict government action in all directions, says that the Government may do this, it is fairly safe to assume that he really meansthat the State ought to take the matter up. The honourable member for Richmond, who spoke of the honourable member for Calare cutting his quotation .too short, did not notice a further reference to this question, in which Mill, after pointing out the success which had attended the'; operation of to the the Scottish banks- a system somewhat similar to the Australian-and saying that if they could get that system in England it would be much better than the one then in force there, added that the experience in England of the working of these joint stock banks showed it to be so notoriously rotten that he hesitated to say whether they would be found safe enough south of the Tweed. I have not given Mill's own words, because the extract is very long, but that is absolutely their effect. I think, therefore, it will be seen that Mill took up the position that it was a matter for grave consideration whether the whole control of this question should not .10 over to the State, but that it was a matter for no consideration whatever that the whole of the profits and the indirect control, at any rate, should be in the hands of the State. The movement of all political and philosophical thought since Mill's day has certainly been in the direction of enlarging, rather than restricting, the functions of government. I could go to other authorities, such as Ricardo, MCCullocli, and Thorold Rogers, who was referred to by the honourable member who preceded me, but I should like-to quote an authority nearer home, in Mr. Russell French, one of the gentlemen engaged in the management of these very banks. In 1897, very shortly after the big bank crisis, Mr Russell French said, among other thingsWhen abnormal conditions, such as periods of crisis, supervene, the Act of Parliament by which the issue is authorized has to be suspended in order to do away for the time being with the rigid regulations which prevent expansion. He then advocated the issuing of Federal notes, to become part of the securities held by the banks, and said furtherSuch a note, having Federal sanction, and resting, apart from the coin basis, on the credit of the whole Federation, would be a wholly satisfactory circulatory medium in ordinary times and for ordinary purposes of business, and would serve as a bulwark of no insignificant strength to resist and overcome the results of panic. . . . And as a practical consideration, it can scarcely be denied that a uniform note system common to the federated colonies, would conduce in some degree to the convenience of the public, and would be much more cheaply administered in the matter of working expenses. That is a big admission to get from one of the most prominent banking officials in Australia. Although I cannot find in our own Library the report of the Conference of Australian Chambers of Commerce at which this speech was made, I found, on looking it up at the Chamber of Commerce today, that while Mr Russell French admitted that the banks had, against apparent reason, been, successful in the past while carrying on business under State divisions, he foresaw that that success could not be expected in the future. He looked forward, like the rest of us outside, - to a time when Federation would come, and we should have a note common to the whole of the States, and means whereby the banks could use this note and still be in as satisfactory a position after they had lost the control of the currency as before, by reason of the other advantages obtained from Federation. I should like, in justification of my contention that this reform would be better for the banks in the long run, to refer to a work called Rational Money, by Professor Frank Parsons, of the Boston University. This very informative work was written at the request of certain thinkers in the United States, who were interested in the question, and its author, in addition to being Professor at Boston, was also Professor of Political Economy in Kansas, and the author of several works, well-known in America, on currency and banking. Dealing with the various schemes of currency reform and other propositions that have come before the public, he saysThere is another movement more to be regretted than either of those just named. I mean . the movement to retire the national notes and give the whole money field to the banks. Some people in the United States are contemplating a removal of the present national note, which is only a limited one, and the handing of the note issue over to the banks-the reverse of what the Prime - Minister is doing hereThe people are asked to retire completely from the money question. He objects to that, and saysIndeed, it may be confidently affirmed that if the people are to realise the fullest benefits of a wise monetary system, the banks must become public as well as the management of the money-volume. It is not absolutely essential - control credits in order to control prices, for the expansion and contraction of credits can be counteracted and overcome by a sufficient change in the money-volume. But it would be of great advantage to the people if loans and credits were managed in the public interest as well as the money-volume. But the chief extract I wish to make from this work isOur banks are organized for private profit, not for the public weal. In times of rising prices they naturally issue notes and extend credit to the extent of their power, thereby increasing the boom. Mr G. B. Edwards. I contend that that applies absolutely to Australian conditions today, applied to them just prior to 1893, and will apply for all time to them if the present circumstances continue, and prior to every panicIn times of falling prices they naturally withdraw their notes and credits in self-protection, thereby producingor intensifying depression and panic. They aid the rise of speculative excitement, and then in times of danger and collapse they withdraw their assistance from the peuple just when they need it most. To diminish public money and government action, and increase bank money and bank action, is to increase the instability of the money system, intensifying both speculation and panic, emphasize the evils of rising and falling prices, ancl place the entire control where it will be used for private gain and not for the public good. The whole machinery and management of money and credit constitute a most vital national interest, and should be put into the hands of trained public servants,, acting under careful regulations for the people's benefit. Even an ordinary government system would make loans' and discounts more difficult or contract them in times of speculative tendency, and in case of stringency would extend their loans instead of calling them in. In England and France the great quasi-public banks have adopted this policy to some extent with most beneficial results. I contend that if the power of issuing paper money is assumed by die National Government, in the long run the banks will benefit. Private banks should exist. I differ on this question from honourable members opposite, holding that currency and banking are separate, and that it is not necessary for the Government to engage in banking business. Banking exists for dealings in credit, which affect individuals mostly, and private institutions are the best for such purposes. When a run on a bank occurs during a financial crisis, it is not a question of getting 20s. for the - Qi note. The run commences with a demand for the repayment of deposits, and when the panic has lasted for some time, the note-holders become anxious, and begin to ask for gold for their notes. The banks, to preserve their prestige and solvency, must always protect their notes, but this lowers to their chance of staving off a financial crisis in respect to other greater and more important liabilities. We should relieve them of the duty of finding currency, leaving them free to keep up the ordinary credits required for the transaction of the commerce of the country, and able to exercise their necessary powers when they are most required, instead of restricting them. This has been found to be necessary in the case of the Bank of England. In an effort to remedy matters, the bank was divided into an issue and a banking department, but, as rmany financial writers have pointed 'out, 'things are now worse than ever, because - the credit of two institutions has to be propped up with such variable reserves as - each may have. The soundest position is for the nation to look after its currency,. leaving its banks to look after the credit - of its commerce and the advances which are necessary there for. The history of the Bank of England, the Bank of France, the Bank of Queensland, the Bank of New Zealand, and other institutions shows - that the tendency of the Government to take - control of the currency is steadily growing. Let me make a brief reference to an outline - of the history of the Bank of England, given in a lecture on the subject by a - bankerOn the 27th of July, 1694, a charter was -.granted to the "" Corporation of the Governor .and Company of the Bank of England,"" the management of the company being in the hands - of a governor, a sub-governor, and twenty-four - directors. The original capital of the companv '(Â£1,200,000) was subscribed by forty merchants - of the City of London, and the whole of it was 'lent to the Government at 8 per cent, per annum. The bank also received an annual allowance of Â£4,000 for administration expenses. In - these days, when the Government can borrow ;at 2^ per cent., this 8 per cent, looks a high Tate of interest; but in 1694 the Government 'had, when borrowing in the City, to pay from 10 to 15 per cent., besides paying a big commission. This loan of a million was the start - of the National Debt, which stands today at - over Â£750,000,000. The charter of incorporation was granted lo =the company for a period of ten years, and gave the bank the right to issue bank notes, payable - on_ demand, lo an amount not greater than its .paid-up capital. The charter has been renewed from time to time, and the powers of the company have been varied. At the commencement the bank had nothing behind it but the credit of the nation, and was, .to all intents and purposes, a - Government institution. As time has gone - en, its charter has been extended and amended, and more and more control has been exercised by the State. The bank has served its purposes well, but at its initiation had nothing behind its notes but a debt due by the Government.",55
264,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That is a very solid capital.,58
265,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"If a Government could be trusted by a bank, I should say that it could be lelied upon by a people. The Bank of England is one the most magnificent institutions of modern civilization, yet it has had to suspend payment, not once but several times, when Government have had to come to its assistance, either at their own initiative, or at the request of the directors, and make its notes, not legal tender, but non-convertible. This has been done from time to time illegally, and some honourable gentlemen propose that the same thing should be done here. Some of those on this side think that, to prevent panics, the Government should provide that bank notes should at any time, for a period not exceeding six months, be non-convertible, while honourable members opposite wish to apply those conditions to the Commonwealth notes. ' I do not consider that that is necessary. If we have not a currency which can be relied on to meet the ordinary needs of our commerce and trade without such methods, we should devise some other system. I believe that with the present system we can obviate some of the difficulties which honourable members foresee. At the present time the reserves of gold in the Bank of England fluctuate between Â£38,000,000 and Â£40,000,000, including the reserves of most of the banking institutions of Great Britain. The liabilities of these banks are roughly estimated at Â£1,000,000,000, showing how the gigantic operations of commerce are based upon a foundation of credit or of simple trust. We have a like position in Australia. Our paper currency, exclusive of the Queensland Government note issue, amounts to between Â£3.500,000 and Â£4,000,000, and our bank gold reserves to between Â£26,000,000 and Â£28,000,000; while there are from Â£43,000,000 to Â£50,000,000 on deposit at call, and other deposits, and liabilities accruing amounting to Â£70,000,000. Yet we are told that there are six sovereigns behind every Â£ 1 note issued by the banks. It is ridiculous to talk in that way. Such a reserve is not needed, and does not exist. The credits in commerce and trade, and the operations of a paper currency, are based on these gold reserves which have to support the two. If we have a simple, workable proposition, and an honest Government, we do not require any protection beyond the ordinary protection of convertibility, for purposes of expansion, provided for in this Bill.",58
266,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"You have, as against the deposit, bills discounted, and I remind the of honourable member that they balance.",58
267,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I know that the they must balance, but my point is that deposits at call must first be met if there is a run on a bank.",58
268,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,The call in England is about one-tenth.,59
269,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I am speakger ing of deposits at call, and the honourable member should not forget that I have separated the two things. I say that posits at call are the first charge on the gold reserve of a bank. That cannot be denied, because it is not until after a rush has set in that the general public begin lose faith in the notes of a bank. I shall not weary honourable members by going over the arguments which have been used against this proposal. The Argus, for instance, fers to the fact that a man does not want a promissory note for Â£ i for its own sake as a piece of paper, but because it sents a sovereign payable on demand. II say that he does not want the bank note because it represents a sovereign payable on demand. It is not the gold, silver, copper money at the back of the paper which makes its possession desired, but it the faith that its possessor will be able pay for commodities and to meet debts, dues, and taxes up to its face value. I say that if we had a currency wholly of paper governed by such safeguards and limitations as I have suggested for ideal system-that it must not be in excess of requirements, and must have the power of the Government behind it-w e should have a system which the people would always have faith 'in, and its current value would be the value of'gold at the time, because it would always be used instead only be one. of gold. I say that in such circumstances, even a reserve would not be necessary. would be unnecessary to have any of gold? gold reserve, if we had these severe restrictions and an honest Government. Wool, leather, timber, iron, any one of these would be as good as gold, and gether would be better than gold, because they would be more realizable at times gold. Peculiar positions arise sometimes, and we know that only a few months ago it was impossible to get cotton for gold. Although the world had cotton, it was not available even for gold. Speculators cornered cotton just as on other occasions they have cornered wheat, and it has almost impossible io buy it until the cornering operations are concluded, and goods have been released for purchase.",59
270,Mr DEAKIN,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Does the honourable memto ber say that he could get for notes what he could get for gold ?,59
271,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I do not say so. I say that although we have not yet realized it in Australia, and the World has not become conscious of the danwhich lies in that direction, people ' in America have had their eyes opened to the fact that it is possible to decorner gold. That is going to be one of the great troubles of the world before very long. Some of these giganticfinanciersand multi-millionaires will get their heads to to gether at some time, and so rig the money market that the price of gold must go upÂ« They will reap millions out of it, then release it, and reap millions more. I have rebeen arguing for a paper currency simply for internal currency purposes, and not for the ideal position, when gold must take repreits proper place as a mere commodity. should like to direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that, while gold is worth, roughly speaking, Â£ 4 an ounce, or every ounce of gold won in the world costs nearly Â£ 6 to get. It is all a worthless is expenditure of human effoTt, energy, brains, to time, and money, because gold, at that price, as a medium of exchange, is given a fictitious value, and if we ceased to use it for internal currency, its price would depreciate to probably lower even than that an of silver, because it would then command value only for its use in the arts. I say that an ideal civilization will have all paper money for its internal currency, and its external exchanges will be effected by goods and commodities, of which gold will",59
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,Has the honourable It member anything in mind to take the place,59
273,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Yes , paper, with the authority of the Government behind it, and issued only in severely limited tovolume, proportionate to the needs of the currency. 1 do not say that I would adthan vocate the adoption of that ideal system straight away, or that it would be possible to carry it out at once.o 1 think that the provision in the Bill for a reserve of 25 per cent, of gold is absolutely required, and I had shall tell the House why. The system must be made elastic in some way. We been could have no fixed system of currency upon a calculation that the needs of Austhe tralia would be Â£5,000,000, Â£7,000,000, or Â£10,000,000, waiting for a few years see how things would develop, and whether we should ror. require to provide for a few millions more. There are times an expansion of the currency is absolutely necessary. These periods are differently described. They are known as "" quarter days"" in the Old Country, in America which as ""the moving of the crops,"" and time here as ""harvesting time."" is bigger need of money then than at other times, and we must have In some simple and automatic way of swelling the volume of the currency during the period of its greatest need, that the operaquestion tions of the market and exchange may be carried on without interruption. Provisions for expansion are easy to make, but expanobjections sion does not give elasticity. Elasticity does not mean merely expansion, it means the power to expand and contract, and say that, in the Bill before us, with provision for a 25 per cent, reserve of .and notes convertible into gold at the sury, we get the two forces at work which provide elasticity. The Treasury is naturally anxious to issue these notes through its public servants, and in public expenditure for national works. On the early other hand, the banks, when they find they have too many of them, will be equally desirous of passing them back to the sury. These two forces working together will give the elasticity in the currency is demanded, but whether they will give sufficient elasticity or not I am unable :say. I think it can be made to serve purpose of expanding the currency at the demand of people desiring counters in the game. That is really all that the currencytinental amounts lo. The keeper of the gambling saloon issues to the players a number of manner. chips, and when the game is running high, more chips are required and applied for, one after another of the gamblers retires, and gives in his chips to the keeper of bank in exchange for gold. Without ex-' posing too much the secrets of the charnel house, I would say that the principles lowed in ordinary private gambling operabeating tions are those which we need to apply the national currency j that is to say, need to be able to expand and contract to meet the needs of the moment. The Argus tells us that history is full ings for us of what is going to happen we adopt, not a particular form of paper currency, but any form of paper currency at all. They'have gone beyond the first picture which they drew of the Atabled when torney-General turning a mangle to make the paper, and the Prime Minister turning another to print the notes. This was the more or less ridiculous way in the proposition was first received. As goes on, however, the attitude, not There only of the leading newspapers, but of honourable members themselves, has changed. this very debate we have seen many of these notions passing out of the minds of honourable members, who are looking at this more as one to be seriously considered ; and, I venture to say, that many of them are finding that some of their to the proposed system are vanishing. The Argus refers us to history, and tells us that the world is full I of examples of the evil consequences its following on the issue of paper money. gold, I cannot at this time turn to the many Treahistorical references I have here, but I should like to direct attention to some of the American examples. It has been said that paper money caused wreck and ruin in America; and undoubtedly some of the colonial issues were disastrous for reasons I have given. But the biggest "" disaster "" in America, if it were a disasterTreathe greenback-wa s absolutely necessary for national purposes. Again, what was that known as continental money in the early days, when America was fighting Great to Britain, was necessary to the Americans in the wringing their freedom from the Motherland. It is an historical fact that a great deal of the depreciation of this old conmoney was due to the hostility of England, exhibited in a most unscrupulous Thousands and thousands of these notes were printed in England, surbut reptitiously introduced into America, and sent broadcast amongst the people in order the to depreciate the currency. In fact, General Clinton wrote to England a letter saying that he had done all he could in this direcfoltion, but even that had not resulted in the colonials, who were surviving to in spite of all his efforts. The fact we remains that it was this paper money it that enabled America to successfully fight Great Britain - it was the greenof warnback, bad as it was, with its train if of evil consequences, that preserved the Union. Then, as I interjected when the honourable member for Hindmarsh was speaking, it was the assignats of France that enthe freedom of western civilization to be established on a higher plane than it probably would have attained for another half century. These are not the only ways in which debts are created by sary or unnecessary wars. Our own national debt represents"" a pretty tidy sum that be set against the abuses of those forced national issues of paper in times of great and dire national disaster. But it is to these forced issues that we must look for some guidance as to how paper money can be worked. I should like to take honoroccasion able members back to very ancient history - and show them the success of money issued in paper form with nothing at the back it. The original form of money was probcitizens ably cowries and cows. We have been told of one money driving another out of tence ; and we may be sure that the cows used in Massachusetts to pay the taxes all the poorest, the good ones having been eaten. These cows and cowries were probof ably succeeded by hides, tiles, iron bronze plates, and so on to coined money. An early form of money was stated by Ruskin to have been a piece of an ox hide; and I am reminded that the very word - pccunia refers to the oxen from which early money was made. Probably, as the whole hide would be too big to cart about, piece was cut or punched out in a peculiar way, and passed as representing the credit for that hide. The man, when he went claim that hide, would fix the piece in, thus be able to recognise his own. The first use I have heard of money made of leather in a more artistic form was when blind old Dandalo, the Doge of Venice, was making an attack Constantinople. I think he had with him the third crusaders, who had promised him a lot of money for ships in which their voyage-; but these crusaders, as we know, were always short of money, and when they got on the high seas they were unable to pay, so that the old Doge could' not pay his men, or buy stores for the ships. He, therefore, stamped out pieces of leather with his own coat of arms, and gilded them, and these passed through the fleet, and all over that portion of the where his operations extended. They were accepted by the old feudal knights who had set out to fight for the Holy Cross; and. when they got back to Venice, a siderable time afterwards, the whole these little bits of gilt leather were deemed. This opens up a novel question. In the early history of the world paper money was impossible, because Governof or. G. B. Edwards. ments were not honest enough. Venicestood out peculiarly as the most honest of necesall known communities. The Venetianswere bad enough, perhaps, in their privatecan lives, but in regard to their city, they were patriotic, self-denying, and straightforward ; and their reputation as merchantsnot throughout the world stood high. In the twelfth century the Venetians had another to make an attack on Constantinople, and, they had been in so many wars recently, they had no money in their' Treaof sury. The Fathers of the city invited theto subscribe to a public loan, for thepurposes of an expedition for an assault onexisthe Emperor Manuel. This loan was subscribed liberally, and it was irredeemable, were but bore interest at 4 per cent. Themoney was paid into the bank to the credit each man, and certificates given; and . plates, this formed the Bank of Venice. That money was never paid back. More money came in, and the total was swollen fromyear to year; and the position was so satisfactory that the Government refused to this pay any more interest. They told the people that they must place their money in. a the bank without interest, and irredeemable at that. That seems inconceivable; but money was paid in by thousands of pounds. to Honourable members have been asking toand night whether we know of any paper money that ever held its value against gold; and out I tell those honourable members that the paper money of the Bank of Venice was invariably above par-as much as 40 per on cent, above the price of gold.",59
274,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,That was because to make they had a mixed currency.,61
275,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"In Venice they had the whole currency of the world,, but still they, by some means-and they were shrewd enough-roughl y ascertained' the value of the various gold pieces, and' the gold pieces were stated in terms of value relatively to those paper credits. As T have said, those credits always stood at East a par with gold, and, in some instances, rose as high as 40 per cent. over. Why > It was because of the justification the people had for believing that this inconstitution only existed for currency. of The Government, when they had too remuch, paid off their depositors, and when they wanted more they invited fresh deposits. This bank was the forerunner the Bank of Genoa, the Bank of Amsterdam, the Bank of the Netherlands, and the other banks mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and the founder of our system of commercial credits. This was done without one ounce of gold reserve, out an asset of any sort, and simply on the faith of the people in the Commonwealth and in the city where it was started. That very institution went as far as England, for its paper money was used in making settlements under such a rough clearing-house system as was then in operation there. Those of us-no t many, I - hope-wh o are acquainted with the three balls that hang over those places of business to which we have occasionally to go to raise a little money will recognise in them the arms of one of the Venetian founders of these old money-lending institutions. That is, .. briefly, what I wish to give of the history of the foundation of this credit system. While banks and paper currency systems of mushroom duration in America and the southern republics of South America have, for one reason or another, fallen to ruin in all directions, this bank without any assets behind it, without any gold reserves, existed for 500 years. It might have been existing today but for Napoleon, who had it abolished. This is ancient history, but it is history extending over a period of 500 years, and is incontestible. There is only one little matter of modern history to which I care to refer at this late hour, and some honourable members will think it a rather childish argument to introduce into this debate. I have, however, my own views, and this case will illustrate my faith in providing for the necessities State with paper money. The little island of Guernsey has a Legislature of its own. The community there is very small, and one can trace the operations in such a community with far less mental effort than is necessary to trace a similar operation in a larger community. Guernsey, which had a Parliament of its own, as well as an Executive, and all the paraphernalia that we have for administering the affairs of this Commonwealth, felt the need of a new market. It was found that it would cost Â£4,000 to reconstruct the old building for the purposes required, and the Government said, "" We cannot raise the money."" A man named John Jacob, however, came to them, and said, "" I will show you how to find it. Issue Â£4,000 of paper currency, pass a law to make the notes legal tender, pay your workmen and buy your materials with that Â£4,000 of legal tender o paper currency, and you will succeed. All the people will take the paper, for they want to secure this market."" His advice with- was followed, and in twenty odd years the notes were all paid off from the rents of the market. The market was built, the paper currency was retired, and the people had the satisfaction of securing market buildings, and of obtaining from them a revenue for all time. I ask the critics of paper currency to point to a flaw in that operation. Certain Americans, given to the consideration of this question, and applying to it keen minds and close scrutiny, have said that it would have been possible for the Government of the United States, by the adoption of the same system, to have built the transcontinental railway, so that it would not have cost the American people one cent. I am afraid I have exceeded the bounds of ordinary patience, but I rose late in the evening, and I have vet to refer to one or two features of the Bill itself. I do not. think the Bill wilt give to the nation any of the vast pecuniary advantages that either its promoters or its opponents appear to anticipate. I think we shall get some advantage from it, but I am supporting it simply because it will give us the necessary national control over the whole currency.",61
276,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I said that it erred on the side of caution. - Mr GB EDWARDS - Some parts of it probably err, not on the side of caution, but from a mistaken notion as to what their effect will be. Clause 11, for of the instance, is very objectionable. It contains a principle to which I think it will' be permissible to refer at this stage. I cannot understand the intention of the Government in inserting it. It is needlessly irritating. It puts upon the banks a veryonerous task, when the Government should' be endeavouring to secure their co-operation, and it is not required for the ourposes of the Bill.",62
277,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,J do not feel very stronglyon it.,62
278,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I read that the honourable gentleman said that he proposed to amtiid it, but I think that inmoving the second reading he might haveintimated in what direction he proposed toamend it.",62
279,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I did.,62
280,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"I believe inmaking these notes legal tender, but clause: 11 goes beyond that. It means an enforced currency. In effect, it says to the banks, "" You shall not .pay gold if you wish to do so. You shall pay notes if they are demanded by the applicant or the client."" The only other objection that I really have to the Bill is the immense power taken under it by the Treasurer. I am not speaking of the Treasurer personally, but the Bill gives to the Treasurer of the day powers that I would not vest in any Treasurer. Under it the Treasurer will be formed into a limited companyof one with control over the whole system. We could scarcely find a man fit to be trusted with such powers. I hope that before the Bill passes through Committee the Government will see the wisdom of associating with the Treasurer, representatives of, say, banks and chambers of commerce, to work with him as a Board for the regulation of the issue and the restriction of the currency from time to time, as well as in connection with the investment of the funds. The provisions made for checking this currency are one of the extraordinary features of the Bill. The destruction of notes under a large currency proposal is one of the most important and laborious undertakings of the system. Yet the checking of this business is left in the Bill to an officer to be named by the Treasurer when it should be entirely in other hands. What is our Auditor General for if he is not to check such operations as are here provided for? Finally, as to the investments of these securities, the Government have given no indication of what form of investment they propose. They take power to invest the money in various ways, but I hope that this Legislature will see the wisdom of restricting the investment to the buying up of State debentures. Let us make a beginning there, rigidly stand to it, and we shall pave the way for the solution of great problems that are yet before us. It is the best investment we could make with this money. It would give the people a security for their notes that they might not feel they had in any other direction. At all events, it would give them much greater security than they could have from any bank.",62
281,Mr FISHER,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,I am glad to hear the in it. honourable member say so. I have said the same thing.,63
282,Mr GB EDWARDS,DEPORTATION OF CRIMINAL,"Notwithadjourned. standing all that has been said to the contrary, I believe that this Bill will give the people a note issue that is sounder and more stable than the banks are giving, or could give us at any time. The people will have behind these notes, not only the proposed gold reserve and the investment in, I hope, the public debts of the Australian States, but the full credit and power of the Government. . They will have further the greatest security of all : the power of the Government to tax the people. That is the amplest security for the whole system. Some men talk of the Government of the Commonwealth not having, as compared with the States, this or that power, but its power of taxation is a greater security than the States have in all the material properties for which they have paid with borrowed money. Then, in addition to giving stability, by the operation of these two virtues of convertibility and issue, working one against the other, we shall have a greater degree of elasticity than we have under the present banking system. Bankers admit that the present system is not sufficiently elastic. I hope that this new system, after we have had some experience of it, will be found to be more elastic than the present, and that with a little further experience we may modify it, so as to make it still more elastic. It has the further advantage that it will give us a common medium of exchange for all Australia. With the tenshilling note it will also give us one of the most convenient forms of currency that I am acquainted with. It is becoming quite usual even now for people to pay the few half-pence required to purchase postal notes for ten shillings, and to carry them about in their pockets to be used for purposes of currency. It is a pleasant thing to have these nice little crisp notes in one's pocket. They can be carried about without any trouble. In the same way the ten-shilling note will give us an exceedingly handy form of currency. The Commonwealth notes can range in value from ten shillings to ten thousand pounds; and I hope we shall have many of the latter, because they are the best form of reserve for financial institutions. I trust that this Bill will have a rapid passage through diis House, and that such amendments as I have indicated will be made Debate (on motion by Mr ATKINSON) House adjourned at 10.36 p.m.",63
