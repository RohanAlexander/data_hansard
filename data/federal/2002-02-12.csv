1,The Clerk,SPEAKER,"Honourable members, the next business is the election of a Speaker.",18
2,Mr MCARTHUR,SPEAKER," Mr Clerk, I would like to propose the honourable member for Wakefield as Speaker of the House of Representatives. I move: That the honourable member for Wakefield do take the chair of this House as Speaker.",18
3,The Clerk,SPEAKER,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Forrest- Mr Clerk, I have the great honour and privilege to second that motion.",18
4,The Clerk,SPEAKER,"Does the honourable member for Wakefield accept the nomination? Mr Andrew- Mr Clerk, I do.",18
5,The Clerk,SPEAKER,"Is there any further proposal? There being no further proposal, the time for proposals has expired. I declare that the honourable member proposed, the member for Wakefield, has been elected as Speaker. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",18
6,The SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to the House for the high honour that has been conferred upon me. The Speaker having seated himself in the chair,18
7,Mr HOWARD,SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I would like, on my own behalf and I know on behalf of all honourable members, to congratulate you on your re-election as Speaker, and may I remark on the courtesy of the opposition in ensuring that your election as Speaker was unanimous. It is an important office. It is a difficult office. It is an office that, from to time, carries with it controversy. Can I say on a personal basis that you and I have been close colleagues for a long time. I have always had an immense personal regard for you as an individual. You have been a great representative of the people of Wakefield. Can I say on behalf of those who sit behind me in this chamber that we will, within the traditions of this House, extend to you every respect and every courtesy. I think all of us want at the beginning of a parliamentary term to aspire to a parliamentary decorum and a character of debate that is better than the one that went before. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we as a government are prepared to have a constructive dialogue with the opposition about ways of changing matters for the better, and I have asked the Leader of the House to talk to the Manager of Opposition Business on those matters. I do not think any of us should have unreal expectations, but equally I think the Australian public would want us to try. In saying that we should bear in mind that this is the parliament of Australia and there are characteristics of the Australian people that are exhibited in this chamber, and I would not wish it to be otherwise. We should not try and be a mirror image of a parliament and of a people that we are not. We inherit some of the Westminster traditions-and long may that be the case because they are good traditions-but there are also Australian characteristics of this place that I would not want to see constrained. We are a direct, robust people, and necessarily the debate must represent and characterise the robustness and the directness of the Australian people. But if we can do it in a way that is more likely to produce better outcomes and a greater understanding of our responsibilities in the Australian community, then we should endeavour to do so. There is a strange and almost eerie peace upon the chamber, Mr Speaker. It is nice, and I savour the moment. It is not that one would be unprepared to respond to a different climate, but I say very genuinely, Mr Speaker, that it is great to see you there. It is great be in this position to congratulate you, and I look forward to it being a constructive partime liament and a parliament that above all else serves all of the people of Australia, because that is our responsibility and that is our solemn charge, whatever our political vantage points may be. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on his assumption of that position. It is a tough position, I know; there are none tougher in politics than leading an opposition. I congratulate him, the member for Jagajaga and all of the others who have been promoted on the opposition front bench. We look forward to a constructive, vigorous debate and a proper examination of things that are important. I also say how delighted I am to have my colleague and friend the Leader of the National Party, my colleague and friend Peter Costello, the Leader of the Liberal Party, and all of my colleagues back in their respective positions. To all of them, I extend my congratulations. I look forward to a very entertaining parliament.",18
8,Mr CREAN,SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, can I, too, offer my congratulations to you, and indicate that we did not oppose your election; we welcome the fact that you are back as Speaker. I would have preferred the circumstances to have been those of me seconding you in a prime ministerial nomination in accordance with a proposal that I put forward in the spirit of getting order back into the place.",19
9,Unknown,SPEAKER,Government members interjecting,19
10,Mr CREAN,SPEAKER,"Who are the ones who are not genuine? My proposal would see the Speaker alternate, by nomination from either side, for two terms. Those on the other side of the House laugh at that, but I remind the Prime Minister of his words on 2 April 1996, when he said: You will never have a completely independent Speaker in this country unless the Opposition is prepared to come halfway and commit itself to not opposing the Speaker at a subsequent election. We have come halfway but the Prime Minister could not engage his own proposal. I to have not heard the prime ministerial response to that proposal but the opportunity will present itself later today when the Deputy Speaker is nominated. We will be putting forward for that position, in the spirit of proposal, Harry Jenkins. My proposal is that the Speaker be nominated by the Prime Minister for two terms. The position will then rotate. The Deputy Speaker will be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, likewise for two terms, and the position will then rotate. We will have the opportunity to consider this proposal this afternoon, when the position of Deputy Speaker is filled. I look forward to the coming three years in this chamber. I believe we have to improve the standards in this place, and I admit that I have been part of the problem in the past. I am prepared to turn over a new leafGovernment members-Oh!",19
11,Mr CREAN,SPEAKER,"but are those on the other side? I note the mirth, but I also note the proposal by the Prime Minister-and I welcome it-that the Manager of Government Business meet with the Manager of Opposition Business to talk these issues through. The Prime Minister says that he does not hold out too much hope on that. What I would like, Prime Minister, is for you and me to sit down and talk these issues through. What is wrong with that? In the spirit of trying to improve the standards of the House, why shouldn't the two leaders of both major parties sit down and work that proposal through? It is all very well to delegate the detail others, but unless this proposal has prime ministerial authority it is not going to advance terribly far, I suspect. My point is that not only is the opportunity there in terms of our bona fides in respect of your position to take that a step further this afternoon but also importantly the opportunity is there to improve the standing orders to give substance to the ability for greater independence on your part and greater order in the chamber. I have put forward a package of proposals that will assist you, Mr Speaker, if they are adopted. And I think the opportunity is there, because I have seen attributed to you comments whereby you support the proposal for an independent Speaker and the notion that I have put forward-that the election of Speaker not be challenged. We would also like to see the standing orthis ders altered such that answers to questions are limited to four minutes, so that we do not have the endless drivel that ministers go on with; questions are limited to one minute; and there again be opportunity for supplementary questions. The important thing, though, is this: we are also asking that ministers fully answer questions. This place breaks down into disorder when this government, by avoiding questions, will not be held accountable. I believe that, if it is appropriate to have a standing order on relevance, there has to be an obligation that questions be fully answered and the answer be relevant to the questions asked. It is a simple proposition which gives effect to what I believe is your intent; an intent that we know, from your earlier rulings, you have great difficulty in enforcing. We also believe that there should in this place be an opportunity for returns to order; not in addition to matters of public importance but in place of them where we consider it appropriate. It is a practice in the Senate. I think it is something that could usefully be brought into this place so that we can debate issues that arise in question time and that may not have been anticipated by us in the framing of our matter of public importance. We also want to see introduced a circumstance where ministers do not abuse question time by making lengthy policy announceto ments. There are other forms of the House for that; ministerial statements, for example, where the opportunity is afforded opposition spokespeople to debate them. This is what a house of parliament should be about. There should not just be an opportunity for the government side to put a proposition in terms of a policy announcement; there should be an opportunity also for the opposition to put its views. The other issue that has been in constant abuse in this place is the length of time ministers take to answer questions on notice. Questions on notice are an important part of the parliamentary process, but time after time we have seen members on this side get up and talk about the inordinate length of time by which ministers have failed to answer. We are proposing that the 60-day rule be reduced to 30 days and that you, Mr Speaker, be given the opportunity to indicate that ministers are in breach of the standing orders. We also think that petitions should be given greater significance in this chamber. People who have taken time to sign a petition deserve to know that it is going to be followed up. What we are looking for is the opportunity for petitions to be properly considered this chamber. Mr Speaker, all of those initiatives have been put forward in the spirit of making your task easier. We want to have a chamber that is orderly but, if we are going to be subjected to the circumstances in which our questions are not answered and ministers abuse the form of question time, we have to resort to other alternatives to try to make them accountable. I say to the Prime Minister in the spirit of goodwill at the outset-not by any means as a threat but as a genuine offer-not to delegate this but to take charge of it self. He has argued on previous occasions, time and time again, that he wants to improve the standards. He has argued for an independent Speaker. I am giving him an opportunity to implement that in his third term. In the spirit of cooperation, I hope he responds positively. I look forward to him setting up a meeting with me, not just delegating it to someone else.",20
12,Mr ANDERSON,SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating you on your return to that high office. I was reflecting a moment ago on what a great country it is that, just a few days ago, you and I were in your home area in Renmark enjoying the friendship of, dare I say it, constituents of yours who seemed to be glad that this side of the House was to be returned and would be in a position to put you back in that place. How fortunate we are in this country-you with your office, me with mine-to be able to move around freely as we do amongst our constituents in an atmosphere of goodwill and of security. I certainly congratulate the Prime Minister on his return to his office and again record my appreciation of his leadership through what was for all of us a difficult year last year. I look forward to continuing to work with him, the Treasurer and the rest of the team. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on attaining their positions. I was talking to the deputy this morning. She will experience some of those things that are common to all deputies of being a clearing house for in some of the problems that will come across the desk. I personally wish her well with it. Mr Speaker, in relation to our role as members of the House and the way we are perceived by the broader community, as has been touched on, I am often struck by the way people in the community say, including at times when you are on talkback radio and so forth, ‘We do not like the standards that sometimes we see parliamentarians apply in the House of Representatives.' My response is always to say-and I am echoing a point that the Prime Minister made-that no Aushim- tralian should be squeamish about a full blooded debate. It would be a sad thing indeed if in this place there were an inadequate exploration of issues, if there were not strongly held positions and if those positions were not from time to time expressed with great passion. Australia would be the poorer for that. Indeed at times perhaps we would do well to see a wider diversity of views more strongly expressed. I do think that it is part of the Australian way of life that, having expressed your views, you ensure that personal animosity is not allowed then to taint relationships, and I think people expect us to apply that rule in this place. From that, I just make the observation that you can talk about standing orders, agreements and a whole range of frameworks for the way that we might behave, but in the end it is up to each of us to reflect upon how we interact in this place, how we present our ideas, how we take them forward and how we argue the case without becoming personal and without seeking to abuse others. I think that is what is expected of us. In that sense I was reflecting this morning that we are all privileged-all of us-to have been sworn in in here this morning. There was a very interesting article in today's Australian about Pat Farmer. It reflected, amongst other things, on the reality that I was not aware of that fewer than 1,000 people since Federation have been sworn in as members of this House. I was unaware of that, but it is quite remarkable when you stop to think about it. We are privileged. It is a great honour to serve the Australian people. In the spirit of those remarks that have been made about our behaviour, they do expect us to take forward different perspectives with vigour and passion but to do so in a way that reflects the fact that each one of us has been duly elected by people who want their point of view presented and respected. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you.",21
13,Ms MACKLIN,SPEAKER,"Jagajaga) (11.35 a.m.)Mr Speaker, I join with my colleagues in adding my congratulations to you on your re-election. Undoubtedly we will continue to at times test your patience, but in the spirit of today we do welcome you back here as the Speaker of this great House. I also want to thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party for their kind words. I am sure that the Leader of the National Party could give me advice about how to conduct many of the challenges that will come forward, so I appreciate his kind words. Just to follow up in one respect the initiatives that have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. We are all aware in this House, particularly those who have just been elected-and I extend my congratulations to all the new members on all sides of the House, including those on the crossbenches-of the message that we all get in our electorates that, for many reasons, we are not held in as high an honour as we would like, given the responsibilities that we have. I think that that in the end is the for the initiatives that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward. The public wants to know that this will be a place not only of feisty debate, as the Prime Minister said, but also where the public-not just the opposition-will get answers to critical questions, whether they are about the accountability of the government and the executive in particular or on policy issues and policy differences. The public does not want to see this place, in the sense of it being a clearing house for ideas and different points of political view, being brought into disrepute by those critical issues not being pursued in a vigorous way. That is the underlying reason for the initiatives that we have put forward and we hope that they will be taken in that light.",22
14,Mr ABBOTT,SPEAKER,"Warringah-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (11.38 a.m.)- Mr Speaker, I believe that you have been a gracious and courteous occupant of the chair of this House and I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others in congratulating you on your re-election. I will respond to a couple of points made by the Leader of the Opposition. First of all, this is not Westminster. As the Prime Minister has said, this parliament inherits many of the Westminster traditions but not all of them. One of the key differences between this parliament and Westminster is that at Westminster speakers are not opposed at election time. It is highly unrealistic for the Leader of the Opposition to expect a Speaker seeking re-election not to be opposed in his election.",22
15,Unknown,SPEAKER,Opposition members interjecting,22
16,The SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Those desperate to reform the parliament might like to consider the fact that the minister has the call.,22
17,Mr ABBOTT,SPEAKER,"The other point I would make is that, as this chamber has evolved, opposition members can ask, more or less, the questions that they like and ministers can give the answers that they think most appropriate under the standing orders. That is the way it should be. What we cannot expectreason certainly what the opposition cannot and have no right to expect-is that ministers will give the answer that the opposition wants. Ministers will give the answers that they believe are appropriate; ministers will defend the government's position in the way that they think is appropriate. The opposition has put forward an interesting and, I think, constructive set of proposals. The Manager of Opposition Business and I are more than capable of sitting down and talking them through. I trust the Manager of Opposition Business to speak with authority on these matters. The government will look at those proposals constructively. The government is concerned not just with a better question time; we are concerned with having a better parliament. We would like the parliament as a whole to work better. We believe that all members of this parliamentnot simply members of the executive-have an honoured role and an important place in the national debate. The proposals that we will be putting forward in the next few weeks will be designed to enhance the dignity of the parliament as a whole.",22
18,Mr SWAN,SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I follow my leaders in offering our sincere congratulations. I think yours has been a formidable achievement in securing a second term in the face of a concerted campaign elsewhere. I am delighted with the comments that you have been reported as making this morning, expressing interest in the proposals that we have put forward because, in addition to this being something for discussion between the government and the opposition, I think it is something that should also involve your good self. We really have a once in a century opportunity here to reform the parliament. One hundred years ago this people's house had a record of parliamentary and democratic reform unsurpassed anywhere in the world: the extension of the franchise, the secret ballot, votes for women-you can go on. One hundred years ago the world looked to this parliament for parliamentary reform. This is the people's house. If the people are unhappy with the way in which this House has operated in recent years then that is our problem; it is not the people's problem. The proposals that we have put forward go to the very heart of the quality of our democracy. If there is much alienation in the community with the way in which this House operates then we have a duty to change. We have put forward our proposals in a bipartisan way. We are not absolutely fixed with the proposals we put forward; we are happy to sit down and talk with the government. But I think the point that the Leader of the Opposition made is an important one: it has to go to the top. The member for Warringah and I can sit down and have a friendly chat-and I am sure we will-but that will not be enough. Mr Abbott interjecting",23
19,Mr SWAN,SPEAKER,"He's buying is he? The point is that the primary objective is to make the House function more effectively and with dignity. Of course we have to put our views in a forthright manner-that is all the more reason why we need an independent Speaker. No set of rewritten rules in the standing orders is going to provide the reform that is required unless we have a Speaker who is more independent and has authority. That is the point. We think that the two reforms are linked. What repels so many Australians about this House is the sense of barnyard politics-a House of yelling monkeys, collective jeering. It all looks ugly on TV and it is an ugly reality. There is no point trying to make TV the scapegoat. We have to change ourselves to fit into the new century, and that is what we need to do. We will be coming to our talks with the government with a genuine desire for change. But all of us must change; all of us have to change. All of the proposals we put forward are linked in one way or another. Congratulations, Mr Speaker. I think we will have an interesting parliament. Congratulations to all of those opposite who have been elected and to all of those on this side and on the crossbenches. We look forward to the challenge of reforming this parliament, the first parliament of the 21st century.",23
20,Mr MCARTHUR,SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, may I take the opportunity as a colleague and long standing friend to congratulate you upon your elevation to the speakership in this your second term. You bring to your new position the experience of so three years in the job, a maturity of 19 years in this parliament, honour and integrity and an understanding of the standing orders. We would hope that there is no confusion about the one-minute and four-minute bells, which almost brought about the demise of the chief whip and me. The electors of Wakefield have been well served by you and the first Speaker of this parliament, Sir Frederick Holder, who held the position from 1901 to 1909. You made reference to that in our celebrations of the Centenary of Federation in Melbourne on 9 May. You have brought the representative of Wakefield to the speakership in 1998 and 2002. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have alluded, the performance of Speaker is evaluated in this place on a daily basis by members opposite and by members of the government. It is also evaluated by those many people who look at question time on television at 2 o'clock and later in the evening. People often comment to me about the performance of members, of the Speaker and of the parliament generally. You get a lot of gratuitous advice by telephone after question time as to your performance, as to the very good performance of the Prime Minister and as to the performance of other ministers. The Speaker's role is always under scrutiny, and I do wish you well in your new term. The use of standing order 304A will be used with much more discretion on future occasions, because the member for Hotham is now reformed! The member for Hotham allowed you, Mr Speaker, to use that standing order on a number of occasions, but I note from his own words on this occasion that you will no longer need to use 304A in a similar manner. Likewise, the member for Prospect has been elevated-she has two positions now. She is in a more responsible position and she is further away from you, so neither you nor she should be able to engage in ongoing conversation. Mr Speaker, I wish you well in your role of administering this parliament. Sometimes members of the House and others overlook this important administrative function that you, as Speaker, have in meeting representatives from other countries and in being our spokesman on behalf of the parliament and the Australian people. There is also your in foreign delegations to other countries. I know you undertake that role with considerable expertise and understanding. Along with other colleagues, your wife, Carolyn, and your family, I hope that you enjoy the responsibilities and privileges of the great honour that has been bestowed upon you by this House in this the 40th Parliament. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",23
21,Mr ANDREN,SPEAKER,"Calare) (11.48 a.m.)May I add my congratulations to your renomination and success. Had there been another nomination, I may have taken a different course of action, because it is a source of disappointment that, as the Constitution requires, we do not nominate people for that position formally from the floor of the House except where a predetermined decision has been made and debated in the press long before the House assembles, as required, to nominate candidates and have a proper election if need be. I had toyed with the idea of nominating the member for KennedyGovernment members-Where is he?",24
22,Mr ANDREN,SPEAKER,"but he, unfortunately, is not here",24
23,Unknown,SPEAKER,Government members interjecting,24
24,Mr ANDREN,SPEAKER,"‘And they may well have voted for him,' I hear on my left. A very interesting House it perhaps would have been. The point I would have made about that nomination is that I think it is healthy that the members of the House, particularly from the crossbench, have an opportunity to nominate their own candidates. If we are talking about reform of this process, it might not be such a bad idea to go through that process of nomination on the floor and go through the voting procedure, rather than stitch it up beforehand. I have listened with interest to the words of the Leader of the Opposition, and I congratulate him on his elevation to the position. I agree wholeheartedly with some of the reforms he is suggesting. I think it was the member for Chifley-correct me if I am wrong-who in one of the former parliaments had a long standing motion on the Notice Paper alluding to the length of questions and, indeed, the length of answers. I think role the one-minute, four-minute suggestion is absolutely ideal. While we are talking about processes, I must say that this House risks becoming an irrelevant backwater in the democratic process if we continue to refer legislation to Senate committees without it being referred to a House committee and if we do not move substantial amendments in this House and debate them. If they are lost or whatever happens, they can be reintroduced in the Senate, as should be the process. But we are capitulating to the Senate and it is becoming the de facto House of Representatives. The real danger that we face in this democracy is that this House runs the risk of being overrun by the executive-by the truncation of debate. I know that we cannot go on forever with debates, but it is absolutely essential that we, as the people's representatives, have an opportunity to put forward amendments and to properly debate legislation when it appears before the House. Having said that, I congratulate you again, Sir, on your re-election. I know you will continue to show your evenhandedness by occasionally ejecting the member for Warringah from the chamber. I know what sort of pressure that you and your predecessors have been under, particularly from your own side of politics. I would ask you to stay strong. You certainly will have all the support necessary from the crossbenches. I am sure I can speak on behalf of the member for New England, who I also welcome to the chamber, and who, along with me and the member for Kennedy, will probably ask the only true questions without notice that this parliament will hear.",24
25,Mr FORREST,SPEAKER,"Mallee) (11.52 a.m.)Mr Speaker, I join briefly in the congratulatory remarks to you from other members, and make a comment about how much, in the eight years I have been a member of this chamber-having arrived here in 1993-I have appreciated being mentored by you because we are from adjoining electorates with similar interests to do with horticulture and the River Murray. More than that, we have shared interests in what has been discussed here today-that is, in reform and in ensuring that the activities of this place remain relevant to the Australian public. I know it a shared expectation that we both have, so I offer you my best wishes in the difficult task that is ahead of you. I was delighted to second your nomination. You have my confidence. I might say to other members, particularly members of the opposition, how refreshing it is to know that the member for Hotham has been down the road to Damascus. It will take more than fine speeches in here to convince members on this side that that is true. I say to the Manager of Opposition Business that I will be willing to test the strength of your new experience because it is appalling to have to justify-particularly to youngsters and schoolchildren that visit us here and sit in a glass gallery-the behaviour that goes on here. I know that you, Mr Speaker, have reminded us on many occasions that the students of the nation-even our own children-watch us. With those remarks, it is hoped that the Leader of the Opposition lives up to his expectations to improve the behaviour and the functioning of this chamber so that the Australian people will be the ultimate beneficiaries. I conclude with my best wishes to you, to Carolyn and to your family. I give an undertaking to do everything I can to enhance the standing of this chamber.",25
26,The SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Can I respond to the many good wishes extended to me this morning by thanking you all for your support and your consideration. It has been a great honour to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives through the past three years, and a particular honour to occupy this office in the year of the Centenary of Federation. I thank the House for giving me the opportunity, and I thank the House for the confidence it has shown in me in re-electing me to this post today. Can I reassure the member for Calare and, in defence of the Clerk, make the point that there was absolutely nothing preventing anyone in this process from nominating any other member of the chamber who would have been exposed to a secret ballot as the standing orders provide had that been the wish of any member of the chamber. I want particularly to thank the Prime is Minister and the former Leader of the Opposition for the courtesy they showed to me while I had this post through the last parliament. I extend my congratulations to the Leader of the Opposition on his election and to the Prime Minister on his re-election and my optimistic good hope that the relationship that I shared with the leaders of the coalition and the Labor Party in the last parliament I will share with the leaders of the coalition and the Labor Party in this parliament. I want to thank the member for Corangamite and the member for Forrest for their preparedness to nominate and second me. I appreciate the friendship of the member for Corangamite and the frank way in which he deals with issues and with each of us as individuals and with me as the Speaker. Let me also add my appreciation to the member for Cunningham who, unknown to most, when all else is falling apart around the Speaker, will come around to my office or even to this chair and, in his own quiet way and from his own experience in this office, offer a word of reassurance and support. On that note can I reassure you all, particularly the new members of the chamber, that the office door is always open and that I am alert to any concerns that you may have that will ensure that everyone feels that they are being adequately arbitered in this place by the occupier of the Speaker's chair. I give my particular thanks in this instance to the former member for Cowper, Mr Nehl, as Deputy Speaker, and to the member for Scullin, Mr Jenkins, as Deputy Speaker. They both gave me all the support a Speaker could wish for, as you would all be well aware, and offered it from a bipartisan point of view. I thank them for their approach to the office. For the way in which both of them-although in this case I may say particularly the member for Scullin-sought conciliation rather than confrontation I am grateful. I do not want to prejudice in any way what may happen later today, but I do want to indicate my appreciation of the roles that they played. In common with most of you, I stand indebted most of all to my family. To Carolyn, to Matthew and Kate, to Kate and Matthew-and someone can make something of that-and to John and the grandchildren I say thank you very much. They are the rock of my life. As you know, things are tough in political life and tough on political families, but to have some sort of refuge where you can go and where criticism rarely emerges and all that emerges is support is a great privilege. Thank you to all of you for the support you offer. I know that is a sentiment that will be echoed by most of those in this chamber to their families as well. It is true to say, as we have said often, that the things that unite us are far greater than the things that divide us. Much has been made this morning of the need for parliamentary reform. Sentiments expressed by both sides have been widely endorsed. Can I offer a word of caution. As parliamentarians we run the risk of focusing so much on parliamentary reform that we imply that this chamber is some sort of disaster in legislative terms. Let us hesitate with our reformnot that it is not necessary; of course it isjust long enough to acknowledge that this chamber has served the people of Australia well over the last 100 years and, if I may say from my own experience, particularly over the last 20 years. Compared to 20 years ago we have a nation that is socially more cohesive than it was, we have a nation that is economically more stable than it was, and we have a nation that, to use modern terms, punches above its weight in world forumsthanks to people who have served in the parliament over the last 20 years while I have been in this chamber. Let us reform the chamber, but let us ensure as well that Australians recognise that they have been well served by parliamentarians present here and their predecessors. Of course there is real concern-justifiable-as echoed by the Deputy Prime Minister, about the level of personal abuse. Of course we all want to do something about it and I believe we mutually will, but these are things that will happen gradually. We do well to remember what history has shown us and that is, sadly, as we learned in the Centenary of Federation, that the first occupier of this chair 100 years ago collapsed in the then federal chamber and died uttering the words, ‘Dreadful, dreadful,' as he reflected on the behaviour of the chamber 100 years ago. We ought not to do ourselves the disservice of pretending that nothing worthwhile has happened. This chamber has, as the result of decisions in earlier parliaments, brought in reforms that are now picked up by other chambers around the world, such reforms as the Main Committee, and we ought to celebrate that. This chamber can serve the people better, but it already serves them well and we ought to be proud of, not apologetic for, its performance. It will, of course, continue to be confrontational; that is why we are part of the great Westminster tradition. Australians expect their chambers to be robust and, frankly, by the standards of most of other chambers around Australia we are, in any case, a relatively well-behaved place to be. I look forward to a greater level of personal interaction and, in the interests of the people of Australia, a greater understanding of the standing orders, but let me reinforce to you all that the occupier of the Speaker's office is here not to make the rules but to enforce those determined by the parliament. I am your servant and I hope in that form to serve you well in the next three years. Thank you for your support. Honourable members-Hear, hear! PRESENTATION TO GOVERNORNA",25

I have received a copy of the speech, which will be incorporated in Hansard for record purposes. The speech read as followsHonourable Senators and Members of the Parliament of Australia: Lindsay Tanner MP Senator Stephen Conroy Christian Zahra MP Kelvin Thomson MP Senator Kim Carr Kirsten Livermore MP Janice Crosio MP Michael Danby MP Harry Quick Senator Sue Mackay Senator Trish Crossin Senator Kay Denman Parliamentary Secretaries are shown in italics. Introduction On the tenth of November 2001, the Australian people re-elected the government and conferred upon it, for a third time, responsibility for managing this nation's affairs. In doing so, they endorsed a wide-ranging programme of continued reform, disciplined fiscal management and the implementation of policies underpinned by the characteristic values of the Australian nation. The government will take early steps to implement the specific policy commitments it made during the recent election campaign. There are few nations on earth which can enter the early years of this new century with the same sense of optimism, opportunity and quiet confiBILL 2002 dence that the Australian people are entitled to First Reading feel. The government seeks to build on a century of national achievement and accomplishment evident in fields as diverse as business excellence, scientific endeavour, the arts and culture and in the world's great sports. With political stability and social cohesion that are the envy of the world, with the personal freedoms of expression, enterprise and association more certain and assured than ever before, Australians can pursue whatever individual or collective dreams inspire them. Although neither complacent nor unaware of the many challenges ahead, Australia can create for itself a future of immense prospect and prosperity. The government pledges itself to that effort. It will continue to be driven by a belief that self reliance, individual endeavour and choice must be encouraged and rewarded. It will maintain a strong social security safety net for the more vulnerable in our society. It will champion the concept that families, workers and communities striving together towards shared goals create capacities far more potent than any other arrangements. It will continue to believe that Australian ety is fundamentally built upon principles of fairness and decency and the premise that opportunity should be available equally to all, regardless of background, gender, race or religion. It will support the creative talent and entrepreneurial spirit of Australians as they seize the unprecedented opportunities available in the years ahead. The government's priorities throughout the coming term will also be based upon an acknowledgment that it must set in place the foundations for national success well beyond the life of a single parliament – addressing such serious long term issues as the changing age composition of Australia's population and environmental sustainability. Above all, its decisions will recognise that a government is charged with two over-riding responsibilities, namely providing for the security of, and delivering prosperity to, the nation. Security The national consciousness of security issues has understandably risen in the wake of the tragic and momentous events of September 11, 2001. The world is sadly neither the safe nor certain place we would all wish it to be. Australia has joined the United States in an emphatic international response to terrorism. The government will ensure that Australia maintains a strong and flexible Defence Force, able to act in the nation's interest whatever circumstances may arise and in support of the principles of democratic freedom that Australians value so highly. I acknowledge the professionalism, the commitment and the courage of all Australian servicemen and women but particularly those currently on active duty overseas – in the war against terrorism, in East Timor and as peace-keepers in countries throughout the world. Through the implementation of the 2000 Defence White Paper, which provides for real increases in defence spending of $32 billion over the next 10 years, the government will ensure Australia's Defence Forces are properly trained, equipped and supported, and that they remain capable of contributing both to the cause of political stability within our region and broader international endeavours. The government will continue its fight against transnational and organised criminal efforts to boost trafficking in illicit drugs, people smuggling, money laundering, major fraud and other crimes. Modern terrorism clearly presents a new and socidangerous threat. Determined and strong responses are needed. To this end, Commonwealth law enforcement and national security agencies are being reviewed and will be allocated additional resources to achieve even higher levels of effectiveness. Priority will be given to collaborating with other nations on security and law enforcement issues, enforcing proper control of our borders, ensuring greater efficiency within Commonwealth agencies and providing clear leadership for the states and territories in these vital areas. The Prime Minister will host a summit of state and territory leaders in April to advance new national frameworks for dealing with these challenges. Both Australia's security and its prosperity will be enhanced through constructive international relations and Australia's network of bilateral relationships will remain the foundation of the government's foreign policy. These relationships are in good order, but will require careful ongoing attention over the term of this parliament. Our ties with the United States are of immense importance to Australia's security and economic interests and the government continues to recognise the ongoing relevance of the ANZUS alliance for regional stability. Maintaining our support for the coalition against terrorism and, more generally, our relationship with the United States will be priorities for the government. Developments in Asia, of course, are of enduring importance to Australian interests. The government will ensure that our already considerable economic and political ties to North and Southeast Asia continue to be strengthened for the benefit of all Australians. Australia's Pacific neighbours have faced many difficult challenges in recent years and the government will continue to work with the region to help it address these issues. Australia has strong economic and diplomatic relations with nations around the earth. The government will continue to foster these relations in the interests of domestic prosperity and global security. Australia is honoured to be hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Coolum in March and is committed, as Chairman, to ensure that the Commonwealth meets the challenges ahead and encourages members to maintain their shared values of good governance, human rights and economic development. Her Majesty The Queen, as Head of the Commonwealth, will visit Australia for this meeting. This year marks the Golden Jubilee of the Queen's accession to the Throne. There can be little doubt that, during the past fifty years, Majesty has fulfilled her duties with great dedication, skill and remarkable energy. Australians will wish her well on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee. Shared prosperity The second fundamental obligation of government is the pursuit of prosperity in which all citizens may share. The government remains committed to achieving higher living standards and more jobs for Australians over the next three years. The resilience of the Australian economy, despite a global slowdown, is a strong endorsement of the government's disciplined approach to economic management and the structural reforms it undertook to improve the efficiency and flexibility of Australia's product, labour and financial markets. Since 1995-96, the government has repaid over $55 billion of public debt. A key priority in the government's third term will be to maintain a strong fiscal position. While Australia's recent economic performance has been extremely impressive, the process of economic reform is ongoing and the government will vigorously pursue economic policies which further strengthen and reform our economy. The government will continue to vigorously advocate genuine trade liberalisation. Securing additional market access through WTO and bilateral trade agreements will be a high priority. The government will continue to explore the prospects of achieving a free trade agreement with the United States. This will be very difficult but, if such an outcome can be realised, the benefits for Australia will be significant. A thriving business sector At home, competitive, well-functioning markets, supported by good regulatory frameworks, encourage economic growth. The proposed review of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and their administration, will examine whether they adequately encourage growth and international competitiveness, protect the balance of power between small and large business and support the growth of regional business. Attracting overseas direct investment to Australia will also be an important activity of government. The government will continue to develop strategies to promote and attract investment, promote new venture capital arrangements and focus efforts in sectors of high growth potenHer tial, such as information and communications technology. The government will consider appropriate changes to current foreign ownership and control of Australian media laws and the cross media rules, aimed at opening up the broadcasting sector to new investment while ensuring continued diversity of opinion. The government will continue to pursue reforms that deliver an efficient, cost competitive energy sector. This will include an improved national energy market for both electricity and gas. The government will also actively promote the responsible development and export of our abundant minerals and energy resources. The government will also undertake a review of the current governance arrangements for statutory authorities and office holders. The government will focus on improving their structures and practices, particularly of those authorities that impact upon the business community, to ensure more efficient and effective operations and the highest standards of accountability. Families Policies that support families and provide them with effective opportunities and choices are crucial to Australia's economic and social future. The government will continue to provide practical assistance to families in their day to day needs and in support of their longer term aspirations. The government will take early legislative steps to implement its election promise to introduce a First Child Tax Refund, recognising the loss of family income that generally results from the arrival of a first child. Tax initiatives aimed at improving Australia's superannuation system and securing family income throughout retirement will also be priorities. The government remains committed to supporting the right of parents to choose the type of education that best suits the needs of their children and to quality schooling for all Australians. In particular, it will maintain its strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy for all young Australians, including indigenous children. Choice and access in health care The government will continue its commitment to improving choice and access to high quality health care for all Australians regardless of their personal circumstances. Australia's world-class public Medicare system will continue to provide access for all to high quality health care, complemented by a vibrant private health sector. This mix of public and private health provision means that Australia's health system will be viable in the long term and able to adapt to our nation's changing needs. In its third term, the government will negotiate new Australian Health Care Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The aim of the Agreements will be to achieve improvements for people who use public hospitals to ensure that they receive appropriate treatportant ment in a timely and responsive way. Welfare Reform Welfare reform remains a key focus of this government. It believes all Australians should have the opportunity to become more self-reliant and attain higher standards of living for themselves and their families. The government's commitment to welfare reform is expressed through the Australians Working Together package. Using Centrelink as a gateway, this package will provide increased assistance and improved incentives for people on welfare to get paid work, at a cost of $1.7 billion over four years. The government will maintain a strong social security safety net and increase opportunities for people with disabilities wishing to work to their fullest potential. In addition, Work for the Dole will remain a vital element of Australia's new active welfare system. The government will strengthen Mutual Obligation arrangements to focus on what people can do, rather than what they cannot. Flexibility and reward in the workplace The government considers that further workplace reform is essential to deliver higher living standards and create more jobs. In the first weeks of parliament, the government will introduce bills to ban compulsory union fees, ensure secret ballots before strikes, prevent one-size-fits-all industry bargaining and establish fair dismissal procedures. The Autumn sittings will also include the introduction of bills to improve protection for workers in Victoria, ensure more democratic and accountable unions and employer organisations, and give more workers a say on workplace safety issues. The government will also provide an effective safety net of minimum wages and conditions that can be relied upon by low paid employees whilst contributing to workplace bargaining above that safety net. The government will consult further about ways to give employees priority over secured creditors in the event of company failures. It will also work with employers to extend opportunities for workers to more effectively balance their family and workplace responsibilities. In its third term, the government will give particular attention to addressing the challenges of an ageing population through helping mature aged people remain in and/or get back into work. Innovation, technology and higher education Recognising the vital link between science and business in building a prosperous future, an imfocus for the new Education, Science and Training portfolio will be the continuing implementation of Backing Australia's Ability, which commits an extra $3 billion to supporting research, commercialisation and skills development. As part of this effort, the government has initiated a process to develop national research priorities to assist and guide research funding decisions across a range of government funded research programmes. The government expects to announce these national research priorities towards the end of this year. The government understands that the higher education sector is critical to maintaining Australia's international competitiveness, economic prosperity and cultural development. It will work with universities, the business sector and the broader community to ensure that its policies enhance the quality of teaching and encourage universities to develop their particular teaching and research strengths and areas of specialisation. In today's global economy, knowledge and skills development provide the essential platform for business competitiveness and community prosperity. In the time that the government has been in office, the number of people undertaking new apprenticeships has more than doubled from about 143,000 to an estimated 330,040 in September 2001. The government's support for vocational education and training will be further strengthened in its third term. A stronger country Australia This will be a government committed to creating greater opportunities for country Australia. An important priority for the government is to help improve the profitability and competitiveness of Australia's rural industries. A strong, vibrant primary sector will not only create jobs and earn this country valuable export income, but will also help revitalise many rural and regional communities across Australia. The government will continue to improve the transport system, an important social and economic issue for country Australia. It will maintain its commitment to national highways and roads of national importance and seek further progress in rail reform. Domestic and international aviation will be reviewed, to ensure that the government's approach to competition and regulation recognises the major changes in the aviation operating environment. Australia will also participate in international efforts to strengthen aviation security. The government remains committed to ensuring adequate levels of telecommunications services across regional, rural and remote Australia. It will build on the significant improvements achieved through the Networking the Nation programme and other Social Bonus initiatives. These programmes, combined with the $163 million response to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry, will mean that almost $1 billion will have been spent on improving regional communications services over the life of the government. In response to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry, the government is also introducing further enhancements to the regulatory safety net, achieved through the Universal Service Obligation and the Customer Service Guarantee, to ensure that all Australians have timely, affordable and reliable access to basic telecommunications services. The government's programme of telecommunications sector reform has encouraged greater competition and given Australians access to a wide range of high quality, innovative and low cost telecommunications services. The government's priority is to ensure more services for rural and regional Australia. The government will not proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. Our citizens The government recognises the special place indigenous people occupy in our society as the original inhabitants of Australia and will continue to implement its practical reconciliation agenda, sustaining its focus on tackling disadvantage in the key areas of education, employment, health and housing. These important endeavours will be pursued in partnership with indigenous people. Our joint goals should be to improve outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The government will continue an immigration programme that places a strong emphasis on attracting people with skills. Australia will also continue to be one of the very few nations in the world to maintain a refugee programme. Whilst continuing to work for solutions that give help to those most desperately in need, the government is committed to following the fundamental principle, accepted in international law, that Australia alone has the sovereign right to determine who is allowed entry. Australia will continue to seek effective cooperation with nations in our region to combat people smuggling. Protecting the environment A whole of government approach to sustainable environment issues is to be one of the highest priorities in the government's third term. To this end, the government has established a new Sustainable Environment Committee of Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister. Immediate action to tackle salinity and water quality problems is essential and, for this reason, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments will jointly invest $1.4 billion over seven years under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The Plan will target some of Australia's worse affected areas and will support action by regional communities and local landholders. The Plan will be complemented by the extension of Australia's largest ever environmental rescue effort, the Natural Heritage Trust. The government's ongoing funding package of $1 billion over five years for greenhouse gas abatement is among the largest by any government in the world. These funds are assisting to develop strong government-industry and government-community partnerships that are beginning to reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Conclusion Honourable Senators and Members, in the pursuit of success in all areas of national endeavour, the government will maintain its characteristic pragmatism, drive and determination. It will seek to defend all that is best within Australian society today whilst initiating the bold reform necessary for a prosperous and secure future. Its overarching goal will be to better the lives of all Australians, wherever they may live and whatever their own aspirations may be. Address-in-Reply",32

41,The SPEAKER,DEPUTY SPEAKER,The time allowed for nominations has expired.,37
42,Mr NEVILLE,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"I have pleasure in nominating Ian Raymond Causley, the member for Page, for the position of Deputy Speaker. Before entering this place in 1996, the honourable member had been the member for Clarence in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since 1984. So he brings to this place a richness of experience in the parliamentary process and a knowledge of its Westminster traditions, nurtured in the mother of the Australian parliaments. Ian Causley is a man steeped in life's experience-a husband, a father, a grandfather, a fourth generation cane farmer, a mill director, a publican, an MLA, a member of parliament, a bowler, a cricketer, a youth leader and a coach. His parliamentary experience shows a similar depth and diversity. He has been chief secretary of New South Wales. Also, in that state, he was Minister for Natural Resources on three occasions, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister for Mines. Since arriving here he has played an active role-at times in a leadership role-on important committees. He has chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage and the government's policy committee on Aboriginal affairs. He has also served on the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund and on a wide range of other policy committees. In short, he has been keenly involved in the affairs of 5.00 p.m. this place at many responsible levels. The thing I like about the member for Page is that he comes to grips with the detail Election of his brief, whatever that might be. He looks for outcomes, not theories, and he is workmanlike in achieving those ends. I well remember his analysis of the dairy industry deregulation-its processes, its probable unfolding, what the states would do and then its financial impacts. The eventual outcome was chillingly similar in its mirrored detail. This capacity for analysis and his workmanlike approach spill into other areas of his parliamentary activities, not the least of which is his appreciation of the standing orders. I for one have noted how easily he fitted into his role on the Speaker's Panel when he was appointed to that position three years ago. His ease with the forms of the House and his application of the standing orders were quite noticeable. Unmistakably, both he and the member for Menzies shone in that respect in the last parliament. I might add that the member for Page does not suffer fools gladly. Mr Sercombe interjecting",37
43,The SPEAKER,DEPUTY SPEAKER,The member for Maribyrnong!,37
44,Mr NEVILLE,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"So I expect that those who abuse the processes of the House during his tenure in the chair will have an uncomfortable time. That said, as I predicted three years ago, I believe he will mirror the previous Deputy Speaker, the former member for Cowper, in being forceful, deliberate and fair on the one hand and urbane, counselling and witty on the other. Mr Sercombe interjecting",37
45,The SPEAKER,DEPUTY SPEAKER,The member for Maribyrnong! This is the first sitting day; I do not wish to have to discipline the House.,37
46,Mr NEVILLE,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"His attributes and his 18 years of parliamentary service should equip him for this, the most responsible of offices. I commend him to the House as a worthy deputy to you, Mr Speaker, in the discharge of good order and equanimity in this place.",37
47,Mr BAIRD,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"I have much pleasure in seconding the nomination of the member for Page for the role of Deputy Speaker. The member for Page entered New South Wales politics at the same time as I did. In 1988, as the member for Clarence, he became the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries-or Natural Resources, as it was called then. To that he later added mining. During the seven years that he was a minister he had a distinguished career. He was noted for his strong interest in rural issues, forestry issues, fisheries and mining. He was always approachable. Within the party room he was always known for his strong advocacy of regional matters and matters related to the bush. No matter what the issue was, he would always bring in that dimension. He brings to this House his own dimension on the same issues-a strong interest in regional issues and those matters that affect rural Australia. In terms of his personal credentials, he is a person of great integrity and honesty. In the times he has been in the chair he has carried out that role with great diligence. I have great pleasure in seconding his nomination. I believe he will carry out the role of Deputy Speaker in a very professional way, and I wish him well in his future role.",38
48,Mr CREAN,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"I moved a motion earlier today that Mr Harry Jenkins be the Deputy Speaker, because I am serious about modernising this parliament. My proposalwhich I hope the Leader of Government Business gets to fully understand before he has his discussions tonight and which he misrepresented earlier today-is quite simple: the government nominates the Speaker for two terms and I second it; and the opposition nominates the Deputy Speaker, also for two terms, with the Prime Minister seconding it. Those positions would rotate at the conclusion of the terms. Members still have to face elections in their electorates, so this is not a model. This is an Australian response to Australian circumstances in an Australian parliament. The position is not determined by one's party room; it is determined by the whole of the parliament. It ensures that they do not owe their position to their party but to the parliament as a whole. It is about modernising the parliament. It is not to argue that this place should become less robust; rather, more relevant and with a better framework in which to operate. Apart from the principle, there is no question about the quality of the candidate that we are nominating. Mr Harry Jenkins is a candidate who is respected on all sides of the parliament. He has as good an understanding of the procedures and standing orders as anyone in this place and, I would suggest, better than almost all. He has been in the parliament since 1986. He has been schooled in its procedures. From 1993 to 1996 he was the Deputy Speaker, and from 1996 to now he has been the Second Deputy Speaker. Mr Speaker, you yourself praised his role and supported him. You supported the fact that he had a conciliatory role in that job. You said you did not want to prejudice the outcome, and I accept that. But, clearly, if Harry Jenkins is elected by the parliament, we would have a team that could work together to restore public faith in this institution. I think that is terribly important. Parliament should grasp this opportunity. It is an opportunity that presents itself uniquely to this parliament, and that is why it should be grabbed. It reflects the stated desires of the Prime Minister. In 1996, Mr Howard, as the newly elected Prime Minister, said: You will never have a completely independent Speaker in this country unless the Opposition is prepared to come halfway and commit itself to not opposing the Speaker at a subsequent election. That is the commitment that the opposition is making, Prime Minister.",38
49,Mr HOWARD,DEPUTY SPEAKER,What? In the election?,38
50,Mr CREAN,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"No, we are saying that we will not oppose him in terms of his role in this place. We are not proposing the Westminster model.",38
51,Mr HOWARD,DEPUTY SPEAKER,But you would still run a Westminster Labor candidate against him.,38
52,Mr CREAN,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"No, we would not. Mr Howard interjecting",38
53,Mr CREAN,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"If you want to have a discussion about this then respond to the invitation, Prime Minister, but do not misrepresent our position. Here is a unique opportunity. It is an opportunity to implement your policy. It would seem that we are now in the ridiculous position whereby I am putting forward the Prime Minister's policy and he is rejecting it. I am proposing it, and you are rejecting it. This is absurd. Instead of starting the third term, Prime Minister, breaking yet another promise, seize the moment. Let us agree in the best interests of the parliament and the people to try to regain the public's respect. I urge the parlia- Jenkins. ment to support Harry Jenkins so that we can commence the road to an independent Speaker and underpin a more modern Australian parliament. If my motion fails today and if Labor wins the next election, I will ensure that the Speaker is fully independent by implementing the policy that I have spelt out. I urge the parliament to get behind this motion and set the parliament on a modern path.",39
54,Ms HALL,DEPUTY SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, firstly, I would like to congratulate you on your re-election and say that I know that you will preside over this parliament with great dignity and fairness. It is an honour to be elected to this 40th Parliament, and it is an even greater honour to be asked to second this motion that Harry Jenkins be appointed Deputy Speaker. I endorse the words of the Leader of the Opposition, because without cooperation this parliament will not grow and flourish. What he has proposed is the first step toward this, and ing Harry Jenkins is also a step towards a better parliament. There is no better candidate for the position of Deputy Speaker than Harry Jenkins. He has previously been the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker. I have served with him on committees, in caucus and in this parliament. Many of you have also served with him on committees and in this parliament and you know his great ability to resolve issues without creating conflict. He has compassion, humour and wit. He is a person that you can share confidences with and know that those confidences will stay with him. He is a man of substance, a very special person. I just refer to what the member for Hinkler said. Unlike the member for Page, Harry Jenkins, whilst not suffering fools gladly, is prepared to suffer fools, and I think that that makes him very special and very suitable for the position of Deputy Speaker. In performing the role of Deputy Speaker, that is quite often what he is asked to do. As I was saying, no person in this parliament is better suited to that role. There is no person with a better knowledge of the standing orders and the operation of this parliament than Harry Mr Speaker, I refer to your words of this morning when you thanked Harry Jenkins for the role that he played in the last parliament-and it was a very substantial roleand said that he was always there in a conciliatory role, with a non-confrontationist approach to resolving problems. That is what is needed in the role of Deputy Speaker. No person is more worthy or better qualified to fill that position. I urge members to support the motion and embrace the change, a change that will bring about parliamentary reform and a better future.",39
55,The SPEAKER,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"In accordance with standing order 13, the bells will be rung and a ballot will be taken. The bells having been rung and a ballot having been taken",39
56,The SPEAKER,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Order! The result of the ballot is: Mr Causley, 81 votes; Mr Jenkins, 66 votes. Mr Causley is appointed elect- Deputy Speaker and Mr Jenkins shall be Second Deputy Speaker.",39
57,Mr HOWARD,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"On behalf of the government, I would like to congratulate the member for Page on being elected as Deputy Speaker. I know, particularly in the circumstances of the last parliament, when serving on the Speaker's Panel the newly appointed Deputy Speaker impressed many members with his grasp of the standing orders and his capacity to fairly adjudicate disputes and preside over debates in this chamber. He brings to the national parliament previous experience in the New South Wales parliament and as a minister in one of the coalition governments of that state. I wish him well and congratulate him. Whilst I am on my feet, may I extend my congratulations to the member for Scullin, who has been appointed the Second Deputy Speaker. He is a person we like and respect. We wish him well and we are sure that he will carry out his duties with considerable fairness and distinction. I think the House has made two very good choices in relation to the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, and we extend great goodwill to the member for Scullin. Many of us remember with affection his father, who was a Speaker of this House and a thoroughgoing gentleman. We wish the member for Scullin well, and I congratulate both him and the member for Page on their appointments. I know they will have the goodwill and the support of everybody in the chamber.",39
58,Mr CREAN,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"I also congratulate the member for Page on becoming the Deputy Speaker of the House. I have had experience working with the member for Page in a previous role in ministerial councils, and we look forward to working with him. I also congratulate Harry Jenkins. I think that he will continue to perform the function of Second Deputy Speaker well, but we look forward to the opportunity, after the next election, of him perhaps becoming the first independent Speaker of this parliament.",40
59,Mr ANDERSON,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"I too congratulate both gentlemen, particularly the member for Page, a colleague of mine who has had a very real commitment to rural and regional issues. I think he will bring a very deep understanding of parliamentary practice to this role, as well as his own unique and forceful style. I think he will be extremely adept and discharge his duties with very great distinction. I extend too my goodwill and congratulations to the member for Scullin and have no doubt that he will also add dignity his position when he occupies it.",40
60,Mr CAUSLEY,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Page) (5.35 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Speaker, Prime Minister and colleagues. I thank the House for the great honour you have bestowed upon me. I feel privileged to have served in both the New South Wales parliament and the Australian parliament. It is one of those privileges, I suppose, that we enjoy because of the support of our electorates. I did learn quite a lot in the New South Wales parliament. The honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Cook both went into the New South Wales parliament on the same day as I did. I was educated well under Neville Wran and Speaker Kelly and I am sure that I learned very quickly the procedures of the house. I am sure that I will enjoy this position and I say to honourable members that I will give as fair a hearing to all members as possible and will uphold the standing orders of this place. I also congratulate the honourable member for Scullin. The honourable member for Scullin and I have served on several committees together and we have got on very well. I am sure we will continue to do that as the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker of this House. Thank you.",40
61,Mr JENKINS,DEPUTY SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, can I first congratulate you on your re-election. I look forward to continuing to work with you in your role as Speaker. One of the things that we perhaps ask of presiding officers is consistency. This being the third ballot in which I have stood for Deputy Speaker, the third occasion I have run second and the third occasion I have been elected Second Deputy Speaker, I hope that that is not the only consistency that I display. In all seriousness, I thank the House for the honour it has bestowed upon me. I am a little flattered and overwhelmed by some of the comments that have been made about me, but I can only hope that I can do the duties that will be asked of me, with the greatest impartiality I can muster. It is very important that those who relieve you in the chair do so, because it does make your task a lot easier. I look forward to working with the honourable member for Page in this new to capacity. It is true that I have experience working with him on parliamentary committees. I believe that we have had a very good working relationship in those situations, and I look forward to that continuing.",40
62,The SPEAKER,DEPUTY SPEAKER,"At the conclusion of this ballot, I congratulate the member for Page and the member for Scullin and say how much I look forward to working with them as part of the presiding officers' team this parliament. NA Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon",41
63,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That: An address to Her Majesty The Queen in the following terms be agreed to: YOUR MAJESTY: We, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, have received with profound sorrow the news of the death of Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. On behalf of the Australian people, we express deep sympathy to Your Majesty, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other members of The Royal Family, especially Lord Linley and The Lady Sarah Chatto. Australians will be aware of the death at the weekend of the person we knew as Princess Margaret, the Queen's younger sister. After a very long illness, she died at the age of 71. I know that the House will want to express its sympathy particularly to her sister and her 101-year-old mother. Whatever views people may have about the constitutional arrangements in this country, it cannot be denied that the Queen and the Queen Mother are two people who as individuals are held in great esteem and indeed in great affection by Australians in all walks of life and of all political persuasions. Older Australians in ticular will have vivid memories of the young Queen and the young Princess Margaret during the World War II years, when, with their parents, the late King George VI and the Queen Mother, to many people not only in Britain but also throughout the British Commonwealth and throughout the free world, diminished as it was for so long by the apparent success of the Nazis and the Japanese, they represented a centre and focal point of many of the hopes of ordinary people. By any measure, Princess Margaret, who was born on 21 August 1930 at Glamis Castle, the Scottish seat of her mother's forebears, lived a life of material and economic in privilege. But, as is so often the case, people who are born into those circumstances do not always experience uninterrupted personal happiness and personal contentment and fulfilment. As I mentioned a moment ago, Australians of older generations will remember the two young princesses and the contribution that both of them made to the various charitable activities associated with the war effort in the United Kingdom and subsequently. Many Australians of that generation will also remember that, for a person whose proximity to the throne was naturally more distant than that of others, Princess Margaret made an exemplary sacrifice for duty in 1955 when, quite plainly out of deference to the wishes of her family and the teachings of the then Church of England, she renounced any intention of marrying Group Captain Townsend. It is instructing to read the words that were contained in her statement of October 1955. They may seem in today's age rather quaint and old-fashioned, but they indicate a degree of commitment to a values system that she was willing to uphold. She said: ... mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others. As we know, she was to go on and marry Antony Armstrong-Jones in Westminster Abbey in 1960, and that was a marriage that regrettably was dissolved in 1978. She was described as a person who was par- able to move in a circle of younger people whose way of life reflected the changes through which postwar society in Britain was gradually passing in a way that was denied to her sister the Queen. It was very plain throughout her life that she remained very close to her sister. The royal family is very much public property. When a marriage is dissolved in the royal family it is a matter which is splashed across the headlines of the tabloids and there is a privacy denied to people in that kind of position which is available to many other citizens. Her life was not without its areas of criticism, it was not without its behaviour that attracted disapproval from many people, but are there any of us who can argue that we do not live lives that might not from time to time, if they were fully known, attract the disapproval and criticism of others? I thought that Prince Charles spoke very movingly of his aunt's death when, in paying his tribute, he said: ... it was hard, let alone for her to bear it, but all of us as well, particularly as she had such a wonderfully free spirit. She loved life and lived it to the full. He was speaking of the considerable pain and discomfort she suffered in the final years of her life, and that was apparent in her several appearances associated with the 100th birthday celebration for her mother and also on her mother's 101st birthday. It ought to be recorded that, although certain other aspects of her life attracted a lot of publicity, she was a patron or the president of more than 80 organisations. She was very involved in the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Royal College of Nursing, Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, the Migraine Trust and Barnardo's, where she was president from 1948 until 1984. At the height of her public activities in the late 1970s and early 1980s Princess Margaret was carrying out more than 300 engagements a year. She had an immense and very genuine interest in the arts, which at a young age included a talent for the piano as well as a fine singing voice. In 1957 she was made an honorary Doctor of Music of London University, and in that same year she became the first president of the Royal Ballet. She was a member of the royal family who had a very close identification with the world of entertainment and the film industry and many of the great stars of not only the United Kingdom but Hollywood as well. Her death is a particular blow to her mother, made all the more poignant by the fact that the burial will take place on the 50th anniversary of the burial of the late King George VI, the Queen's father, a person whose sudden and unpredicted accession to the throne in 1936, on the abdication of King Edward VIII, changed the life of the then infant Princess Margaret and her older sister Elizabeth. Many Australians met Princess Margaret on her two visits to Australia, in 1972 and 1975. She carried out those duties in a warm and friendly fashion. She was a vivacious person who enjoyed life to the full. In a privileged environment, against a backfor ground of being born into particularly atypical circumstances, her life contained its moments of happiness and its moments of sorrow. On behalf of the government, and I know on behalf of all members of the House, I extend particular condolences to her sister, Her Majesty the Queen, and to her mother. It is pleasing that the Queen's attendance at CHOGM and her visit to South Australia and Queensland will go ahead notwithstanding the death of her sister. On behalf of all members of the parliament, I extend to the Queen, to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and to Princess Margaret's two children our condolences and our sympathy, and we record our respect for the contribution she made to public life in the fulfilment of her duties as a member of the royal family.",41
64,Mr CREAN,CONDOLENCES,"I second the motion moved by the Prime Minister. It is a terrible tragedy when a mother loses a daughter, and members of the Labor Party express our deepest sympathies to the Queen Mother on the loss of her daughter, Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. Our thoughts and sympathies also go out to the Queen, who lost her only sister, and to Princess Margaret's children, Lord Linley and Lady Sarah, at this very sad time for all of them. Princess Margaret visited Australia twice. In 1972 she toured Western Australia with her husband, Lord Snowdon, undertaking many formal duties, and she met many people, including indigenous Australians. On that trip she unveiled a commemorative plaque for the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, which was named in her honour. In 1975 she visited again to help commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps. She held a number of honorary commands in the British Armed Forces. Princess Margaret did use her office for good public duties. She served a number of charities and public organisations that promoted the welfare of children. There was Barnardo's-the Prime Minister mentioned that for 36 years she was involved with that organisation-and also the Invalid Children's Aid Association. She also had very strong connections with nurses and the nursing profession, including the Royal College of Nursing and the National Council of Nurses of the United Kingdom. She had a long-term association with English and Scottish culture, including the Royal Ballet, the London Festival Ballet and the Sadler's Wells Foundation. But she will mostly be remembered for the way she lived her life, in particular her inability to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend. She was ahead of her times but she was also a victim of her times. Princess Margaret had much popular support over the marriage plans but not institutional or politiists, cal support. Looking back at the history of that episode reminds us of how things have changed. The then cabinet, under Sir Winston Churchill, actually made it known that they would not approve the marriage because Captain Townsend had been divorced. Thankfully, today we live in more enlightened times and it is hard to see today politicians involving themselves so directly in the private affairs of women in that way. Princess Margaret was a modern and defiant royal. Although it often made life difficult for her, by courting controversy and creating precedence, she helped gain sympathy for the difficulties faced by women in prominent public roles. Our sympathies go out to the family. She is a very sad loss for all of us.",42
65,Mr ANDERSON,CONDOLENCES,"In joining in this condolence motion I know that I speak not only for my own party but for all members of the House and, I am sure, the overwhelming majority of Australians. Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret was born in 1930, as the Prime Minister referred to. It was a royal birth in the old style. There was the lighting of a huge beacon and there were 41 gun salutes all over the place. Church bells rang out all over England. Princess Margaret and her older sister Elizabeth seemed destined for a sheltered and comfortable life until their future changed dramatically in 1936, the year that began with the death of the old King George V and ended with the abdication of Edward VIII. Elizabeth was suddenly the heir presumptive and the pomp of royal ritual closed in on the family. In her 20s, as has been alluded to here, Princess Margaret chose duty over her heart, a decision that unquestionably echoed through the rest of her life. Despite that, she carried out a very busy schedule of royal engagements, which included two visits to Australia, in 1972 and 1975. As has been mentioned here, at the height of her public engagements she carried out more than 300 functions and commitments a year. It sometimes seems that our fascination with the glamour, the colour and sometimes the controversy-and certainly, when it exthe tragedy-that attend the lives of those who are in that public eye allows us to too readily overlook important things like a sense of duty, a commitment to others and a willingness to put in many hours, often in self-sacrificial activities. Last year we celebrated the International Year of the Volunteer, a good thing to celebrate. Frankly, I was one Australian who was somewhat unaware, until I started to prepare for this motion, of the extent to which Princess Margaret really was prepared to make sacrifices in the interests of doing things for other people well beyond that which she might reasonably have been expected to make, notwithstanding her very high position. Princess Margaret will be remembered not only for those charitable activities and her strong interest in them but also for her youth activities and her interest in the arts. As has been mentioned, she was also very prominent in the British National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children-of course, a work that all of us in this place would very strongly recognise and support. Princess Margaret had a long association with the Girl Guide movement which began in 1937 when she became a Brownie in the first Buckingham Palace Girl Guide troop. In later life, she was Chief Ranger of the Commonwealth and President of the Girl Guides Association. She had a close interest in the arts. She was first President of the Royal Ballet and patron of the Scottish Ballet. Princess Margaret is survived by two children from her marriage to the Earl of Snowdon-Lord Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto. She emphasised that her children were not members of the royal family and that they were therefore able to develop their own talents in their own ways. Lord Linley became an accomplished cabinet-maker and his sister worked in the film industry before becoming a painter. As I said earlier, I know that all of us would join in expressing our sympathies to her children, to her family and to her many friends and admirers everywhere. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. Adermann, Hon. Albert Evan, AO Freeth, Hon. Sir Gordon, KBE Chaney, Hon. Sir Frederick Charles, KBE, AFC",43
66,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at deaths of the following former Ministers, the Honourable Albert Evan Adermann, AO, former Member for Fisher and Fairfax, the Honourable Sir Gordon Freeth, KBE, former Member for Forrest, and the Honourable Sir Frederick Charles Chaney, KBE, CBE, AFC, former Member for Perth, and that the House places on record its appreciation of their long and meritorious service, and tenders its profound sympathy to their families in their bereavement. These three ministers served in the parliament over a very long period going back to the 1950s and up until, in the case of Evan Adermann, the early 1990s. Evan Adermann was born in Kingaroy on 10 March 1927. He attended Brisbane Boys College and the University of Queensland, where he received a Bachelor of Commerce. He was a dairy farmer, a public accountant, a councillor on the Kingaroy Shire Council and a great cricket fan. He married Joan in 1951 and they had three sons and two daughters. He was elected as the member for Fisher in 1972 following the retirement of his father, the late Sir Charles Adermann. He held the seat until 1984, when he was elected as the member for the redistributed seat of Fairfax, a seat he held until his retirement prior to the 1990 election. He was opposition spokesman for customs and excise when I entered the parliament in 1974, and he became Minister for the Northern Territory, Minister Assisting the Minister for National Resources, Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry. I served in the first Fraser ministry alongside Evan Adermann. If ever a person qualified for the description of being an essentially very decent, thoroughgoing gentleman, it was Evan Adermann. He was friendly and conscientious. He was a decent man. He cared for people. I remember him best as somebody who worked tirelessly on the re-establishment of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy. Of course, the reconstruction commission had been established by the Whitlam government, but much work remained to be done after the Fraser government was elected. He was a devoted member of the Church of Christ and he gave much of his time as a lay preacher in that church. He was honoured in 1990 as an Officer of the Order the of Australia for service to the parliament and service to the Church of Christ in Queensland. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Joan, to his children Joanne, Jenny, David, Peter and John and to other members and friends our very deep and sincere sympathy in their bereavement. There would not be anybody in the parliament now who would have served when Sir Gordon Freeth was here. Sir Gordon Freeth left the parliament having been defeated in the seat of Forrest in the 1969 election. He then continued to make very significant contributions to public life, including a very successful period of time as Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. He was born on 6 August 1914 at Angaston in South Australia. He attended Sydney Church of England Grammar School, Guildford Grammar School in Western Australia and the University of Western Australia, where he gained his law degree in 1938. In 1938 he competed in the Sydney Empire Games where he rode in the winning four. In 1939 he married Joan Baker and they had twin daughters, Felicity and Susan, as well as a son, Robert. In 1939 he set up his law practice at Katanning in Western Australia. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II and flew Beauforts in New Guinea, and he was a flight lieutenant by the time he was demobilised in 1945. He belonged to that very special group of members of parliament known affectionately as the 49ers. Many of them were swept in as returned servicemen in the 1949 election. He was returned to parliament seven times, and in 1955-something unknown now-he was returned unopposed in the seat of Forrest. There are not too many examples of that occurring now. I think that, while you have public funding, it is unlikely to come back. He held his seat until 1969 and, as the foreign minister and I were reflecting earlier, the view is that a speech that he made at the time about the presence of Soviet naval capacity in the Indian Ocean was one of the things used by his political opponents on the right-hand side of politics to bring about his defeat. He did have a very long and distinguished ministerial career. He was Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works in 1958, and over the next 10 years he also held the positions of Minister Assisting the Attorney General, Minister for Shipping and Transport, Minister for Air and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. He was appointed Minister for External Affairs, replacing Sir Paul Hasluck, in 1969 when Sir Paul became Governor General, and he held that position until he was defeated at the 1969 election. He was Ambassador to Japan from 1970 to 1973 and High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1977 to 1980. In 1978 he was knighted for his distinguished public and parliamentary service. He was a very keen and accomplished sportsman. He was known as a strong squash player. He also enjoyed boxing, rowing, running and swimming in his younger years. As I mentioned earlier, he was part of a successful four at the Empire Games in 1938. I personally got to know Sir Gordon Freeth when he was High Commissioner in London in the late 1970s when I was Minister for Special Trade Negotiations. I found him a gracious, courteous, helpful and charming person to deal with. He represented this country with very great dignity and style, both in Japan and in the United Kingdom, and I want to record my personal gratitude for the many courtesies he extended to me on those occasions. On behalf of the government, I want to extend to his children, Felicity, Susan and Robert, and to other family members and friends, our very sincere sympathy in their bereavement. Frederick Charles Chaney was born on 12 October, also in 1914, at Fremantle. Life in the early years was very difficult for him and for his widowed mother during the Great Depression. After completing his primary education at state and Catholic schools, Fred was granted a scholarship to the CBC Aquinas College. In 1932 he joined the state education department, not being able to afford university, and pursued a career as a teacher. He married Mavis, a fellow teacher, in 1938 and they had four sons and three daughters. In 1941 he enlisted in the RAAF, where he trained as a pilot and became a flying instructor. He served in Australia, New Guinea and Borneo and for a time he performed RAAF reconnaissance as a member of the legendary Z Force commando unit. As a result of a number of daring rescue missions, Fred was awarded the Air Force Cross for courage, skill and resourcefulness. After his discharge in 1945, he returned to teaching and became a deputy headmaster. He was the first World War II veteran to become Western Australian President of the RSL. He was elected as the member for Perth in 1955 and he retained the seat until 1969. He was Government Whip in 1962 and 1963 at a time when the coalition had a majority of one. He was appointed as Minister for the Navy shortly after the Voyager disaster. He was Administrator of the Northern Territory from 1970 to 1973, and it was during this time that he developed a very strong interest in matters affecting the indigenous people of this country. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year's honours for long political and public service and he was knighted in 1981. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Mavis, and his children, Robyn, Fred, Karen, Richard, Michael, John and Jillian, and their husbands and wives and children and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. I did not know Fred Chaney all that well but my personal contact with him was such that I found him to be an immensely likeable person who mixed very easily. He obviously would have brought to this parliament that experience of World War II which was so common for men of his generation who served in this parliament. The Chaney family were a great and strong family, and they have had a considerable political influence in Western Australia and on this parliament. One of Fred's sons, Fred, served in the Senate and in the House of Representatives and one of his daughters married Ross MCLean, who was also the member for Perth until 1983. To the extended Chaney family, I extend my personal sympathy and the sympathy of all members of this House. Mr Speaker, I know that you will, in a moment, also refer to the death of three former members. With your indulgence, could I attach my sympathy to that reference. David Hamer was a Liberal colleague of ours in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. He was the member for Isaacs, defeated in the 1974 election and re-elected in 1975. In 1977, he re-entered the parliament as a senator for Victoria, and he held this position until 1990. Ralph Jacobi-who in my early years I found to be a great debating opponent in this place on a lot of issues, ticularly issues relating to financial matters-had a very good brain on financial matters, and he was a great example of somebody who I think was of the generation that, by dent of economic circumstances, had to be self-taught. I found him a very likeable person and somebody who would always enter into the good spirit of the debate on a substantive issue. He was elected as the member for Hawker in 1969 and held the seat for 18 years until his voluntary retirement in 1987. I did not know Cathrine Brownbill. She was the member for Kingston. She was elected in the Holt landslide to the seat of Kingston in 1966 and held the seat until her defeat in 1969. I also extend, by incorporation in the motion, a reference to those three former members.",44
67,Mr CREAN,CONDOLENCES,"I second the motion of the Prime Minister, because through it the parliament pays its respects to three ministers who have served their nation in time of war and peace-two of whom as servicemen. I will not repeat the histories of those ministers. The Prime Minister has done that appropriately, and we simply acknowledge those points. However, there are a few additional points I would like to make. The Hon. Gordon Freeth, the Hon. Sir Fred Chaney and the Hon. Albert Adermann served in a wide range of ministries, and after leaving the parliament they continued to serve the public. Two of them in particular did this- Sir Fred Chaney as Lord Mayor of Perth and another as an ambassador from this country to Japan and subsequently as High Commissioner to London. A common theme in this condolence and that of some of the non-ministers whose contributions are also being acknowledged today is that most of the deceased had distinguished military careers. Gordon Freeth flew bombers with the RAAF in New Guinea and Sir Frederick Chaney flew with the RAAF as an artillery spotter in New Guinea and Borneo. He was awarded the Air Force Cross, as the Prime Minister mentioned. He was later Minister for the Navy. Albert Adermann, whilst he did not serve, had contact with vetparerans as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. David Hamer-who, whilst not the subject of this condolence, will be discussed after this-was decorated for his part in the naval campaigns in the Pacific in 1945 that were subject to Kamikaze attack. He served in Korea and rose to be a destroyer squadron commander. With young Australians now serving abroad in two theatres-East Timor and the war on terrorism-it is fitting that we honour their service and that of all of our veterans. They were also concerned with issues that still concern us today. Fred Chaney had a keen interest in Aboriginal affairs and education, and he was made a blood brother of the Groote Eylandt artist Yirawala. Evan Adermann and Fred Chaney both played a part in the development of the Northern Territory, as minister and administrator of that Territory respectively. So we, the members on this side of the House, convey our respects to the families and friends of the ceased ministers. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would also like to note the death of Ralph Jacobi. He was, as the Prime Minister indicated, a fierce defender and representative South Australia; he took a very keen interest. He and his wife, Stella, were known very closely to my parents-both of whom are in the chamber today. Ralph was one of those people who just did not give up on his passions and his interests, and with the HIH collapse he was in constant correspondence with me, as shadow Treasurer, indicating the sorts of reforms that should have taken place. He served as the member for Hawker from 1969 to 1987. I hope that there will be an opportunity for me-perhaps in one of the adjournment slots, Mr SPEAKER - to say some more about Ralph. He was a great defender of democracy; he was a person that gave it his all. He was a great representative in the parliament, not just for the Labor Party but for the people of Hawker.",46
68,Mr ANDERSON,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing my condolences to the families and friends of all of those who have been mentioned but in particular to those of Evan Adermann. I would like to speak very briefly about him, and I know that there are those in the House who maintained close contact with him until quite recent times. That would particularly apply to some of my Queensland colleagues in the National Party. I briefly overlapped with him in this place in terms of parliamentary service from the time that I entered at a by-election in 1989 through to his retirement at the election called by then Prime Minister Hawke in early 1990, so I do not claim to have known him well personally, but he was very highly regarded for his decency. He was by then not a young man anymore, but his gentleness, his humility and his consideration of others and their needs were qualities that made themselves apparent almost immediately upon meeting him, and it is right that those qualities have been so generously noted here today. His father, who had been a member of de- parliament before him for some 30 years, had served as Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Primary Industries and, from 1964 to 1966, as Deputy Leader of the Country Party. Evan followed. As has been mentioned, he of had a Bachelor of Commerce and he had worked as a dairy farmer, a public accountant and been a shire councillor before he came to this place. Evan Adermann, as the Prime Minister said, was a very hard worker in terms of his responsibilities as Minister for the Northern Territory in 1975. When it came to rebuilding Darwin, he was active indeed. He was also the minister responsible for declaring the Uluru National Park and was responsible, too, for establishing the Territory's self government arrangements. Indeed, he was so good at his job that he lost his job. The appointment of the first Northern Territory government meant that Canberra no longer needed a specialist Northern Territory minister, and he went then to Veterans' Affairs. His great achievement there, not to be overlooked, was to establish the first medical inquiry into the effects of defoliants such as Agent Orange on Australian servicemen in Vietnam, something that I know has plucked at the heartstrings of all of us who have considered the plight of those who returned from Vietnam-a group of men and women who for too long were not accorded their proper place and respect in our community for that which they were engaged in. They left this country, many of them. I suspect very reluctantly, to participate in an engagement that they felt they ought to participate in as loyal Australians but they were not exactly brought home as heroes. That has left deep scars on many of those people. Evan was one who understood that and worked hard to turn around attitudes. We can say today that we honestly do respect and have a very great sympathy for what those young Australians who went to Vietnam went through on our behalf. Evan Adermann left the ministry in 1980 and retired 10 years later. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1999 Queen's Birthday honours for service to the Australian parliament, and I understand that that meant a great deal to him and to his family. He did not allow his political achievements to distract him from the most important aspects of his life, which he saw as his church and his family. He was a devoted member of the Church of Christ and a lay preacher in that organisation. I again join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in extending my sympathy, the party's sympathy and the parliament's sympathy to his wife, Joan, and his children, Joanne, Jenny, David, Peter and John.",47
69,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"There seems to be some confusion about the matter before us, and that is not what anyone would want over a condolence motion. The difficulty has arisen because the briefing I had did not dicate that there were other people wanting to speak on the motion of condolence for Princess Margaret. We intend to facilitate that as soon as we can. The motion I currently have before the chair deals with the deaths of Mr Evan Adermann, Mr Gordon Freeth and Sir Frederick Charles Chaney. I thought that ought to be dealt with appropriately. We will then return to the Princess Margaret condolence motion. If that causes confusion in the House, I regret that, but it would seem to me to be the most dignified way in which to deal with this matter.",48
70,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,CONDOLENCES,"I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the late Frederick Chaney Sr, member for Perth from 1955 to 1969. I have been a resident of the seat of Perth since 1967 and Fred Chaney Sr is the only post World War II member for Perth whom I have not personally campaigned either for or against. I did however have the great pleasure of campaigning with him during the republic referendum in 1999, when all of the surviving members for Perth jointly campaigned on a ‘yes' unity ticket. It is not, however, just my regard for Sir Fred Chaney Sr as a republican which sees me join his condolence motion today. He is of course a most distinguished predecessor as member for Perth. He is held in high rethe gard by the people of Perth, both as a member for Perth and subsequently as Lord Mayor of the city of Perth. This regard crosses political boundaries and is in my view the bedrock of the respect which the Chaney name has in Western Australia today. Together with the member for Brand, I was able to attend Sir Fred's funeral service just before Christmas. He was given what you could only describe as a terrific send-off by friends, family and members of the community; in particular, those people involved and active in the Catholic community in Western Australia, those people interested in educational and Aboriginal issues in Western Australia and members of the returned services community, who held him in fond regard as a local member, a state president of the RSL and as a service minister in the in- course of his parliamentary and ministerial career. I wish to extend my condolences to the family, particularly those members of the Chaney family whom I have had some personal contact with over the years; in particular, Fred Jr, a member for Pearce in this place previously and now associated very much publicly with reconciliation and Aboriginal issues; Dr Ric Chaney, a well regarded and community orientated general practitioner of medicine in the electorate of Perth-indeed, in the suburb in which I live; Michael, a well known and respected member of the Perth business community; John Chaney, the younger son, who was a couple of years above me at law school and now a distinguished legal practitioner; and Ross MCLean, his son-in-law, also a former member for Perth. The interests and regard of the members of the Chaney family reflect the values, principles and humanitarian and Christian beliefs that Sir Fred Chaney, in my view, stood for and exemplified over a long period of time. I have great pleasure in associating myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I commend the motion to the House.",48
71,Mr TRUSS,CONDOLENCES,"Today the House is recording and recognising the contribution of a number of distinguished Australians to our national I would like to speak specifically about Evan Adermann, a man whom I have known for most of my life. He served with my father on the Kingaroy Shire Council. His father, Sir Charles Adermann, was my federal member during most of my childhood years and, indeed, was a man I admired very greatly. He encouraged me personally in my own public life. Sir Charles was the agriculture minister in the Menzies government and, as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, he rose to be Deputy Leader of the National Party in this House. It was a different era but he enjoyed a spect and admiration of his constituents in the community that I think is lost in the rent generation. Sir Charles was a gentle and caring man, a farmer, an industry leaderone of the fathers of the peanut industry-a businessman, a shire councillor, a prominent churchman, a member of parliament and a minister. Evan, his oldest son, was a gentle and caring man, a farmer, an industry leader, a businessman, a shire councillor, a prominent churchman, a member of parliament and a minister. They were indeed a distinguished father and son team. Evan was born in Kingaroy on 10 March 1927. He went to school in Kingaroy and Brisbane, and then studied medicine at Queensland University. He came to the view that medicine was not his calling and so he purchased a business in Kingaroy and also went into farming. He was farming at a little place called Corndale, which is just outside of Kingaroy, and he must have been very near to another famous Kingaroy lad by the name of Matthew Hayden. Matthew was last night named Cricketer of the Year. I am sure that Evan followed his career with great interest, as do the many other Kingaroyites on this side of the chamber admire Matthew's achievements. While he was farming, he became an external student at Queensland University and obtained his bachelor of commerce degree. It was while he was practising as an accountant that I first came to know him in Kingaroy. He served on the Kingaroy Shire Council for nine years, on the hospital board and in the Maryborough dairy association. He was seclife. retary of many local community organisations, including the Booie Soil Conservation Group and a parents and citizens association. He was a director and later the chairman of radio station 4SB, in which the Adermann family took a very keen interest. He married Joan Hovard, whom he had met during his time in Brisbane. Her brother Bill has been my campaign director for four of my election campaigns. He had a particularly keen interest in the church, as others have mentioned. He was a Sunday school teacher, a youth leader, a deacon and a lay preacher. After he retired from parliament, he became president re- of the Queensland Churches of Christ and, right up to his death, took a keen interest in cur- church affairs, including the Kenmore Theological Board. Evan was a man who certainly contributed enormously to the local community. When he retired from parliament in 1990, the curtain fell on 47 years of father and son representation for the Kingaroy and later the Sunshine Coast regions in this House. The Adermann family made a remarkable contribution to Kingaroy and the Kingaroy district, and also to the nation. Others have referred to Evan's ministerial service as Minister for the Northern Territory. In fact, he was the last Minister for the Northern Territory, because after self-government there was no need for such a department. He was also prominent in the period when the reconstruction of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy was prominent in the national agenda. Evan was a gentle, loving and dedicated man, but he was also strong, loyal and determined. There was perhaps one thing that Evan put above his service to his community and even his dedication to his family, and that was his love of God and his commitment to his church. This was very much the first thing in his life. Even in his latter days, when he endured much pain and disfiguring surgery, his faith never wavered. His devotion to his family, to his friends and to those around him was certainly appreciated, but he always turned for comfort to his God and to his lifelong faith. At his funeral service, there was a little poem that I think gave encouragement to him, but also to others who face his illnesses. It read: cancer is so limited; it cannot cripple love, it cannot shatter hope, it cannot corrode faith, it cannot remove peace, it cannot destroy confidence, it cannot kill friendship, it cannot shut out memories, it cannot silence courage, it cannot invade the soul, it cannot reduce eternal life, it cannot quench the spirit, it cannot lessen the power of the resurparties. rection. It was with that spirit that Evan endured his last difficult times. His funeral, though, was not an occasion of sorrow or despair; it was a celebration of his achievements but also a celebration of hope for his family, friends and those who were with him of the sure and certain confidence that he was leaving this earth to be with his Heavenly Father in a far happier place. Evan has made a great contribution to this country. I record my sympathies to Joan and the family. I appreciate very much the help and assistance that Evan has provided to me over the years and I recognise the enormous contribution-the almost unparalleled contribution-that the Adermann family have made to the South Burnett region, in my own electorate, and also now parts of the Sunshine Coast.",48
72,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"Noone who attended the funeral of Fred Chaney could fail to have been impressed by several things. The first was the magnificent family over whom he was the patriarch for so long and the massive contribution that family has made to the political, social and economic life in Western Australia. The second thing that would have impressed those who attended was what a full human being Fred Chaney was. He was a knockabout character, a character not without erudition. He was a person who replicated in his life many of the attributes that Australians like to attach to themselves and who took those attributes not just from where they are often to be found, and joyfully to be found-around the bar at bowling clubs, RSL clubs or whatever-but from the halls of this parliament, local government and the administration of an important territory like the Northern Territory. In all those places he found himself to be in a situation with which he was always entirely comfortable. He drew to himself people of all sorts of views, not just those views to which he himself was personally attached. The third thing that those attending that funeral would have been impressed by was the enormous affection and regard in which he and his family are held by the huge number of people who attended from all political It was a celebration of a great Western Australian life and a great Western Australian family. My sympathies go to Mavis and to all the children and grandchildrenthe enormous numbers of them who got up and expressed themselves in different ways about the love they had for their dad, their grandad and their relative. I also want to take the indulgence that the Prime Minister did-although I do realise that I am on less indulgence these days than I once was-to say a word or two about Ralph Jacobi, with whom I served for seven years in parliament when we were at the other place. Ralph was a magnificent mentor to new members of parliament like me. Gareth Evans once complained that he had a whole filing cabinet full of Ralph's magnificent obsessions. Most of those magnificent obsessions ran to the financial management and accountability of companies. Most of what Ralph had to say was absolutely on the button. Almost nothing that Ralph had to say was ever implemented in legislation. The consequences are collapse, after collapse, after collapse and shareholders being ripped off and the like. Ralph, on his deathbed, was worried about the outcome of HIH. When I phoned him the day before he died, Ralph was still keen to get from me the Temby report into the affairs of some financial shysters operating in Western Australia. They were truly magnificent obsessions, protecting the position of the ordinary shareholder and the ordinary customer of companies in this country. He pursued his concerns in that regard well beyond his life in parliament, literally to the grave. Ralph had other obsessions as well. When I spoke to him I said that we still had not managed to catch up on the Middle East subcommittee of the joint foreign affairs committee, as far as I was aware, and his view that Middle East politics all stopped in 1938 and began and ended with water. I served on the joint foreign affairs committee with Ralph for a period of time. That was another of his abiding interests-what he always regarded as the fulcrum, if you like, of the cess or failure of the international political system and the location where he most feared massive conflict was likely to emerge, and that was in the Middle East. Ralph was almost a biblical character in that concern of his. He was a person of whom all of us in parliament would be proud. He was a great parliamentarian from an old-fashioned school. He was a person who sought his joys in the ability to contribute in this place as a member of parliament with a great belief in the role of the individual member. He was not necessarily concerned with the view that one only succeeds in this place by being a minister, cabinet minister, leader or whatever. The Australian nation is poorer for the passing of Ralph.",50
73,Mr WILLIAMS,CONDOLENCES,"I also rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister. I do so to refer in particular to the careers of the last two surviving ministers in the Menzies government from Western Australia: Sir Gordon Freeth, who died in November; and Sir Fred Chaney, who died in December. I did not know either of them particularly well, but I have had extensive associations with a number of the Chaney children, including Fred Jr, and I was at university with one of Sir Gordon Freeth's daughters. There are some curious parallels in their careers, but they were vastly different people. Both were born in 1914, both finished the war as flight lieutenants, both came into the parliament from Western Australia and both lost their seats in 1969. Both of them were prominent public figures when I was growing up. They were readily recognisable as significant people in the community. Sir Fred seems to have had a lot of adversity in his life. His mother was widowed, I think twice. He went through the Depression, could not afford to go to university and ended up, virtually without any training at all, becoming a schoolteacher; he subsequently went on to do further training. His reputation-not one that I could recognise in his later years-was that he was something of a larrikin. The adversities he faced were not only living through the Desucpression and being part of the war but, when he was in parliament and received promotion, he became government whip, as the Prime Minister pointed out, at a time when the Menzies government had a majority of one. At the eulogy given by Fred Jr, referred to by the member for Perth and the member for Brand, he pointed out that earlier last year Sir Fred had given him a silver mug engraved, ‘Fred Chaney MP, with gratitude for 1962,' and signed ‘Robert Menzies'. It must have been a tough year for the government whip in 1962. At the end of 1963 he ceased to be whip, and in early 1964 became the Minister for Navy. He faced adversity there too because, not long prior to his appointment as minister, the Voyager incident occurred, and he was the minister responsible for dealing with the aftermath. I have to say that there is still litigation going on arising out of those events. On the suggestion that he was a larrikin, I cannot personally add anything-but it is worth referring to a story told by Fred Jr in the eulogy at Sir Fred's funeral. Fred Jr raised the question of why his father, with all of his talents, had not been promoted beyond the rank of flight lieutenant. The reason he gave was in this story, which is probably true. Sir Fred was twice promoted to the position of Acting Squadron Leader but on each occasion the promotion was short-lived. At one stage while he was Acting Squadron Leader he was in Borneo. The wing commander at that time, Fred explained, had a small pig that he was expecting to eat. It disappeared. Acting Squadron Leader Chaney was constituted as a committee of inquiry of one, to inquire into the matter. He duly reported that the pig had disappeared without trace. Shortly afterward, a party was held at the base hospital. The wing commander was chatting with the matron and he began to introduce Acting Squadron Leader Chaney. She said, ‘We know him; he is our favourite pilot.' The wing commander asked why this was. ‘Because he gave us a delicious little pig,' was the reply. I am told that that was typical of him. As a person he seems to have enjoyed the affection of everybody. I think he has a very significant lasting monument to his life in his children. They are all high achievers and, as the member for Brand has pointed out, they have made a very significant contribution to the life of Western Australia and they continue to do so. It is also noteworthy that Sir Fred and his wife, Mavis, enjoyed a very close relationship. They were married in 1938 and the marriage lasted until his death-some 63 years. Sir Gordon Freeth is a different person altogether to Sir Fred Chaney. He came across as an urbane, sophisticated and polite person. His career in parliament was longer than Sir Fred's-he held a number of ministerial appointments. It is a matter of regret that probably the last event in his ministerial career is one that is held against him. He made a fairly open and forthright statement about the role of the Russian navy in the Indian Ocean, for which he suffered political consequences. After a distinguished career he served as Ambassador to Japan for four years, and then as High Commissioner in London. He died in the same year as Sir Fred, having been born in the same year as Sir Fred. I extend my sympathy to the children of Sir Gordon Freeth and to the extensive family of Sir Fred Chaney.",51
74,Mr SOMLYAY,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the condolence motion for Evan Adermann. As the Prime Minister has said, Evan Adermann was elected as member for Fisher in 1972 following the retirement of his father, Sir Charles Adermann. Evan was the first member for Fairfax when the seat was created in 1984. I succeeded him as member for Fairfax in 1990. Evan is actually the reason I moved to Queensland. I worked for Evan Adermann from 1976 to 1980 as his ministerial chief of staff in the portfolios the Northern Territory and then in veterans affairs. Evan was also minister assisting Doug Anthony in natural resources, Peter Nixon in the transport and Ian Sinclair in primary industry. Evan had the respect of everyone who knew him. His departmental heads, such as Ray Livingstone and Sir Richard Kingsland, had the utmost respect for Evan Adermann as a person and as an effective minister. He was a quiet man but he got the job done. He did not seek the limelight in his position but he was devoted to service of the people and their interests. He brought the Northern Territory to self-government and was the minister responsible for the Darwin Reconstruction Commission during the rebuilding of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy. He is very fondly remembered by old Territorians. As Minister for Veterans' Affairs, he was a passionate advocate on behalf of the veteran community. I had the pleasure of accompanying him to Europe in 1978 on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Armistice when he joined the pilgrimage of World War I veterans from Gallipoli to the Somme and to Flanders, where he visited the grave of his father's brother. It is ironic that the host of that visit, Sir Gordon Freeth, was the High Commissioner to the UK during this visit. In his private life, Evan Adermann was the perfect family man. He was totally devoted to his wife, Joan; to his sons, David, Peter and John; and his daughters, Joanne and Jennifer. His great passion was his love of the Church of Christ and he played an active role in it as a lay preacher. I learned my politics from Evan Adermann during the Joh Bjelke-Peterson era in Queensland, when they played their politics pretty hard and tough. Evan was a board member of radio 4SB in Kingaroy. I fondly remember travelling with him on the 3½ hour journey on Saturdays to Kingaroy. Whilst he was in the board meeting, I would sit with his late father, Sir Charles Adermann, as he reminisced about his political career from 1947 through to the ‘Black Jack' MCEwen days. Sir Charles told me he would write a book one day, but he never did. Evan Adermann inherited his father's political of skills but he never sought the top job or the political limelight, though he did not lack the skills or the knowledge. He is sadly missed by his wife, Joan, and by his children, grandchildren and his many friends and former colleagues. I offer my sincere condolences to the family. Evan Adermann was both a gentleman and a gentle man.",52
75,Mr SLIPPER,CONDOLENCES,"Fisher-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (6.45 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, because of the lateness of the hour I will not detain the House for long, but I do want to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister in relation to the late Evan Adermann, whom I succeeded as member for Fisher. Evan was a man of high principle. He was a Christian gentleman. As the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out, he was devoted to his family and church. He and Joan were like parents to me. I was privileged to attend his funeral, and I have spoken to his family. Our community is very much the poorer for his passing. I wish to take this opportunity salute Evan Adermann and the very many principles for which he stood. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. Hamer, Mr David John Jacobi, Mr Ralph, AM Brownbill, Miss Kay Cathrine Millin",53
76,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I inform the House of the deaths of David John Hamer, Ralph Jacobi and Kay Cathrine Millin Brownbill, former members of this House. David Hamer died on 14 January 2002. He represented the division of Isaacs from 1969 to 1974 and from 1975 to 1977. Ralph Jacobi died on 15 January 2002. He represented the division of Hawker from 1969 to 1987. Kay Brownbill died on 3 February 2002. She represented the division of Kingston from 1966 to 1969. As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, I invite honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",53
77,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I thank the House. Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon",53
78,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I should indicate to members that, as a result of an error in the system, the opportunity for people to speak to a condolence motion on Princess Margaret appears to have been lost. It is my intention to allow those who were inadvertently denied that opportunity to speak to do so. Should there not be sufficient time this evening, I would accommodate people later. I want to assure all members that the Hansard that will be sent to the royal family will include all the condolence motions together so they will be a mark of the respect of this House for the memory of Princess Margaret.",53
79,Ms MACKLIN,CONDOLENCES,"I want to add my support to the condolences expressed by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on the death of Princess Margaret. Our sympathy goes especially to the Queen Mother. As others have said, losing a daughter, even at the age that Princess Margaret was, is a very tough thing to experito ence, particularly for a lady of such an advanced age. Our sympathy also goes to the Queen and to the family of Princess Margaret. As many others have said-and certainly as many news reports have touched on-Princess Margaret was a flamboyant and charismatic woman. The essence of what I want to say today is that her sometimes troubled life certainly touched a chord with many people the world over. It is true that she made many contributions to other people's lives through her charity work and her various official responsibilities. She was a patron of many charitable and professional bodies. As my colleague the member for Perth reminded me, she was a great friend-and, of course, the namesake-of that wonderful children's hospital in Perth. I know that she was a very strong supporter, and long standing supporter, of that hospital. Despite these many good works and professional achievements, her personal life was the cause of examination, discussion and, still today, continuing judgment. She was born into a world where her every movement, decision-even emotion-were scrutinised and analysed in the court of public opinion. As the Leader of the House said to me earlier-and I thought he made a really good point-Princess Margaret, unlike all of us who have chosen to go into public life, did not make that choice, but she had to deal with the enormous amount of public attention that was brought on her all through the difficult pressures of her life. She was a very glamorous princess whose life was filled with many official and formal responsibilities, but she was also confronted with the difficulties and challenges that all people have. She was familiar with the good and the bad of life's experiences. Some of her decisions were celebrated and others, unfortunately, were condemned. I think she can be described as part rebel, part perfect princess. She appealed to many of the contradictions in all of us. Above all, Princess Margaret was a woman who, like so many others, did her best to balance conflicting expectations of the public and her family with her responsibilities and her desire to find a place of contentment for herself. In this way, she was a very human princess. She will be sadly missed by very many people.",53
80,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES,"Warringah-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (6.51 p.m.)-I wish to add to the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the gracious comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in respect of Princess Margaret. When Shakespeare said that some are born great, as opposed to achieving greatness or having greatness thrust upon them, most of his listeners would have known what he meant, because in those days leaders were invariably born rather than made. Part of the strangeness-at least to many modern minds of the monarchy-is that these days everyone else in public life has to compete for preferment. But members of the royal family are born to live a life of duty and service. Princess Margaret was, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, a conscript to public life. She did not ask to famous but she was because she was a member of the royal family. Members of the royal family occupy just about the only positions of public leadership which do not require the one in 10,000 qualities of ambition, drive and intellectual commitment. This gives the royal family, despite their lifestyles, a rare potential for empathy with the man and the woman in the street but it does not always equip them for life in a goldfish bowl, and life in a goldfish bowl is certainly the life they have these days. In the last 50 years, as Walter Bagehot feared, daylight has been let in on majesty. Members of the royal family are no longer remote and distant figures of state. In addition to their constitutional role, members of the royal family have become actors in a kind of modern morality play, with heroes and villains according to a fickle public's judgment. In the beginning of her life, Princess Margaret was regarded as a very charming and delightful young lady. Her grandmother, Queen Mary, described her as ‘so outrageously amusing that one can't help encouraging her'. Then, at the time of her doomed romance, as mentioned by the Prime Minister, she became a tragic heroine. I think it is worth quoting, as the Prime Minister did, her statement at the time that she did not go ahead with the marriage. She said: ... mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others. That was a great and gracious statement by a woman who had the potential for greatness in her. But later, as she discovered just how demanding, unforgiving and lonely that life of duty could be, she became one of the first royal rebels, or at least one of the first royal rebels in an age when the media expose every foible of the royal family. Unlike those of us who volunteer ourselves as public role models, Princess Margaret should not be judged harshly because she turned out to be only too human. Like other ancient institutions that we have inherited from Westminster and made magnificently our own, the monarchy should be be approached in a spirit of respect as well as a spirit of critical judgment. We should not forget that when we judge our institutions we are also judging those who have lived under them. It might even be said that our system of government under the Crown is the worse possible system-except for all the others. More than most institutions, the monarchy has been subject to the relentless trivialisation which is the hallmark of the modern era. It is important that we remember that it is our royal family, as well as the British royal family, especially at this time of considerable sorrow for the royal family and for all those countries which enjoy government under the Crown.",54
81,Mr SWAN,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others in this condolence motion and I extend my sympathies to the royal family. Princess Margaret was a survivor from a generation past, when the royal family was a complete symbol of stability and certainty. I think it is fair to say that the long history of that peculiar institution, the British monarchy, its standing was probably never higher than under George VI in the desperate days after Dunkirk in World War II, when the nation faced invasion and defeat-a point that the Prime Minister made very well. Nations do need enduring symbols, and nations at war even more so. George VI himself was a shy man who could never have fulfilled his role alone in those dark days. He did this of course with his family, with the Queen Mother and his children. In Australia we could argue over the disposition of us constitutionally, but there are many republicans here. Whatever the differences we now have, it is hard for Australians of a younger generation to understand the loyalty that older Australians have freely to king and empire. Nevertheless, it still exists. Yes, there are elements of cultural dependence-even cringe-when it comes to our relationships with the British, particularly given the mistakes of the British military, but still all Australians hold that concept of empire and service in high esteem. Princess Margaret grew up on the public stage and I think it is fair to say that she came, over time, a rebel and in many ways was contrasted with the stability of her sister. To maintain the status of the royal family, it was required in those times that its members seem a bit remote and always above criticism. For a time, I think that was the case for Margaret. She played the role of a romantic fairytale princess that was cast for her for a time, but disappointment in love and other events meant that she moved down a different road. But that should not disguise her very good charitable works that have been mentioned at length here tonight. I extend my condolences to the royal family.  support and join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other speakers on this condolence motion. I certainly extend my sympathy to the royal family: Princess Margaret's sister, children and grandchildren. I think we can all empathise with the sorrow that they are currently experiencing. I have in not often spoken on condolence motions, and this is the first time that I have spoken on a condolence motion about a person to whom I have sworn my allegiance on six previous occasions. It is somewhat ironic that in this day and age we are still swearing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen, her heirs and successors but are unable to incorporate the Australian people. Hopefully, that will be a change for the future. I think it is fair to say that Princess Margaret was a more modern royal, trapped in tradition-most important of all, a tradition of duty and service. In the same family, I think there is some irony in the fact that her uncle, King Edward, abdicated the throne for the woman he loved, but his niece gave up the love of her life. I take an interest in family law matters, and I guess the royal family is no different from any other family in that respect. I note that Princess Margaret had a great interest in ballet. It is not something I would ordinarily admit to, but I was once a promising student of the Borovansky Ballet Studio-although looking at my weight and disposition, a lot of members might find that somewhat incredible. Without doubt, Prinbecess Margaret's sister, the Queen, is a person who all Australians admire for the job that she has done. The service and duty with which Princess Margaret assisted the Queen throughout her lifetime are also admired by many older Australians. Unfortunately, Princess Margaret suffered ill health in later life, and so many younger Australians will not get to know her and her good works. I support the condolence motion.",55
82,Mr WILKIE,CONDOLENCES,"I rise this afternoon so that I may also be associated with the comments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others reflecting this parliament's sadness over the passing of Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. I pass on my condolences to the Princess's family, her friends and loved ones. I also pass on the condolences of the people of Swan. It is clear from the tributes that have poured in from around the world that Princess Margaret held a special place in the hearts of many people. Indeed, Princess Margaret had a special relationship with the people of Australia. While she may not have visited our shores for a number of years, many Australians will remember her previous tours with fondness. While there was no formal role for the Queen's younger sister, Princess Margaret showed from an early age that she was prepared for a life of public duty-a commitment that had repercussions in her personal life. As has already been stated, the office was thrust upon her: it was not of her choice, but she held it with dignity and great compassion. Princess Margaret had a great affinity for young children and the sick. In my home state of Western Australia, the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children-an Australian and world renowned hospital for childrenproudly bears her name. The Princess Margaret Hospital was a former children's hospital prior to its name being changed by royal assent in 1949. The Princess Margaret Hospital is Western Australia's only specialist children's hospital. The original hospital had 40 beds, an operating theatre and a small outpatient department. Over the years, the Princess Margaret Hospital has become a household name in Western Australia, synonymous with compassionate and quality health care for children. Each year the Princess Margaret Hospital cares for almost 300,000 children who attend or stay in the 254 bed hospital, which is ognised around the world as a leader in the field of paediatrics. Through the hospital support of research into childhood diseases and education on accident prevention, the hospital strives to reduce the number of children who will need specialist health care in the future. In 1972, Princess Margaret visited the hospital with her former husband, Lord Snowdon-a visit remembered fondly by some who are still on the staff. She is remembered for her gentle and caring nature and her sense of ease with which she was able to communicate with people from different backgrounds. During her visit, she insisted on visiting every child in the hospital. It is fitting that she be remembered in an ongoing way through the Princess Margaret Hospital carrying her name. No reflection on the life of Princess Margaret would be complete without a comment on her obvious love of life, her charm and quick wit. The Prime Minister has already mentioned the comment by Prince Charles when he said, ‘She loved life and lived it to the full.' I think that summed up her life experience. It has been noted by others that, if she had not been born to royalty, the princess may have had a promising career on the stage, such were her talents as a singer, pianist and mimic. I have read that her impersonations of former British Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and John Major were great favourites. While many Australians are questioning the continuing relevance of the monarchy in our political and constitutional affairs, there is no doubt that the values of public duty and commitment admirably shown by Princess Margaret throughout her life continue to have their place. They are values that we should continue to promote and appreciate.",55
83,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"Before I invite the Prime Minister to move the motion by which the House will be adjourned, I ask the whips and any members who because of the nature and the program of today were denied an opportunity to participate in any of the condolence motions to inform my office, and I will endeavour to ensure that they get an opportunity during the adjournment debate to rec- make a contribution to the condolence motions.",56
