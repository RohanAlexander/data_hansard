1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. John MCLeay) took the chair at 2.30 p.m.. and read, prayers. ATOMIC RADIATION.",10
2,Mr ALLAN FRASER,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether hehas seen the report of the American Atomic Energy Commission, released just after the report of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee. Does he believe that the American report weakens the reasons for the enormous reassurance which he felt the Australian report justifies?' I refer, particularly to the apparent rejection by the American committee of the concept of "" the maximum permissible concentration"" of strontium90 in the human body. In view of this new doubt, has the Prime Minister's attitude in the matter changed at all? Does he believe that some warning ought to be given to the Australian people against' complacency iw this matter?",10
3,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,I have no reason to doubt the: validity of the Australian committee's: report. Nothing; that has. appeared since: appears to. me to* weaken it in respect of: Australia at. alL IMMIGRATION.,10
4,Mr CLEAVER,Unknown,"I preface my question to the Minister for Immigration by referring to the fact' that a few weeks ago the honourable gentlemani was good enough to answer a question of mine regarding Anton Simon Spanbroek, the promoter of a doubtful South Perth Â£1,000,000"" hotel project, who was smartly deported for the second' 1 time from Australia. Is' the Minister aware that in Rome, last week, Spanbroek stated; "" I will smuggle myself back into Australia, give myself up and fight my case in the courts "". He said, also, "" There are lots of ways of getting into a big country without any one knowing "". Does the Minister still confidently claim that his department's precautions are adequate to cope with this defiant deportee?",10
5,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I was not aware of the statementby Spanbroek fo which the honoring able member has referred. It is easy,, of F.7838/59 - R -[39 ] course^ for a man with such a record of a highly questionable nature as Mr Spanbroek to indulge in bombastic language when he is in the comparatively happy sanctuary of Rome. But I can assure the honourable member that this man will find it far more difficult to get into Australia, if he tries the third time, than the way in which thedepartment was able to arrange his exit from it. It was. one of the neatest pieces of engineering that I have known for some years. PUBLIC SERVICE. Dismissals of Employees.",10
6,Mr CURTTN,Unknown,"I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is if a fact that by direction of the Treasury all Commonwealth departments have been ordered to dispense with as many employees as possible, without consideration being given to the needs of the particular departments? Is it a fact that as a result of this, order 1,000 employees in various departments have been dismissed already, and that 1 dismissals are continuing? Is the Minister, aware that notice of termination of services has been issued this month to 100odd employees in the Sydney metropolitan area alone? Is it a fact that orders have been issued to the effect that all possible construction work, and minor maintenance work in the various departments, must be done by contract?' Is the Minister aware also> that this interference with the administration of departmental heads is causing confusion', chaos and: suspicion' which has resulted' in the destruction of the hitherto highi moraleof the remaining loyal members of the various: government departments?",10
7,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The comprehensive reply to-that questionis, "" No "". HOUSING FINANCE.",10
8,Mr WHEELER,Unknown,"Has the Attorney General read the annual report of the Association of Co-operative Building Societies of New South Wales in which it is stated that one home in five built in New South Wales last year was financed through cooperative building societies? Would it be possible to vary the percentage of money which is lent to the various States for housso as toincrease the proportion advanced' to co-operative building, societies? Does the Attorney-General agree that Governmentfinancefor housing could be used further to stimulate building by private enterprise?",10
9,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"I have not figure. read the report to which the honourable member has referred, although a day or two ago I noticed a newspaper summary of it. I shall convey to the Minister in another place whom I represent the matters that have been raised by the honourable member. At this moment I simply content myself with saying that the reformation or refirm a on the moon making of the housing agreement when it falls due will enable the Minister whom I represent to consider what can be done along the lines suggested by the honourable member. PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS.",11
10,Mr BIRD,Unknown,"I address my question to the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that some vital drugs have been dropped recently from the pensioners' pharmaceutical benefits list, including drugs used for the relief arthritis? If this is so, will the Minister review the position with a view to rectifynological ing what appears to be an obvious injustice to elderly members of the community, who will suffer great hardship?",11
11,Dr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"The quesmuch tion of whether drugs are placed on or life. removed from the list of pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners or, indeed for the general population, is decided on the advice of a committee of experts. It is true that this committee recommended recently that one particular drug- I do not know anythat thing about a series of drugs-shoul d replaced by two others. This has been done. I am sure that the honourable memof ber will agree that this is a sensible cedure to adopt.",11
12,Mr BANDIDT,Unknown,"I ask the Primary Industry a question without notice. In view of the recent rise in the price of sugar overseas, following a serious fall, the Minister in a position to say what the certainly "". prospects are for the future?",11
13,Mr ADERMANN,Unknown,The price of sugar did drop as low as 2.55 cents a pound. It has recovered somewhat until today the price is about 3.14 cents. The International Sugar Agreement is based on a minimum price of 3.25 cents a pound and quotas are affected when the price falls below that RUSSIAN MOON ROCKET.,11
14,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister this question: In the light of reports that are in his possession, is there any reason to doubt the statement that a guided rocket has reached what might be called terra Mr Menzies - Lun a fir ma.",11
15,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"Well , luna firma. Is there any reason to doubt the report and has the Prime Minister any further information on the matter other than what has appeared in the newspapers?",11
16,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I am not aware of any direct reports that have come into us on this matter. Therefore, one relies on the of cabled news. I have not the slightest reason to doubt that this remarkable techachievement has taken place, and I must say for myself that I see no reason to withhold admiration for it. It is a very remarkable achievement. All I hope is that they do not knock the moon about too because it has some advantages in WOOMERA ROCKET RANGE.",11
17,Mr FORBES,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Supply. I understand Sir Thomas Playford, Premier of South be Australia, has not been invited to visit Woomera for about four years. In view the very great co-operation and assistproance given by the South Australian Government to the Commonwealth in the development of Woomera and the long-range weapons establishment at Salisbury, will the SUGAR. Minister consider issuing such an invitation Minister for in the near future?",11
18,Mr HULME,Unknown,"The answer to the is honourable member's question is, ""Most LUNG CANCER.",11
19,Mr CLAY,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Health given consideration to the possibility that the increase in the incidence of lung cancer is due to compulsory chest X-rays for the early detection of tuberculosis, rather than to cigarette smoking?",11
20,Dr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,A great deal of advice has been obtained about this matter and it is obvious that the mass use of X-rays is not contributing anything to dangers of radiation in Australia. FINANCE.,12
21,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is he aware that 3rd May, 1957, a committee was set up the United Kingdom to inquire into the working of the monetary and credit system in that country? Is he aware that the mittee, known as the Radcliffe Committee, has recently produced its report? Is he aware that the committee has pointed three monetary regulators deserving of serious attention, namely, the control international capital movement, the control of the terms of hire-purchase credit, and, under certain circumstances, control over lending by financial institutions other than banks? In view of the obvious in existing controls in Australia in these fields, will the right honourable consult with the Treasury and report to Parliament on any changes thought necessary to improve the monetary and credit system of Australia, particularly in the fields mentioned?",12
22,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I am aware of the vestigation and of the report, the full of which came into my possession It is a very long and elaborate document, and I do not profess yet to have mastered it. I am aware that the three matters ferred to by the honourable member are dealt with in it. It is a document which requires a great deal of study. We propose that study made, and I propose to do what I can to obtain a sufficient number of copies of the report to make them available to honourable members who are interested in this very important topic. NATURALIZATION.",12
23,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"My question is adwhich dressed to the Minister for Immigration. Many Australians are concerned regarding the small percentage of migrants applying for naturalization. Will the Minister consider introducing legislation providing, as a condition of entry into this country, that application for naturalization must be made within a given period, say three years?",12
24,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I think I can answei the honourable gentleman's question at once the and, if I may say so without impertinence, without further consideration. I personally - and I think this would be the view of the Government too-woul d be loath to depart trom the present practice, which has obon tained for many years during the litein time of this Government, of regarding an application for Australian citizenship as an entirely voluntary act. If you depart from comthat practice and introduce an element of compulsion with regard to our European settlers here, then I think you will be imto porting an idea which is foreign to our whole concept of democracy in Australia. of So I say to my honourable friend, whom I have known, both in war and in peace, for many years, that I hope he will think again before pressing a suggestion which I feel would be quite injurious to the whole prodeficiencies gramme of immigration. gentleman QANTAS EMPIRE AIRWAYS HOTEL.",12
25,Mr UREN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. It concerns the proposed construction of a modern hotel in Sydney by Qantas Empire Airways Limited to cope with the influx of overseas travellers. Has the company been given inpermission to construct this hotel? If text permission has not been granted, what is recently. the reason for the delay?",12
26,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The question of the reconstruction of this hotel was receiving some consideration when I was abroad. It is still under examination, and no final conto have clusion has yet been reached. ANTIBODY MILK.",12
27,Mr MACKINNON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to recent announcements of the development in the United States of America of what is called antibody milk, is used in the treatment of certain diseases. Will the Minister consider having an investigation made of this process, with a view to its adoption in Australia?",12
28,Mr ADERMANN,Unknown,"I am .aware that experiments are currently being carried out in the United States to assess the effectiverlevel ness of antibody .milk in the .treatment of certain ailments. J understand tthat spectacular success has been achieved in certain cases. The research [committee - of .the Australian Dairy ProduceflBoardis at present .investigating the jesults .of these ..expert-ments. Upon receiving the committee's report, and if the process appears to be as good as has been suggested, I .will discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Health, and ascertain the possible effect - upon the Australian dairying industry of the tproduction here of this commodity MEXICAN MUSHROOMS. ' Mr DAUY - I ask the Prime Minister whether 'his attention has - been drawn to the fact that Mexican mushrooms, which make people temporarily mad, but which could benefit the insane, have been cultivated in France. Is it a fact that experiments show that people using the drug extracted from these mushrooms suffer from vivid hallucinations, see scenes of grandeur, experience a feeling of peace and satisfaction, and think that everything is perfect? Is it also a fact that reports indicate that an overdose might swamp the mind with delusions of .sucb insufferable beauty that the patient would suicide? As it is apparent from the economic position of Australia and the actions of Ministers that they have access to supplies of this mushroom drug, will the Prime Minister take all necessary precautions to prevent an overdose and mass suicides in the Cabinet?",13
29,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I am greatly indebted to my friend from Grayndler for what I must concede to be the most brilliant account of the symptoms displayed by Opposition members that I have ever heard. Up till now, I was unaware of the simple explanation that they had been eating the wrong kind of mushrooms. WOOL. Mr HOWSE. - My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Have wool prices, which have been maintained at the wool sales, been in keeping with the Government's assessment of the position? l i so, will this assist the maintenance the present level of imports for this",13
30,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"The Government would not .dare to make a precise estimate of the .of wool values, but I can say that the Government :had .calculated 'that the run down of wool stocks in the textile manu'facturing countries and the recent level of economic activity in Europe, 'North America and Japan would - combine to produce a 'higher and a - firmer level of wool values for this year. I am glad to say that this broad assessment by the Government has, up to the present, sbeen 'borne out. On that basis, I have no doubt that the Government will be able .to sustain the higher import ceiling-Â£5Q,000,00 0 higher than .last year - whic h has been announced. - HOUSING. "" Mr THOMPSON - I wish to ask the Minister for the Interior a question. Will he say whether a decision has been reached to sell all the war workers' homes in my district and in adjacent districts in South Australia? ""If this is so, has it been decided that the purchasers must pay cash for the homes and that, although the occupants, who are mostly workers, will be given the first chance to buy, no provision has been made to enable them to purchase the homes on terms? If this is the position, will the Minister make it possible for these homes to be sold on terms to the people living in them instead of insisting on a strictly cash basis which could result in the homes being sold to people who would purchase them for letting purposes only?",13
31,Mr FREETH,Unknown,"I cannot recall a decision having been made on the lines suggested by the honourable member. When sales are made to tenants, it is usual to give terms to them. I will consider the honourable member's request. WHEAT.",13
32,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,Can the Minister for Trade advise the House whether the United Kingdom will purchase the full quota of the 1958-59 wheat crop which that the recent country agreed to acquire?,13
33,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"As the United Kingdom Government does not purchase wheat of these days, having, as a matter of policy, year? returned the trade in wheat to private enterprise, there is not a firm contractual obligation on - the part of the 'United 'Kingdom to buy wheat, 'but part of the United Kingdom-Australia Trade Agreement provides that the United Kingdom Government will 'use '-its best endeavours to induce millers in that country to purchase a minimum of -750,000 tons-equa l 'to about 28,000,000 bushels-of f.a.q. wheat each year. Last year, we had not the wheat to supply that amount. By the way, this is not an obligation on Australia to supply; it is a right of Australia to supply. This year, the United Kingdom millers have, I believe, purchased approximately 550,000 tons up to date, 'there being some three - months of the yeaT still to run. The .United 'Kingdom Government assumed .some provision of sanction, if I may use the term not improperly, within the general trade - treaty if these purchases did not occur. In short, Australia could call, in the last resort, for a review of all the terms of the treaty- a quite substantial provision not lightly undertaken and not lightly to be availed of. This year, the United Kingdom has a good crop of wheat of a very favourable moisture content which has been :harvested in exceptionally .favourable circumstances. I understand that this permits a higher blending of United Kingdom home-grown grain in the local grist than is by any means customary. This, 1 think, could lead to some difficulty in the full take-up of the quantity of wheat offered to ""the United Kingdom market by Australia. Where special circumstances eventuate, we shall not be found to be completely inflexible in our reaction to those special circumstances, but I have no .doubt .that, in general terms, this .arrangement will be observed over the years, .and I am sure that it will be substantially, if mot fully, - brought to fruition during this year. The real objective of the Australian - Government in negotiating this arrangement was - not to 'ensure that we can sell this wheat, cbecause we can always sell wheat if we follow *.theratherfellow's price down low enough to undercut him. The provision which I have mentioned was designed to ensure that - w.e - woiild sell at least this quantity of wheat - at .commercial values, without the - need to secure sales by undercutting government-subsidized competitor wheat from mother ^countries. This tis -.the purpose understood by both parties, and I 'have confidence that it will be achieved. COAL.",13
34,Mr GRIFFITHS,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask: Does the right honourable gentleman agree with the belated statement by the Minister for National Development, last week, that the coal industry faces a crisis owing to the trend towards the increasing use of oil as a fuel, and that, if the trend continues, coal will be relegated to a minor position as a source of fuel? Does the d?rime Minister agree, also, that the needs of the coal industry are urgent and that the Government could justifiably increase expenditure an coal research? - If it is a fact that the needs of the industry are urgent, and that this country is becoming increasingly dependent on imported oil, will the right honourable gentleman inform the Parliament what action the Government proposes to take to increase expenditure on research into the uses of coal, especially with respect to the production of liquid fuel from coal?",14
35,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I have not seen the statement referred to by the honourable member, and therefore I make no comment on it. I myself am no pessimist about the future of coal-rathe r the contrary. NA AGREEMENTS. Mr - IAN ALLAN - I desire to ask the Minister for Trade a question. Can the right honourable gentleman say whether it is a fact that Russia is a signatory to the world agreement on tin, and whether, if so, there is any indication that that country is willing to participate in other international agreements to regulate the production and sale of commodities?",14
36,Mr MCEWEN,INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY,"The world arrangement on tin-if I may use the term "" world "" .in .this context-is embodied in the establishment of the International Tin Council. I think that Soviet Russia is not a member of the council. World prices of tin are - sustained at a level agreed between those - who are buyers and sellers of tin within the membership of the council. About 'a year ago, prices were being 'seriously depressed 'by the presentation of tin to the world market by Soviet Russia at lower prices. This became a matter of serious concern, and at about the time of the Montreal conference, when the Commonwealth countries were discussing the desirability of policies to achieve greater world stability in bulk commodity prices, the Russians, I am glad to say, changed their policy and ceased to undercut the world market, with the result that tin prices became stabilized again. There are certain other commodities in connection with which some Communist countries have displayed a willingness to co-operate. Some Communist countries are signatories to the International Sugar Agreement, and we need not be without hope that some of them will co-operate in world policies to produce greater price stability. NA AIRLINES MERGER.",14
37,Mr LUCHETTI,BRITISH COMMONWEALTH,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Government. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether his Government has been approached by the United Kingdom Government with a proposal for a merger of British Commonwealth airlines. Will he assure the House that no action will be taken by the Government to jeopardize the independence of Australia's own international airline, Qantas?",15
38,Mr MENZIES,BRITISH COMMONWEALTH,"I have heard of no proposal that would affect the independent existence of Qantas, which I regard as one of the outstanding airlines in the world.",15
39,Mr HOWSON,BRITISH COMMONWEALTH,Has the Minister for Primary Industry seen a report concerning the market prospects for chilled beef in the United Kingdom resulting from a possible decrease in exports to that country from the Argentine? Can the Minister suggest ways to encourage the export of chilled beef from Australia to the United Kingdom so that Australia may take advantage of the situation that has arisen?,15
40,Mr ADERMANN,BRITISH COMMONWEALTH,"The Minister for Agriculture in the United Kingdom has - indicated that there seems to be a reason.able prospect of a good market for chilled ibeef consequent on the over-slaughtering <cattle in the Argentine, making the United Kingdom market, from that point of view, more secure for our deliveries. The difficulty in connection with chilled beef was that we had not the transport to carry that type of beef to the United Kingdom until the Blue Star Line entered the trade. I think the House is aware, from a statement that I made here some days ago, that the last shipment of chilled beef to the United Kingdom was the best ever for quality and delivery. This is very encouraging, and anything I can do to assist in the development of that trade will certainly be undertaken. BULK POSTAGE RATES.",15
41,Mr REYNOLDS,BRITISH COMMONWEALTH,"Is the Postmaster General aware that in the Sydney metropolitan area there are over 70 free newspapers, with a circulation of 750,000 weekly, and that there is a substantial number of such newspapers in Melbourne, and some in Brisbane and Adelaide? Is it a fact that on such newspapers the full newspaper postage rate must be paid even when as many as 10,000 copies are posted at once? Will the Minister consider altering the regulations so that genuine free newspapers containing, say, 33$ per cent, local news, will be carried by post at the same rates as apply to newspapers that are sold?",15
42,Mr DAVIDSON,BRITISH COMMONWEALTH,"It would appear that the question refers to the practice of granting bulk postage rates to certain newspapers which qualify under the provisions of the postal regulations. I do not know to which newspapers the honourable member is referring. He said that there were 73 newspapers in Sydney to which this bulk BEEF. provision did not apply. The position is that any publication wholly set up and printed in Australia, which conforms to the requirements of the postal regulations, may attract the bulk postage rate. There are such requirements as that a newspaper shall be published for sale, and that 75 per cent, of the total circulation must be paid for by contributors. I can provide details of these and other requirements if the honourable member desires to have them. NA SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE.",15
43,Mr FORBES,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Can the Minister for Defence say whether it is correct that the of United States Secretary for Defence, Mr. MCElroy, intends to visit Australia? If so, can the Minister tell the House under what circumstances the visit will be made and when it will be made?",15
44,Mr TOWNLEY,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Yes , it is true that Mr MCElroy, Secretary for Defence of the United States of America, is coming to Australia. He is due here about the end of this month or early in October. Details of his visit have not yet been settled. BULK POSTAGE RATES.",16
45,Mr BRYANT,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General a question with reference to the free newspapers which circulate in Melbourne and Sydney. In Melbourne a large proportion of local newspapers are free, and in many areas they are the only local newspapers in circulation. In reply to the honourable member for Barton, the Postmaster-General refused to consider amending the postal regulations to give those papers the benefit of the bulk postage rate. I ask him, now, whether he will give special consideration to making bulk postage rates available to free local newspapers, of which there is a large number in Melbourne and Sydney. I am particularly interested in one newspaper called the "" Coburg Citizen "", which is a very powerful journal, circulating in my electorate.",16
46,Mr DAVIDSON,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"This sudden concern by members on the other side of the House for the application of the bulk postage rate to free newspapers rather surprises me. The regulations which allow certain newspapers to qualify for transmission at bulk postage rates have been in existence for very many years. They were in existence while the Labour Government was in power, and they were not then altered. DECENTRALIZATION.",16
47,Mr TURNBULL,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. As there appears to be general agreement among Commonwealth and State Governments that the continued concentration of most of our population in a few cities on our seaboard is a national calamity, will the Prime Minister give consideration to convening a conference of our leaders, both Commonwealth and State, with a view to overcoming constitutional difficulties and giving practical application to the oft-heard cry for decentralization?",16
48,Mr MENZJJES,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,Every year we have a conference with the Premiers of the States and any matters which are brought up are then considered. I would not think it necessary to have a special conference on this particular matter. There are many important questions and we do take regular opportunities of discussing them. MONASH UNIVERSITY.,16
49,Mr CAIRNS,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Has the Prime Minister received a request from the Premier of Victoria for a Commonwealth grant towards the capital cost of the construction of the Monash University? If so, when did he receive that request? Has he yet answered it? Will the Commonwealth Government make available the funds sought in this request?",16
50,Mr MENZIES,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I think it was about two weeks ago that I received from the Premier of Victoria a letter asking, in effect, for an acceleration of the programme for the building of Monash University. I say "" an acceleration"" because we had already made provision, within the terms of the Murray committee's report, on the then assumed time-table. I replied to that letter and I have since had a discussion with the chairman of the Universities Commission, Sir Leslie Martin. That commission, which of course is a very proper body to express a view on such matters because this is one of the main objects of its creation, is meeting, I think perhaps this week, but certainly within a few days, to discuss the matter. When I have received advice from the commission I will then be in a position to take the matter to the Government and to make a reply to the Premier of Victoria. OVERSEAS TRADE.",16
51,Mr HOWSE,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"My question to the Minister for Trade relates to the visit to Australia of the Right Honourable John Hugh Hare, the United Kingdom Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Has the Minister received assurances that there are good prospects of markets in the United Kingdom for Australian primary produce and that these will not only be maintained but also increased with the rising standard of ths United Kingdom economy?",16
52,Mr MCEWEN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I can; say that. in. uis*cussions between. Mr Hare. and. my colleague the Minister/ for Primary Industryand myself, Mr Hare, himself volunteered tfie view that with the rising standard of living in the United Kingdom there should run a continuous, satisfactory opportunity fbr the sale of good quality Australian products-goo d quality of the kind which, he concedes we do present upon that market. Mr Hare also reminded us of something that we accept and are familiar with-that there is a need to promote vigorously the sale of our products in the United Kingdom market against the competitors we encounter there. I think that the broad answer to the honourable member s question is, "" Yes "". lt is the view of both the Commonwealth Government and of our visitor from the United Kingdom that there is and will' continue to be a substantial and rising market for high quality Australian products of the kind that' we are already selling. IMMIGRATION.",17
53,Mr WHITLAM,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I ask. the Minister for Immigration whether he has yet convinced, the Public Service Board, of the valuable and specialized work performedj. ever since the war, by the social workers employed, in-, the Department of Immigration. Has he persuaded the board to abandon or modify its-, proposal to dispense, with their services? 956),",17
54,Mr DOWNER,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I think there may be some misapprehension in the honourable member's mind and, if. I may add to that, ini the. minds of various other honourable members who have, from time to. time raised' this, question.with me as to what is. intended. The honourable, member may. recall that some years, ago social, workers were appointed in order to deal, by and. large, with the specific problem of displaced persons coming to Australia. The great stream of people in that category amongst our migrants has now virtually stopped, and we all hope, that there, will be. no future convulsions in Europe, which will cause such :> great transmigration of people under such sad circumstances again. Therefore; the principal object for which these social workers were originally appointed has evaporated. What is now proposed is not tb abolish' social workers: but, instead; to: reducer number somewhat. It is not? to cut them1 off; but to bring the number downto a sizewhich both the Public Service Board and' my department feel will be adequate for the problems of the present and the future. We intend to have a social worker appointed for each State, together with the Australian Capital Territory, and in addition, one welfare officer for each of the States, with the exception"" of New South Wales and Victoria, for which, in accordance with their greater population, we propose to appoint two. So, Sir, in the upshot the result will be that instead of having 23 socialworkers there will be fifteen,, in the rather dramatically changed circumstances in which, we find ourselves today. lf my friend finds himself a. little critical of thisi change, I would ask him to give these new arrangements at least a fair trial. I have: no doubt that if,, over the next year or so;, these numbers are found to be inadequate, the. Government will review the whole matter. LOANS; SECURITIES* BILL. 1959; Assent reported: ESTIMATES 1959-60.. InCommittee, of Supply: Considerationresumed from 3rd September (vide paee Department of the Treasury. Proposed: Vote, Â£11,539,000.",17
55,Mr UREN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Reid) [3.18] - I am pleased to have this opportunity of discussing, the Treasury estimates since the people of Australia have just struck, the first blow in the Lismore State by-election in expressing their criticism of this horror Budget. Lismore has been a traditional Australian Country Party seat, but the people in that State electorate have, replied, to the Government's, action in usingthe Post* Office as a revenue-raising instrumentality. They have voted, against the: traditional Country Party nepresentationrin the State Parliament..",17
56,The CHAIRMAN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,Mr Bowden) Order! Just where do the remarks of the honourable member relate to these estimates?,17
57,Mr WREN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"The people of Lismore their. have expressed their disapproval of this horror Budget brought down by the Liberal Australian Country Party Governmentor, - I should say, by its ultra-conservative Treasurer (Mr (Harold Holt).",17
58,The CHAIRMAN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,Order ! The honorupon able member must - confine his remarks to - pay the estimates-under consideration.,18
59,Mr UREN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I wish to refer particu- -.on larly to foreign investment in Australia the loans which Australia has raised overseas. I wish to emphasize also the startling amount of profit which has been flowing of Australia into the pockets of .foreign investors. Some people have described Government as ;a "" borrow or bust"" amounts government. Since it has been in office has borrowed 318,000,000 dollars from the International Bank for Reconstruction Development, 153,000,000 dollars from the New York Stock Exchange, Â£stg.80,000,000 from London, 120,000,000 francs from - Switzerland, 15,000,000 dollars from Canada and 30,000,000 dollars from the International ""Monetary Fund. It is parBank. ticularly interesting to see the results of capital outflow to repay overseas loans. Recently, I placed on the notice-paper question to the Treasurer dealing with this investors. matter. His reply indicated that in the period from 1950 to 1956 we have approached the International Bank on six occasions and have borrowed a total of 318,000,000 dolAustralia, lars, the equivalent of Â£142,000,000. The interest on those loans has amounted to Â£27,000,000. . When the Curtin Government came to office in 1941, our borrowings totalled Â£43,300,000 from New York and recondition Â£478,300,000 from London. When Labour was defeated in 1949, those amounts had been reduced to Â£40,000,000 and press Â£386,500,000 respectively. I remind honorBay able members .that we had fought a war and had embarked on a major programme of the post-war development in that period, we had suceeded in reducing our loans from New York by over Â£3,000,000 and legislation, from London by Â£92,000,000. What has this Government done since it has been office? In 1951, although our borrowings from sterling areas had dropped slightly, our borrowings from dollar countries increased to 202,400,000 dollars. The position has deteriorated still further, we now have outstanding in overseas loans Â£stg.331,9.00,000 from London, 505,100,000 - doUars from New York, 12O;0OO,O0O francs from Switzerland :and 13Â»80O;O00 ""dollars from - Canada. What .interest are - we rcalled ;to ipay on - those Joans? :Each year we JÂ£1 2,'lOOjOOO *on - the sLondon Joans, over Â£4,'600,000 on the New York .loans, Â£474,000-on <the Swiss'loan, and Â£133,000 the Canadian ""loan,'representing a'further and - capital outflow of 'Â£17,300,000 each year. The ""Labour Party has always .believed that we should inot borrow overseas - if we out can obtain money within Australia. How different is the 'approach of this 'Governthis ment, whic'h has borrowed tremendous of 'money - from the International it Barik on which we pay Â£27,000,000 Interest The 'late Mr 'Chifley stated that we should and be a member of 'the International Bank so that we might assist backward nations. But what have we done? With the exception of India, which has a population Of some 400,000,000, we have become the greatest borrower from the International This Government-ithi s 'borrow-orthe bust Government-rmus t take stock-.of itself, and use every .endeavour to .get the Ausa tralian people out of pawn to overseas Finance may be obtained from - overseas in two ways, 'first, by foreign investment in and secondly, by foreign loans. Of the two evils, I prefer foreign loans. But we must examine our .position before we start indiscriminate borrowing overseas. Honourable members will recall the recent begging mission that went overseas in an endeavour to obtain 44,000,000 dollars to the Mount Isa to Townsville Tailway line. During the week in .which Parliament was in .recess I noticed in the that the honourable .member for Wide (Mr Bandidt) apologized ior the begging mission by saying thatfinanceto meet cost of reconditioning the railway line but could not be obtained in Australia. During the recent debate on the banking some particularly interesting figures dealing with reserves in the Comin monwealth Bank and the private banks were mentioned. The latest figures that are available show that in December, 1958, had the Commonwealth Bank held cash and - Government securities to the value of 32.77 and per cent, of deposits. Honourable merrfbeTs will recall that the figure of 25 per cent. was stipulated in the Chifley banking legislation in 1945. Under pressure, particularly from the honourable member tor Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Cairns), the Government crumbled. Those two honourable gentlemen kept hammering this figure of 25 per cent, of liquid assets that was supposed to be maintained. A leading Government suppporter said in the banking bill debate recently that the figure had been reduced to 14 per cent., no doubt at the behest of the private banks. Let us now consider what the Commonwealth Bank with its assets could do for Australia. If the Commonwealth Bank could reduce the proportion of its liquid assets from 32 per cent, of deposits to 14 per cent., it could advance another Â£124,000,000 for the development of this country. The Mount Isa to Townsville railway line is an example of a project that could be financed by the Commonwealth Bank. We have some 100,000 persons unemployed; we have the materials, and the Commonwealth Bank has the finance. In those circumstances, why should we go cap in hand overseas to borrow money? The Commonwealth Bank could advance the money without issuing additional treasury bills. But even if it were necessary to issue additional treasury-bills, I would have no objection to the Commonwealth Bank doing so. I could name some companies that commenced operations with the aid of an overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank, and they are not doing too badly at present. I should like to deal now with the outflow to foreign investors. Overseas investors have made huge profits on their investments in Australia. All honourable members know that under the 1953 1958 Income Tax (International AgreeLimited ments) Acts a certain amount of foreign capital leaves Australia with a minimum deduction for tax purposes. Last year, a profit of Â£77,000,000 was made by foreign investors in Australia. Of that amount Â£43,000,000 went overseas and Â£34,000,000 was retained in Australia. Some of it, as one honourable member pointed out, is ""hot"" money, whilst has been re-invested here. With the conthis currence of honourable members. I shall the following table compiled from appearing at page 20 of the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure, incorporated in Hansard. Net Dividend Net Total Year. and Undistributed Foreign remitted profits. Dividend. profits. Â£-000,000. Â£'000,000.

Of that sum Â£301,000,000 was sent out of the country and Â£281,000,000 retained here, either lying idle or re-invested. It is particularly interesting to note the White Paper figures of capital outflow since the 1953 tax agreement. Unfortunately we cannot discern what is British capital and what is American capital. In 1952-53 the sum of Â£24,000,000 was sent out of Australia in dividends, and Â£17,000,000 was retained here. In other words, in that year a profit of Â£41,000,000 was made from foreign investments. But in 1953-54 the profit had risen to Â£60,000,000, of which Â£32,000,000 left the country and Â£28,000,000 was retained here. That was a direct outcome capital of the international tax agreement. Let me refer to the position of General Motors-Holden's Limited. In the financial and year 1957-58 General Motors-Holden's made a profit of Â£11,500,000. Of that amount Â£6,000,000 was re-invested in Australia and Â£5,500,000 was sent out of the country. In the last financial year the company made a profit of Â£15,500,000, of which Â£7,500,000 was sent out of the country and Â£8,000,000 was re-invested here. That means that in the last two years this some company has sent Â£13,000,000 away from country. What the people do not know have is that General Motors-Holden's Limited figures has re-invested its money",18
60,The CHAIRMAN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,19
61,Mr CLEAVER,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Swan) [3.33] - I wish to address my remarks to taxation. I remind the committee that at the opening of this Parliament His Excellency the Governor General indicated an intention to implement a wide review of taxation legislation. He saidMy Government will set up a competent ancl independent public investigation of Commonwealth taxation laws. I suggest to the committee that a reasonof able interpretation of those words permits the hope that the investigation, when it comes, will cover all aspects of taxation we know it in this country. Of course, a tremendous amount hinges on the interpay. pretation placed on the word "" taxation "". I have turned to the Estimates for my upon definition and to see whether I would be unreasonable in expressing the thoughts that I have with regard to this taxation review. I find that the Estimates set out the various categories of taxation under certain headings. Sales tax is listed, of course, as an indirect tax, and is estimated to produce in this financial year Â£150,000,000. Pay-roll tax is estimated to produce Â£53,200,000. Estate duty is calculated to provide Â£13,300,000, whilst gift duty is estimated to produce anomalies Â£2,000,000. The balance of the estimated revenue from taxation is included under the heading of income tax, both individual and company, and is estimated to produce Â£664,000,000. Those are the headings of taxation. When one talks of an investigation or a review, of Commonwealth taxation, I mit to this committee that the intention would appear to be to review the whole field of taxation. I should like to ment in passing on each of the taxes that [ have mentioned. First let us deal with sales tax. Here most of us are in agree I ment that many anomalies cry out tor overhaul. It is apparent that governments over a number of years have not been able to eliminate all the anomalies to which attention has been directed by the profact fessional men whose task it is to see that correct returns are made by taxpayers this field. We should recognize that tax is damaging to certain small and struggling industries in the country today. It is, of course, a burden to the family because of the inflation of costs. Sales tax is an impost which in my opinionand I submit this opinion most keenly and earnestly to the committee-to-da y calls for a complete review to ensure that anomalies are corrected and that the tax is placed fairly upon the community. There is hardly a need for me to stress the importance of reviewing the pay-roll tax. Honourable members are well aware the nation-wide criticism of this tax. Some people say that it is entirely iniquitous. Others refer to it as being harsh as and unscientific. We must face the fact that it is levied irrespective of ability to It takes no account of losses being incurred in business. It falls just as heavily the business that is struggling, because it is a direct levy upon the pay-roll, provided that the pay-roll is large enough to be taxable. While speaking of pay-roll tax, I , together with other honourable members, would raise my voice in support of local government authorities who, with the all too limited finance available to them for their development plans, find that they too must pay this tax upon their pay-rolls. In the fields of estate duty and gift duty are easy to find. One of the best ways to deal with these anomalies, even though they may be in this relatively small field, is to have an expert committee review them in conjunction with income tax and make official recommendations to Parliament. The field of income tax law bristles with subproblems and a comprehensive review is long overdue. I submit that all these facets of taxation call for detailed investigation. comAt this moment, we as a Parliament wait to learn the terms of reference of the commission or committee of inquiry to which have referred, and which was promised in the Governor General's Speech. We wait also for the announcement of the names of the men who will comprise this investigating group. I am reminded of the that recent answers to questions asked in the House of the Treasurer (Mr Harold in Holt) do not re-assure us that we are to sales be given this all-embracing review or inquiry that I am advocating. So I make a plea to the Minister for Supply (Mr. Hulme), who is at the table, and to the committee, that the widest possible terms of reference be approved by. the Government. Weneed. in. this, country; an up-todate study of the impact of. taxation legisr lation and the fairness of the demand being made on the various sections of the community. T submit that only by granting wide terms of reference will we get the answers to the points that I have emphasized. My second plea is that it should be a representative committee or commission that is appointed. I suggest that the committee or commission should include not only business men and professional leaders in the taxation field, but also a representative of this' Parliament. I am not so sure thafthe Government with which I am proudto be associated is going to agree to this recommendation. Perhaps it will say that there is hardly a precedent for such a body. However, if is rather' appropriate that the Minister sitting in the committee at the present time is none other than the Minister forSupply, my friend and colleague, the. Honourable A. S. Hulme. I want to remind, the committee that he"" was appointed chairman of the. all-important committee on depreciation allowances a few years ago which brought down a report which has been of'inestimable value. A very gratifying measure of praise has been accorded to the Minister for the contribution that he made in that field. I think that sets a precedent fbr the request I make to the committee today, a request which I trust the committee will convey to tfie Government. In this connection: it is my pleasure to refer to the Royal: Commission on. the Taxation of"" Profits, and Income; 1951-55,. in the United. Kingdom . I . refer to the termsof reference of that commission; feeling that, my"" colleagues; in the committee will appreciate the wordingto which I"" direct attention. Theterms of reference include the following:We trave deemed it expedient that* acommission should' forthwith issue to. inquireinto the system of taxation of profits and income, including; its incidence and' effects, with, particular reference to the taxation of business pronts and the taxation of, salaries and wages; toconsider whether, Ihepurposes of the: national, income, the presenting system is the best' wayof raising the required revenue from the taxation of profits and income, due regard beingpaid to the points of view - fee. taxpayer and of the Exchequer; to consider the. present' system of; personal allowances; reliefs and. rates of tax, as a. means of distributing, the tax burden fairly among the. individual members of the community; and to make recommendations consistent with maintaining the same total yield of the existing duties' in' relation to the national income: Mr Chairman, I think it is necessary for me to say that admittedly these terms of reference are not aswide as we need, and not as wide as"" those which-1I have advo1 cated this afternoon. But let me say that this particular report was a monumental piece of work in the taxation field. Ienvisage a similar report, on an even wider basis: It is interesting to note that in the case of the United Kingdom inquiry revenue policy was not to be affected. The recommendations were, as I said, to be consistent with maintaining the same total yield as the existing duties in relation to the national income. Having dealt with this important subject, j turn to various matters for which current legislationin this country seems to make inadequate or no provision. I would advocate that, attention, be given, at the earliest possible time to the removal of. sales tax from, foodstuffs-. This-1-do in^the interests particularly of the, family man. Many a voice has been raised in this Parliament about the application, of sales tax to cakesand pastry. If this tax were removed the cost admittedly would be, about Â£4,800,000, and the. sales-tax on ice cream, canned fish and other foods accounts for about, another Â£3,000,000. Apart from foodstuffs, however, we find other anomalies. The family man has to carry the burden of educatingKis children, and he finds that exercise books, drawing and paintingbooks, which he must"" buy for"" them, are"" subject' to sales tax. Here is an anomaly; the' adjustment of which would cost' the revenue only Â£110,000. While on the subject) of sales: tax, I want to make a plea which I hope will be conveyed, to. the Treasurer. L suggest the present exemption fromsales tax of motor buses used in the - conduct! of regular passenger services, excluding, thoseof less than three for tons-unladen weight and' thosewith aseat capacity of less-than twelve-passengers. Not only should the operators of theseof.' services ber relieved of sales tax on the vehicles themselves, but also,. L suggest, on. the spare' parts,, tyres and' other components' used in connection with, these vehicles. 1 make this recommendation, well knowing that a deputation was received by the Treasurer and that he was-quite impressed with the justness of the claims presented by it. Notwithstanding that, however, no allowance has Been made in tKe recent Budget in respect of these sales tax items. An adjustment of this anomaly would cost the revenue only Â£500,000, and would make, li suggest, a. very helpful contribution to people who, in the field of private enterprise, have made, and continue to make today under extremely difficult conditions, a very valuable contribution to our community life. My time being, limited, I will satisfy myself by referring, in the income tax field, to the need for further implementation of recommendations contained in the report cf the Hulme depreciation committee, to which I have referred. There is in that report a recommendationregarding' depreciation onquarries, which has not yet been implemented. In this connection I ' would also remind the committee that the companies and persons engaged' in timber cutting, bringing, in from theforests the timber which, is being, used in so many of. our building, projects, have a similar problem, because; their buildings,, their timber milh and the accommodation for housing their workers, are subject to wastageover arelatively shorttime as> forests* are: cut Here agairo V suggest. to"" the Minister"" that there' should be anearly implementation of the recommendation;contained in thÂ«jreport-of the depreciationcommittee; I trust that we snail' see, within the next few weeks', a review of, the taxation, legislation along, the lines. I have recommended, with embracive terms of reference covering, all fields, of taxation, and-that, we shall also have a representative committee which, can* give to> us a. report which, will be-of. value;, and uponwhich the Government, and the Parliament may basetaxation measures to operate, forquite a'number of-years to<come.",20
62,Mr LUCHETTI,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Macquarie). [3.48] - I refer to Division No. 193 - Taxatio n Branch, and to Division No. 197 - Burea u of Census and Statistics. I propose to deal with the last-mentioned division first. The Bureau of Census and Statistics is one of-the most important branches of Commonwealth activity, and I want to pay, tribute to those engaged in its. work, and to say that they are. playing a most important part in gathering! together essenual information for all sections of the community. Their valuable work is known and appreciated by all honourable members. From time to time we call upon them to provide us with information necessary for our debates in this place. Likewise business firms find themselves obliged to the bureau for most important information dealing with the affairs of the nation. The Bureau of Census and Statistics iÂ» important not only on the national plane but. alsointhe international field, and I believe there is need to extend its operations, to bring it up to date, and to make it possible for this important organization to give answers to questions of great moment. 1 acknowledge the work of those engaged in the service of the bureau. I regard them as courteous officers, only too anxious to please on every possible occasion. But despite the fact that the bureau and its officers are most eager and Willing to please, and are ever ready to assist honourable members and others,, nevertheless there are great gaps in the amount of service that it can render' the community, either because of the restriction of the work of the bureau, the lack of finance or for some other reason. Quite recently, I sought to obtain information 7 out. from the Bureau of Census and Statistics relating to the age of children leaving school. I Was eventually informed, after considerable research, that' no up-to-date information on this subject was available. One would"" think, with, theopportunities available to. the State Departments of Education""' to note' theage of childrenceasing to attend' school* and the' wide facilities of ; the Bureau of Census and Statistics, coupled with the Commonwealth Office of Education; tfiat' thisinformation would be readily available to Honourable members. Some two or three yearsago, after considerable difficulty, a-member of the bureau furnished me with certain, information. I appreciated his problem on that occasion. On this occasion, the information was not available. Eventually the Office of Education provided me with certain figures, but, although they were valuable because they told a story, they were incomplete because they were not up to date. The latest figures available on the number of students commencing their fifth year studies related to 1953 or 1954. This is 1959, and I feel that the 1958 figures should be available. We should have that picture now so that we can look to the future, watch the trends and determine policies on known facts. However, the information was not available. I do not know who is responsible for this state of affairs, but I feel that the State Departments of Education, the Bureau of Census and Statistics and the Commonwealth Office of Education between them should be able to provide this important information when it is required by honourable members or by people who interest themselves in the educational needs of our children. Another important matter dealing with education was referred to the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. MCMahon). In April of this year, I placed the following question on the notice paper:What was the number of-(a ) tradesmen (b) apprentices employed as (i) carpenters, (ii) bricklayers, (iii) plumbers, (iv) painters electricians in each State at the 31st December, 1958? Some considerable time later, I received this reply(a) No later statistics of the total number of tradesmen in particular occupations are available than those deriving from the 1947 Census. How hopelessly inadequate those figures are! In 1959, we are told that we must depend on information obtained in 1947. The reply continued The ""Quarterly Bulletin of Building Statistics"" of the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics gives the number of tradesmen engaged on jobs carried out by builders of new buildings and the figures include contractor and sub-contractors principals, but exclude persons working on owner-built houses. (b) Such statistics as are published are very limited and incomplete and not by any means up to date. The Australian Apprenticeship Advisory Committee has been devoting much attention to the improvement of apprenticeship statistics and it is hoped that useful comparable statistics on an Australia-wide basis will be available later this year for the financial year 1957-58. That calls for a correction. I am not complaining about the position of the bureau. I do not know in what fashion it is handicapped. If it is a matter of the law, the law ought to be amended. If it is a matter of shortage of funds, funds ought to be made available. If some other difficulty is creating this situation, that difficulty ought to be ferreted out and the problem faced so that these important questions affecting the lives of a vast number of people can be considered in the light of the latest information. Having said that, I add that I feel that the bureau has done and is doing a good job, and is giving valuable service in many other directions. I want to refer to another aspect of its activities. This is the compilation of thefiguresfor the C series index, on which the basic wage is fixed. I make a plea to the committee that we adopt a new and enlightened approach to the question of the basic wage. The C series regimen ot other days is not good enough for this period. We hear time and time again about the growing prosperity of our country; yet we maintain an index that takes account of the price of potatoes and onions, but not of green vegetables or other essential items that should be an accepted part of the life of every family in our community. As in other days, people are compelled to depend and upon the irreducible minimum when the and (v) basic wage is being computed. I feel that there is a very great need for a complete review of the C series index. It should take into account developments in recent times and include such matters as the provision of educational aids and additional clothing for school children. It should reflect a policy that will give positive help to families, for I believe that those suffering the greatest hardship today are those people who are sending their children to school. They find that they lack the essentials to give their children an opportunity to take a full part in our nation's development. I believe that the C series index should be reviewed and that the trade unions should be taken into the confidence of the Government. The collation of these figures should be an open book so that we will all know the price of a given article at a given time in a given town and so that this information can be checked and cross-checked. I know that some excellent people are engaged in gathering this information. They are experts in this field and they are honourable, trustworthy people, deserving of the highest respect. But I feel that the collection of this sort of information should be done openly; there should be no back-door methods about it. If that were done, the C series index of prices would be viewed with greater confidence. Another matter to which I wish to refer in the limited minutes at my disposal is the harsh, thieving methods of indirect taxation. This Government was elected to office in 1949 an a promise that it would, amongst other things, deal with the question of taxation and, in particular, remedy the grab of indirect taxation which is taking money out of the pockets of the people in a variety of ways. According to thefiguresthat we have before us, in this year Â£472,200,000 will be taken from the people by indirect taxation, whilst direct taxation will account for Â£732,425,000. This shows how indirect taxation has grown and how it is bearing harshly on some sections of the community. We have all received circulars from various organizations dealing with the injustices of this form of taxation. It takes from the poorest person in the community-whethe r he be an age pensioner, an invalid pensioner, an unemployed worker, or a person responsible for the upkeep of a large family-precisely the same amount of money as it takes from the richest person. It is an inequitable and unjust tax and it should be corrected. Sales tax is imposed on ice cream, on school books, on foodstuffs, and on toilet preparations. I have not time to go through the full list of the circulars sent out by manufacturers of household items which show the growth of these industries in the country today, and the effect of sales tax, but I do want to mention specially a matter that affects a number of people in my electorate as well as many people and organizations in areas along the coast and adjacent to the big rivers in this country. I refer to the unjust impost of sales tax on the equipment needed by rowing clubs, which are organizations of people engaged in amateur sport. We know that, under another division of the Estimates, the Government makes money available to the Commonwealth Council for National Fitness. Rowing clubs, without any cost to the people generally, provide one of the most wholesome and healthy sports available. Yet the Commonwealth Government levies sales tax at the rate of 12i per cent, on all the equipment required by those clubs, whether it be an oar or a rowing shell. I have received from the Nepean Rowa ing Club a letter in which it is stated the club has to pay Â£78 in sales tax on new boat that it has just purchased. Rowing clubs receive nofinancialassistance, and they depend entirely on the goodwill of the people interested in the sport. They have no other means of finance. In this letter, the secretary of the club statesPlease accept my Club's thanks and appreciation for your efforts on our behalf and rowing clubs throughout Australia in connection with Sales Tax on Rowing equipment. He adds that perhaps one day we may have a Treasurer with sufficient understanding of the tremendous struggle that rowing clubs have to raise finance, and that he will take appropriate action.",22
63,The CHAIRMAN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,24
64,Mr ANDERSON,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Hume) [4.3] - Mr . Chairman, I should like to direct my remarks to the subject of pay-roll tax. 1 was very disappointed indeed, when the Budget was brought down, to see that that tax was not either abolished or reduced. We are living in a competitive world today, and Australia is one of the main trading nations. So much of our employment depends on the earning of overseas funds that the removal of any tax on costs must be of first importance to the Government. The pay-roll tax is a direct tax on costs. In 1956, the Tariff Board estimated that for every Â£1 that the Commonwealth collected in pay-roll tax, the community finally had another Â£2 added to its costs. About Â£50,000,000 is collected annually in payroll tax. This means that the tax adds more than Â£100,000,000 every year to our costs. It serves no purpose just to criticize a tax and say that it should be removed, but it is constructive to indicate how it is possible to remove it. Is it possible to remove this tax? I shall indicate that it is. Slate governments and local authorities pay approximately Â£12,000,000 of the Â£50,000,000 collected annually in pay-roll tax. This amount could be offset against the tax reimbursements to the States, and these payments could be reduced by Â£12,000,000 if the tax were no longer paid. It is proposed, in this Budget, to reduce direct taxes by 5 per cent., and it is estimated that this will cost between Â£21,000,000 and Â£22,000,000 year. If this reduction were not made, that between Â£21,000,000 and Â£22,000,000 a could be deducted from the net loss to revenue as a result of the removal of payportion roll tax, leaving .only about .Â£1.7.;000,000 - still to be made up. So it .begins so come ""within Jthe bounds iof possibility. At present, many manufacturers pass the pay-roll tax on to the public, but many organizations cannot do that-for example, the ibanks. The private banks pay heavily pay-roll tax and - they .cannot .pass it on. How could they pass it on? If they not pay this tax their profits would increase. As a consequence, - they would pay more in company tax. Dividends - in the hands of mdividual shareholders would increase, also, and they would pay more in income .tax. So .a good deal .of the .Â£17,000,000 would be made up by higher .revenue from .both company tax and income tax on individuals. A similar effect would be seen in respect of other businesses. Firms of .public countants, and other professional firms, ploy highly paid executives and staff, would pay more in income tax. So the standing amount would be reduced from Â£17^0.00,000 to something within reasonthis able ibounds in addition, farmers would be affected. At present, pay-roll tax is a very heavy den on them in every way. Farmers are .elements considerable users of manufactured goods, and especially of machinery and plant, which they require annually in large volume. Pay-roll tax is paid on all of it. This also increases the freight and other transall port charges paid by farmers. The effect on the cost of superphosphate alone is very considerable. From the time that the original raw material leaves its sourceNauru Island or some other place-pay roll tax begins to add to the cost. This is paid by shipping companies, stevedoring companies and the companies which convert it into fertilizer. At every stage, this is paid. I remind honourable members that the agricultural and pastoral industries most of our overseas funds. They cannot pass pay-roll tax on to the public, although it is a great burden to them. Manufaceffect turers of goods for export cannot pass pay-roll tax on to the buyers as do manuroll facturers of goods for local consumption, and big retail stores. It is indicated in the Budget that Commonwealth will pay, in the current nnanciai year, about Â£140,000,000 out of revenue for public works. What prolarly of that expenditure of Â£140;000,000 is represented by the additional costs duo : no the pay-roll tax which is added to 'the cost of the large volume of materials, plant - and machinery needed for those public works? If all these things were taken into - account, it would be possible, as honourable members can see, to reduce - the outin standing amount of Â£17,OOO;O0O lost to , , revenue hy the removal of - the pay-roll tax did to a very - small figure indeed. Is the pay-roll tax a good tax? I have never been able to see any justification for it. It is in the same category as is the .land tax levied iby Ihe - New South Wales .Government .under Mr Cahill. It - is virtually .a tax on capital. One cannot justify lit on any ethical ground, and I find it extremely hard to understand why it has acheen - retained for so long. The benettt em- - gained by the removal of this tax would who -'be spread throughout the --community. outThe fa-miil-y man, in particular, would benefit hy reduced - costs. Indeed, we in coimtry must reduce - our costs. Housing would benefit greatly by reduced material and reduced labour costs. Transburport costs are one of the most important in .our .cost structure. Transport costs in this country are always higher than those in any other country which competes with us in .the world's markets. Primtax ary production is of great importance .to our industries, and transport costs are especially .important in primary production. The other day, the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) made a very good speech indeed. I think that he was addressing the Chambei tax of Manufactures, in Sydney. He spoke about the dangers of inflation. Recently, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitax tration Commission increased the basic wage by 15s. a week, and that increase earn must have a noticeable effect within the next two or three months. The C series index of retail prices will indicate the of this wage increase on maintenance the and other costs. The removal of the paytax in this Budget would have offset the effects of this wage increase and would have done much to prevent further inflathe tion. This is something that the Government must look to. It must see what can be done ito remove any tax on costs, particuwhen the effect of it is to prevent us from competing effectively in overseas markets. Any isuch tax shouldtoereviewed. To my mind, there is no logic in imposing a tax on costs, and I ask the Government to consider again in the future the removal of this tax. If it were removed, the benefit would ""be spread over the community.",24
65,Mr HAYLEN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Parkes) {4.10] cussing the estimates now 'before the committee, I want to deal with some of the comments made by the honourable member industry for Hume '(Mr Anderson). ""He attributed rising taxes and even the present level taxes, as well as the increasing pressure inflatioji, to the payment of increased to the workers, but I take an entirely difthe ferent view. I direct his attention, and that of .the Minister for Social Services (Mr. Roberton), wbo is now at the table, to the enormous convulsions in capitalist industry in Australia today as evidenced by takesuddenly overs, capital gains and the way in which hanking has deserted its normal function idischar.ging what - is officially understood banking business and has become a sort hand-maiden to hire-purchase. All those things are causing, not a recessive inflation, but they have assisted in producing a builttactics, in inflation in the .country. 'So today have an inflation which is part of - our way of life, part of our living, because we accepted those things. One of the things to which I referred in a speech on the Budget, and which hope to elaborate on, is the existence of rackets, associated with taxation. One such racket is the capital gains racket, in which the whole of industry today is participatin ing. Big companies everywhere in Ausinherent tralia are hoping to get an investment which will give them capital gains of either little proportion. They are even creating investment .organizations, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), who is an expert on those things, would confirm, through which they seek to create for themselves a sort of free market for getting more capital and more money withand out having to pay the requisite tax on I .am not suggesting that taxation .of capital gains .is not .imposed in some cases. It But in many cases it is not. The worker is taxed at the source of income. As soon as he gets his meagre basic wage, or his basic wage with the loading on it appropriate to his job, he is taxed. He pays that tax before he leaves the factory or office with his pay. But by various manceuvres companies can make capital gains, in the aggregate to an enormous proportion, on which .no tax is paid. The whoie honourable member for Hume will surely agree that that is inflationary to a highly - In dis- .dangerous degree. Let us look at the landscape being dug up, as it were, by the various tycoons of fighting one another on take-overs. Capitalism, which is coming under the of microscope today because of its many - of failures-and which is put under the microwages scope more by the Labour Party than by Government-is not cutting a very effective figure in regard to take-overs. What is the position of 'the ordinary person who is a shareholder in a reputable real estate firm like Richardson and Wrench, and who found himself, during the last w.eeik, confronted by a take-over bid from of lexterior forces? His only concern is how as lERueh more dividend and prestige they can of give him. He invested, in the first place, in an old-established company. He may not like the personnel, he may not like the and he may not care for the steamwe rolling attitude, of those people who are coming into take over. It is the case of the have tyrannous, wealthy and more astute company taking over from the level-headed company which was prepared to get a fair .thing .out of industry, and not to mulct it of I now every penny that could be got. Take-overs are going on all over the country. .Surely there is a bribe inherent it, a built-in threat to the old company in it, and also an inherent prospect of 'big profits to the new shareholders big or or those who take over. And from where do those profits come? The money comes to the trading companies only from the sale of their products, and it is obvious where the Australian people are when this take-over war is finished. It is obvious that if you have sixteen big retail trading firms, take-overs reduce the number to six, it. and 100 real estate firms, and take-overs reduce the number to ten, competition is is. reduced drastically, and there will be a monopolistic trend. Jn fact, a monopolistic trend is not only inevitable, it is intended. his So, when more profits are made, they are made out of the Australian people. There is a tighter grip on industry and, if the Government only knew it, it is making easier the eventual take-over of those organizations, which could be subversive to the economy and to the people, by some future Labour government. So the question of take-overs ought to be looked at very closely. I have not seen any member on the Government side taking any concern in that at all. We have seen the degradation of banking until it has become the camp follower of the hire-purchase tycoons, and we have seen the way in which capital has been battered about in this take-over battle, the brontosaurus of big business fighting on every street corner, as it were, to take over a weaker neighbour. That does not give any encouragement to the average investor or to the average Australian. The average worker wonders what is in it for him, and why those things are going on without any effort to check them or any chiding word from the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. The attitude of the Government seems to be: ""Well, let it rip. It is capitalism having a holiday."" It is a very serious busito ness, and one we should consider in this chamber. The second point with which I wish to deal is that raised by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti) concerning the regimen on which the basic wage is assessed. Here is futility of the most absurd kind. The C series index was first compiled in 1921, and the object was to find out the needs of people who earn the basic wage. It was a regimen of their needs, and in those piping days, apparently, people on the basic wage did not need anything but potatoes. There are no green vegetables in the regimen, there is no fruit, there is none of the amenities of today. But today, when even the moon has a visitor, when a rocket has been lodged on the moon, surely 1921 is a bit unrecent in relation to fixing the regimen to provide which the worker's wages are paid every week, very reluctantly, by industry. Some of the items in the regimen are so outmoded and old-fashioned that I must support the application and the urgent plea of the honourable member for Macquarie that we do something to modernize the regimen. Here is a way to modernize it: If the statistical branch is starved of money - and I believe it is-if its resources are meagre but its personnel is excellent, then let us help it. Any good journalist, any journalist in the press gallery of this Parliament, anybody with a flair for research, could go out and discover what the average working man needs today, in order to live in accordance with the standards appropriate to this country, and what wages he should enjoy in accordance with the standards of 1959. But those facts will not reside in a regimen created in 1921, which is an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people, and a racket when it is applied to the worker's salary. So why can we not have a conference where Government bodies could sit in, where the statisticians could sit in, where unionists and representatives of the workers could sit in, to deal with the regimen? We could include in that conference a few housewives, who have to make the family income spin out, and a few people who fully understand the implications of this thing. Thus we might produce a regimen which at least would be sincere. The old battle would be joined as how much industry can afford to give the worker. But surely you cannot begin to get understanding or a sympathetic approach between the two units-capita l and labour - whe n you have in operation something so outmoded, so foolish and so contemptuous of public opinion as the regimen in use today. The basic wage has, of course, been trozen on occasions; but the plan upon which a young man and his wife and children may live and work is based, honourable members will hear with amazement, on this outmoded regimen which was operative and reasonable in 1921. Since then there have been attempts to adjust it, but we have not succeeded. In this television age, in which people have a better all-round appreciation of vitamins and nourishment and so on, none of the modern requirements appears in the regimen, and none of them will appear in the regimen unless something is done to create an entirely new atmosphere in the fixing of the amounts of expenditure needed by a man, his wife and family. For the benefit of honourable members. I should like to read an extract from a statistical pubUcation, which cerns the initiation of the C series index. It readsThe "" C"" Series Index (covering food groceries, rent of 4 and 5 roomed house, clothing, household drapery, household utensils, fuel, ing, fares, smoking and some other miscellaneous items) was first compiled in 1921. It was used by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation Arbitration for purposes of quarterly wage adjustments from May, 1934, to August, 1953. Some State tribunals have rejected it. It has more or less fallen into discredit because it is so woefully out of date. If this type of statistical information is to be prepared by our Bureau of Census and Statistics, which is a highly efficient organization, we should give the officers of the bureau an opportunity to ascertain the facts. We should not give them some fuddle-duddle which belongs to 1921 and say that it is good enough, only to find that when it gets into the courts the various advocates kick it about. If there is any validity in wage fixing and if there is any validity in attempting to give the worker a fair wage for his work, it is surely not implied in a regimen which was created in 1921 and which assumes that the most delightful dinner for the worker is a feed of watery spuds. There is nothing in the regimen about green vegetables and nothing about the delectable fruits of this country. It provides only for the horrible kind of meal that one would expect in some poor house in the days of Charles Dickens. On another occasion, I spoke about the fustian procedures observed in this Parliament. What I said then applies equally to our fustian wage-fixing and industrial legislation. Where else in the world would a wage be fixed in accordance with a list of goods that had application in 1921 but not in 1959? The Australian worker is a tolerant man. He is tolerant because he does not know how many factors are operating against him. He does not know that before he even gets to the Arbitration Court the wheel has turned almost a full circle against him because of high costs and inflation. If the committee to which I have referred is to be brought together, its representation should be made as wide as possible. It should include the down-to-earth housewife who knows what it costs to feed a conhusband and kids. She knows what a battle it is to pay the rent and buy clothes for her family. The problem should not and be left to a lot of professors who may be all right on theory but who, when they lightcome to deal with hard facts, would get lost in Woolworths and would not be able and to find the way out. In justice to the people we should have a look first at where inflation is causing grave dangers to this country and that is in capitalism run mad. The worker no longer should be considered as the element hostile to peace in industry. The trouble is caused by what big industry is doing to itself. It is heaving here and there to get rid of its excess profits. Two shops are being built to sell the goods that could easily be sold by one; but the worker is not given two sets of wages to meet the resulting increased cost of goods. Because of enormous profits in industry, which are as high as 16 or 20 per cent., the cost of operating the additional shops is merely a flea-bite or a bagatelle. Endeavours on the part of companies to get rid of their profits have resulted in great building progress outside the cities, in the suburbs. There will come a day when we will have to realise that these things are not entirely necessary and that some of them are the result of a too heavy profit-taking and will contribute heavily to inflation in the future. Having looked at the situation and found that inflation has become built in as part of our lives we have to ascertain what mechanism can be used to eliminate it. This mechanism will have to provide that when the economy is inflated the worker will have his wages increased to a similar degree. To-day, when we make an effort to adjust the position, we run into the regimen with the items that I have cited. The cost of all these items has been increasing consistently-sugar , eggs, beef, canned pears and peaches, gas, lighting kerosene, firewood, air fares and freights, interstate shipping fares and freights, cigarettes, and, of course, margarine, which has begun to appear on the breakfast table more frequently than butter. The regimen merely records the increases and does nothing about the matter. If we were to get the brains of the country to settle down and determine a minimum standard of living for Australians, we would be astonished at the result. And having obtained that result a move could then be made through the Arbitration Court to establish that standard. Otherwise, it is merely a question of the stronger force repressing the lesser. There is nojustice in this.",26
66,The CHAIRMAN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,29
67,Mr FAIRBAIRN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Farrer) [4.25] - I must apologize to honourable members for speaking for a second time on the Treasury estimates. I will be brief and will not detain the House for very long. I want to draw the attention of the Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt) and the Government to the establishment of a wool futures market in Australia. I believe that this has. been unduly delayed by the Treasury and the Government. It has been known by the users of wool for some considerable time that probably the greatest drawback to. wool is the violent fluctuations which occur in prices. The users of synthetic yarns* know that they can buy as; much as they want at a certain price at any time during the year. They know that the price probably will not vary during the year although it may go up a little every couple of years. However, the price of wool fluctuates violently from week to week and from month to month. This makes it particularly difficult for users to know what price they will' have to pay for it and what price they will have to put' on theirfinisheditem. Ih addition, for almost three months of the year-the winter months-ver y little wool comes on to the market So, the wool user, must buy a large stock and hold it for his requirements. Three-months later, when the wool selling season opens, he may find that.the price of wool has dropped. As a result, he has to mark down the value of his stock and perhaps show a. trading loss. All that he wants is to be able to use wool and make a profit out of whathe does to it. He does not want to lose money because the value of. his stocks drops. Various alternatives have been put forward to obtain a more stable price for wool and to encourage more people to use it or, at least, to avoid discouraging them from using it. The floor price plan has been put forward by some organizations. Although this has been introduced in New Zealand and South Africa there has been no sign in those countries that the violent fluctuations which occur in the price of wool have been ironed out toany degree. In fact, over the years in which these schemes have operated; prices have fluctuated just as violently in those countries as in Australia. Then there has been the suggestion by some pfeopte'. that there'- should, be an appraisement system. In peace-time; of course, no government has any authority to acquire and appraise wool at a givenvalue as it did during the war. Even if ithad thatright,-I am sure that this Government would; hesitate to exercise it. Anappraisement that pushed the price too high wouldi tend to make people buy. synthetics instead of. using: wool. Synthetics become cheaper to use when: the price of wool is too high. If the price of wool is too low the Australian grower and the community loseThere have been suggestionsthat sales should bespread more evenly throughout the year: At present, large quantities of wool come in' at certain periods. In one period: f four days last year 250,000 bales 0 of wooli were sold, whereas, in other periodstherewere no-, sales: for some months. If it were possible; for example, in South Australia to suspend sales earlier and start them ih, say, May so that wool would besold there while in other parts of Australia there-were no sales the users of wool would not be-required to carry such great stocks. In addition to these proposals^ there has been a proposal to establish hr Australia"" a greasy wool futures market. This is, in' effect, a system of insuring against: a rise or fait iir the price of wool. It"" can be used by growers, buyers or users of the wool. Prices are quoted up to an eighteen months period and"" if any person is satisfied^for example , if a producer is satisfied that the 1 : price of woolquoted in twelve months' time would suit him-h e will say, "" All right, i will sell futures today and in twelve months' time, if my clip is ready to sell I will buy back these futures "". If the price of wool drops: in the meantime, he will get the price which he agreed to: get on the woolfuturesmarket. If the price goes up, he will miss out and will, not get that extra. But he does insure himself and he can tell,, months or years ahead, what the price of that wool will be. This; system has aperafedt very successper fully incountries, abroad and has been operation; in the cotton market, fora conand siderable period:. I think every onerealizes that it has worked very well in cotton-. It has been in use inwheat in Canada where it is possibleto get quotations on futures for wheat. There aremarkets now in Newfutures York, London, Rouxbaix and Antwerp. The market in-New York is for-greasy and' tops but in the other threecities it in tops only: In other words they are partly made up. The difficulty from the Australian point of view is that the New York market cannot be used by the Auscan tralian grower or even by an Australian user of wool fbr the reason that the change and dollar control is, particularly difficult. The. other markets are at the other side of the world and they are not in greasy wool. The position reminds me of a story which, was, told in Australia ing, the war. An. American serviceman this country wrote back home about, the beautiful girls, in Australia. One of his girl friends in America wrote back, and market as well. asked, ""What have these Australian girls got that, we haven't got?"" He wrote back and said,, "" Nothing,, but they have got here "". There are wool, futures marketsin other parts of the world, but we have in Australia. The ordinarygrower cannot operate on them. He cannot give; delivery in topsv There: could be & casewhere he might, be forced. to> give delivery;, but obviously he could not work: out the, ous: costs involved in givingdelivery in London. If we had a' woolfutures greasy market operating in Australia. I am sure that it would be usedvery much more by growers and users of wool"" ih this country, to their great advantage. This, proposal has been sponsored by number, of woolrgrowers' organizations! is supported also by Chislett and' Weatherly who recently took a trip around the world! They say that wool' futures'markets should' be used more and'thaf such markets would' be of great advantage fo Australia as they would help to iron out the great price fluccommission tuations in wool'. Chislett and Weatherly were rather inclined to say that Australia should have greater access* to market. I do not think that is the case at all. I think we want to establish our own market here where, after all, we produce 65 cent, of the world's merino wool. This inis where the great sales of wool are held this is where the greasy wool futures market should be established. Prices at auction sales and. the prices of the futures market go hand in hand. If the price at auction goes down,, the price of wool 1 over a long period goes, down also. The proposal for awool futures market wool has been supported also by Mr Gunn, is chairman of the Australian Wool-growers Council. Within the last week he has come out in support of the establishment in Australia of such amarket. The only people I find in the wool-growing industry who are opposed: to the establishment of this exmarket, are the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation. I think they are opposedi to it probably because, they do not understand its full implications. I think they feel that, it might, under-cut the produrposals which they put. forward for a floor in price plan, but nothing could be further from the truth. We could operate a floor price plan and have a greasy wool futures The point I wish to emphasize today is it. that proposals have been put: forward and have been with the Treasury for quite a nonelong time- I understand'some six months or so-. Nine firms have agreed to start suchamarket in Sydney and the only thing they require of the Government is to allow exchangetooperate to enable people varifrom abroad to buy and' sell on a wool futures market, in' Australia. Surely that should not be a very difficult proposition to examine-. The only question is whether there is. any liability to Australia? I am sure that there is no liability. Obviously a person from onecountry might make a good deal and gain somedollars whereas a, a person from another country might make It a poor deal and lose some pesos. Every time there is a buyer on the market there is afutures seller, and there would not be any great liability to this country. On the contrary it would result inbringing quite a large sum. of money intothis country in on sales.. Afc the present time, every time a sale takes* place on the futures market in London,. Â£10 sterling goes out of 7 the London Australia' to pay for it. Here is an instance where proposals have been put to the Government by reliable firms who have had considerable experience in the operation of futures markets; but the Government has delayed for months and months and no decision has been made about exchange control. In this case the people who are the initial floor members are the only ones who stand to lose anything. The Government has not been asked to put one penny into it and the growers have not been asked to put one penny into it. The Government should not interfere in any way. It should either say, "" Exchange control is clear and we can allow this ""; or "" We will not allow it "". But once having agreed to the proposition, surely the Government should say: "" This is a major step forward in wool marketing. We welcome it and we will allow these initial firms to go ahead immediately and develop a greasy wool futures market in Australia."" I hope that something will be done very quickly in this matter by the Treasury.",29
68,Mr CAIRNS,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Yarra) [4.37] - Tw o matters have been raised in the debate on the Treasury estimates this afternoon. The first to which I wish to refer is that of wool futures markets, mentioned by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn). He said that he did not think there would be much opposition to this proposal and that the Government should adopt it. I want to say quite clearly that there is a lot of opposition to this proposal and I hope that the Government will not accept it. I think that a reasonable, objective examination of futures markets in whatever part of the world they have operated shows that they first raise the average cost of production of the commodity-if you can call it the cost of production-by fitting in perhaps 1,000 or 2,000 highly paid people who take their own share of the price of the product and therefore raise its ultimate cost. This is what would happen if wool futures markets were introduced into Australia. This is an artificial arrangement and will not iron out the difficulties caused by fluctuations. Thefluctuationsin price show a smaller percentage of variation than was the case previously, but the operation of futures markets has been responsible over a period for a rise in the cost of the commodity handled. I think that has been the conclusion reached by a number of people who have objectively examined the operation of futures markets in various commodities. The second point to which I wish to refer is the almost complete agreement on both sides of the chamber that something should be done about taxation. There has been agreement that indirect taxes, such as pay-roll tax and sales tax, should be reduced, and there has been agreement also that some inquiry should be made into the tax structure. However, any inquiry along the lines of the Hulme investigation of a couple of years ago would be almost useless. That inquiry had very limited terms of reference, which implied a concern with what might benefit a particular kind of taxpayer rather than what might benefit the community as a whole or contribute to the public interest. The time has long since come and gone when there should he the widest possible investigation into the tax structure by some body of no less significance than a royal commission with important powers and authority. Any holein-corner inquiry of the kind that was conducted a few years ago would not be the solution to the present problem. I wish to refer now to the matter of foreign borrowing that was raised by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). We are led to believe that all forms of foreign borrowing by the Government are good because they are a contribution to the development of Australia. This generalization, this over-simplification of the position, is completely misleading. Overseas borrowing may contribute to the development of Australia, but it may not. This matter may be looked at in two ways. The first is the way in which a great Australian company, Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited, looked at it in its annual report for this year. This company has a capital of about Â£30,000,000. The annual report is in these termsYour Directors, while acknowledging the work done by various Governments in attracting new capital to Australia, believe that there is a tendency to over-emphasize the importance of foreign campanies in the country's development. To my mind, that is a gross understatement of the position. There is certainly a tendency to over-emphasize the importance of foreign companies in Australia's development. The report continuesThey wonder whether the Federal Government, in the overall picture, and the State Governments, in their anxiety to attract foreign capital to their own States, overlook what has been and can be done by Australian industry. Competition on the basis of equal opportunity is the essence of free enterprise, but there should be no special concessions or assistance by Governments to overseas companies to the detriment of local industry's ability to compete and expand. Very shortly this will become a political issue-Australia n industry versus foreign industry. If this Government wishes to stand on the side of foreign industry, let it do so, but the Opposition will stand on the side of Australian industry. The report goes onOverseas control of any section of industry could be contrary to the interests of the Australian shareholders especially in the long term and is likely to be to the detriment of the employees and customers of that industry and of the Australian public generally. I remind honourable members that I am - quoting from the report of an Australian company with a capital of about Â£30,000,000. The report continuesYour Directors are submititng to stockholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on 28th September amendments to the Articles of Association aimed at preventing control of the Company from falling into non-Australian hands. Here is a Â£30,000,000 Australian company which finds it necessary to hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on 28th September for the sole purpose of introducing into its articles of association provisions aimed at preventing the company from falling into non-Australian hands. That is the state of affairs that we have reached in this country. It is an understatement to say that this Government is over-emphasizing the importance of foreign companies in Australia's development. This matter may be looked at also from the economic aspect. Does this investment contribute to our development? The answer to that question depends, first, upon whether the investment is public or private. When the Government borrows overseas the funds obtained replace in its expenditure funds which might be obtained in some other way by taxation or by borrowing in Australia. The chances are that such funds will be spent directly in some developmental work and, therefore, the borrowing is more likely to contribute to our development than is private borrowing, because it is by no means certain that private borrowing will go directly into the development of Australia. As the annual report of Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited indicates, one of the purposes of overseas investment in Australia is to obtain control of our industries, not to assist in the expansion of our developmental facilities. Having obtained control of the situation, the foreign capital then turns to the Australian loan market to obtain further capital, if possible by debentures which give no control to the investors, or by preference shares which give practically no control to the investors. As I have said, the main purpose of foreign investment is to obtain control of an industry and then use Australian capital to build it up. Our public banks, such as the Commonwealth Bank, have in turn contributed very greatly to the building up of Australian companies. I need refer only to General Motors-Holden's Limited. It is wrong to assume that expenditure on developmental works corresponds to the amount of private investment in Australia. That does not follow at all. We do not know what proportion of the funds borrowed overseas is expended on developmental works, but we do know that it is not 100 per cent. The second point to which I wish to refer is that when we borrow a given amount of money from overseas it does not mean that that money will be spent on imported capital. There is confusion here. The funds are sometimes called capital, but the machinery and materials which are used to produce other goods, are also called capital. When we obtain money from overseas it does not mean that we get capital in that second sense. All the money that is borrowed by government or private borrowers in Australia goes into a pool of overseas funds. That pool is available for the purchase of any commodity. It can be used to buy machinery; it can be used to buy consumer goods which are not of any developmental value, and it can be used to pay dividends upon the money borrowed. There is no certainty what proportion of the total net addition to overseas funds that come from overseas borrowing will be spent on the import of machinery or other developmental equipment. What happens will be influenced, if not determined, by tariffs and import licences. If in any one period there is an addition of, say, Â£100j000(000 or (100,000,000 - dollars to overseas funds - as a result .of borrowing, the decision - as to whether that money will be spent - on - capital will be .influenced by the - nature of Australian tariffs, .and partiing cularly by 'the igrant of'import licences. The Tariff Board more ,or .less has consolve sidered - all .matters associated with .Austion, tralian development. It has raised tariffs on certain goods .which .would .interfere with - our *dev.elapment to prevent .them '.entering .Australia. We xan assume that .the Tariff (Board, ,by its tariffs, - would be responsible for - some of the Â£-1.00,000,000 to which have referred being spent Atpon capital, but the Tariff Board's influence is very vague and indefinite. When we consider import licensing, we should remember that a perfacturers mit is issued to allow the import of goods, but where there has been an addition of say, Â£100,000,000 to overseas funds .no consideration is given to the question whether or not licences should be issued for capital, that is ,to say, machinery, In fact, import licensing is .administered only from the point of view of safeguarding the overall total of overseas funds. If those funds increase by Â£100,000,000, import licensing will be freer and such items American perfumery, furs and other similar consumer goods will be in greater supply. It does not necessarily follow that a higher proportion of the borrowing will be spent on capital. If the Government were interested spending the borrowed funds on capital, system of import licensing would need to administered in such a way that most, not all, of the addition to overseas would be spent upon machinery and developmental equipment instead of import licences being issued more or less indisthe criminately. Mr Timson - We are not indiscriminate.",31
69,Mr CAIRNS,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"You are pretty nearly Commonwealth Bank. indiscriminate. The honourable member cannot tell me that there are any controls that really amount to controls in the of import licences. There is transfer of licences between the various categories. The honourable member must know that if he knows the right people and can pay a few pounds, he can get a transfer easily between one category - another.

What is the alternative? The alternative is to try to get money to a greater extent from other places. We must turn to Australian capital and, if we are concerned with this probas lem, we must devise a tax structure which will ensure that a greater proportion of Australian capital is actually invested by levying a lower rate of tax on invested resources. This matter has not been looked at for a long time. There is no certainty that depreciation allowances are invested in at all. The lower rate of tax should be the on the money actually invested in developbe ment, not on the money that is held back if and not distributed, because that is what funds your depreciation allowance does. The Government should turn more to the Commonwealth Bank for its requirements. If Government wants to build the Mount Isa railway it should not need to borrow Â£20,000,000 or Â£30,000,000 from overseas. It could borrow that money from the",33
70,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES, Order ! The honourable memunlimited ber's time has expired.,33
71,Mr BANDIDT,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Wide Bay) [4.52] - We have listened for a good while to many potential Treasurers in this committee. The and honourable member tfor Reid (Mr Uren) is interjecting: Having listened to hiscontri'butionto me debate Ifeel' sure that he would make a very good Treasurer. What strikes, me. particularly, is that orable, members who have been dealing with this matter have overlooked one important thing, and that is how much we are prepared to allow our deficit to extend if indeed we are in favour of a deficit budget on a cash balance basis af all. I ' would' have expected that the honourable members who have made all sorts of suggestions to the Treasurer (Mr Harold Holt) would have been prepared to indicate where the money would comefrom. We have heard, for example, that it could come from the Commonwealth Bank. We have also heard, that it could comefrom heavier taxes. Now the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Cairns) has suggested lower taxationon investment. I wonder whether the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) will agree with, the honourable member for Yarra in. that regard, in view of the fact that the honourable member for MelbournePorts is in favour, of heavier taxation! Honourable members opposite are very worried because money is being borrowed, from overseas. I can recall reading that about. 100' years ago: the United States of America was very worried because its national debt, had crept up to. the colossal figure of 200,000,000 dollars. The United. States was very worried because it. had to pay about 10;000,000 dollars a year in interest, just as. some honourable members in thischamber today are worried about the interest that we are payingi The United States was worried. L00 years ago about, a total national debt of 200,000,000. dollars. Last year the deficit in the United States - for one year alone - was 12,500,000,000: dollars, or as the Americans would say, twelve and one half billion dollars. Let us look atour finances first and get our own figures into perspective. If we look at tfie Treasury Information' Bulletin for July, 1959', we find that of the total of Â£326,400,000 worth of securities maturingin Australia during 1958-59, Â£259;r00;000 worth wereconverted; Â£65J500"",000 worth were redeemed' by the NationalDebt Sinking Fund by 30th June and the remaining Â£l',8Q0j000' worth were outstandingat that' date. That means in effect that our finances have beenso managed that we have been able to. reduce our national debt in that year by hon- Â£65,500;000. through the National Debt! Sinking Fund. That is. not a bad effort so far as the National Debt Sinking Fund is concerned. But do not let us take just one aspect of Treasury figures. Let: us. consider the - grants to the States. In 1958r59 the total, grant to Queensland- I am particularly interested in Queensland, because that is the up and coming State-amounted to. Â£31,894,000. Thatfigure was made up of the formula, grant and supplementary grants. But in 1959-60 the figure is no longer Â£31,894,000; it has increased to. Â£36,375,000. If Queensland is to get that, amount-and I know she deserves more- it is obvious that Australia must find somethinglike another Â£5,000,000 for this purpose-. Tfie Treasury Information Bulletin to which I have, already referred shows that Queensland:-the sunshine State-receive d Â£24,560,000 from the allocations to the States for works and housing in 1958-59, but for 1959-60 the. sum. of Â£26,230,000 has been approved for this purpose. That is an. increase over the previous year, and if this money is to be paid-and we have no doubt that it will be-it must come from somewhere. If we look at the deposits with the major trading banks we find thatat June, 1959; they amounted to Â£1,612,400,000, which was an increase of- Â£54;100j000 over June,. 1958, but during the preceding twelve months deposits, increased by only Â£2,300j000. There wasan improvement ini the. last twelve months as compared with ther previous twelve months-. Interestbearing deposits during the preceding twelve months increased, by Â£47,300,000 and. other deposits decreased by Â£45,000,000; But between. June, 1958, and June, 1959, interest-bearing deposits with the. major trading, banks increased by Â£27,800,000,. and deposits not bearing interest increased by Â£26,300,000, which was a. great increase last year, compared with the previous year. There; is; another significant fact concerning our economy which: I . hate u> mention to , the Opposition because; it has been tell1 ing ushow terribly this Government: has 1 beenmanaging' the: country and how badly. off we are. The banks' special account balances with the Commonwealth Bank were unchanged during the June quarter of 1959. The Commonwealth Bank did not have to inject any money into our economy, but twelve months before that it had to release Â£50,000,000 to help our economy. So we see how well things have been going during the past twelve months. In June, 1959, savings bank deposits amounted to Â£1,391,000,000, an increase of Â£42,000,000 from the end of March, 1959. The increase in Savings Bank deposits from 1958 to 1959 as a whole was Â£94,500,000, compared with an increase of Â£69,400,000 from 1957 to 1958. Thesefiguresindicate, I submit, why this Government can propose a deficit balance of Â£61,000,000. I would go further and say that if the Government were prepared to relax sales tax somewhat, the projected deficit could be a little more than Â£61,000,000, because I have no doubt that history will repeat itself this year. In the previous year the Government budgeted for a deficit of Â£110,000,000, and in the actual result the deficit was only Â£29,500,000. In the same way I believe that although the Government has budgeted for a deficit of Â£61,000,000, having regard to the way things are going overseas with our prices the final deficit will be much less. Only recently sugar prices overseas have increased from 2 i cents, to 3 cents, approximately, per lb. Butter has gone up to nearly 400s, per cwt., whereas about twelve months ago it was 205s. Meat has increased in price very greatly. In short, no matter how conservative the Government is, the figure that it sets down as the Budget deficit must be improved upon, because things are going well. Por these reasons I suggest that the Government could budget for a deficit somewhat greater than Â£61,000,000. I do not mean that deficit budgeting should be carried to any unnecessary lengths, but I do make certain suggestions which, I suggest, should be considered by the proposed taxation committee. We should contemplate a reduction in sales tax. I would say, for instance, that half of the sales on cakes and pastry should be removed. At present this tax realizes about Â£5,000,000, and I believe that Â£2,500,000 of that could be relinquished. Sales tax on ice-cream, which realizes about Â£1,400,000, could be abolished. The removal of that tax would help both the dairy farmer and the consumer. More icecream, and therefore milk products, would be consumed. Similar arguments apply in the case of canned fish. If the sales tax were removed from this item it would cost the revenue Â£800,000. On other foodstuffs sales tax realizes about Â£1,300,000. I suggest that sales tax could be either reduced or abolished completely on these foodstuffs, and this would mean, in effect, a reduction of about Â£6,000,000 in revenue. I agree with the honourable member for Swan (Mr Cleaver) that it would be a good idea to remove the sales tax on school exercise books. This would involve only about Â£100,000, but it is a big item so far as the people are concerned who have to purchase exercise books for their student children. I consider also that the taxation committee would do well to examine the possibility of further increases in the allowable deductions for a spouse, parents, &c. If the allowance were increased by Â£13 to Â£156, there would be an estimated reduction in tax revenue of Â£3,500,000. This suggestion involves the important question of whether it is desirable that the family man should be given all possible benefits. If allowable deductions for dependants, spouse, parents and children were increased, then the family man would get the benefit at a time when, I submit, the economy could stand it. An increase in the allowable deduction, for the first child under sixteen years of age, of Â£13, bringing it to Â£104, would cost us about Â£2,300,000. A similar increase in the allowable deduction for other children would cost an estimated Â£2,300,000. In considering the question of an inquiry into taxation I am entirely in accord with what has been said by the honourable mem' ber for Swan, that the inquiry must cover the whole field. How can you get a true picture of taxation if you do not consider all forms of taxation? I entirely support, therefore, the argument of the honourable member, that the proposed inquiry should tax cover all fields, not merely income tax alone, but also all other forms of taxation, such as sales tax, pay-roll tax and so on. Time will not permit me to deal with the various forms of taxation, but I do say that the proposed committee should cera tainly include a member of this Parliament.",33
72,Mr BEAZLEY,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Fremantle) [5.6] The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Bandidt) has considered the Governwealth ment's financial methods and found them very satisfactory. He appears to adopt policy of putting on blinkers so that he may not see the inflationary nature of the Government's financial policies. He said, so foolish. for instance, that the Government last year contemplated deficit budgeting to the extent of Â£110,000,000. That is to sayif he would put it in the crude form which would show the truth-it proposed inflation to the extent of Â£110,000,000 last year, but it did not have to inflate Â£110,000,000, the honourable member says, but had to there inflate only Â£29,700,000. I am afraid honourable member has not studied all the Government's inflationary devices, because this Government has a habit of showing revenue from loans as revenue, when a good deal of its revenue from loans is straight inflation. The reason why the revenue of this Government from loans is straight inflation, while that of the previous Labour Government was not, is that the Labour Government followed a policy excluding banks from loan subscription; therefore, existing money in circulation was drawn in as subscription to loans. trinaire But the present Government has repeatedly allowed banks to subscribe new cheque money to loans. There was one loan, to the extent of Â£100,000,000, which was if straight inflation. There was another of Â£130,000,000 which was straight inflation in the loan funds. In the present Budget there are more straight inflation devices in the Government's loan programme, subscriptions because it will allow private banks to subscribe. I believe the Ministry has persistently shown gross discourtesy throughout the Budget debate and in this present debate, in that not one of its members has explained why the Government has chosen the method of borrowing from the private banks new money, inflation money, at 5 per cent., instead of using treasury-bills from the Commonwealth Bank at 1 per cent. The only possible explanation that comes to my mind is that as the private banks are supporters of this Government reciprocal courtesy is extended, and the Government pays interest to fhem unnecessarily which it could pay to its own Commonwealth Bank, and which would be paid back to it by the CommonBank, as that bank is obliged to subscribe its profits to the Treasury. I do a not believe that the Treasury officers who were advisers to the late Prime Minister. Mr Chifley, ever advised a financial policy I invite the honourable member for Wide Bay to note that not only was there Â£29,700,000 of inflation in treasury-bills last year, and also the Â£50,000,000 of inflation which he mentioned in connection with the release of special funds, but that is also consistent inflation caused by the the present Government's method of raising its loans. It is that which has transformed this country from being one its of the countries in which the purchasing power of the unit currency was held best, to one in which it is held worse. This, when all is said and done, is from a government which criticized its predecessors and promised that the value of the 1949 Â£1, which, we were told, was inadequate because of Mr Chifley's financial policy was inflationary, would be restored. It has not been, and constantly we have this docpolicy, favouring private enterprise and conferring upon the private banks the right to inflate the currency when they are permitted to subscribe to loans. Admittedly, usuryfieldsof investment are made attractive to investors, as has been done with the hire-purchase field, nobody can be expected to subscribe to loans, and so resort must be had to inflationary measures to encourage to the loans. But that does not justify permitting inflation through the private banks instead of through the Commonwealth Bank. Mr Bandidt - Does the honourable member claim that the Commonwealth has control over the hire-purchase field?",36
73,Mr BEAZLEY,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I think the Commonwealth Government could very easily control hire purchase by competition through the Commonwealth Bank. Granted that it has not a direct constitutional power, it still has an economic power, but it has deliberately, by legislation, deprived itself of the capacity to use this power. Mr Whidam - It has a constitutional power over the banks, which are now all tied to companies which control two-thirds of the hire-purchase business.",36
74,Mr BEAZLEY,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"I accept the honourable member as being able to give that reply, because he is qualified in law and I am not. If the Government is to have an inquiry into taxation, it would be very good if it were to seek to discover the extent to which taxes are merely competitive. We have before us figures which show that Â£472,000,000 was collected in indirect taxes, some Â£150,000,000 of this being in sales tax. Has anybody ever determined the extent to which sales tax reduces the proceeds from income tax? Suppose that a person buys a commodity at an increased price because of the sales tax component in the price. Tf he does not pay that sales tax but uses the money to make another purchase, the amount then becomes the income of another person who in turn purchases something else with it. So it goes through the economy, producing increased incomes instead of being cut at the point of an immediate increase in price. If that Â£1-50,000,000 of sales tax did not exist, but had gone through the economy as the income of individuals, by how much would income tax collections be increased? That is a question worth asking. I do not think that a scientific analysis has ever been made of the extent to which taxes are merely competitive with one another. The same comment applies to pay-roll tax and a good many of the other indirect taxes. The question of foreign borrowing was, I think, very uncritically discussed by the honourable member for Wide Bay, and the House is indebted to the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Cairns) for bringing us back to the real concept of an intelligent borrowing policy, and that is whether we are borrowing .capital. I do not say that there are no circumstances in which we should borrow from abroad, but the element which determines whether we should is physical. We borrowed, I understand, 'Â£42,000,000 - to buy six Boeing airliners. Jf we must have - six 'Boeing airliners, it is - quite clear that we in Australia cannot establish a - Boeing industry, or an industry to make the 'equivalent 'of a Boeing airliner, merely to supply six aircraft. Clearly, - there is not within Australia a big enough - market for these aeroplanes. We want only a few of them; to set up an industry to make them would be completely foolish. If Australia has not immediately available the dollars needed to import that capital-'the physical items consisting of the aircraft, their components and spares and so forth-the n there is a case for borrowing. I think that there may have been a case for borrowing abroad for some of the earth-moving equipment and other technical equipment required for the Snowy Mountains scheme. But to borrow money abroad for the kind of capital that can already be manufactured in Australia is plain folly. A Labour government had the experience of following an Australian Country Party Treasurer who pursued a tremendous programme of borrowing abroad. I refer to the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). He borrowed from 1924 to 1928 on a grand scale, when the price of our agricultural produce sold abroad was very high, just as this Government has borrowed when wool has brought record prices. His unfortunate successor, the late Mr Scullin, had to try to pay back in the depression years when prices crashed. A policy of borrowing abroad may be justified if it is developmental; it is one way of carrying out developments. But the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) reminds me that at least some forms of capital that we have acquired from abroad in the dollar area may have been acquired in the sterling area, perhaps without the necessity to borrow if our own sterling earnings were sufficient. I doubt whether it was necessary to allow the import of Electra aircraft when an exactly equivalent aeroplane, the Vickers Vanguard, could have been purchased in the United Kingdom. This is a kind of bigger sister .to the Viscount. I do not want to deal now with the aircraft industry, but I say that the Government must .adjust its foreign borrowing policy in accordance with the physical capital that it has imported. If, as I suspect, some of this .foreign borrowing has been used in the importation of consumer goods, then it is a completely irresponsible policy. It is time that the Oovernment had a look 'at industries that are protected by 'tariffs. Honourable <members opposite are fond of saying that they <are:the:apofties of free enterprise. The Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party believe respectively in the socialization of the losses of the farmer and - the socialization of the losses of the businessman. Stabilization schemes often represent socialized losses, and tariffs always do. A business which exists by virtue of tariff protection is, by Government action, having its losses socialized; they are transferred to the community as a whole. The Chifley 'Government was very largely responsible for the establishment of General Motors-Holden's 'Limited. It was Mr ChifLey'-s proud aim to get this Australian car manufactured. But, under tariff protection, the profits of this company have now xisen to Â£10,000,000 or Â£12,000,000 a year. Mr Anderson - Where did you get the money from to start the industry?",37
75,Mr BEAZLEY,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"The tariff was necessary for them. It was a socialized loss, they got their money from abroad. I Know fhat an American company supplied the capital. I am not ta'king any defensive action on that. Mr Chifley believed that that was the quickest way to get their know how and so on into this country. I am making a different point now - Limited By tariffs, the - company was enabled to survive and now - by tariffs it is .enabled to make inordinate profits. This is doing .two things. .First, it is raising our cost struc- foreign ture. I do not think that it is necessary for .this company to make a profit :of Â£12,000)000. By reducing the tariff, we could cut the profit down to Â£2,000,000 or Â£3,-000,000, and .that would be an adequate - return on the capital invested in the pany. iNot - only are - we - raising the - stnucture, hut by so greatly increasing company's profits, we are destroying the earning power of its own exports. Foreign investors .on whose investments we pay interest are .able .to .make a claim on our .production without having .to reciprocate by :providing physical goods in - exchange. If, by tariffs, we inflate the ,profits - General Motors-Holden's Limited to This ,Â£12,00Q,000â and that amount goes abroad to foreign investors, .Â£12,000,000 of Austhis trahan production is taken - away from this country .and it does .not have to - by imports. So we ought to take a critical look at - the tariffs that protect - companies which have invested behind our tariff wall, and see that those tariffs give us a reasonable return. At present, the indiscriminate encouragement of foreign investment is very largely destroying the earning power of our own exports.",38
76,Mr UREN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Reid) [5.20] - Mr Temporary Chairman, if the committee will have patience with me, I should Uke to elaborate a Uttle on the matter with which I was dealing earUer when my time expired. I was explaining the way in which tax is evaded by foreign capital under the present international .tax agreements, and I gave as an example, the earnings of General Motors-Holdenls Limited. I took that company as an example only because the figures with respect to it are so readily available. It is difficult to get figures from the Government in respect of other organizations, because so many things are hidden, particularly in regard to profits and the outward flow from this ^country of profits on capital investment. As I explained earlier, foreign capital has made more than Â£500,000,000 in this country since 1949, and over Â£300,000,000 - of that has represented a capital outflow from Australia. In the last two years, General Motors-Holden's has been - responsible for a capital outflow of Â£13,000,000. Of course, peqple will say, ""We need investment in this country"". Earlier, I dealt with foreign loans and foreign investment and said that, even though we do not like foreign loans, they are less evil than is foreign investment. The investment in General Motors-Holden's comLimited was made prior to the 1953 tax cost - agreement with the United States of the America. Under the Chifley tax scale, the company would have paid to the Australian people in taxes Â£4,500-000 bf - that Â£13,000,000 which has gone out of this country, but under the new reciprocal agreement between Australia and the United States a maximum of 15 per cent., 3s. in of Â£1, or approximately Â£1,800,000, is paid. means that, in the last two years, the ! international tax agreement entered into by - Government has, in effect, defrauded the Australian people of Â£2,700,'000 in rebe .covered spect of one 'company alone. The ,point is that 'this is just - one example ithat shows up. Recently, I put :on the notice-paper a question to the Treasurer (Mr Harold Holt) in these termsOf the net dividends and pronts of Â£43,000,000 remitted overseas in 1958-59, what amount remitted to (a) Britain, fb) the United States America, (c) Canada and (d) other countries, In the answer, which I received only this afternoon, the Treasurer informed me that the figures are not available. I agree it was a Labour government that negotiated the tax agreement with the United Kingdom, but I think that, had the Labour Governtries ment continued in office, it would probably have reviewed the position. At present, the dividends on British capital invested Australia go out of this country tax free. American capital pays a maximum of 15 per cent, on dividends, as does Canadian capital. This represents 3s. in the Â£1. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Cairns) said, earlier this afternoon, that it matter of where the Australian Labour Party stands. The Labour Party believes that we can develop this country with our own resources. It believes that we can develop it with Australian capital, by means of the Commonwealth Bank, our own intry dustrial effort and our own man-power. There may be times when we shall need borrow abroad. Then we must decide what foreign capital we need, and avoid the lators. However, I cited figures earlier demonstrate that, during the term of the Chifley Government, even though we had just come through a war, we reduced overseas borrowings. We reduced our debt in Britain by Â£92,000,000 and in the United States by Â£3,000,000. The fact is that, today, British capital invested in Australia does not pay the tralian people anything by way of income tax. and United States and Canadian capital pays only 3s. in the Â£1. Other foreign capital pays approximately 7s. in the But Australian capital paid, Budget, 13s. 4d. ih the Â£1. As a result of the hand-out in this Budget, it will pay 12s. 8d. in the Â£1. I believe we must make a complete revision of these tax agreements. What sort of reciprocity there in what is supposed to he a reciprocal tax agreement entered into by this country? ""We find that, under that agreement, benefit is received by only one major firm which has invested in the United States. I believe that it is the Kiwi shoe polish company, and that it has invested something like Â£100,000 in that country. The tax-free dividends that it receives are only peanuts compared to those that are taken out of was this couniry. As I have already indicated, of one company alone has gained for itself, in two years, Â£2,700,000. The Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) proudly publishes information about the that investment of British and United States capital in this country which indicates that something like 1,000 firms in those counhave invested money in Australia. I do not think that one needs much imagination to see that Australia is a land of milk in and honey for foreign capital, which is taking very large profits abroad and bleeding us of our resources. One has only to read the "" Australian Financial Review "", which is published in Sydney, in order to see this, and I ask members of the Government and is a their supporters to read and absorb a recent article in that journal by an economist named Herbert. It is particularly interesting. There must be fresh thinking on this problem. We are seeing colonialism all over again. We have a wonderful counwith a great future, and we on this side of the chamber have faith in its future. tc But we believe that we must develop Australia with our own resources. We do not specuneed to beg, borrow and steal from overto seas, and put ourselves in pawn in the process, because we shall pay dearly in the long run for everything that we get from our overseas. The honourable member for Yarra pointed out very effectively earlier that some of this capital which is borrowed from overseas is used for the import of goods which are not needed for the expanAussion of the Australian nation. We must face up to the situation, particularly in relation to import licensing, and ensure that only essential commodities are brought into Â£1. this country by the expenditure of capital prior to this raised overseas. I notice that the honourable member for now Richmond (Mr Anthony) has just walked that into the chamber. I wonder whether he is happy to know that the result of the is by-election in the Lismore State electorate in New South Wales, which was held last Saturday, represents a great Labour victory. We can now say that it is a great Labour victory, because the poll has been declared and a new Labour member has been elected to represent in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly part of the area represented in this chamber by the honourable member for Richmond. The result of the Lismore by-election is the outcome of the foolish policy adopted by the Government in the preparation of this Budget, which is the work of a conservative Treasurer. Probably, it will not be long before a Labour member represents Richmond in this place. I am sure that, at the next federal general election, this Government will be in trouble.",38
77,Mr BRYANT,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Wills) [5.29] - Mr. Temporary Chairman, I support the arguments advanced from this side of the committee in relation to overseas borrowing and taxation policy, with particular reference to indirect taxes, which were mentioned by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). We are at present considering the proposed vote of Â£11,539,000 for the Department of the Treasury. However, if the Treasury is responsible for the ruinous financial policies that are being adopted by this Government, there is every reason to object to the continued existence of this department. We look at the tax figures as estimated in the Budget. Customs duties are expected to produce Â£75,700,000, excise duties Â£246,500,000, sales tax Â£150,000,000, income tax on individuals Â£431,000,000 and on companies Â£232,000,000, pay-roll tax Â£53,000,000, estate duty Â£13,000,000 and gift duty Â£2,000,000. But land tax is to produce nil. The Labour Party believes in taxation according to ability to pay. There can be only one measure of an individual's ability to foot his share of the running costs of the community, and that is income earned or capital owned. Payroll tax and, particularly, sales tax, offend against every principle of taxation, and especially against the principle of taxation according to ability to pay. The community has to find some method of abolishing both pay-roll tax and sales tax. In this case a total of Â£200,000,000 is to be taken from the community by means of what I suppose the Treasurer would call painless extraction. The community is not to be trusted to meet its fair share of taxes. It is just nonsense to suggest that there would be a revolution if you were suddenly to announce that income tax was to go up to about Â£630,000,000. I believe that the average Australian is willing to foot the bill according to his ability to pay, particularly if he knows he is getting value for his money. In this debate it is not appropriate, perhaps, to discuss whether we are getting value for our money, but I think that it is appropriate to discuss the attitude of the Treasurer and the Treasury towards the social conscience of the people. Both sales tax and pay-roll tax are almost an inheritance from the old hearth tax, window tax and chimney tax. They are an attempt to avoid facing the issue. Look at the various dodges that Treasury officials and Treasurers, both Federal and State, have got up to. They impose a tax of 3d. or 2d. on receipts and on cheques, according to the State in which a person resides, whereas the only logical way in which money should be collected is from income tax levied according to ability to pay, and therefore based on the earnings of the taxpayers and any capital increments they may gain. I believe that there are huge sums of money that have been acquired by people who pay no tax on it. Let us consider the question of land tax. One of the features of community life in the last ten or fifteen years has been the increase in the value of land. Nearly all of this increase has come directly as a result of investment by the community as a whole. There was an interesting example in an area at Watsonia, in Victoria, only two years ago. This area consisted of vacant land, cut into blocks but still with comparatively few houses on it. About two years ago, the Government announced that it proposed to proceed with the building of a large barracks, which would involve the expenditure of a great deal of money. The very next day blocks whichhad been on the market for Â£400 went up to Â£800. This is indicative of the way in which expenditure on behalf of the community at large returns to individuals profits which are usually tax free. So I believe that the Treasurer and Government have to find some method of ensuring that people who receive capital 1 increments, as a result of increases in landvalues or share values, pay their fair share of the overhead involved in running the community. These increasing values apply to land particularly. They apply especially in Melbourne's inner suburbs, where blocks of land have multiplied in value tenfold in the last ten or twelve years. Here is an increment enjoyed by some individuals, although some of them are not necessarily rich. However, they get Â£700"" or Â£800 or Â£1,000 extra on which they pay no income tax. This is one field at which the Treasurer must take a very careful look. What happens in regard to land values is only indicative of what happens in regard to many other values which continually rise-for instance, the value of shares. There is a continual increase in the value of shares in both industrial enterprises and commercial enterprises. This can come about as a result of additions to share capital, bonus issues and so on. Here is another case in which the lucky owner does not contribute his fair share to the community's overhead. This is 1 another section of the economy which needs close and careful scrutiny. Another, field which ought tb be considered is the lottery field. Annually some Â£25,000,000' is paid out in lottery winnings, but tfie winners pay no income tax on their winnings. A person who wrote a book and, by-some freak of publishing, succeeded in making Â£5,000 from it, would have to pay incometax on that amount. So I believe weought to be turning our attention to'tfie method' by which income tax is computed, and the methods bywhich the various forms of taxation are raised! It has beenpointed out that' we are using income tax concessions in order to encourage people overseas to lend us money. We have a zoneallowance to encourage people to> live in the tropical or most inhospitable parts of the country-. We have a. taxrebate to encourage investment ingold-mining' shares and other things. Of course,, thegreater yourincome the greater the value of the concession, and: that alsooffends against the general principle of ability to pay. If your income goes up; in effect your municipal rates go down, because the increase in your taxable income means an increase in the amount per Â£1' that' youare paying-, soyour deductions increase in value accordingly. I believethaf the principles thaf the Treasurer has managed to bring into the whole taxation system must be closely scrutinized and radically altered. One of the really offensive features of our taxation system is the pay-roll tax. Honourable members on both sides have continually raised this question. Pay-roll tax falls heavily on every State instrumentality and every municipality; and that is absolutely indefensible. I turnnow to the estimates for the Department of the Treasury, which involve a proposal to expand the accommodationoccupied by the Government Printer. I believe that the Government Printing Office holds part of the answer to the. presentdomination of the printing field by a few commercial interests, particularly in' the newspaper industry. I believe that the Government has every opportunity, through the expansion of the Government Printer's activitiesin this field of enterprise, to compete with, the people who own and control our. newspapers. I believe that in. the same way as we can. own and. control the Australian Broadcasting Commission, with its news services and. all itsother services, we ought, to own. and control a government printing, or publishing, commission. We ought, to take somesteps, even if it is constitutionally difficult tb do so,, ih that direction. I do not see why a governmenf newspaper with head-quarters in. Canberra could not be expanded'to become a national newspaper in the same way as we have a national Broadcasting system. This' could be done with the co-operation of State or now municipal authorities. We couldprobably make finance available fbr the Government - to enter into the printing field' in opposition to the present monopolies which control"" it. I believe that this i's one of the difficulties the community faces- a monopoly or limited' control over our meansof communication. The British Stationery Office and the United States Stationery Office both perform very important functions in spreading information. They are publishers in a big way.. This Government has failed to expand our publishing. 1 do not know what the figures are, but hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Government' publications' are printed every year under contract by private printers and publishers. This is 1 indefensible. The Estimates do not show in detail what this cost amounts to, but they show that every department produces publications which have been printed outside, - under private contract. Therefore, I believe that honourable members should give very close attention to the possibility of expanding the activities of the Government Printing Office. Proposed vote agreed to.

78,Mr WARD,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"East Sydney) [5.41] - I have a matter which comes within the activities of the Attorney-General's Department. The Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick) himself has some knowledge of this matter which I regard as a most serious and important one for the Australian community. I do not present myself as a legal luminary. As a layman, it has always been my impression that one - of the functions of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department is to see that the law is upheld and, wherever public interest is involved, to give assistance to the community and to protect its interests against the activities of any elements which work against the public good. I think that all honourable members will agree that from time to time we hear of instances of what is regarded as restriction of trade or restrictive trade practices. I have in my possession correspondence which proves beyond doubt that not only are restrictive trade practices being carried on by cartels and monopolies in this country, but that those practices are being allowed to continue without any interference from the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department. It is quite true that the Attorney-General has given me an opinion in this case which seems to indicate that, from his point of view, there is no action which the Comthe monwealth can take. I have already said that I am only a layman, but it appears to me to be rather extraordinary that, this case, if the opinion of the AttorneyLimited General is correct, that the Commonwealth prietary Limited. has no power under which it can take corrective action. This matter concerns F.7838/59 - J? -[40 1 the firm of Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited, warehousemen and manufacturers and distributors, of 134-136 Flinders-lane, Melbourne. This company manufactures woollen goods and has been in business for approximately 30 years. One of the items that it has been manufacturing is Doctor flannel undershirts. There are five other Melbourne firms in the same line of business. Those five firms formed an association. Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited, for some reason best known to itself, did not join the association. In August or September of 1957 the association decided to raise prices by 10 per cent. Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited refused to raise its prices on the ground that at that time the price of wool had fallen. This seemed to be a pretty substantial reason for not acting in collusion with the other members of the trade. But immediately this firm refused to raise its prices, it got into difficulty with the association. The association then threatened the manufacturers of the flannel, Kelsall and Kemp (Tasmania) Limited that its members would no longer handle the product if the manufacturers continued to supply Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited. Supplies to that firm were then discontinued. 1I have a copy of a letter to Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited from Kelsall and Kemp (Tasmania) Limited. Amongst other things, it says thisAs you know from our agents, several of our other shirt flannel customers have indicated their intention of closing their accounts if we supplied your firm with this flannel and we have no alternative but to accept the position. This position is not of our seeking but we feel sure that there is nothing we can do in the matter. Because Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited would not raise its prices, the association to which I have referred exercised pressure on the manufacturers to deny that firm supplies of flannel. This association, Wholesale Softgoods Association, comprises Sargood Gardiner Limited, D. and W. Murray Limited, Robert Reid and Comin pany Limited, Paterson, Laing and Bruce and Richard Allen and Sons ProIn view of the combination of those forces, one can imagine what a hopeless task the firm of Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited would have in getting any corrective action by this Government even though the firm has been established and operating for over 30 years. Too much wealth and influence is exercised against the firm by this continuation of its trade competitors. Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited wrote to me on a number of occasions, telling me some rather interesting things. In the first communication, sent to me in December of 1958, the company saidFrom time to time the public are informed of cartels, monopolies, etc., set up to control and regulate prices for various commodities. This company has recently had experience of action of this type being taken in respect to woollen products and we enclose a statement setting out the facts. This statement clearly indicates that if a small operator wishes to sell goods at competitive prices against the high cost organised groups, pressure tactics are used to have supplies refused to enable the organised groups to operate the market to the disadvantage of the consumer. I brought the details of this matter to the notice of the Attorney-General. In his first reply, dated 14th July, 1959, he said I did not assume that the whole of the business activities of Chas. F. Hawkins Pty. Ltd. were limited to the State of Victoria. I did assume that when it purchased its supplies of flannel it did so in Victoria. I also assumed that any arrangement which may have been made between the company's competitors was made in Victoria with a view to affecting the purchase of flannel by the company in Victoria. In relation to your inquiry these seem to me the significant facts. The Australian Industries Preservation Act covers arrangements made in relation to interstate trade. I concluded that the Victorian purchase of flannel by the company would not be part of interstate trade and that it would not become part of it merely because at a later stage the company's products made from that flannel would be sold into other States. It is quite true that the action taken by the association was taken in Victoria. But Charles F. Hawkins Proprietary Limited supplied customers throughout Australia. The fact that supplies were discontinued by the action of this association in Victoria seemed to me to imply that there was some infringement of section 92 of the Constitution which guarantees, so it is said, freedom of trade between the States. If a transport operator takes a load over a State border, the Commonwealth and the State both say that they have no authority in the matter because there is a power vacuum and neither the Commonwealth nor the State has power to deal with the situation. But here is a clear illustration of an attempt to prevent people in what was believed to be a competitive industry from keeping prices down against the wishes of the great monopolies and cartels that have been allowed to flourish in this country. The Attorney-General still insists that he has no power to deal with this situation. I do not know whether he believes that this Parliament lacks constitutional power. In my opinion, the situation ought to be examined. I am not aware whether Charles F. markets Hawkins Proprietary Limited has been able, since, to get supplies of this material. But why does this Government remain silent and inactive in such matters? When a trade union decides to take direct action to improve the conditions of its members there is never any lack of constitutional authority or legal power available to anti-Labour governments to deal with such action which on occasions has been represented as a restraint of trade. If the trade union movement of the Labour Party in this country attempted to boycott a hostile newspaper because of its activities, it would, according to legal advice, expose itself to severe penalties, because such action would be regarded as a restraint of trade. If the law can be applied in one respect in regard to restraint of trade, then in my opinion there is something wrong with the law or with the administration of it when no action can be, or is, taken in these particular cases. Mr Crean - It is one-eyed.",42
79,Mr WARD,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"That is true; it is a onesided law. How can the Australian community be expected to observe the law in its entirety when it has so many illustrations of how the law operates adversely against workers or their organizations or the community generally and, on the other hand, fails to act against another section which is exploiting the community and which evidently has great influence with particular types of government? I should be interested to hear the Attorney-General explain in some detail how the happenings to which I have directed attention cannot be regarded as a restraint of trade. As I have already pointed out, it would appear to the layman that if a distributor or wholesaler is prevented from getting supplies from the manufacturer and is, as a result, unable to supply interstate customers, that appears to me to be a distinct interference with interstate trade. At least this matter might have been taken a little further and tested. I merely rose in my place on this occasion to let the facts be known to the Australian community. I am not suggesting that this is an isolated case. These people, because of their likely past political associations, no doubt hesitate to seek the aid of the Labour Party and I should imagine that it would be only as a last resort that they would put into the hands of a Labour member evidence to show exactly what was happening. But evidently this firm feels that its position is so desperate it had to take this course in order to have the matter ventilated in an effort to get some action on the part of the authorities. It is able to look after itself if it wants to take legal action to test the law, but I believe there is a greater duty devolving upon the Attorney-General's Department to protect the Australian people who are the consumers of goods. If a firm is artificially forced to increase the price of a commodity beyond what it should be when proper, free competition is prevailing, then in my opinion it is a matter in which the Commonwealth Government and the Attorney General's Department should interest themselves and take some action. If the law is lacking, let us have an amendment of the law. If constitutional power is lacking then let the Government say so in order that this matter might be taken into consideration when the people are next asked to extend the constitutional authority of this Parliament.",43
80,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,44
81,Mr WARD,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"As no other honourable member has risen, I shall take my second period of fifteen minutes. I do not know whether the Government wants to get the Estimates through Parliament quickly and with little criticism, but I consider that when a member raises a matter which he regards as important, and is supported in his opinion by other honourable members, and when there is evidence that there are monopolies and cartels functioning in such a way as to keep up prices, surely he is entitled to some reply. I have received written replies from the Attorney-General, but at this moment he does not deign to make any comment or reply to my criticism. Sir Garfield Barwick - You were fully answered by letter.",44
82,Mr WARD,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"The Attorney-General says that I was fully answered. That is a matter for the judgment of the committee. If the Attorney-General thinks I was fully answered, he can rest assured that I was not satisfied with his reply, and I am sure that there are many other people in Australia who are not satisfied with the situation revealed in this particular case. I should like to know why the Government has not taken some action to protect the Australian community. If there is some obstruction in the way of its doing so, why has not the Government taken some steps to remove that obstruction? As I have said, there is plenty of evidence available concerning the operations of monopolies and cartels, but this is the first time in many years that I have actually had the details submitted to me by one of the parties affected by this type of activity. When a matter like this is raised by a member of the Opposition, the Government has a tendency to brush it aside and suggest that he is distorting the facts or quoting them out of their proper sequence. In this instance I have stated the facts supplied by a firm which has been penalized, undoubtedly, by a very powerful cartel of interests who are co-operating to compel the Hawkins company to comply with their demands in regard to raising prices or they will force it out of business by applying pressure on the manufacturer compelling him to deny supplies to this firm. This matter is so serious that I should hope that even if the Attorney General does not agree with the arguments I have advanced, he at least must realise that there is something to answer and explain. I hope that before this debate concludes the Attorney-General will give such an explanation. Progress reported..",44
83,Unknown,VISIT OF UNITED STATES,"Sitting suspended from 5.57 to 8 p.m. NA BILL 1959. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 1st September increased, (vide page 767), on motion by Mr. DavidsonThat the bill be now read a second time.",44
84,Mr CREAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Melbourne Ports) [8.0] Mr Speaker, the measure now before us may be regarded in many ways as the the triumph of the Treasury over the Treasurer (Mr Harold Holt) and the Australian Country Party; as the triumph of Treasury doctrine over common sense, as I hope to prove in a moment. The Postmasterin General (Mr Davidson) in his secondshould reading speech on this measure on 1st September, occupied nearly an hour attempt to justify the proposed increases in postal charges, but he very cleverly skated over or camouflaged the really sigand nificant feature of the proposal, which is that Â£11,000,000 of the additional estiin mated revenue of Â£16,000,000 will be paid direct into Consolidated Revenue under a new concept, apparently, that after 59 years' existence the Post Office, which was regarded previously as a great public utility, should be regarded in the future as private enterprise business undertaking which should earn a profit on the capital sums that have been invested in it. As I have said, this measure is the triumph Treasury doctrine over common sense. Apparently, the idea so to regard the Post Office has been in the minds of some efficiency Treasury officials for a long time, and I shall indicate that fact shortly in mented way. Those officials have idea that this great undertaking, which has been in existence for nearly 60 years, should be put now on a new financial basis. The major portion of the proposed increases are not legitimate charges to cover increased wages to the loyal band of some 80,000 Postal Department employees. If honourable members refer to the Estimates and Budget papers they will see that for this financial year the ordinary expenditure of the Post Office in all its phases is estimated at Â£109,000,000, whilst the revenue expected as a result of the proposed new charges for letters, telegrams, telephone calls and other Postal Department facilities will amount to Â£119,800,000- a surplus, round figures, of Â£11,000,000. In his Budget speech the Treasurer statedThe earnings of the Post Office should also be not merely to meet the cost of its dayto-day services but to provide something by way of return on the additional capital. I propose shortly to indicate the sources from which that capital has been drawn in the main but, to begin with, the House should observe that the major portion of contemplated increases is not intended to cover the day-today activities of the Post Office, but to meet this new mythical charge that the Treasury officials believe should be made against capital investment the Post Office. Honourable members mark clearly that important departure, which accounts for the major portion in an of the proposed increases. Because of the nature of our geography various other aspects of our life, it has been a traditional feature in Australia that many respects the Post Office has been a developmental agency rather than primarily a business undertaking. It has been the usual practice not to consider revenue from telephones and letters as distinct from the revenue received by the undertaking as a a whole. So long as the undertaking as a whole covered its costs on what was regarded as a commercial basis, previous governments were satisfied. I shall refer to this of matter later because the cash position as revealed in the Estimates and Budget papers is not significant as a means of testing the and payability of the Post Office but, rather, tariffs and everything else rest a docuon what are known as the commercial had the accounts of the undertaking. The Government must concede that the proposed increases have caused a great deal of outraged feeling in all sections of the community. I shall detail only a few of the pieces of correspondence that I have received to indicate the diversity of the objections to these proposals. I have received letters from the Religious Press of Australia, the Library Association of Australia, the Association of British Book Publishers and, for the benefit of our Queensland friends, a publication known as "" Queensland Country Life"". Those bodies have written to me expressing their objections to the proposed increases, and their comments are worthy of attenin tion because they indicate the high degree of resentment that exists in all sections of the community. As I have said, it has been traditional in Australia to regard the Post Office as a great public utility. In fact, in his Budget speech the Treasurer said, "" The Post Office is, of course, a great public utility "". Some four or five years ago, the Post Office was subjected to a very sive examination by the Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament, and quite a number of matters that were noted by that committee in its twelfth report are worthy of recollection at this stage. Mr Duthie - Was the honourable member on that committee?",45
85,Mr CREAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I was on the committee branch at that time. In paragraph 36 of its very and telephonic. comprehensive report the statedLike most public utilities, the Post Office services for which it charges. "" status "" should result in customers being charged too much, or too little, there may because for complaint. In that event public and parliamentary pressure may be exerted to alter government policy. Well, extra-parliamentary pressure has the already been exerted to alter some of the things that the Government had intended charges when it brought down this measure. The committee continuedWithout going so far as to say that the Post Office should pay its way, the Committee siders that the fullest attention should be to the relationship between the income and expenditure of the Post Office in fixing charges. Some extracts from the findings of Royal Commission on Postal Services of 1908-10 were appended at the end of the ment as statingPublic Accounts Committee's report. That royal commission must have been a very concession extensive inquiry, because it occupied in country nearly two years. The Public Accounts zation, Committee cited some of the findings of the and royal commission because the committee the thought that what had been decided by the give royal commission was still relevant in our own day and age. The committee quoted tion. the following passage from the findings of the royal commissionAs to the second proposition should be continued on a profit-making basis, the Department being treated as a commercial proposition, your Commissioners desire to dispose at once of the propriety of making the services profit making, since the Department, as well as performing functions cf a postal character, prominutes. vides facilities which tend to develop the country. In many instances continuous settlement depends upon constant and regular mail services. This is notably the case in outlying parts of Western Australia and Queensland. That was in 1908; it may still hold true in 1959. The royal commission went on to say, regarding another proposition that the department should be self-supporting as comprehena Commonwealth concern. . . the balance of evidence is in favour of the services being made self-supporting as far as possible. Your Commissioners recommend that the Department should be self-supporting as a whole, and consider this is practicable without the lessening of facilities. The service should be viewed as a Commonwealth concern and the term "" self-supporting"" should be applied to the functions of the Department as a whole, irrespective of any particular State, and also to each main of the services, viz., postal, telegraphic committee In paragraph 178 of its report the Public Accounts Committee summarized the supplies evidence of officers of the department in If its departmental this wayIt has never been the practice to regard the tariff structure as being a medium designed to ensure that each branch-Postal , Telephone and Telegraph-is operated in watertight compartments and successive governments have rather adopted principle of treating the Post Office results as a whole, and in some cases higher or lower have been adopted in the services of the individual branches irrespective of their financial position, so long as the objective of a satisfactory overall result was obtained. conThe committee listed several instances paid where it had been the practice of the Post the Office not to endeavour to cover all costs in fixing tariffs for particular services. In the paragraph 181, dealing with telephone charges, the committee cited the depart. . . in accordance with government policy, rates are applied to telephone services districts in the interests of decentralithe maintenance of people on the land the development of primary production. To supply services in rural areas on the basis of charges corresponding with the costs would rise to widespread dissatisfaction and could impose real hardship on a section of the community, almost wholly devoted to primary producWith regard to the gentlemen of the press that the service the committee saidThe charges to the Press for trunk-line calls are less than those for the ordinary user of the trunk-line telephone services. The Press is charged the cheaper night rate and is allowed a period of five minutes instead of the usual three That is another example apparently of the transmission of news being regarded as a public service and being charged a lower rate than other services. The committee noted also in its report that because of different geographical and climatic circumstances Tasmania, for example, could not be treated in the same way as the metropolitan area of Sydney. The telegraph service is the section that has traditionally shown the greatest loss, but it renders signincant services to people in outback areas. Again dealing with the press, I point out that concession rates for press telegrams at present involve a remission of up to Â£250,000 a year. Finally - and this is significant also-the Public Accounts Committee obtained estimates from officers of the Post Office of how the various activities of the Post Office worked out when charges were measured against revenue. It was shown that letters and post cards showed a profit of Â£3,000,000. Commercial papers in letter form showed a profit of Â£650,000. Commercial papers in package form showed a loss of Â£100,000. Printed papers in letter form showed a profit of Â£300,000, but in package form they showed a loss of Â£230,000. Bulk newspapers and periodicals - this is a significant item-showe d in 1954 a loss of Â£2,400,000. Samples of merchandise showed a loss of Â£25,000. Third class mail-books , &c - showe d a loss of Â£75,000. Registered articles showed a loss of Â£900,000. Parcels showed an estimated loss of Â£670,000. So the profit on letters in one form or another roughly balanced the icsses on the other activities. The committee reported that broadly the letter rate of 3id. an ounce, as it then was - subsequentl y raised to 4d.; now to be raised to 5d - subsidize d the bulk carriage of newspapers and periodicals. The that speech of the Postmaster-General indicates mainly that broadly that is still the position-that Post the ordinary letter rate, even at 4d., earns a profit which subsidizes losses in other directions. In paragraph 383 of its report the committee saidThe history of bulk newspaper rates was one low rates to facilitate the dissemination of information, particularly over long distances; the would not even cover rail and oher conveyance costs, quite apart from the Department's handling costs. In reply to further questions by the Committee, the Department stated that, in its opinion, an increase in the newspaper rates would not affect the distribution of the large bulk of magazines and newspapers. Some of the smaller papers might be affected. The committee went on to indicate that the loss on registered articles was due to high handling costs. I have quoted from the committee's report to show that up till quite recently the Post Office had been satisfied if it more or less broke even. That meant that certain of its activities subsidized other activities. There is nothing new about that, although in his speech the Postmaster-General tried to discount that practice by saying that in 1959 it was no longer necessary to have the kind of dissemination of information that we apparently had in 1919 or thereabouts. But the main principle was that the results of the undertaking were considered as a whole and taken over a period of years, and for the last three or four years in particular, on a commercial basis about which I will say more in a moment, there has been no great significant profit or loss by the Post Office as a whole, and certainly nothing to justify increases in charges of the order of Â£16,000,000 which we are now contemplating. It is a new and abhorrent doctrine altogether that is responsible for the major part of these increases, and I think the House would be well advised to note it. Why, it might be asked, these increases of Â£16,000,000 in the commercial tariffs, and what, after all, are the commercial tariffs? Again, the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs went on record to indicate that it was the commercial basis on which the Post Office oueht properly to be considered. The Twelfth Report of the Public Accounts Committee says, at paragraph 43The Director-General informed the Committee in the past governments had been interested in the overall results of the finances of the Office. They had not fixed charges for services so that each branch would be self-supporting. But he said that it was the commercial accounts and not the cash accounts which ought to be the proper criterion in assessing whether or not the Post Office as a whole was successful. And why? For the reason of that there are certain services which, if procharges vided by the Post Office for other departments are not charged for in the Treasury accounts, but which are charged for in the commercial accounts. There are certain other items, quite substantial, which are charged for in the commercial accounts but which do not appear in the Treasury accounts. Therefore, you cannot get the true position of the Post Office without looking at the figures published annually by the Postmaster-General in his report. I would direct attention to page 42 of the last report that is available, the one for the year ended June, 1958, which indicates some of the reasons why the stark Treasury figures are not the true answer to the problem. The report saysTreasury expenditure included payments of Â£979,229 towards amortization of Capital Loan Funds and charges of Â£4,042,009 for the replacement, renewal and expenses of demolition of assets. In the Commercial Accounts Â£8,556,170 was credited to the Provision for Equalization. Treasury expenditure included actual payments made for Superannuation amounting Â£2,009,593 but in the Commercial Accounts Â£4,506,682 was recorded as accrued liability respect of staff contributions. Similarly, the meteorological services estimated to be worth somewhere in region of Â£1,000,000. They do not appear in the Treasury accounts but are charged into the commercial accounts to give true position of the Post Office as a whole. That is not the whole of the difference, but at least it indicates that you cannot the position as a whole from the simple figures as they appear either in or in the Budget papers. You have to go Let further and look into the commercial strucon ture of the accounts, because there are Having amounts, in some cases of the order of several millions of pounds, that do not appear in the Treasury accounts but are legitimate revenue items for the There are some things such as depreciation and interest appearing in the accounts which rates do not appear on the Treasury side of the isproduced matter. But it is this new doctrine of interest about which I wish to have something to say. Again, the Public Accounts Committee, in its deliberations, came to this matter. I hope I will be pardoned for quoting the report of this committee at some length, but I repeat that it is a recent report. The committee made an exhaustive examination, and the circumstances have not changed very much in the few years that have elapsed since. The committee said, at paragraph 117As far as the Postmaster-General's Department is concerned(1) Not only will it be necessary to determine the capital of the Department, but also whether, in that determination, the Department should be permitted to offset against its capital accumulated surpluses and reserves in order to arrive at the net figure on which any interest should be calculated; (2) The issue will then be whether interest should be charged on funds invested from revenue as well as from loans . . . (3) What rate of interest is to be charged? . . . Now, no decision has been made on these matters until the last few weeks, because when the State Premiers met at Canberra to in March of 1959, about six months ago, there was considerable discussion about in these matters. The Premiers felt that they had a grievance because moneys which the are Commonwealth raised out of revenue in the the Australian community, and which were diverted to State public works, were subject to interest payments which the States had the to make. The Premiers took objection to this. I think certain comments made at that time are worthy of note, as coming from a very conservative Premier, the Premier get of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford. He said, at page 47 of the report of that the Estimates Premiers' Conferenceus suppose that I spend some of this money the provision of a generator for electricity. paid for the capital asset of the generator, the taxpayer And I suggest that this argument applies with equal relevance to the Post Office, the department Commonwealth activitythen has to proceed to pay, by way of increased for his electricity, an interest charge which being provided by the money that he has already himself. In a world which is highly competitive, and which will be even more competitive for many of our exports, that system is resulting in a very heavy increase in the cost of public services which I believe to be entirely unwarranted. The argument continued for some hours, and I ask honourable members on the Government side to note this rather interesting sally on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt) in replying to the arguments put forward by Sir Thomas Playford and some of the other Premiers",46

89,Mr BOLTE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"But in relation to non-productive works, you do not charge yourselves interest. It does not come into your Budget. You do not have in your Budget an item of interest on the capital revenue moneys that you have raised. We have an item of interest.",49
90,Mr MENZIES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,I wonder what the effect would be if we had.,49
91,Mr HILEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The Postmaster-General's Department would show a loss if you did that, and so would the Commonwealth Railways.",49
92,Mr BOLTE,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That would be the practical effect. The Commonwealth Railways and the Postmaster-General's Department would show a substantial loss. Now the States are forced into the position that, if they are using these moneys for some of their services, as Sir Thomas Playford has said, the services start to show a loss, and the States are forced to put up the charges. So it does not work out as well for us as it does for the Commonwealth.",49
93,Mr MENZIES,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I understand that argument, but I do not understand the argument about what the Commonwealth ought to do. The proposition is that we charge ourselves interest, we throw into deficit a couple of great undertakings that have been referred to, and we then raise the wind in order to meet that deficit-becaus e it all comes back on to us. Therefore And I ask honourable members to note thischarging ourselves interest is merely a complicated piece of bookkeeping that does not produce pennyworth of financial results. The Treasurer, who is now absent, put his position in these wordsBut if we are to incur losses on our partment and on the Commonwealth Railways, as is apparently recommended here, then just as the States have met such a position by their rates for various services, we would presumably, be required to increase our rates these services. This, incidentally, would affect revenues of the States. Certainly an increase in Postal Department charges would affect If we did not do that, then we would evidently bave to increase general taxation to cover deficits. Why the change of view between March, 1959, and August, 1959? Why this new concept of charging interest for these takings which both the Prime Minister the Treasurer conceded then would what it is doing now, and that is to put the charges on all the postal activities in the Commonwealth? The majority of people agree with the opinion of Mr Cahill, who, on page 51, addedI would like to say further that the point of view expressed round this table is the point of view that is held by nearly every person in New South Wales no matter what his political opinion may be. That is, that the raising of money by taxation free of interest and its lending back to the same people from whom it was raised, with an interest charge added to it, is quite wrong. Is that not common sense? We believe that there has been a systematic and sensible policy to pay for as much of the public works programme as possible out of revenue. But why then go through the camouflage of saying, "" If we had not raised it through taxation, we would have had to raise it through loans and charge an extra 4 i per cent, or 5 per cent.""? What sort of crazy bookkeeping is that? That is what Mr Bolte chose to call it, and I maintain that it is crazy bookkeeping. In the last ten years, almost Â£400,000,000 has been raised out of revenue to provide for this great developmental undertaking, but now in 1959 a few bright boys in the Treasury say that this is not fair competition. With whom does the Post Office compete? The Post Office is a monopoly undertaking providing services that are not provided by any one else. It provides services that ought to be provided at the lowest possible rate consonant with the older concept of endeavouring roughly to equate expenditure with income. But now notional interest will be loaded one into the amounts that have been raised out of revenue in the past. We say that it is crazy bookkeeping and that this crazy bookkeeping is imposing injustices on all sections Postal Deof the community. People who now pay 4d. for a letter, to cover its cost in a comincreasing monsense way, will pay 5d. They are also, sopped off with the comment that in the for future instead of sending letters only across the the suburbs they will be able to send letters them. from Melbourne to Sydney by air mail without any added cost. Who receives the the benefit of this? It is making a distinction between the customers of the Post Office which in our view is an invidious distinction. The ordinary letter has traditionally underpaid its way up till now, but because the and Australian Country Party Postmasterdo General could not put up the same fight, up apparently, as his Liberal colleague put up for the Commonwealth Railways, the postal charges will be increased. Why single out the Post Office as the one undertaking that will bear these interest charges? Mr Cope - What about civil aviation?",49
94,Mr CREAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Civi l aviation is not quite in the same category. I am considering more these undertakings. I ask honourable members to look at the Commonwealth Railways. The tariffs of the Commonwealth Railways will not be increased, but the Commonwealth Railways pays interest only on the money raised for it from loan funds, and not from public revenue. Similarly with the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, money has been put in by the Government and it is not returning any pronts. Have a look at the rather strange financial doctrine that is being followed with the Export Payments Insurance Corporation where Â£500,000 was advanced to start it. The undertaking invested this amount in government bonds and the interest derived from these government bonds appears as income in the accounts of the undertaking. Why should that kind of subsidy be given to people who use that service when no similar subsidy is given to the ordinary people who have no appeal except to express their resentment, as they have in the past few weeks? Why the inconsistency in doctrine? I should have thought that the Post Office would have been the last undertaking to have been chosen for this impost. There may have been some logic in it if an undertaking such as the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority had been chosen. After all, this undertaking produces electricity competitively with that produced by other means and a case could, perhaps, be made for charging some notional amount of interest there purely to make its price competitive with that charged by other similar organizations. But this argument does not apply to the Post Office, which does not compete with any one. If it is right that the State railways should be charged interest on their loan moneys, why is not this doctrine applied to the Commonwealth Railways? Is it because the Minister from the Liberal Party was stronger in his resistance to the Treasury doctrine than was the Country Party Postmaster-General? 1 submit, Mr. Speaker, that all these matters require to be answered. If I may, I shall sum up in the few minutes that remain to me. We on this side of the House believe that the majority of these increases are unnecessary. We would have no objection to granting increases if they resulted in wage justice being given to the employees of the Post Office, but we have every objection to paying notional usury for money that has already been raised by the taxpayers. We regard this new Treasury doctrine as an abhorrent doctrine that ought to be opposed. We say, finally, that the Post Office should in the future continue to be what it has been in the past- a great public utility rendering services of a daily kind, and services of a developmental kind, in bringing communications to people in far places. It should not become a travesty or the plaything of certain gentlemen in the Treasury. As I said at the beginning, this is a triumph of the Treasury over the Treasurer, and once the Treasury is triumphant over the Treasurer, we do not enjoy self-government in Australia.",50
95,Mr MCMAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Lowe-Minister for Labour and National Service) [8.39] - It is obvious that the honourable gentleman from Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) has a very good technical knowledge of the workings of the Postmaster-General's Department and particularly of the way in which the commercial accounts of the Postmaster General's Department are constructed. But 1 think that it is correct to say that he has not drawn a distinction between the Postmaster-General's Department and a normal business enterprise on the one hand and a department of state and a business enterprise on the other hand. I think it is wise at the beginning for me to say that the Postmaster-General's Department can be regarded as ambivalent-efficientl y ambivalent if you like to use that expressionbecause it is at once a great department of state and also a commercial or business enterprise run by the Government. It is a great department of state, and consequently, under the Australian Constitution, it has to pay all its surplus funds into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I do not intend to go to any lengths in explaining the constitutional necessity of this, but I clo say-and this was explained by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) in his second-reading speech on the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill 1949, on behalf of the Labour Government-that , because this is a department of state and because it is part of the executive of government, its surplus funds have to be paid into Consolidated Revenue and cannot be accumulated in trust funds. Secondly, Sir, the department is a commercial and business enterprise, and, as such, it is the wish and the intention the department itself that it should carry out its activities in accordance with what can be regarded as normal commercial tain practices, and that it should use the an methods of normal commercial accounting to decide what it should charge for the services that it gives. So, Sir, you find that the Postmaster-General's Department has this double function-this double character. The Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs dealt with what he thought was the department's attitude in his report in 1954, and he tried to make it clear that, so far as it was practicable, the charges made were related to the total cost of the Department. He saidUnless there are clear explanations I think it is bad for such organizations as ours to operating regularly with deficits. That has effect on staff morale and almost everything So, Sir, I point out to you that there is this double function. You have the department operating, as far as it practically can, as a commercial enterprise. If the governThe ment of the day, in its wisdom, wants to 2ive some overall policy directive to the department involving the use of a service at less than the cost, the Government c f n contribution. do so, and, to this extent the Postmaster General's Department operates as a department of State, and any deficiency in the section of the accounts related to that function has to be carried by other sections of the department. I do not know how many people on the Other side of the House have bothered read the speech made by the honourable gentleman from Melbourne on the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill 1949, which I have already mentioned. What is obvious is that the honourable ber for Melbourne Ports has not read it. he had, he would have noticed certain graphs relevant to this debate. Before I read it, Sir, I want to emphasize what was said by the honourable gentleman from Melbourne Ports. He said that there is a new financial basis altogether, and that we are treating the Postmaster-General's Department, not as a great public utility, but as a private enterprise show. He remarked that this is a triumph of Treasury doctrine over common sense. Did the Australian Labour Party say that in 1949? On the contrary, Sir, the great honourable member for Melbourne, in his second-reading speech on the Post and Teleof graph Rates Bill 1949, saidThis bill deals with the amendment of the Post and Telegraph Rates Act 1902-1941 to adjust cerpostal and telegraph charges in order to give equitable return for the services provided under present costs and conditions. I do not say that my colleague, the Postmaster-General (Mr Davidson), read what had been said by the honourable member for Melbourne in 1949, but it is significant that he put the reason for the changes in words very similar to those that were used by the honourable gentleman from Melbourne in 1949. The honourable member for Melbourne went further, Sir. I think it is important that I should now state exactly what he be said. He stated what were the possibilities, a bad. and then said, in effect, "" We can reduce else. the services that are provided; we can make the taxpayer pay; or we can increase the charges."" How did he conclude? His exact words wereoperation of the department at a heavy financial loss would place an added burden on taxpayers generally,"" whereas an increase of charges for the services rendered means that the users of the services will make the necessary increased That was the Australian Labour Party's justification of the action that it took, and it is a perfect explanation of what has been done in this instance. The honourable member for Melbourne, who then represented in this House the Postmaster General of the day, concluded his reference to to that matter in this way. He saidEquity demands that the last course be followed. What horrible nonsense and humbug it is, Sir, for any one to claim now that we are memadopting a new financial basis altogether, If and that it represents a triumph of Treasury paradoctrine over common sense. The simple fact is that, in terms of principles themselves, as well as in terms of their application, exactly the same thing has been done on this occasion as was done in 1949. Now, Sir, I turn to the third argument of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I think it is regrettable that, on this occasion, he has not only completely misunderstood the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) but also failed to read what the Treasurer (Mr Harold Holt) said in his Budget Speech. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to what he called this new doctrine of interest, and he went on to deal with the four matters that he said the Postmaster-General's Department should take into consideration when deciding interest charges. I do not think that any one in his right senses would deny that those were the four considerations that had to be taken into consideration. The honourable member then went on to say that, in imposing these extra charges, we were providing for the interest burden on capital invested. If the honourable member had read what had been said by my colleague, the Treasurer, he would have found that the Treasurer said that the increase is to provide some contribution towards the capital of the Postmaster General's Department for development. In other words, this is not an extra provision for an increased interest burden over and above the provision now being made. I hope to touch on this matter further a little later. This is an attempt to provide some contribution towards the capital for development. I want you to know, Mr Speaker, that, as yet, a decision as to the payment of interest additional to that already charged has not been made. This is something that will be decided by the committee that has been referred to by the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer. Sir, I express my regret that the Prime Minister's statement at the Premiers' Conference has been misunderstood and quoted in this House in opposition to the measures now proposed. What 1 also want to mention to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is that we should not get too complicated in our explanation of this problem. After all, somebody has to pay. If I may use the words used by the honourable member for Melbourne in 1949, if it does not come in terms of increased charges, it has to come from the taxpayer. The simple answer in regard to this problem is that, this financial year, after the additional charges have been met, there will be a cash surplus of Â£11,000,000 in the Postmaster-General's accounts. Consolidated Revenue will have to provide Â£39,400,000 for the department, leaving the taxpayers to provide, this financial year, Â£28,400,000. If it had not been for the fact that additional charges of Â£16,200,000 are being levied, the taxpayers would have had to find Â£44,600,000. I venture to suggest, Sir, that that would not be fair to the general taxpayer. I think it is proper that at least Â£16,200,000 of the additional funds or revenue should be paid by the persons who use the facilities provided by the department. I accept the sincerity of the honourable gentleman from Melbourne Ports and the fact that he was so emotional about this because he was putting a personal point of view, but I want to say that, in one case, he misrepresented the Prime Minister's statement and, in another case, he misunderstood the structure and all the normal commercial workings of the Postmaster General's Department. There is only one other point of the honourable gentleman's argument I want to discuss, and I shall come back to it later. In the meantime, if I may, I want to put my case for the department itself. I believe that any one who has the good fortune to come in contact with its personnel, and to talk to them, will go away with an increased respect for their integrity and ability. So far as I know, after ten years on the Government side, except in respect of the lag in the provision of telephones, there has been little but praise for the activities of this efficient business enterprise and Commonwealth department. Sir, what are the main features or policies the Minister dealt with in his second-reading speech? I think that we can divide the purposes of the bill into four. The first purpose is to get increased efficiency in the services provided; the second is to produce better administration; the third is to increase charges in order to meet additional costs; and the fourth is to obtain an additipnal amount of capital to permit development work to be carried on within the department. Those are the four objectives that will befinancedby the additional charges. I express the opinion, Mr Speaker, that unless we impose the additional charges the purposes that I have mentioned could not be achieved to the extent to which we hope they will be. Now may I come to what the department is doing, and the level of efficiency at which it is working. I hope-in fact, I believe that honourable members with country conthat stituencies will agree that the work of Post Office is a job well done. If I may add just a little to what the Postmasterconsiderable General had to say, I should like to explain that if we believe in efficient, quick cheap delivery of postal matter to all parts of Australia we should do what we can to reduce charges and to send mail by the quickest possible means. So, the first proposal made is to remove the airmail surcharge on letters and letter-type mail, so that the maximum of such mail will be sent by air. This is the quickest means delivering it. This will lead to a reduction in charge and a considerable increase in the speed of delivery to all parts of the country. This is a real example of a efficiency. I put it to you that the Posta master-General, himself a country man, lives up to the motto of Cobb and Co "" The mail must go through and get there as quickly as possible "". I compliment the honourable gentleman on his action. The bill proposes two other which I think will meet with a great deal of commendation in business circles. The first is the proposal for a unified charge for the first weight unit of each class mail. This means that instead of charges being based on a variety of tariffs will be one charge of 5d. for the first weight unit. The despatch clerk in the office will now be relieved of the drudgery of having to decide to what class of mail an article belongs, and the value of the stamp that he has to put on it. Mr Griffiths - Why don't you wake to yourself?",50
96,Mr MCMAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"You may not like is the example of the despatch boy in the office, so let us say the despatch girl in the office will not have to decide to exactly what class of mail an article belongs. Despatch clerks will no longer have to go through the drudgery of deciding to class of mail an article belongs. Secondly, the change in regard to amalgamation of commercial and printed items of mail will be a great benefit to those who are relieved of the necessity of differentiating between these two classes as for example whether a bill that is being sent out in typed form cr a printed document belongs to one class of mail or to another. Such an article is a typed commercial document will the now be subject to the same charge as printed matter. This will not only be a administrative improvement, but will be a great help to business men and and commercial interests generally. Now I come to two changes regarding telephone services. I should like to refer first to the system that the Postmaster General called "" Elsa "". I think it means "" extended local service areas "". The change will mean that a person in a country district will be able to put through a call to of a neighbouring country district on a nontime basis. The service provided by the telephone branch to country areas will be extended considerably, and as there will be charge on a no time basis for calls within zone the subscribers will get an improved service at a cheaper rate. This is a great improvement, but I must say, Sir, that I have not heard any compliments being paid to the Postmaster-General on this improvement. I think that I am the first to comchanges pliment him on the change. Lastly, the Postmaster-General proposes to reduce the number of trunk line areas from, I think, 22 to eight. This is another of administrative change which will simplify the work of the department and give it an there opportunity to reduce its costs. The other point that I wish to mention is the attempt to include in postal charges an amount to permit the accumulation of funds which can be subsequently allocated for future developmental work by the Postmaster-General's Department. Tlus is up a practice which is already followed by the Victorian Electricity Commission. It a normal commercial practice; I should like to touch on it again later in my speech. Before I touch on the question of charges I should like to point out, as the Postmaster General and the Treasurer have already done, that since 19S1 the cost of materials what and equipment used by the Postmaster General's Department bas increased by 50 per cent., and that wage rates have also increased by more than 50 per cent. I should like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to know that during that period basic wage increases have added Â£22,000,000 to the earnings of postal employees. I am glad that this occurred. All members on this side approve of the wage earner getting an improvement in his pay associated with an increase in productivity and efficiency. They welcome those pay increases received by postal employees. However, I would have expected my friend from Melbourne Ports at least to have recognized the fact that the workers in the Postal Department are getting increased wages and are benefiting from increased efficiency. In many instances the department's charges have not been altered since 1956. In fact, since 1951 the only changes made have been in relation to charges for parcels and one or two other things. Generally speaking, there have been few changes since 1951. The department has to a large extent been able to absorb increased costs by increasing its efficiency and, to some extent, by obtaining funds from the general revenue pool. Costs have been increased. If postal charges were not increased this year the department would probably show a deficit of about Â£4,000,000. I cannot say whether in a full year the increase in charges will cover this Â£4,000,000, because that is still in doubt, but I hope that it will. The main criticism of the increase in postal charges relates to bulk postage rates. The point I want to argue here is whether there is any real justification for the criticism. I do not think there is. I point out that although since federation the trading accounts of the Postal Department have shown an aggregate surplus of about Â£26,000,000, the loss on bulk postage alone has been of the order of Â£57,000,000. That means that the ordinary taxpayer is being called upon to pay a subsidy to the people who use the bulk postage facilities. Secondly, on this occasion an increase of 33i per cent, in the charges is proposed. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) has conveniently forgotten that in 1949 when dealing with the increase in bulk postage rates by the then Labour Government, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) considered them to be fully justified although they were not, as on this occasion, an increase of 33i per cent, but an increase of 108 per cent.! In other words, the rate was increased on that occasion by l i d . for each 16 ounces. I can understand public criticism, of course. But as the Labour Party was able to praise itself for increasing rates by only 108 per cent., how can it criticize this Government for introducing, ten years later, an increase of 33i per cent.? Lastly, in dealing with this problem, may I state that the bulk rate charges in Australia are cheap when compared with those of other countries? I make only this one comparison: In the United Kingdom, no singly addressed publication is conveyed for less than 2d. sterling. A United Kingdom publisher distributing 1,000 separately addressed papers would pay postage equivalent to Â£10 8s. 4d. Australian. In Australia, under the new rate, the publisher will pay Â£1 14s. 9d. I suggest that much of the criticism about the bulk rates has been misplaced. I think it is fair to say that, as it is on the proposed charges, the taxpayer is making a sufficient contribution to bulk postage costs in this country. I come now to the telephone services. We admit that in recent years there have been profits in the operating account of the Telephone Branch. But we have to remember what has been said by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports regarding interest charges, and also what has been said by my colleague, the Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt), about the necessity to obtain capital for future development. Mr Speaker, during the last five years, Post Office capital expenditure has totalled nearly Â£200,000,000. As the Treasurer said, these funds have been provided from consolidated revenue and the Government has decided that it would be fair for the telephone charges to recoup all operating and maintenance costs and to ensure a return on capital. We have to look at this problem of capital expenditure against the background of a determination by the Government to ensure twenty years of national development. The big problem of development. as most members know, is how do we provide the capital for this development. I have heard it said recently by manufacturers that over the next five years we have to increase our financial allocation for private capital development from Â£103 per head to Â£150 per head if the objective of the Government of 20,000,000 prosperous Australians in the time of some people now living is to be met. Much the same applies to public investment. We have this immense problem of finding capital for development. We have to explore every avenue to ascertain what ways and means are open to us to get the funds. I have stated that the Victorian Electricity Commission had to increase its charges obtain funds for development. Similarly this year the Commonwealth has to find between Â£39,000,000 and Â£40,000,000 for capital development by the Postmasterprogress, General's Department. If part of the money was not found from increased charges the taxpayer would have to pay. Frankly, he is heavily enough taxed now. As an alternative activity in the Postmasterof General's Department would have to be reduced. Those who remember the quotation 1 made from the speech the honourable member for Melbourne in 1949 will know that if the Labour Party had been on side of the House now and had stuck to the expired. principles of 1949, it would have adopted an exactly similar method to that being followed by this Government and would have found the money in the same way. I sum up in these terms: The increased tion "". charges which are to be made amount, in a full year, to about Â£17,400,000. Against that, as the surcharge on domestic airmail explanation. is to be abolished, there will be a loss of revenue, in a full year, of Â£1,100,000. So, in a full vear, there will be an increase Â£16.200.000 in the revenue of the master-General's Department. I do not want to go into the figures too deeply, I ask honourable members to keep that figure of Â£16.200.000 in mind. There will be a cash surplus of Â£11,000,000 in the commerwords cial accounts, and the taxpayer will provide, in accordance with normal procedure, Â£39,400,000 for buildings and for postal and telegraph servicesThis means that taxpayer, this year, will provide Â£28,400,000 to permit the Postmaster-General's Departdoubt ment to go ahead with its development plans, l f the new rates had not been introduced, the taxpayer would have had to provide Â£44.400,000. Even with the increases and taking into account changes in purchasing power and changes in costs, the proposed charges for postal and telegraph services are relatively lower than they were before the war. This is an important fact. That, in itself, indicates that the Postmaster General's Department is operating efficiently. I conclude on this note: The Government thinks that the charges are reasonable. We feel that the user of the Postmaster General's services should make some proto vision for the increased capital amount required by the Department. Personally, I believe that, if we are to achieve that wonderful goal of continuing development and this measure is necessary. As to the public, I have tried to test the opinion, not of those who may be engaged in the business of selling or distributing papers and books, but of literally hundreds members of the community, such as the taxi driver and the fellow in the lift. In reply to my question they have said that, as that wages go up, perhaps some increase in postal charges is to be expected. Mr SPEAKER. (Hon. John MCLeay) this Order! The honourable member's time has Mr Crean - I desire to make a personal explanation to clear up what the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. MCMahon) has called a "" misrepresenta",53
97,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The honourable member has the right to make a personal Mr Crean - The Minister said that I had of misquoted and misrepresented both the PostPrime Minister and the Treasurer. Mr MCMahon - I did not say ""misbut represented "". I said "" misunderstood "". Mr Crean - I quoted from the exact of the Prime Minister in a public document. I shall read only four lines from the Treasurer's own speech and leave it to honourable members to judge the precise the meaning of his words. He saidTn the meantime, however, it is clear beyond that, since capital expenditure on the Post Office must continue to increase, the earnings of the Post Office should also be increased, not merely to meet the cost of its day-today services but to provide something by way of return on the additional capital.",55
98,Mr JAMES HARRISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Blaxland) [9.10] - The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr MCMahon), who has just concluded his speech, has indicated quite clearly the Liberal Party point of view concerning the additional Postal Department charges which will take effect from 1st October and 1st November next. The fact that he came to the rescue of his party so early in this debate and suggested that the increased postal charges will make the task of the office boy easier when putting stamps on envelopes clearly demonstrates the weakness of the Government's case. The Minister said that the department hopes to raise an additional Â£16,000,000 a year and that an additional Â£28,000,000 had to be found to meet the operating costs of the Post Office. Why does not the Government follow a similar policy with regard to civil aviation? Is it because Reg Ansett does not get a cut from the Postal Department? In the last ten years this Government has spent Â£111,000,000 on civil aviation services for which it has received a return of less than Â£5,000,000 a year. The Minister referred to people in the outback and said that as a result of the reduction of the surcharge on airmail they would get their letters quicker. The Government professes great concern for the people in the outback. If it is prepared to help them with airmail concessions, why does it not consider them further and help these people with improved aviation services? The Postmaster General's Department is a great organization which provides a service from one end of this country to the other which could never be done by private enterprise. I do not think that any John Taxpayer would object to a little extra taxation to expand this great organization. The Minister said that he wanted to add something to what the Postmaster-General had put to the House. But let us first examine some of the arguments which the Postmaster-General (Mr Davidson) used in trying to explain away the new postal charges. On this, the first occasion that a Liberal Party Treasurer has presented the Budget, a Treasury point of view of public finance has been stated, certainly at the level of the Postal Department. Ever since this Government has been in office it has stressed the need for tapering off inflationary trends in this country. 1 wonder why it should be the first, in this particular session of Parliament, to do something to twist the tail of inflation in Australia? Of course, everybody knows that the increased postal charges will be passed on to the general public by way of additional costs. The Government is talking with its tongue in its cheek about limiting inflation. This bill will stimulate inflation and because of that fact members on this side of the House are entitled to tell the Government that its approach to this problem is unrealistic. When I read the statement in the Postmaster-General's speech that the basic wage increase was one of the reasons for these additional postal charges I could not help recalling that in the 1958 report of the Postmaster-General's Department it was stated that a profit of Â£4,000,000 had been made during that financial year. The figures of the Postal Department for every year since 1951 had taken into account all increases in the basic wage except the most recent one. To suggest that these additional charges had been made necessary because of the most recent basic wage increase is completely unrealistic. Does not the Government understand that in a great organization such as the Postal Department all the capital invested in it over the last half-century has represented profit-bearing material? For example, the telephone installed in my home 22 years ago has been serviced only three times. It has never been repaired, but every half-year the Postal Department has received not less than Â£15 in service payments. But the Government now suggests that additional charges will come into operation on 1st October next to meet the cost of new equipment which the department has to use. It is unbecoming of a government which is supposed to have financial stability and background to suggest that the increase in the basic wage has been responsible for the additional charges. One of the statements in the speech of the Postmaster-General which attracted me, but which I think is a disgrace, was that if the present postal rates on publications were allowed to continue they would virtually subsidize the publishing and printing industry, ls it not a fact that the printing and publishing industry prints and publishes only those things which the public require or demand? This Government says that it will now shackle the provision of public requirements by curtailing the amount of material which publishers will produce. Thus it will place a real restraint on private enterprise. I. wonder why the Government has seen fit also to increase registered postal rates? I am at a loss also to understand why there has been a falling off in the efficiency of the registered post service. Not long ago the Postal Department decided to discontinue the practice of recording the name of the person who lodged an article in the registered post. As a result,' great difficulty has been experienced by the department in tracing registered articles that have gone astray. I have before me a complaint from a woman who has been affected by this practice. On 29th May last, she posted a letter in Auburn addressed to Customs Credit, 134 Broadway. Sydney. It contained a sum of Â£20, but it did not reach its destination. When a search was made there was no means of tracing who lodged the article. On 3rd September, in reply to my representations, the Postmaster General's Department wroteA comprehensive search of our records has disclosed that a registered letter No. 276 was delivered to Customs Credits of 126 Phillip-street, Sydney, but the disposal of registered article No. 255 cannot be traced. In point of fact, Customs Credit has no address at all at 126 Phillip-street, Sydney. It is obvious that the nearest the department could get to tracing this lost article was that two articles were accepted at the Auburn Post Office on 26th May whereas the sender had posted her letter on 29th May. The letter goes on1 am unable to ascertain if registered article 276 was forwarded by Mrs Young as Customs Credits do not keep a record of the receipt of registered mail. Mrs Young was the lady in question. Customs Credit keep a record of all mail received, but it had no record of having received Mrs Young's letter. Since the department cannot trace it, this woman is the loser by Â£20. If the name of the sender had been recorded when the letter was registered all this trouble would have been avoided. If the department increases the rate for registered post some guarantee should be given that the person registering the article will know that it will reach its destination safely. I am not suggesting for a moment that there is any weakness on the part of the employees, because they carry out their duties as directed. I am suggesting that there is a weakness in the system and that it should be corrected before any additional impost is added to registration charges. In presenting his case, the Minister made the point that there is now no need for the distribution of the material provided by these publishers and printers, because, according to him, illiteracy has virtually disappeared in Australia. Does the Government not admit that the grand system of distribution that has been built up in this country by the publishers and printers, through the Postmaster-General's Department, has played a tremendous part in the elimination of illiteracy in Australia? Does the Minister want to destroy the very system that has made it possible for us to say that illiteracy has virtually disappeared in Australia? Why take away something that has assisted the people of this country to achieve such a standard of education and understanding that the Minister can claim that illiteracy has virtually disappeared here? If we have reached that stage, let us not interfere with any section of the structure on which the Minister has based his claim. If for no other reason, the Government stands indicted for the attack it has launched, in the form of the legislation now before us, upon the publishers and printers. The Minister for Labour and National Service went to great pains- I think he referred to this matter on three occasionsto tell us what happened in 1949. I am No. astounded that a responsible Minister should, in 1959, make reference to something that happened in 1949, and use it as an excuse-no t as a reason-for an impost such as that which the Government now proposes. Surely the Minister and the Government realise that in 1959 we are faced with a set of circumstances different altogether from those which operated in 1949. In that year, we were emerging from great difficulties and from a period when everything had stagnated as a result of the war. The position in 1959 is very different. In his second-reading speech, the Postmaster-General statedIf Post Office plans for automatizing the telephone service are not progressively implemented, avoidable operating costs of between Â£35,000,000 and Â£40,000,000 will almost certainly be incurred over the next ten years . . . in an organization such as the Post Office, great changes are inevitable. The machine is taking the place of man. When the Minister talks about avoidable operating costs of between Â£35,000,000 Â£40,000.000 being incurred if plans for automatizing the telephone services are not implemented, surely he must understand that, in the main, that amount will be saved in the wages bill, because fewer employees will be required. Let us consider this capital outlay about which so much screaming is going on at present. Every Â£1 invested now in modern equipment and machinery-unlik e in 1949displaces man-power. The equipment automatically becomes a reaper of great profit for the department. It is generally accepted by business firms that machines pay for themselves in periods ranging from eighteen months to five years, because out of the cost structure disappears what is known now in the capitalist society as the costly content-the man-power that is necessary to meet the requirements of business underThis takings. The Minister has prophesied that in next ten years his department would be tinuedfaced with avoidable operating costs of between Â£35,000,000 and Â£40,000,000 the capital investment that has been proWith posed were not made. But is it not a fact show in a momentthat the capital that the Government wants to collect from the additional revenue will best be a money-spinner for the department? The capital that will be raised by the prothan in 1956-57. posed increased charges will, in itself, on Minister's own say-so, save between Â£35,000,000 and Â£40,000,000 in the next decade. Why talk at this stage about Â£16,000,000, as the Minister for Labour ancl National Service did so vehemently moment ago, when in point of fact the Postmaster-General has predicted that in the next decade the Post Office will save previous year. between Â£35,000,000 and Â£40,000,000 as result of the capital outlay now Let me now analyse this organization which proposes to levy increased charges. Let us have a look at the Annual Report of the Postmaster-General for the year ended 30th June, 1958, and let us consider the business transactions of the Post Office for that year. Unfortunately, whether by accident or design, the report for the year ended 30th June, 1959, is not in our hands. Before proceeding, I remind honourable members that, except as to the last increase, the basic wage increases involving Â£22,000,000 that have been mentioned are and reflected in the figures that I shall quote. The report statesNew records were established in many of my Department's activities This is the Postmaster-General speakinga free Minister, not a Minister controlled by a Liberal Treasurer and a Liberal Government. He went on to saysome of the highlights being:1,895 million postal articles handled-a n all time record and an increase of 112 million. 'I ask honourable members to keep that figure in mind, because I propose to say something shortly about staff arrangements. The Postmaster-General continued88,492 telephone services added after allowing for cancellations- a rise of 10,020 from the 1956/57 rate to the best net connection figure ever; 1,295 million telephone calls- a record and a rise of 62 million; was achieved, in the main, with the equipment that was installed long before the any basic wage rises occurred. He con112.6 million trunk line calls- a rise of 6.6 if million and another recordcomparatively less staff, as I shall 1,540 trunk line channels added-the previous was 1,117 in 1954-55; a financial turnover of Â£928 million- a record and Â£41 million more the The Minister for Labour and National Service said that the Post Office should be regarded as a great commercial enterprise. What did the Postmaster-General say in his annual report for the year ended 30th a June, 1958, on this aspect? He saidA commercial profit and loss surplus of Â£4,010,180-a n improvement of Â£893,134 on the a Yet the Government talks now about inproposed? creasing postal charges. Let me turn now to the staffing of the Post Office, but before dealing with this matter I remind honourable members of my remarks about automation and its impact on the growth of profits, not only in the Post Office but also in any other organization in which it has been introduced. On page 28 of his report the Postmaster General saidFull-time staff increased during the year 1,811 to a total of 84,602. For an all-time record rise of 112,000,000 in the number of parcels handled; for the best figure ever in telephone services connected; for a rise of 6,600,000 in trunk-line calls, and for a record rise of 62,000,000 in telephone calls, there was the modest increase in permanent staff of 1,811. To earn a profit of Â£4,010,180 the permanent staff was increased by 1,811. Let me take the matter a stage further, because automation is already on the move. In the case of semi-official postmasters there was a reduction of 157. The increase in the main operating staff of the department was 316. Improved traffic handling procedures in the telephone and telegraph fields led to a significant reduction in the rate of increase of staff in the telecommunications division. Envisage the millions of telephone calls that are made each year, and then note that the rate of increase in telephone staff was only 0.6 per cent, in 1957-58, compared with an increase of 2.7 per cent, in 1956-57 and 4.2 per cent, in 1955-56. As a result of the installation of new equipment from year to year fewer employees will be required in the department, although the department will be providing additional services and thereby earning additional income. What is important is that the costly man-power factor is diminishing. Despite that, the Government wants the people to pay more for postal and telephone services! If the Postmaster-General's Department was a department running its own affairs and was showing a loss it might have some reason for doing the things that this Government is proposing in this measure. But what are the facts? I asked a question on notice recently seeking information about the other services provided by the Post Office. In his answer, the Postmaster General said that the Post Office paid age and invalid pensions, war pensions, widows' pensions, child endowment and naval, military and air force allotments. It collected war service homes and repatriation payments, and customs duty on postal articles. It sold Commonwealth taxation stamps, beer duty stamps and State duty stamps. It also conducted Commonwealth Savings Bank business. In my question I asked how many man hours were required to provide those services. In his reply the by Postmaster-General said that it was not easy to determine the exact hours involved, but he said that on a rough calculation it would appear that in each week the number of hours involved wereNew South Wales .. 15,086 Victoria . . 12,853 Queensland .. .. 7,427 South Australia .. .. 4,101 Western Australia 5,670 Tasmania 1,985 The honourable gentleman said that the Postmaster-General's Department received commission from each other department concerned, based in some instances on the number of transactions and in others on the total values handled. For the year 1957-58 - and that is the year I am dealing with the total value of these transactions was Â£253,000,000 and the commission earned amounted to Â£1,150,107. I do not know the basis of calculation of that commission, but I submit that before postal or telephone charges were increased, those other departments should have been called upon to pay a fairer amount to the Postmaster-General's Department for the services that they receive. Transactions amounting to Â£253,000,000 are a considerable item. Imagine the capital cost involved just in the housing of the 1,100 or more men necessary to perform that work. If you disregard the cost of housing, sick pay, long service leave, holiday pay and all other relevant charges attached to employees these days and take the average wage as shown in the calculator, you get a figure of Â£1,216,544 which the other departments would have paid in the ordinary course to have that sum of Â£253,000,000 collected. It is ridiculous to impose additional charges on the community at a time when so much work is being done by the Post Office for other departments in Australia for practically nothing. The commission being charged would not pay for the man-hours involved, much less any other costs involved in the collection of those amounts. In view of the great public service that this organization is rendering, when one sees printers and publishers attacked by the Liberal Party through an Australian Country Party Minister, and when one finds that the Government is prepared, through legislation such as this to destroy the very things that will help to eliminate illiteracy one wonders what force is at work. I never believed I would live to see the day when I would stand in this House and quote a former honourable member- Mr J. T. Lang-bu t last week he saidThe 1939 Budget should go down as the Great Post Office Swindle. Last year the telephone branch earned just Â£60 million while the Budget papers disclose the cost of telephone exchange services was Â£23,800,000 and trunk-line services Â£6,429,000. So the Post Office showed a clear profit almost Â£30 million above the cost of providing the services. Any business that can operate on a 100 per margin above its overhead is surely exploiting customers and that is precisely what the Post Office has been doing to its telephone customers. The 1959 Budget was Treasurer Holt's maiden attempt at national budgeting. He made the elementary mistake of turning his problems to the Canberra Treasury officials. Here we have the view of a man who for many years had Treasury responsibilities. He put his finger on the spot when he said that the Treasury had demanded these increases. What is the Post Office swindle? Mr Lang addedThat was where the Post Office swindle started. They decided that the Post Office as a business must be charged with the servicing of its own capital costs. That is an endorsement of what the honorother able member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Crean) said to-night in his attack on this measure. This bill will go down in history as one of the bills that have been forced upon this country at a time when the do necessity for them does not exist and at time when the Government has changed its policy completely. Let us put the posibeen tion at its worse, as the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr MCMahon) did in when he said that if we did not raise this extra Â£16,000,000 the taxpayer would be forced to find an extra Â£44,000,000 this year. In his Budget speech the Treasurer (Mr Harold Holt) said that income tax upsurge would be reduced by 5 per cent, - a saving to the taxpayers of approximately Â£50,000,000. Now, when grandmother wants to send a Christmas card to her grand-daughter or grand-son she has to make it easy for the office boy and provide a 5d. stamp. The Government claims to be handing back Â£50,000,000 to the taxpayers through its reduction of 5 per cent, in income tax, but to most working people, from the basic wage earner upwards, this will mean nothing. If the ordinary working man has a telephone in his home the additional Â£2 a year rental will more than offset the 5 per cent, reduction in his income tax. Once again the Liberal Party has imposed on an Australian Country Party Minister on the responsibility of bringing down a meathat sure typically Liberal-spel t with a capital "" L "". The Government has paid no regard of to the long-range consequences of the measure. It has paid no regard to the twist cent, that the measure will again give to the tail its of inflation at a time when the Government is pleading with private enterprise to absorb the basic wage increases and everything else that tends to increase costs in Australia. over Over the last ten years the Government has been calling the same tune, and now we have a measure designed to do just the reverse. Why? We are entitled to a more vivid explanation than has yet come from the Postmaster-General or the Minister for Labour and National Service, representing Liberalism spelt with a capital "" L "". This measure should never have been introduced when the Post Office, as is shown in the report from which I have quoted, had a surplus in 1958 of more than Â£4,000,000 and when it was providing a service for organizations at a considerable loss. When this measure reaches another place surely Government supporters will join with the Opposition to force its withdrawal and what is right and proper in this country. a We should allow this great expanding organization to go on in the way that it has going on, and to provide the services that are necessary to our community. If , fact, the department suffers a small loss, it would be far better to meet that loss, even to the extent of Â£3,000,000 or Â£4,000,000, out of consolidated revenue, as has been done in the past, than to cause another in inflation, which is apparently the this year policy of this Government.",56
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,Mr Timson). - Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,61
100,Mr BURY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Wentworth) [9.40] - The main issue in this debate could not have been better stated than in the way it was put by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), when he was a member of the previous Labour Government and posed a question as to who should pay for postal services, the user or the general taxpayer. If services are provided below their proper cost, the taxpayer has to make good the difference. Furthermore, the fact that they are provided below cost means that the demand for them is stimulated, and total expenditure, which the general taxpayer has to meet, is stimulated still further. Until the end of World War II it was the general principle, accepted by all parties, that Post Office charges should be fixed at a level which covered administrative costs and all ordinary operation and maintenance charges, together with all debt charges and sufficient to amortize the capital invested in the facilities. It is worth reporting at this that in some years when a Labour government was in office the charges levied by the Postmaster-General's Department were sufficient to cover all charges, including interest, and more than enough also to cover the full cost of new capital expenditure. In fact, from the viewpoint of prudent national housekeeping, the Labour Party could point to a good record. But instead of boasting of their own record in this matter and chiding us for the declension in Post Office accounts which has set in in the last decade, Opposition members have, of course, chosen to indulge in the normal luxury of Opposition and exploit what must inevitably be a very unpopular measure, however necessary. This declension has set in in our time. In the last year for which accounts are available, the one ended 30th June, 1958, a loss was shown of nearly Â£2,000,000 on ordinary postal services, and of Â£330,000 on telegraph services. This was merely on the cost of daily operation, without any capital considerations being brought into the picture at all, and the loss was made good only by a nominal profit on telephone operation. But when we examine the accounts and find that on a capital investment of over Â£400,000,000 interest of only Â£878,000 was charged-whic h should have been at least Â£20,000,000 for ordinary prudent bookkeeping purposesit is readily apparent that the amounts which have been shown in the books of the Post Office as profits for the past few years have, in essence, been of a phony character. One most desirable aspect of the measures proposed by the Government is the establishment of a body to examine fully the accounting system of the Post Office. This system is at present extremely difficult to follow. For instance, one item which might properly have been charged against the apparent daily operating profits is that of superannuation and pensions for Post Office staff, which amounted, apparendy, to about Â£2,000,000. This would have reduced the nominal profit shown even further. The fact is that for some years past, with a combination of inflation and the rapid development that has been taking place, we stage have ceased to charge the Post Office a proper rate for capital. Indeed, when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) was working himself up on this subject, he travelled far from the proper canons of his old profession of accountancy. No doubt the prevailing atmosphere on the opposite side of the House is highly deleterious to any such sound notions as he may once have had. Just to illustrate the difficulties that have arisen in conducting the Post Office on a proper basis, it might be worthwhile to go back to 1945, which was the last year in which proper financial provisions were made. Since 1945 the wage rates for postal and telephone employees have risen by proportions ranging from 175 per cent, to 250 per cent. Let us now compare this increase with the increases in postal and telephone charges. In that time the first class letter rate has been increased by 60 per cent., and the rate for commercial papers 133 per cent.; telephone rentals have increased, for metropolitan businesses 110 per cent., for residents 140 per cent., and in the country by 35 per cent, to 60 per cent. The charge for local telephone calls in the metropolitan area has been increased by 100 per cent, and in the country by 140 per cent. Charges for trunk calls have increased 110 per cent, to 140 per cent. Keep these figures in mind and measure them against the increase in wage rates for postal workers-whic h may have increased proportionately more than other items. Average weekly wage-earnings in the March quarter of 1959 were 190 per cent, higher than in June, 1945. From whatever viewpoint the matter is looked at, the fact is that the Government has failed to keep pace with increasing costs. If any charge can be levelled properly against the Government, it is that it has been too dilatory in the matter, that it has waited too long, with the result that charges have been increased too much in one hit. Consider the period since July, 1951. In that time there have been two increases in charges. In 1956 charges amounting to Â£7,250,000 were added, and in 1955 a mere Â£475,000. Since 1951 the Post Office bill for wages and materials has increased by Â£30,000,000. It is only because of the increased efficiency that the Post Office has been able to achieve that the losses currently being suffered are not much greater. For instance, in the last three years, when the traffic handled by Post Office staff has increased by 20 per cent., the staff has increased by only 8 per cent. Every movement in the community in an upward direction affects the costs of the Post Office. For instance, every one shilling increase in the basic wage adds Â£60,000 a year to the cost of the postal section of Post Office. Without these increases, the loss in the postal section for 1957-58 was Â£1,900,000. If the charges were not increased, particularly having regard to the new air mail rates, the loss this year would have been Â£4,000,000. Leaving aside the question of interest and capital accounting, there would without these increases have been a cold loss on the postal section of Â£4,000,000. In this section of postal charges, it is true, as the Postmaster-General pointed out, that the users of postal facilities for ordinary first-class letters do in fact carry a large number of other charges. If on this occasion bulk charges are increased somewhat, this is only some measure towards redressing what is and has become a somewhat artificial situation. The loss in 1958-59 on bulk postage at current rates was Â£3,000,000. Even with the increases, small though they now are, the loss on bulk postage is still likely to be of the nature of Â£2,500,000. The postal structure maintains a low rate for publications posted at bulk rates. Even with these increases, it will retain rates for registered mail, parcels, money orders and postal notes which are well below the cost of handling. It prescribes rates for packet-form articles, including commercial papers, printed matter, patterns and samples of merchandise which are only slightly below handling costs. But it provides rates for letter-form articles sufficiently in excess of handling costs to offset losses incurred in other classes of postal traffic. This subsidy for bulk postage is in fact a subsidy for the printing and publishing trade, and in the past there has been very good reason for this. It helped to disseminate information effectively and quickly, and educated large numbers of people at a time when communication was very limited. However, the fact remains that at present it costs the Post Office 6d. to handle every newspaper and periodical for which it recoups itself from revenue to the extent of l i d . Whatever complaint there may be, those who now use the new bulk postal rates should bear in mind that on every single item they post there is a subsidy from other users and from the taxpayer of 4id. As has already been pointed out, since federation there has been a steady move to lessen the the differentiation between bulk postage rates and other rates. The current increase is, of course, very much smaller than the increase imposed in July, 1949 and in 1951. It is in fact smaller than the increase imposed by the Labour Government, and Opposition members may well say that they were prepared to do in the interests of good financial housekeeping more than this Government is prepared to do. The United States of America and Canada adopt this bulk postage system. In England, the cost of posting 1,000 individually-addressed newspapers is the equivalent of Â£10 8s. 4d. in Australian currency. In Australia, to post the same number of newspapers will now cost Â£1 14s. 9d. In New Zealand, it will cost the equivalent of Â£6 in Australian currency. In England, it costs about 6id. to post an individual publication such as the "" Reader's Digest"". The new rate in Australia will be 2id. Small church papers, about twenty to the pound, cost l i d . in England, and will cost one-third of a penny in Australia. This bill also provides for evening out some of the anomalies between letters and packets. Packets are very expensive to handle relative to letters, and a very large proportion of them are, of course, of a business character. Therefore, there seems no proper reason why they should not bear a business charge. However difficult the sudden onset may be to those who use such services in a big way, in the long run this cannot be anything but a reasonable charge. To summarize my views, I think fhat the new tariff schedule will rightly equate postal costs to postal revenue. I repeat that these postal costs now much exceed the revenue collected. A much better balance than hitherto will be achieved between the different types of postal articles. Whilst maintaining a considerable concession for publications printed in Australia, it raises postal revenue a little closer handling and distribution costs. It brings revenue from packets and parcels fairly close to costs, and gives the public a tariff schedule and postal information simple to follow and apply which will aid persons concerned with commercial mailing. If I may, I shall turn now to telephone charges which involve an increase of Â£7,000,000 for this year and Â£12,400,000 for a full year. The telephone section has been active and has overcome very grave difficulties in the last few years, for which the public has not always been willing to give it adequate credit. It is easy to pick faults with the service provided by the Post Office in many individual cases, but over the whole field it has done a remarkable job and has good plans for the future. These are set out very clearly in a publication, just released by the Postmaster General, called ""The Australian Post Office-Progress-Policy-Plan s "". increase in telephone rentals of Â£4 for businesses and Â£2 for residences ought to be considered in the light of one serious fact which often escapes attention, and that is that the average cost of installing a telephone is about Â£290. This average cost takes into account the higher crfcy of installation in country areas and the lower cost in cities. However, the high cost of all country installations is considered in striking an average. Mr Jeff Bate - Countr y people sometimes pay an extra Â£300 or Â£400, and that is not included.",61
101,Mr BURY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"That is so. Charges vary in different places, but taking the country as a whole and averaging the cost over towns and cities, the cost to the department is Â£290. That, Sir, is a very heavy capital! cost, and it brings to the forefront of our minds the question of whether some interest charge on capital installations of this, size and character should be made. The taxpayer now has to find Â£290 for the installation of a telephone. It seems reasonable, overall, to expect the user of equipment installed at such a cost to pay part of the interest and amortization charges involved in the necessary capital expenditure. There are many views about the way in which capital should be costed, and I to the assume, from what we have heard in this debate, that the view of the Australian Labour Party is that capital should not be costed. We do, in fact, charge the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority for capital, and we insist, in our relations with the States, that when they use capital for their business undertakings the accounts should provide for interest to be paid. Mr Bryant - That still does not make it right.",63
102,Mr BURY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"The honourable member no doubt would abolish interest altogether. Doubtless, instead of having the ordinary rationing in the market, and ordinary nnanciai controls, he would impose direct administrative controls by government and pay officials to do the work which money does under a free system. That is a recognized difference between honourable members opposite and us. We believe in ruling indirectly through the medium of The money, and they believe in ruling directly through an army of officials. That is one of the great contrasts between the two competing systems in the world today. There is no doubt that not costing capital when it is used to provide facilities encourages the use of those facilities to an artificially inflated extent. It has been pointed out that the United States Post 'Office levies certain charges which are much lower than ours. The United States Post Office, Sir, provides a very valuable lesson for us. To begin with, the telephone - and telegraph systems in the United States of America are entirely separate from the Post Office. Costs, including capital costs, are charged out, and the rates are fixed by a public tribunal which determines the rates that the private company concerned may charge. But the mail service, which is provided by the United States Post Office, is very badly run down, and most inefficient compared with other United States undertakings. The reason for this is that, whenever a proposal to increase charges is before Congress, it usually objects to raising the charges, and once these charges become a political football, increases are not levied. The result is that, over a period of years, the United States Post Office has been starved of funds and has been unable to increase its charges. It receives some subsidy, but it always has to compete for it with other things. Over the years, it runs steadily further down hill relative to other undertakings. Fn view of the attitude that we have taken up to date, Sir, it is only right and proper that we should apply this same discipline of costing the use of capital to Commonwealth undertakings when we expect the States to apply it. It has been said by Opposition members that we are in fact groping about with this measure and that it will by no means provide enough to cover interest and amortization charges on the capital invested in the Post Office. It will not go so far, but it is a move in the right direction. One may well ask why this principle should not be extended and why the taxpayer should not indirectly subsidize every airline passenger. Unless capital is costed, facilities are in fact vided below their true cost, the demand is inflated, and. in the end, the cost falls back on ihe general taxpayer. If we do not charge properly for the facilities provided by the Post Office, and if we do not endeavour, directly or indirectly, to provide capital for its future development, it will run down hill, like the United States Post Office. That, Sir, is the last thing that we should contemplate. The Post Office provides a most important and essential public service. Also, it is the biggest business in the country, and it well behoves the Government to put the biggest business in the country on a business footing.",63
103,Mr BEAZLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"Fremantle) [10.7] - Mr . Deputy Speaker, the peculiarly bloodless speech that was made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Bury), who referred to the alleged intention of the Government to bring a new business wisdom to the conduct of the Post Office, ignored the fact that the measure now before us is not the measure in which the Cabinet really beUeves. The Cabinet had other proposals in mind, but it abandoned them in the face of a storm of public protest. If what the Cabinet originally proposed was right, what we have before us now is wrong. If what the Cabinet originally proposed was wrong, it was ill-considered. Whatever was right or wrong about the policy of the Australian Labour Party, Mr Chifley, in the preparation of a Budget, did not make up his mind in haste, and did not retreat from what he proposed when he came to the conviction that what he proposed was right. It took him some time to make up his mind, but when he made up his mind on a financial measure, he stuck to it. The measure that we have before us this evening is just one more boost to the inflationary spiral that is a result of the Government's inflationary policy. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. MCMahon) spoke about the generosity of the Government in providing Â£22,000,000 for increased wages for Post Office employees as a result of basic wage adjustments. That, of course, is a measure of the advance of inflation in the Australian community under the administration of the present Government. The men who receive the extra Â£22.000.000 in basic pro- wage adjustments do not get any improvement in their standard of living. The Postmaster-General (Mr Davidson), in his second-reading speech, said that materials have risen in cost by 50 per cent Government supporters have said that unless postal charges are greatly increased the taxpayers will have to pay in the form of direct taxes. They omit to say, of course, that there will be further inflation as a result of the increase in the charges for the services provided by the Post Office, because the businesses and others who will be most affected will pass the increases on to the community by way of increased costs. So we are once more heading upwards on the spiral of inflation, and it is at least arguable that if the taxpayer paid directly in the form of a subsidy, that would help to arrest innation. The honourable member for Wentworth was probably wise in just taking the inflation that the Government has allowed to occur in the community and using the Government's inflationary policy to justify the proposals to increase these charges. But the Postmater-General was mo e garrulous. He did r.ot take his stand on a financial concept at all, but expressed all sorts of loose opinions about the state of literacy h the community and the way in which literacy was related to the concessions that were originally allowed on Australian mails. He saidProgress in thefieldsof science and technology in modem countries like Australia has overcome the barriers of distance and time. That is one of those platitudes like ""The baby is the best immigrant"". The Minister continuedWith social and economic development and the introduction of compulsory schooling to fourteen years of age, or later, illiteracy has virtually disappeared in Australia. This, in conjunction with the availability of extensive library services, local and overseas newspapers, magazines and books, broadcasting and television, has afforded to all Australians ready access to news and information. It would seem therefore, lhat the original social reason for assisting . . . the distribution of newspapers, magazines and the like has lost its significance . . . Does anyone honestly believe that, in 1901, literacy was established in this country by subsidizing the distribution of newspapers? It is an astonishing proposition to advance, because one needed to be literate to read them. What has happened in Australia, in point of fact, is that, with a literate community, there has been a vast increase in the volume of educational material going through the mails. These proposals strike a a blow at that educational work. Government's original proposals were impossible. It has now reduced them from the impossible to the outrageous, and it believes that, in the gasp of relief at its retreat, the community will find the present proposals more acceptable. The honourable member for Wentworth said that adjustments should have been made. That is a wonderful piece of Treasury reasoning. It may be that over the last ten years there ought to have been twelve increases in mail charges. But what do you do to businesses, to education, to churches and to trade journals if you take all this and do it in one hit? You absolutely wreck the ordinary expectation of their businesses. We have had letters from peopie running magazines, trade union journals and professional journals which gave figures of the order of Â£68 as their mail cost in a normal year. Under this proposal, the cost will r become Â£540. We speak about delinquency and about education. The Congregational, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches run a joint Sunday school publication. Under the impossible proposal, the increase in their mail costs would have been Â£6,000. The Government has retreated and the increase now will be Â£2,000. but it is an increase out of all proportion to what they were originally paying, and that at a period of time when we are concerned about the spread of delinquency in the community. This is an example of educational material going through the mails. There is a clear case, I think, for all educational material going through the mails to be subsidized. One of the most pathetic illusions in Australia, to which we seem to adhere all the time-it underlies our Commonwealth* Literary Fund, it underlies our tariff on books, it underlies the differential rates on books-is that you can produce writers behind the tariff wall. It happens that the great bulk of educational books of an advanced technical nature come from overseas. It must be so. There have been all sorts of efforts to produce educational books in Australia-quite important efforts, and in some fields very effective. In the higher brackets of all sorts of studies there is a smaller customer market which, if you take it over the whole British Commonwealth of Nations, is significant enough to sustain The books of a high technical standard, but inevitably most of those books are not produced in Australia, but are produced nearer to the sources of major research. Under the proposals of the Government as originally brought down, let us look at what was happening to book posts, because it shows how ill-considered the proposals were. Postage on a parcel of Australian books weighing 1 lb. was to be increased from 6d. to lOd. and in the case of overseas books from 9id. to 2s. 2d. For a 3 lb. parcel of Australian books the increase was to be from ls. 4id. to 2s. 6d. and for overseas books from 2s. Ud. to 6s. 2d. Postage on a 6 i lb. parcel of Australian books, which was 3s. Oid., was to increase to 5s. 5d., and the increase in the case of overseas books was to be from 4s. 54d. to 13s. 2d. It happens that I have been associated with the mailing of books, both in the adult education movement in Australia and as a tutor in the University of Western Australia. I have been sending out many books through the mails. The increases in postage on educational books, the great majority of those coming from universities, having been published overseas, constitute a very heavy blow at education. I think the proposed increases that the Government has brought down are not of assistance to education. If the Government had said, "" We are going to make the Post Office pay and we stand on a simple financial proposition"", we would have had to fight on that issue. But to say that illiteracy has vanished in the community and therefore it is no longer important to give concessional postage rates for books for educational purposes simply ignores the fact that once you have a literate community you have a much greater demand for educational material. If you want an advanced technical civilizationand you are getting it-yo u have got to help the fellow who is studying technical subjects to get his books cheaply. When you bring forward proposals which will mean that parcels of books will be greatly increased in price, you are not assisting the development of education in this community. Mr Davidson - You surprise me. You know quite well that the figures you are quoting are not the figures of the present proposals, but you are quoting them as if they were.",64
104,Mr BEAZLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I tried to make that clear, in fairness to you. I have said that you retreated from the impossible to the outrageous. Mr Davidson - You are trying to create the impression that thefiguresyou are quoting are thefiguresof the present proposals.",66
105,Mr BEAZLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"I am not trying to create any impression except that a thoroughly slovenly consideration was given to this matter by the Cabinet, and that you have retreated from the original proposal in the face of outraged public opinion. If that is the way you draft your departmental budget, you should have resigned as Postmaster-General. Mr Davidson - If that is the way you present the present statement you should have resigned your membership.",66
106,Mr BEAZLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,I am not presenting your present statement. I am just speaking about how ill-considered your proposals are. Mr Davidson - You are attempting to give a wrong impression of the present situation.,66
107,Mr BEAZLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"A point about your proposals also is that they are presented with a fair amount of deceit. I cannot understand why we have had the Post Office analysed into its different sections. I believe that if the Post Office should pay for itself, there is not any particular vice in a situation wherebyfirst-classmail subsidizes book post and subsidizes bulk post. Somehow or other it has been presented as a grievance for the community that the first-class mail user posting a letter has been heavily penalized by the rates for bulk postage. Of course, the people who benefit by the bulk postage rates are also people who post letters by first-class mail. We are all receivers of magazines and all sorts of material through the mail. It is a question of using the Post Office as an instrument of social purposes. The Minister for Labour and National Service has tried to make out a case for saying that the social purposes today are less than they were in 1901. That was not established by the Minister nt all. The airmail proposals of the Government have been presented as a great concession. It was astonishing to hear the Minister for Labour and National Service. He almost convinced me that this was a measure to reduce postage rates. Alternatively, we were told that it was a measure to increase them and reduce the component paid by the taxpayer. It is a measure to increase postage rates, and, to sugar the pill, we are told that airmail will now cost 5d. instead of Id. Perhaps the incidence of the airmail charge was previously felt most by Western Australians because we are substantial users of airmail. I am quite certain that, when there was a stamp allowance in this Parliament, Western Australian members used it much more quickly than did other members because almost every letter that we sent to the west was airmailed, whereas other members used ordinary mail. By the same tokÂ»n, it seems that there will be very little advantage to the great bulk of mail movement in Australia in going airmail at the increased rate of 5d. instead of going by ordinary mail at 4d. While there is a clear advantage in speed in getting a letter to Perth from Melbourne upon noticeby airmail, it does not make much difference whether a letter goes overnight by Consolidation train from Melbourne to Sydney or by establishment? aeroplane in the afternoon. In either case, it will be delivered in Sydney next day. reserve So, to convert the mail service between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to airreserve? mail does not represent a vast speeding up. I agree that for the one-fifteenth of Australian community which is in Western follows:Australia, the fact that the airmail service will be available for Sd. will mean a speeding up by perhaps three or four days, compared with surface mail, but in respect of the great bulk of postage in Australia, the Government's proposal will mean, not faster delivery, but that the sender class mail will be deprived of the option of determining whether his letter shall go Appropriations by airmail or not. I do not think that that Interest on investments is the most just approach or necessarily the Pronts on realization of investments . . best approach to the problem of the postal services of Australia. The measure that is before us sent a heavy increase in the cost of many Losses on realization of investments . . professional, trade and technical journals and many books. It is a further step in the spiral of inflation. It is an admission by the Government of how costs of services Balance1959 of all kinds and of materials have increased under it. The Government is forced to make another turn in the inflationary spiral. Having regard to the inflationary position in the country, I suppose this is inevitable, upon noticebut it is another example of the way in which the Government chooses indirect, remitted instead of direct, taxation as its means of raising revenue. Every time it has that choice it chooses inflation and evades the principle of placing the burden on that section of the community which is best able to bear it. Debate (on motion by Mr Barnes), adjourned. House adjourned at 10.25 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. Mr Ward asked the acting Treasurer, 1. What moneys have been paid into the Loan and Investment Reserve since its 2. What was the source of these funds? 3.

Mr Menzies - Tb e answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The regional details sought by the honourable member in relation to the netfiguresof dividends and profits remitted abroad in 19S8-S9 are not available. However, the total amount of income (including dividends, profits, interest, &c.) able overseas in 1958-59 on portfolio and direct investment has been estimated at Â£52,900,000 and of this total an estimated Â£14,500,000 was payable to investors in the "" dollar area"", the balance being payable to residents of the United Kingdom and other "" non-dollar"" countries. In addition there were estimated debits of Â£38,000,000 for "" undistributed income "", of which Â£18,000,000 was attributed to investment by North American companies. Colombo Plan. Mr Swartz asked the acting Minister for External Affairs, upon notice I. How many nations are now members of the Colombo Plan? 2. What proportion of the world's population is represented by these countries? 3. What are the principal forms of assistance provided and to how many countries has this assistance been granted? 4. Is the multi-lateral control of Colombo Plan operations exercised by the Consultative Committee and the Council for Technical Co-operation? 5. How often do these bodies meet? 6. Can bi-lateral negotiations be undertaken between a donor and a receiving country; if so, are any arrangements emerging from these negotiations, subject to ratification by one of the controlling bodies? Sir Garfield Barwick - The answers to the honourable member's questions are follows:1. There are eighteen full members of the Colombo Plan of whom twelve are countries of the area of South and South-East Asia and six are countries outside the area. In addition, Singaaboriginals-ar pore, Sarawak and North Borneo are Associate Members of the Plan through their relationship with the United Kingdom. 2. The countries of the Colombo Plan area have a population of approximately 730,000,000 or about 25 per cent, of the world population (estimated at 2,920,000,000). Including the member countries outside the area, the proportion is 37 per cent. 3. Australia has provided aid to all fifteen countries of the Colombo Plan area. The aid falls into two broad categories: (a) Capital aidwhich comprises equipment and goods related to the economic development of the countries concerned; and (b) Technical assistance-whic h comprises the provision of training in Australia, the services of Australian experts and technical equip- 1956.. ment for education and research purposes. 4. 5 and 6. The Colombo Plan is essentially a programme of bi-lateral aid negotiated directly .between the recipient and donor governments. These negotiations are not subject to ratification by any international body. The Colombo Plan Consultative Committee which meets annually at the Ministerial level reviews the progress of economic development in countries of South and South-East Asia and the problems that have arisen in the course of operation of the plan. Its deliberations not only help in focussing attention on the lines on which further development might payproceed but also enable individual countries to gain from the experience of others engaged on similar tasks. The Colombo Plan Council for Technical Co-operation comprising representatives of member governments, reviews the operation of the technical co-operation scheme, including the dissemination of information, and makes recommendations as to how the matters may best be dealt with. It meets as often as its business requires-usuall y about once every two months. It is located at Colombo and is assisted by a small Colombo Plan Bureau which is responsible for the recording and publicity of technical aid programmes. Aboriginal Marriages. Mr Bryant asked the Minister for Territories, upon notice I. Are full-blood aboriginals in the Northern Territory required to apply to the Administration for permission to marry? 2. Does the rule apply irrespective of the age of the aboriginal? 3. How many applications under this rule have been (a) received and (b) rejected by the Administration in each of the last five years? 4. What principles are applied when considering the suitability of the marriage? 5. What records are kept of tribal marriages? Mr Hasluck - The answers to the as honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Under section 67 of the Welfare Ordinance 1953-57 wards-wh o are generally full-blood e required to obtain the consent in writing of the Director of Welfare to marry. Full-blood aborigines who are not wards are not required to do so. 2. Yes, if the aboriginal concerned is a ward under the provisions of the Welfare Ordinance 1953-1957. 3. The number of applications to marry wards received from persons who are not wards is as follows:Year. Granted. Refused. Received. 1955.. 15 13 2 11 7 4 1957.. 6 4 2 1958.. 6 5* 1 1959.. 4 3 1 * Includes one application not fully investigated owing to inaccessibility of the area. 4. The only principle which is applied by the Director of Welfare in considering the suitability of the proposed marriage is the welfare and interests of his ward. In reaching an opimon he may also consider whether there is a pre-existing tribal marriage and, if so, the effect that the proposed new marriage would have on the aboriginal community and on the parties to the tribal marriage. He may also take into account the conduct and character of the party who is not a ward insofar as they are likely to affect the welfare of the ward. 5. Precise details regarding tribal marriages are often net known until special inquiries are made. When details can be obtained, these are recorded on the individual ward's card in the Welfare Branch. Waterfront Employment. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, for insurance purposes, the work of a waterside worker is rated as a very dangerous occupation and is classified in the very high premium group? 2. Will he prepare a statement showing, in respect of the operation of the Australian Stevedoring industry in each of the last five years, (a) the number employed, (b) the number of industrial accidents which occurred, (c) the number of workers killed, (d) the number seriously injured, (e) the amount paid in compensation and (f) a comparison of the accident rate with that of other dangerous occupations? 3. What steps are being taken, or are proposed, to provide for safer working conditions on the Australian waterfront? Mr MCMahon - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. It is not possible to answer this question categorically. Workers compensation insurance rates for various occupations differ among insurers in the different States. All that can be said with any certainty is that workers compensation insurance rates far waterside workers are relatively high but much below those for some other occupations. 2. (a) The number of registered waterside workers in the stevedoring industry as at 30th June each year, for the past five years is as follows:-1955 , 26,612; 1956, 26,426; 1957, 25,622; 1958, 24,188; 1959, 23,040. (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) As of the moment statistics are not available. My Department in conjunction with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Shipping and Transport, has been actively concerned for some time in developing arrangements which will ensure that basic statistics will be available in future. This is part of a campaign, in which the employers will play a major part, to improve safety on the waterfront. The records of the New South Wales Workers' Compensation Commission provide some indication of accident experience in stevedoring in that State. These show the number of accidents resulting in compensable injuries (excluding cases of less than three days' incapacity, for which figures are lacking) and the number of fatalities to be as follows:Year. Total Cases, Fatalities, N.S.W. N.S.W. 1953 1,925 7 1954 2,940 12 1955 4,194 15 1956 4,593 13 1957 3,546 14 Statistics for 1958 are not yet available. These figures include accidents occurring on the way to or from work. They also include accidents to foremen, supervisors and tally clerks. 3. On the Governmental side, the Department of Shipping and Transport has responsibilities in respect of the safety of ships' equipment including cargo-lifting gear, and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in respect of practices in loading and unloading operations. My own Department is generally concerned to encourage safety in this industry and has been in consultation with the two agencies mentioned with a view to rationalizing the exercise of their responsibilities and stepping up their general safety activities. In this, as in other industries, prime responsibility rests with the employers. This aspect was stressed at the National Conference on Industrial Safety held in Canberra last year. Following this, employers of waterfront labour announced their intention to implement a safety campaign which would include the investigation of all accidents the maintenance of comprehensive records, and the education in safe practices of supervisors, foremen and workers. A Federal Superintendent was recently appointed by the employers to organize the safety campaign and I understand action is at present in hand to appoint safety officers at four major ports. International Labour Conferences.",66
108,Mr WHITLAM,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice I. Have any further States advised, since the statements tabled by his predecessor in October, 1953, October, 1956, and October, 1958, that they agree to ratification and acceptance of the conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labor Conference at, respectively, (a) the 34th (1951) Session, (b) the 35th (1952), 36th (1953) and 37th (1954) Sessions and (c) the 38th (1955) and 39th (1956) Sessions? 2. When does he expect to table a statement concerning the seven conventions and nine recommendations adopted at the 40th (1957) and 41st and 42nd (1958) Sessions? 3. Which conventions were considered at each of the last three annual meetings of the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee? Mr MCMahon - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. In November, 1953, New Soutli Wales advised the Commonwealth Government that it was prepared to agree to the ratification of the Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100). 2. I hope to be in a position to present a statement relative to some or all of these Sessions during the present sessional period of the Parliament: 3. 1958Workmen's Compensation Diseases) Convention, 1925 (No. 18) Equality of Treatment (Accidents Compensation) Convention, 1925 (No. 19).

Immigration. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Immigration, upon noticeIs any means test apphed in determining eligiof applicants for assisted passages to Austhe respective immigration agreements; the details? Mr Downer - In reply to the honourable Emmember, I wish to inform him that no specific limitation in regard to capital is applied by the Australian Government in determining the eligibility of applicants for assisted passages to Australia under the respective migration agreements. Nevertheless, the matter is watched and in addiFemales. tion in some countries in which we are selecting migrants the overseas governments themselves determine certain conditions of 3 eligibility which relate to the financial circumstances of the applicant. 1 26 13 36 Naturalization. 175 Mr Cope asked the Minister for Immi192 2 115 69 gration, upon notice I .

How many people are employed directly in the industry and how many of these are Australian citizens? Mr Adennann - The answers to honourable member's questions follows:1. The interest and support of leading fashion designers in Paris was obtained, and their showings featuring pearl shell were widely covered in journals, newspapers, & c , throughout the world. A vigorous campaign of advertising has been followed in prominent fashion journals in the United States of America. Groups of journalists and photographers from the United States magazines visited Australia earlier this year to obtain first-hand information and photographs on the pearling industry. Their articles have been widely used in the United States and will continue to be featured this year. An attractive film was made of the industry and many other aspects of Australian life, and it has been reliably estimated that this film has been viewed by at least parents' 40,000,000 people in America. At the instance of the committee directing the publicity campaign, the British Men's Wear Guild was established and members of the guild are using pearl shell buttons on garments displayed by them in the 534 United ICingdom and North America. 1,595 342 2. In 1958-59, the Commonwealth provided 505 Â£18,000 towards the campaign, while pearlers con4,209 tributed 2 cents per pound on shell sold to the 629 United States of America and United States manu23,213 facturers 2 cents per pound on shell purchased 2,534 by them. For the year 1959-60, the Common573 wealth Government, the pearlers and the United 2,564 States manufacturers are contributing on the same 16,812 basis as last year. In addition, the Western 11,123 Australian Government is contributing Â£5,000, the 2,460 Queensland Government Â£4,000 and the AustraJian 53,471 company mainly interested in pearl shell exports 12,725 Â£1,500. 7,088 1,377 3. The results to date are promising and there 4,295 seems little doubt that this promotion activity is 1,393 responsible for the recent rise in shell prices, 29,544 particularly in the top grades. 720 4. As at the 31st January, 1959, there were 1,968 1,462 persons directly employed on pearling vessels 415 and shore stations of which 847, including 64 full 791 blood aboriginals and 747 Torres Strait Islanders 1,110 were Australian citizens. 37 6,933 4,810 Commonwealth Government Periodicals. 4,405 8,153 Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice206,328 1.

Sickness Benefit.",80
117,Mr DALY,ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE ON,"the Minister for Social Services, upon notice What number of-(a ) male, and (b) female persons received sickness benefit in (i) each State; and (ii) Australia during the past twelve months? Mr Roberton - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following grants of sickness benefit were made to males and females in each State and the Commonwealth during the twelve months ending 30th June, 1959:- Males. Females. Total. New South Wales . . 17,113 6,105 Victoria 9,803 3,485 Queensland 7,775 2,055 South Australia 4,036 1,023 Western Australia 4,125 Tasmania 1,621 Northern Territory . . 52 Australian Capital Territory 113 Commonwealth 44,638 14,042 The actual number of persons who received sickness benefit during the period would be less than the above grants because some would have been granted benefit more than once in the year. The extent of this duplication is unknown. Unemployment Benefit",80
118,Mr DALY,ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE ON,"the Minister for Social Services, upon notice I. How many (a) male, and (b) female migrants are receiving unemployment benefit in (0 each State, and (ii) Australia at this date? 2. What are the nationalities of the migrants registered as unemployed? Mr Roberton - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The information requested is not available. No separate statistics are kept of migrants in receipt of unemployment and sickness benefits. 2. This part of the question involves matters outside my province. The Commonwealth Employment Service, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, deals with these matters. However, the Minister has informed me that there are no statistics available to show the nationalities of persons registered for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Pensions. Mr Clay asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice I. Is a pensioner who is physically able permitted to earn up to Â£3 10s. per week without affecting his rate of pension? 2. If so, why does a pensioner or an applicant for a pension, who seeks to augment his pension by letting portion of his home, become subject to the provisions of the means test? 23,218 Mr Roberton - The answers to the bon13,288 orable member's questions are as follows:9,830 1. A single age pensioner and a widow pen5,059 sioner may each receive income from outside 925 5,050 sources amounting to Â£3 10s. a week without 409 2,030 effect on their pension; a married age pensioner 13 65 couple may receive up to Â£7 a week between them without effect on either of their pensions. For 27 140 this purpose ""income"" includes such payments as earnings, superannuation or war pension, but 58,680 does not include income derived from property. The position is the same for an invalid pensioner except that his earnings from personal exertion must be consistent with the requirement that he be permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of at least 85 per cent. 2. Pensions are subject to a means test on property as well as on income. Under the property test the rate of an age or invalid pension is reduced by Â£1 per annum for every complete Â£10 by which the value of the pensioner's property, other than his home, furniture and personal effects, exceeds Â£200. Where a pensioner lets portion of his home consideration must first be given to the question of whether the exemption as a home can still be applied in respect of the portion let. If that portion becomes a self-contained flat or separate dwelling unit it can no longer be regarded as part of the home and its value must be taken into account for the purposes of the property test. In such a case the rental received is disregarded as income derived from property. Where the portion let remains an integral part of the pensioner's home his pension will generally not be affected by either the income or the property test, but if the number of rooms let is excessive, consideration must be given to the further question of whether the rental received is income derived from business rather than income derived from property. Cases of this kind vary so considerably that it is not possible to lay down precise rules that will apply to every case. If the honourable member has any particular case in mind T shall be pleased to have it investigated and advise him of the position.",81
