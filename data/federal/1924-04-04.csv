1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. WAR PENSIONS.",13
2,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Yesterday , I asked the Treasurer what is the number of pensions being paid to soldiers for varying degrees of incapacity. In the course of his reply the honourable gentleman stated that all statistics that are likely to serve a useful purpose are compiled regularly, and he hoped I would not press for the information I sought. In view of the importance of this matter I do press strongly for the information, and I ask the Treasurer to have it compiled, and not be bluffed by his officers.",13
3,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"If the honourable member presses for the information it will be obtained, but the compilation will take some time. ARMY VICTUALLING ARRANGEMENTS.",14
4,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I hold a newspaper statement, which I understand is fairly accurate, that trouble has occurred with ihe 58th Battalion at Seymour Camp in regard to the quality of the food supplied. It is stated that the meat was very bad, t*he tea was like dirty water, and the rice was burnt and served without sugaror milk. The men refused to parade until their grievance i i i this regard had been rectified by the officers. I ask the Minister for Defence whether arrangements cannot be made for the better victualling of military trainees when in camp, other than by depending ou private caterers, in view of a possible mobilization on a large scale. any reason why the various arms of the Australian Military Force should not be catered for by the same system as operates in the Royal Australian Navy, and sumcient permanent qualified members of the Army Service Corps made available for training camps?",14
5,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I have ordered that the trouble be inquired into, and if the honourable member will put a question on the notice-paper, I shall supply him with an answer on the next day of sitting. Mr M o GRATH - I notice there has been no complaint by the officers, and I ask the Minister for Defence to consider the advisability of having only one mess for officers and privates. If that were done thore would be no further ground for complaint regarding the food.",14
6,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,The honourable member's suggestion will receive consideration. STOPPAGE OF PUBLIC WORKS.,14
7,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Winte r is approaching, and as the State Governments and State instrumentalities generally have had to discontinue current works and postpone the commencement of new works owing to the financial stringency, will the Prime Minister take immediate steps to improve the financial arrangements so that big public works may proceed ?",14
8,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The financing of State public works is obviously the concern of the respective State Governments, but this Government is anxious that there shall be no general unemployment in winter, and will be only too pleased to discuss the matter with the States if they so desire. TOMATO SAUCE SENT TO JAPAN .",14
9,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"A few days ago I asked the Prime Minister a question regarding a consignment of 3,000 dozen bottles of tomato sauce sent to Japan to feed the starving people there. Will the right honourable gentleman, if possible, ascertain how much, if any, of that sauce has gone into general consumption?",14
10,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I will endeavour to obtain the information, but it will not be easy to do so, as the distribution of the relief food-stuffs is controlled in Japan. COMMONWEALTH BANK. Is there Mr E . RILET - H as the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to the decline in the business of the Commonwealth Bank and the decrease of its profits? Is that result due to the policy of the Government?",14
11,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,The business of already . the Commonwealth Bank has not declined. Mr E . RILEY - H as the Treasurer examined last year's balanoe-«heet of the Commonwealth Bank and compared it with the balance-sheet of the previous year? Does he still say that there has been no fallin g off in the business of the Bank?,14
12,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"There has been a falling off in the profits, but not in the business of the Bank. NA ARBITRATION COURTS.",14
13,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL AND STATE,"I ask the Attorney General if there is any prospect of an early arrangement being made for the settlement of the differences between the State and Federal authorities So that the overlapping of Arbitration Courts may Be obviated ? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - Whatever differences exist arise out of the - Constitution itself; but, as the Prime Minister indicated yesterday, this matter will receive his attention at an early - date. SOLDIER SETTLERS.",14
14,Mr WATKINS,FEDERAL AND STATE,"Havin g regard to the fact that over 300 returned soldier settlers in New South Wales have had to leave their holdings, principally owing to the land having been over-valued, will the Prime Minister arrange to have the valuations reviewed so that some relief may be afforded these men, and the original intention of Parliament for their permanent settlement carried out?",15
15,Mr BRUCE,FEDERAL AND STATE,"The settlement of soldiers upon the land is primarily the concern of the States. The Commonwealth has, however, a very real interest in the settlements, for it finds the money for the States, and gives an interest rebate. It is also very much concerned in land settlement generally, and if at any time the States desire to discuss this matter with the Commonwealth we shall be only too pleased to meet tlieir representatives. I ask honourable members to remember, however, that soldier settlement is not primarily a responsibility of the Commonwealth, and therefore the Commonwealth cannot accept blame for any troubles that have arisen. HMAS. ADELAIDE.",15
16,Mr MARRS,FEDERAL AND STATE,"The reply of the Minister for Defence to a question I asked a few days ago regarding the crew and officers of HMAS. Adelaide was that practically the whole of the personnel were Australians. On the 2nd. April this paragraph appeared in the Sun newspaper :Fifty per cent, of the present crew of 'HMAS. Adelaide are Imperial men who have heen loaned to this Navy for periods of two or three years. Some of these ratings have turned over to the Australian Navy, others may do so, but the majority will complete their time and return home. Many Australians have tried for this trip and been turned down. Why not let Aussies go in preference to Englishmen? I ask the Minister for Defence whether there is any truth in that statement?",15
17,Mr BOWDEN,FEDERAL AND STATE,"There is not. I gave the definite instruction that Australians are to man the vessel on the current trip with the Royal Navy Special Service Squadron, and of 420 ratings on the Adelaide, 410 are Australians. Every application I have received from an Australian to be transferred to the Adelaide has been granted. SINKING OF HMAS. AUSTRALIA.",15
18,Mr MAHONY,FEDERAL AND STATE,"Will the Minister for Defence inform the House what was the reason for the delay that occurred between the adoption of the Washington Treaty, in December last, and the calling for tenders for the dismantling of the battle-ship Australia . As the time 11 allowed under the Treaty for the disposal of the vessel expired four months ago, will he take steps to see that the sinking of the vessel is postponed until the thousands of pounds' worth of very valuable material aboard has been taken out?",15
19,Mr BOWDEN,FEDERAL AND STATE,"The delay in calling for tenders was caused by the fact that the Department wished to take out of the vessel everything in ib that was of use. Some £30,000 worth of material was removed before tenders were called. The time allowed by the Washington Treaty for the final disposal of the vessel will not expire until l'Tth February, 1925. The terms of the Treaty were that she should be rendered unfit for warlike service by 17th February last, nnd should be finally disposed of within twelve months of that date. No good purpose can be served, however, by delaying the sinking, because everything that can be economically taken out has been removed by the Department. The vessel is merely occupying wharfage space unnecessarily, and is not an advertisement for Australia in her present condition. The sooner the sinking takes place, the better.",15
20,Mr MAHONY,FEDERAL AND STATE,"Will the Minister take steps to postpone the sinking of the vessel in order that public tenders may be called for its complete dismantling ? I have information from a leading shipbreaker in Australia that at least £50,000 worth of material will go down in the Yours. &c. Australia if she is sunk next week. TniED MYSELF. Mr BOWDEN - Tender s bave already been called, but none of the ship-breakers tendered.",15
21,Mr MAHONY,FEDERAL AND STATE,The tenders hedged round with difficulties.,16
22,Mr BOWDEN,FEDERAL AND STATE,"It was necessary to hedge them round with conditions. An y contract made would have to contain terms similar to those contained in the last contract. We desire to carry out the terms of the Washington Treaty as soon as possible, and no good purpose would be served by delaying the sinking. NA NA Mr O ' KEEPE - I have applied the Manager of the Commonwealth ShipGranville ping Line for certain information, and although a couple of weeks have elapsed the association is yet aware. I have not received a reply. Will the Minister ascertain, during the Easter cess, if there is any valid reason why management of the Commonwealth ShipDue ping Line should nob accept tenders for the provisioning of any of the ships the Line in a port where the prices proved to be more favourable than those offered in other ports? I am given understand that an offer was Hobart to supply fish at a price lower than was accepted in Sydney, and the only reason given by the Commonwealth not Shipping Line was that it was not concally sidered advisable to accept the Hobart offer.",16
23,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"There is no Minister controlling the management and conduct of the Commonwealth Shipping L in e ; that Line was completely handed over by this House to the Board which was apthe pointed under the Act. The provisionCharlton) ing - of ships and other detail arrangeand > ments are solely the responsibility of notice:the Board, and not the concern of a Minister. NA ASSOCIATION.",16
24,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,"Will the November, 1923 ? Prime Minister in for m the House whether an invitation has been received f r the Empire Parliamentary Association £1,000 for a delegation from Australia to visit the Old Country? If so. have any steps each been taken either to accept or decline such an invitation? were Mr Bruce - The Empire Parliamentary Association has a branch in each of the self-governing Dominions. I understand that no invitation has been received by the Australian branch. I know privately thab such an invitation is contemplated, and I have been asked - as o privately-to indicate whether I think that Australia will be prepared to accept such an invitation. I believe, Mr Speaker, that you are the President of the Australian branch of the Association, and possibly you could supply more reliable information than I .",16
25,Mr SPEAKER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,"Rt . Hon. W . A. W at t ) .

26,Mr MCGRATH,EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,Is it the intention to to apply to the Government to pay the made in expenses of the delegates?,16
27,Mr SPEAKER,EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,I regret that I am able to answer that ' question specifiat present. There is no immediate or pressing hurry ; and I shall search the records and inform the honourable member when the House resumes its sittings. AUSTRALIANMEAT COUNCIL.,16
28,Mr CHAPMAN,EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,"On 27th March, honourable member for Hunter (Mr . asked the Ministeifor Trade Customs the following questions upon 1. What are the names of the members of the Australian Meat Council, and what is the allowance paid to each member? 2. What are the duties performed, and when, was the Council established, and by whom? 3. What was the total expenditure incurred by the Council during the. year ended 8th 4. Did the Commonwealth Government o m advance £10,000 and the Commonwealth Bank t'o the Council during the year ended 8th November, 1923 ? 5. If not, what was the actual amount in case ? 6.

CAPTAI N HURLEY'S EXPLORATION IN NEW GUINEA. HEAD-HUNTING ALLEGATIONS.",16
29,Mr ATKINSON,EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,"On 27th March last the honourable member for Melbourne A. (Dr Maloney) asked the following question :Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories been called to a report that appeared in the London Oraphia of 8th December last, which contains account of Captain Hurley's recent exploration in New Guinea? The report reads"" The victims of a head-hunting raid, when taken alive, are placed in screened structures, which are so jealously regarded by them that few dare approach thera. In order that the unfortunate wretches can by no possibility escape unaided, their legs and arms are cruelly broken. The following morning, the victims are brought to slaughter, after which their bodies are cut up and seasoned with minced cocoanut, preparatory to being put into the pot for a cannibal feast. As has been said, the ' © a m n i o s' are not alone in this hideous custom. In war time, especially, it was (Chiel - widely, if not universally, practised on the island, and must s t ill be prevalent in those wild regions where the influence of civilization has not yet penetrated. The ' Sambios' are located 250 miles up theFly River in our Territory."" Will the Minister ask the Minister for Home and Territories to look into this matter, so that an early contradiction may be made if the statement be untrue? The Minister for Home and Territories Department has furnished the following reply :I have to inform you that the article was brought under the notice of the Lieutenant Governor of Papua, a copy of whoso radiographic reply is as follows:""Your radio re Hurley and alleged atrocities Fly Biver. Hurley has never been up Fly beyond junction witli Strickland. His statement almost certainly sheer invention. I have fairly good knowledge Fly Eiver: for 500 miles from, mouth, .but have never heard of practice mentioned. Official Secretary and Keppie Engineer agree. Keppie spent five montlis upper Fly 5.00 miles from mouth. Hurley did not visit any portion of Papua that was not already well known. Practice mentioned is alleged to have existed in northern division 25' years ago.. Hurley has probably heard, of this and in order to stimulate interest has. represented it as still in existence but changed' location to Fly as northern division too well known. Of course, it must be realized that Government cannot be responsible for anything that takes place beyond limits of Government control. Within Government's control head-hunting and other atrocities arc suppressed' generally without much difficulty. Government control has been rapidly extended, especially during last ten years. See Annual Reports."" SYDNEY QUARANTINE STATION.",17
30,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,EMPIRE PARLIAMENTARY,"The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Austin. Chapman), the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page), Dr Cumpston, and a number of officials some time ago visited the quarantine area at Manly with a view to considering its removal. Some decision has been expected, but I have not heard, anything about the matter since. Has any decision been arrived at? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I regret that I am not in the happy position of the honourable member, who says that he has not heard anything since the visit, because he has been most persistent in pressing this matter and has made certaiu suggestions into which I have had very caref u l inquiry made. I hope in the next two or three weeks to be in a position to give Mm a definite answer to the representations he has made. I recognise the importance of the matter, especially to a great city like Sydney. NA SOLDIERS. POWEKS OF COMMITTEE OF INVESTIGATION : FORMAL MOTION OF ADJOURNMENT.",18
31,Mr SPEAKER,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - I have received from the honourable member for Cook (Mr C. Riley) an intimation that he proposes today to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the failure of the Government to' give adequate powers to the Soldiers Committee, consisting of members of the House of Representatives, to enable that Committee to carry out its investigations."" Five honourable members having risen in their placesQuestion proposed. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [11.28.] - It is with a good deal of reluctance that I rise to move the adjournment of this House today. On the l'2fefi July last I brought under the notice of honourable members the treatment which had been meted out by the Repatriation Department to a number of returned soldiers. In the cases which. I brought forward pensions had been refused, the. reason given by the Department being that the disabilities from. which those returned men were suffering were pre-war disabilities. I , and the men concerned, held' a view different from that of the Department. Realizing that a great injustice was being done to those men, who had given up all to serve their country, I , as a comrade, brought their cases before the House to endeavour .to have justice done to them. I referred to the case of Mr Seary, who was discharged as medically unfit. His certificate indicated that he was wounded, and suffering from gunshot wounds on the left of the spine. He has been unable £o get any pension from the Repatriation Department since his return to Australia. I have visited his home, and have met his dear little wife and five young children, and I know of the severe trial through which they are passing. The wife is having great difficulty to make both, ends meet, and to keep a. shelter over, her husband and children. I had hoped that consideration would be given to, this case, but no pension has been granted. I also drew attention to the experience of three tubercular soldiers. The Repatriation Commission considered that these men - were not suffering from a war disability, although they were unquestionably tubercular. One tubercular patient at present in .the sanatorium at Bodington was recommended by the State Board for a pension, but the recommendation was rejected by the Repatriation Commission. I have waited patiently for nine months for something to be done for these men I had hoped that the Treasurer, who was associated with the Australian Imperial Force, would give them some consideration. Another case to which I referred last year concerns a man named Veitch. He was supposed to be suffering from a syphilitic throat. Later on it was discovered that the real trouble was ulcerated tonsils. A certificate in his case was given by the officer in charge of the Pathological Laboratory at Bulford Hospital. It is dated 2Sth February, 1918, and readsThis soldier has been suffering from rent attacks of ulcerative tonsilibis for the past twelve months. His blood has been tested 'by Wassermann reaction three .times at this hospital since 10th November, 1917, and time the reaction has been a clear negative; and I am of opinion that the condition of 'the throat is not due to specific disease, viz., possession. syphilis. I had hoped that justice would be done to this man, but no action has been taken. His experience was a very sad one. He was subjected to the greatest torture, beto live :a month. cause not only of the way in which military authorities handled his case, but of his wife and children? rtlso of the attitude towards him of own people, when they learned of what he was supposed to be suffering f r o did not introduce this subject last year moved by what he saw. to gain any party advantage, but f r o keen sense of duty to my comrades; some of whom lie dead on the other side the world, and others of whom are still living, but are really dying on their feet. I thought that the returned soldiers are members of this Parliament would insist on justice being these unfortunate men. The case of a them to combat tuberculosis? man who is dying from cancer was perience brought under my notice a few hours ago. The Repatriation Commission said that his trouble was not due to war service, and was not a war disability. But what are the facts? Immediately that entered the military camp he was inocuMany lated, and for a fortnight afterwards right arm was paralyzed. He had trouble all through his period of active service, and since his return to Australia cancer has developed in the right shoulder. He has only a short time to live. The gentleman who brought his case under my notice devoted the whole of lus time during the war years to Red Cross work. He said to me, "" I am not so much concerned about the poor man, for he has nearly gone, as I am concerned about his wife and children."" Surely it is quite reasonable to believe that that man's disability was caused by the paralysis in his arm. He had no trouble u n t i l his inoculation. Since then he has not been free from trouble. I regret to say that I believe that the Repatriation Commission and the State Boards which administer the Repatriation regulations are absolutely unsympathetic. I do not say that in anger, but because I am forced to say it on account of the treatment that has been given to numerous cases which have come under my notice. I have seen recurthe medical history sheet of the cancer case to which I have referred. I hope to have copies of many of these medical hiseach tory sheets before long, though the Department say that they are not in their This sheet shows distinctly that this man's arm was paralyzed for a fortnight after his inoculation, and that he had trouble with it all the time he was in the Australian Imperial Porce. Now he is at death's door. He is not likely But no pension has the been granted to him. What will become The right his honourable the Prime Minister told us the other day that he had visited the graves m . I at Gallipoli, and that he was deeply I would be m a much more interested to hear from the right honourable gentleman that he and of his Government and supporters intend to-show a little more respect for the soldiers who are still living, but who are, who as I have already said, dying on their feet. Do honourable members suggest done to that the war service of our men helped The exthat some of us had with the Australian Imperial Force leads us to say, without hesitation, that so far fro m making men immune from tubercular trouble, the exposures to which they were subman jected actually caused the complaint. thousands of our soldiers were unhis necessarily exposed to danger and disease through the bungling of military officers, and that exposure may have resulted in tubercular trouble twelve months or even two years after their return to Australia. 1 must complain of the manner in which the Government has neglected to carry out its promises. Neither the Treasurer nor the Government has shown, real earnestness in investigating the cases which have been submitted for consideration. A f t e r I brought this matter forward nine months ago, Dr Earle Page said in this House: I have gone personally into each of the cases, ancl I have made the suggestion that a sub-committee consisting of soldier members of the House, one from each of the three parties, be appointed to make the necessary inquiries. IE the suggestion is adopted we shall feel assured that the men will receive just and sympathetic treatmeut. What consideration have they received, and what sympathetic treatment has been meted out to them ? I wa3 astonished to hear a few days ago from the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), that though the Committee was appointed it did not meet until three weeks prior to the re-assemblihg of this House. months were permitted to pass without a move being made, and in that time these men and their wives were at their wit's end to know how to provide for themselves and their families. This should have been treated as an urgent matter. 1 suppose that when Parliament meets after the Easter adjournment we shall be asked to consider the defence proposals of the Government. How can the Government expect us to support its defence proposals while men who defended us in the last great war are so unjustly and unfairly treated? What encouragement is there for us to support defence proposals when we know their experiences ? It was a great war ! The more I learn about it the more convinced I am that it was a great war for certain people to make huge profits. I speak on this matter with iutense feeling. On 10th .August last the Treasurer said I do not think wo are justified in discussing such cases on the floor of the House. I was prepared then to accept his assurance that these men would be given sympathetic treatment. I really something would be done when the Committee of ex-soldier members was appointed, and I confess to great prise at hearing what was told me by the honourable member for Ballarat' Mr 0. Biley. thought that in the recess from which we have just returned the Committee would give consideration to the cases which had been discussed, and to other cases which would be brought before it . But no earnestness has been displayed,. This matter demands an early statement from the Treasurer. So far as I can see we have little to hope for from the Committee as it is constituted. I believe that we would be justified in asking for the appointment of a Select Committee, or even a Royal Commission, to investigate these and similar cases. I am not favourable to the appointment of Royal Commissions, as a general rule, because I think that the Government should shoulder its full responsibility; but when it ' fails in that a Royal Commission may be able to do something to remedy things.",18
32,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.42] - I listened carefully to the honourable member for Cook (Mr C. Riley) to see whether he would offer any j>ractical suggestion about the powers of the Committee of ex-soldiers or about the way in which its powers should be alNine tered. I shall remind honourable members of the suggestion that I made last year, and of the exact functions of this Committee. It was appointed not to take responsibility from the Repatriation Commission, but to try to prevent the medical ' history of certain returned men from being discussed in this House, and put on permanent record in Hansard. It was felt that the discussion of some of these cases placed an unnecessary slur and stigma upon men who had fought for Australia. The intention of the Government was not that this Committee should have executive powers, but that it should investigate such cases as were brought before us last year. I , personally, would have a distinct objection to my medical history being recorded in Hansard. My private ailments concern no one except myself and my doctor. It is necessary for a Committee to function in the way I suggested, and we expected that this Committee would do so; but I hear that that has not been attempted. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr H u r r y ) , and the honthought orable member for Richmond (Mr . R. Green), met in the first place, and examined certain of the files. surSubsequently, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) joined them. I The whole discussion centred round the powers of the Committee, and not specific cases. Let me give some typical instances of what is to be found in the medical files. The case has been brought up in this House by the honourable member for Cook (Mr C. Riley)- I shall not give the name, but am prepared to show the honourable member the file-of a man who has paralysis, and is unable to walk. His condition is due to excessive indulgence in alcoholic liquor, but the fact that he fought for his country, and that the medical advisers to the Commission consider that his case is not one for a pension, is no reason why his particular ailment should be placed on permanent record in this House. Even in a Court of law I would object to the medical details of a case being exposed, and members of this House should use some discretion regarding these matters. Committee was appointed to enable that discretion to be exercised. Another case referred to by the honourable member is that of a man who before the war contracted syphilis, and during the war developed tertiary symptoms. Symptoms of syphilis usually come on for two or three months, at least six weeks after infection, and then practically all traces of the disease disappear for a period of eight or ten months. The person affected may then for two or three years have secondary symptoms, which respond readily to treatment. In ten years time he may develop tertiary symptoms, which consist of huge ulcerations, or paralytic conditions.",20
33,Mr BLAKELEY,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,A man like that should have been tested before he was accepted for active service.,21
34,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Plent y of good soldiers have had syphilis. orable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse), will agree that many soldiers affected with syphilis did their work well, and there is no reason why the whole world should know their condition. One of the cases brought up in this House, - and to this I as a doctor object-wa s that of a man who had contracted syphilis before joining the Australian Imperial Force.",21
35,Mr MAHONY,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,Why was he accepted ?,21
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"He was a good fighter. While in Egypt he developed tertiary symptoms in his throat, and was sent to the hospital and marked "" V . D . "" ' Because of that, his pay was withheld, in accordance with the Army practice. W it h in two or three montlis the authorities ascertained that he had not contracted syphilis on active service, and he was then paid for the whole period of his absence from duty, in the same way as he would have been had he been frostbitten. I know of a case in Sydney where a man is suffering from serious joint conditions due to gonorrhoea. His case has been investigated by the Advisory Committee, and on the representations of members of Parliament and others, the man has been examined time after tune. At the first meeting of the Committee, Colonel Hurry, and Mr R. Green, went into some of the files to see if the cases were such that they should be brought up for discussion in Parliament. No one will say that the Committee, and its medical advisers, should be the author i ty to decide whether pensions shall be The granted or not; I submit that their real function is to examine the files. If we are not satisfied with the Committee we should alter its personnel, and if we object to the conditions laid down by the Repatriation Act with respect to pre-war disabilities, w& should amend the Act ; but we should not divulge in this House intimate medical in formation about returned men. As a medical man aud a returned soldier, I strongly"" protest against themere fact of a man having been a member of the Australian Imperial Force being considered a suflicient warrant for the most intimate details concerning him being broadcast throughout the country, and placed wliere his children and grand-children in years to come may read of the one slip he made.

38,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"They can if they so desire. Later in the session an oppor1 tunity will be' given for the discussion of the law and its administration. Although the Committee has important functions to fulfil in saying whether the details of cases are such that they should be mentioned in this House or not. I admit that this is the proper place lo bring cases forward, so long as intimate details concerning individuals are not divulged.",21
39,Mr MCGRATH,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Ballarat) [11.65]. --Althoug h I was appointed a member of the Committee referred to, I received no notification of my appointment from cither the Treasurer or the Repatriation Department until five months had expired. I then received a letter from Colonel Semmens intimating that the Committee would be called together. I resented Colonel Semmens being in any way connected with the Committee, because we were inquiring into some of his decisions. I consider also that the Committee should have met at Parliament House, and nob at the Repatriation offices. When I first met my two fellow members on the Committee, the)- had already gone through two files, ancl they asked me if I desired to examine tliem. I inquired what authority we had. They said, "" We have nothing."" No authority had been received from the Treasurer, but we were informed by the officer-in-charge that we were to go through the files, after which we could inform some member of Parliament whether the cases, were such that they should be brought up in Parliament. I said that if I was a member of Parliament I would resent any other member telling ine what cases I should bripg up in the House. I claim that if the Committee is to serve any useful purpose it should have authority to examine the men themselves. can be made to prove anything. I recollect one case in which an officer said a man had been examined by an outside expert, who confirmed the opinion of the military doctors, but it was afterwards found that the expert had examinedthe soldier in the presence of one of the military doctors. That is an instance of unfair influence being used. A Royal Commission or a Select Committee should be appointed to deal with this matter and to examine the actions of the Repatriation Department and the administration of the laws relating to venereal diseases. It ill-becomes the Treasurer, or any man who Has been in the Australian Imperial Force, to cast any stigma on a soldier because he has contracted venereal disease.  do so,",22
40,Mr MCGRATH,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Certain men have been denied pensions. It is time there was some plain speaking. In London, I have sat day after day watching the drafts coming in from France, and I have heard the doctors say,, "" Now boys, yon. are going to have a good time, but be very careful. The safest thing is not. to go with any woman at all, but if you feel that you must, there are french letters six a Is. over the way, and 'dreadnoughts' for a bob. If you should get anything, come down to the red light tomorrow morning."" We all know that these things took place, yet we see these men who fell victims denied their pay, and entries in red made in their pay-books, so that they are unable to show these in Australia. It is hypocrisy. One man, after having been in the 39th General Hospital three times came out worse than he went in, and was then ordered, up the line in that condition. It is time we had some consideration for these men. It is cruel for the Department to take the stand that because they contracted a venereal disease they must be denied pension benefits.",22
41,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,They were exposed to temptation.,22
42,Mr MCGRATH,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"That is quite true. Many who went to Egypt in the First and Second Divisions were only boys, who could have had no knowledge of what was before them. Those lads, who had never before been subjected to temptation, found themselves surrounded by vice in Piles its most deadly form. Is it any wonder that so many of them fell victims, and so that many died from this filthy disease?",22
43,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,And yet the percentage of deathswas less than in the civil community.,22
44,Mr MCGRATH,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"That may be the official view. At all events the death rate was very high. A search of the records in Great Britain will show that the position was most alarming. I say, therefore, that those lads, of the First and Second Divisions particularly, deserve every, sympathy. I regret exceedingly that we have to mention these matters. When I hear people talking about the possibility of another war I wish to God they could realise some of the brutalities of the last. They would not then be so anxious to send Australia's sons to take part in another The cases mentioned by the honourable member for Cook show the necessity for an amendment of the Act to make provision for the extreme cases. We should also have the fullest inquiry into the operation of the Repatriation Department. I believe that Colonel Semmens is a most unsympathetic administrator, and that he is backed up by an unsympathetic Treasurer. Since the present Treasurer has been in office every case that I have submitted to him has been returned with the same old story, "" The Board considers the disability is not due to war service."" Mr C. RILEY - What would the honourable member say when a State Board recommends a pension for the soldier and is turned down by the Federal Board ?",22
45,Mr MCGRATH,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"I believe that is possible. I have never heard of one case in which the present Treasurer has reversed the decision of the Board. As a matter of fact, of lute he has scarcely been in Victoria long enough to give an answer to a communication within a reasonable time. Soldiers applying for the living allowance have been kept for weeks waiting for a reply, to learn then that the request has been refused. I have in mind the case of one soldier who lost an arm, and has four or five children to support. As it is impossible for him to get work, applied for an advance of £100 to start him in business. His application was refused. Then he applied for the'living allowance, and weeks, even, months, elapsed before he received a reply in the negative. Among ray constituents I do not know of a single case of a soldier having had his application for a living allowance granted. Similar experiences are reported in connection with the administration of the War Service Homes Department. I know of one soldier who had paid £200 off his home. On 1st January he paid the sum of £ 5 , and on the 20th of that month be received notification that because he was £20 in arrears the Department could receive no more money from him, and that ho had to give up possession within five days. That letter was signed by Colonel Semmens. I took his case up, and wrote to the Department. After waiting five clays for a reply I telephoned to nel Semmens, who practically informed me that I was a liar, and that no such action had been contemplated against the soldier referred to. This, notwithstanding that I had in my hand the letter over his signature. Subsequently the Departties ment wrote to this soldier apologizing, withdrawing the notice of eviction. The excuse which Colonel Semmens gave was that he had no knowledge of the letter, and that the officer who had signed it was no longer in the Department. It was a pretty thin excuse. Much the same thing is occurring in connection with the reduction of pensions. Mr C. RILEY - The Board made a mistake in Goodwin's case.",23
46,Mr MCGRATH,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Goodwin' s solicitor threatened legal aotion, and obtained satisfaction for his client. All along the line there appears to be a move to reduce pensions. The practice of paying a man two-thirds pension because of two-thirds incapacity is cruel, for the simple reason that to a private employer such a man is totally incapacitated. We want a further inquiry into these niatters because of a suspicion that is growing up in the public mind that certain high officials are in receipt of very big pensions. We want to know whether captains, colonels, majors, brigadier-generals and generals are having their pensions reduced. I heartily support the motion submitted by the honourable member for Cook. I hope that the Treasurer will agree to the appointment of an inhe dependent Committee with full power to inquire into the many grievances that have been reported, and make a recommendation to the Government. I do not want a Committee constituted in the same manner as the Committee already appointed, with no power to do anything. We received no instructions, and had no definition of our authority. As a matter of fact, we were practically told that we were expected to echo the views of Colonel Semmens and the other administrative officers of the Department. I , for one, refuse to carry on under those conditions, and I am now hoping that, in justice to our returned soldiers, about whose deeds we are everlastingly talking, the House will insist upon the appointment of an impartial investigation committee with the power to examine all essential witnesses, and make a recommendation to Colothe Government for the rectification of the many injustices that are existing today.",23
47,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Lang) [12.7]. - Wit h a ful l appreciation of the difficulconfronting those responsible for the and administration, of the Repatriation Department, I think there is room for great improvement in existing methods. I am not prepared to go so far as some honourable members, who say that the Pensions Board administers Ihe Act unsympathetically; because members cannot have cognisance of all the circumstances, and have not available to them the evidence upon which to base a sound judgment. I must confess, however, that in respect of many cases that have come under my notice, I am at a loss to understand the reasons for the Board's decisions. They seem to indicate a lack of sympathy. Whether or not this is due to the administration of the officials of the Department not in a position to say; nor can any one without a thorough knowledge of the whole of the facts in relation to each case. But it seems to me that something requires to be done. Either the Board should be given wider discretionary power, or the Act should be amended to meet certain difficulties which have arisen, if one may judge from the number of complaints continually being received by honourable members. I have in mind one case that came before me quite recently, that of a father who had been largely dependent upon a deceased soldier son. After the death of his son this man managed to eke out a living until his physical became, so impaired that he was no longer able to do so. His application for his deceased son's pension was refused by the Board on the ground that it was not apparent that he had been entirely dependent on his son for his subsistence, and that he had adequate means of support. I questioned the man very closely as to his means, and was informed that all he had in the world was £6. If these facts were before the Board, then all I can say is that the decision in his case was in the last degree cruel and ridiculous. I am under the disadvantage of presenting an ex parte statement. I have not corroboration of this man's statement, but having known him for a number of years I am convinced that he is thoroughly reliable and upright. I have reason to doubt him, so I can only come to the conclusion that the Department's treatment of this application was unsympathetic. As his is only one of many similar cases, it would appear that there is something wrong somewhere. Sir Elliot Johnson. The case which I have mentioned has gone back to the Board for reconsideration. There are also complaints about undue delay in answering correspondence, and in reaching finality concerning applications which come before the Board. This may not be entirely the fault of the Board, because we must remember that an immense number of cases come before that body for review, and naturally some must take precedence over others. But the fact that there are so many complaints, and that so many cases had to be investigated, suggests that something should be done either to insure more sympathetic consideration or amend the I am Act. This matter ought to be looked into by the Minister. I am not prepared to say where the blame lies, but certainly there is a very great deal of dissatisfaction in connection with the administration of the Act.",23
48,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Reid) [12.13] - It is just as distasteful to me as it musb be to the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to be obliged to speak in this House upon injustices that have arisen in connection with war pensions administration by the Repatriation Department. But I remind the Treasurer that even in the cases to the ventilation of which in this Chamber he has taken exception, invariably condition the soldiers concerned have given honourable members authority to mention them with the view to inducing the Treasurer to intervene and insure a more liberal interpretation of the Act by the responsible administrative officers. A good deal of time would be saved and discussion avoided if the Treasurer would agree to the very sensible proposal, which is supported by all sides of the House, for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into these cases and ascertain whether an amendment of the Repatriation and War Pensions Acts is desirable. Such an investigation would do much to silence criticism, some of which, perhaps, is unfair. It would also save the time of this House, and enable us to get on with other very urgent public business. I am at a loss to understand why the Treano surer objects to this reasonable proposal. There is ample ability in this House to give.eifect to it. The honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse), with his medical experience, would be invaluableto the Committee in dealing with these matters. I do not want to bring up now a dozen or more cases which have come under my notice. realise it would be useless, because the cases would be referred to the Commission, ancl no action would be taken. I would merely get the stereotyped reply which has been sent in regard to cases submitted previously. In the heat of debate the other day 1 attacked the Repatriation Commission. I have no desire to modify materially the criticism I offered, bub I do recognise that doubtless in many of the adverse decisions given by the Repatriation Commission, the fault is due, not so much to the Commission as to the fact thab the Repatriation Act does not give the Commission a sufficiently wide discretionary power tc enable it to be more liberal. If thab is so a Select Committee would very quickly find it out, and that is an additional reason why the Government should* amend the Act, ancl thus pub an end to the perpetual discussion, not only in this House, but in the press all over Australia, discrediting the Government, and doing more than anything else to belie patriotic declarations. This is party, but a national matter. Honourable members on both sides have had brought under their notice cases - of rank injustice due to the action of the Commission. Their silence today indicates their view of the uselessness of bringing up particular cases in this House. Outside the precincts of this Chamber not one but dozens bave discussed with me, and with other honourable members, cases of injustice, and, in some instances, cases of what appears to be absolute cruelty. The whole operation, of the Act requires careful investigation. At present the assessment of the incapacity of a returned soldier is first of all dealt with by a medical man. That is quite proper; but, unfortunately, the doctor's decision varies according as he is a generous or a hard-hearted individual. I have known one man to receive a pension because the medical man examining him took a generous View of his case, and admitted that his disability was attributable to his war service. The Treasurer must agree that there is a great deal of conjecture and theory in the determination as to whether a returned soldier's disability is attributable to war service.",24
49,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Before rejection, all doubtful cases are examined by a medical committee, which investigates I them as closely as it can.",25
50,Mr COLEMA N,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"The method at present adopted is capricious and unsatisfactory, for the reasons 1I have stated. Consciously or unconsciously the Repatriation Advisory Board is usually swayed by the etiquette of medical trade unionism to confirm the decision of the medical man who first examines a case.",25
51,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,That is unfair.,25
52,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"The fact that the Advisory Board deals w ith a soldier's 7 1 pension case in his absence, and that, in consequence^ the applicant is giveu noopportunity to put his side, the determination being arrived at on written documents, is very unsatisfactory. No appeal is permitted, as in arbitration cases, to an applicant or his advocate. The matter is dealt with in a veritable star chamber composed of medical officers. I do not wish to attack the medical men. On the facts before them, perhaps, their determinations are quite honest; bub the method adopted is unfair, and is inconsistent with the judicial procedure of not a this country. Theright of a returned soldier applicant for a pension to appear in person, or through an advocate, before the tribunal deciding his case, in order that he may know whether any influences are used against him, should be conceded. The suspicion against the Repatriation Department is due largely to the fact that the returned soldier has no participation in the investigation deciding his claim to a pension. I know that the Treasurer wil l reply that the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League is represented on the Commission, but honourable members generally wil l agree with me, that the way in which positions on the Repatriation Commission have recently been juggled, is very unsatisfactory. Mr. Teece, who was formerly a Returned Soldiers' League nominee, proved, on the Commission, such a staunch advocate of the Government's interests, that the League subsequently refused to nominate him, and then, strangely enough, the Government placed him on the Commission.",25
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,Mr Teece was nominated on the last occasion by three separate returned soldiers' organizations.,25
54,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"I am surprised to hear it , and I should like to know the names of the organizations, and what in fluence they exercise in connection with cases dealt with by the Commission. Certain organizations purporting to represent the returned soldiers really represent few "" brass hats,"" a privileged few have the ear of the Government because they support the Government's policy.",25

I have referred desire is that to Mr Teece, because of the fact although he was formerly a nominee of the Returned Soldiers League he was not renominated by the League, and yet the Government thought fit to put him on the Board.",26
59,Dr EARLE PAGE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"I am disclosing no Cabinet secret when I tell the. honourable member that the reason why Mr Teece was appointed in addition to Mr Tindale was because of his nomination by various soldiers' organizations, and in order that the soldiers might have two nominees the Board.",26
60,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"I should like get a vote on the matter before the House, and I know that there are other speakers to follow me. I will, therefore, sion in each particular case. conclude by saying that I have a dozen cases here which time w i ll not permit me to submit. I object to having to be arrived at? submit them here, and I object to having to write to the Repatriation Commisany sion again. I say that in the interests of vided for. the returned soldiers a Select Committee of this House, or a Royal Commiswere sion, should be appointed for the purpose of thoroughly investigating all these cases, and, let us hope, bringing about a better and more sympathetic administration, thus silencing for all time the adverse criticisms which are being directed against the Department. Sir GRANVIL LE RYRIE (Warringah) [12.25] - I compliment the honourable a member for Cook (Mr C.

No one will doubt that sympathies are with the soldiers are who came back from the war maimed, or broken down in health. I can discuss this matter sympathetically I am not so much concerned about Advisory Committee has the done, why it was constituted, or the powers with which it is invested.

No honourable member will contend that pensions should be granted to all who apply for them. There must be some method of deciding who should receive pensions. .

65,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,The honourable gentleman will admit that there - are eases of hardship.,27
66,Sir GRANVILERYRIE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"I admit that there are some apparently very hard cases. I have myself written strongly to the Department in connection with several cases. But on the general principle I say there is only one method which can be adopted to arrive at a fair decision in these cases, and that is the examination of applicants for pensions by a competent Board consisting of medical men whose integrity is beyond question, and whose reputation is high in their profession. We must admit that many men who were at the war, and who on their return re-entered civil life, now suffer from disabilities that werenot attri-f butable to the war. If 300,000 men were sworn in ready to go to the war, and something happened which prevented them going, of that number there would today be thousands suffering from some disability or disease that was not apparent at the time they enlisted. Although they never went to the war they might have become disabled, be crippled with rheumatism, or suffer from tuberculosis or other diseases not attributable to war service. There musb be many returned meu whose present disability is not attributable to their war service. It is, I admit, a most difficult thing for any Board to decide who is legitimately entitled to a war pension, and the amount of the pension which he should receive. Can honourable members opposite devise any better means of arriving at what pensions should be given in these cases bhan the decision of a properly constituted Medical Board ? I am prepared to.assist in the passing of auy amendments of the Act which will relieve the hardships that I know to exist. I shall be agreeable also to any alteration in the constitution of the Repatriation Department if it is considered that the present administration is unsympathetic. But I differ from those honourable members who have said that the Chairman of the Commission is not sympathetic with the returned soldiers. I have known Colonel Semmens for a long time, and he is a3 suitable a person as could be obtained for the position he holds. members must recollect that his powers are defined by the Act, and no matter what his sympathies may be, he must administer the law. But I cannot see that any better method of dealing with these [17] claims can be adopted. Honourable members are wrong in saying that the Treasurer is callous. He is a returned soldier, and I believe his sympathies are with the incapacitated men; but it is impossible to accede to all the requests of honourable members, and the demands of all sorts of associations which claim that their members are being treated harshly. No practical suggestion for an improvement has come from the Opposition other than an inquiry by a Select .Committee or a Royal Commission. My observation of Royal Commissions is that they draw fees for a few months, and bring in a report which does not lead to any practical result. The inquiry is generally a waste of time and 7 money.",27
67,Mr CUNNINGHAM,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Does not the honourable member think that a man's own medical officer, who knows the history of the case, is most fitted to determine the extent of incapacity ?",27
68,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"The man's own medical officer may be more sympathetic with the applicant than he should be. I cannot see that he would be better able to determine the extent of the man's disability than would a Board of competent medical men. This matter should be discussed dispassionately, and I object to the attacks upon the Repatriation Department, because I know that the officers are doing for the soldiers all that lies in their power. Colonel Teece was one of my officers at the Front, and I cannot imagine that either he or Colonel Semmens would think that he had anything to gain by treating these cases unsympathetically. It would be more in accord with their natures, and much easier for them, to grant everything that was asked. But they must honestly administer the Act as they find it .",27
69,Mr LAZZARINI,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"Werriwa) [12.35] I differ from the Treasurer in regard to his definition of the functions of the Parliamentary Committee. I remember the adjournment of the - House being moved on a former occasion by the honourable member for Cook (Mr C. Riley), to allow of the discussion of pensions administration, and the general impression of honourable members was that the parHonorable liamentary Committee then promised would endeavour to get more sympathetic treatment for many men to whom pensions had been refused, or whose pensions had been reduced. The Act also was amended, and we were assured that special consideration would be given to a number of men whose applications for pensions had been refused. But the administration seems to be more unsympathetic than it was before. Apparently the policy of the Government is to build up a surplus, and in pursuance of its cheese-paring policy it will dock a shilling from anybody so long as it can reduce expenditure. I have had under notice the .case of Kenneth MCKenzie, No. 449S, of the 18th Battalion, who was discharged in August, 1919, He is a married man, and was granted in July, 1922, a pension of 10s. 6d. per week which was later increased to £2 2s. per week because his incapacity had become more serious. Since his discharge he has 'returned to hospital three times; on the last occasion from February, 1923, to September of that year. His pension is now reduced to 10s. 6d. per week. This man endeavoured to repatriate himiself. He selected .a farm, but while at work she would, without a moment's warning, .collapse in a fit and remain in the field in a comatose state all night, and be found by his wife next morning. For days after these attacks he is completely irresponsible, and is then incapacitated for a couple of weeks. He has had to abandon his farm :and is now without a means .of living. For a time his wife received a pension, but that has been taken away. This man, who is unable to .work, has to keep his wife and himself, and his incapacity is assessed by the Department at only 10s. 6d. a week. While on active service he was wounded in the neck, gassed, and suffered from trench fever. Except for the periods of - convalescence he remained with, his unit until hostilities ceased. I brought his case under the notice of the Repatriation Department through the Treasurer, and this is the answer I received: Mr IMCKenzie's oase has been very carefully considered by the - Commission, but in view .of the medical evidence it is considered that he is receiving a pension commensurate with - 'his wav disabilities. Consequently, is regretted that .an increase cannot be appEoved - have accepted a position upon it . The That man's condition is such bhat it is dangerous for him .to leave his home, bnt I iave tried in vain to have his claim adjusted through the ordinary channels. I cannot help contrasting the eloquence of honourable members opposite when they are discussing preparations for another war, with their calm and callous contTr. Lazzarini. sideration of the distress"" of the victims of the last war, the cheese-paring policy adopted by the Government, and tthe parsimonious calculation of whether a onan shall be paid a few shillings more or less per week. The Treasurer stated .that he objects strongly to a man's medical history being made public. So .do I , and I object still more to the callous policy of the Repatriation Department, which compels the representatives of these unfortunate men to disclose in Parliament their medical nistory in the endeavour to get justice for them. Does the Treasurer think that we ventilate these cases for the pleasure of so doing?",27

There are some issues too contemptible to be raised for party purposes, but the honoraible member for Parkes is. not one to realise that. I did not go about the country urging men to go to the war, but in common with other members on this side of the House, I am determined to see that justice is done to those .who suffer disabilities as a result of the war. I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr MCGRATH) that a searching inquiry be made by a Select Committee or Royal - Commission.

The latter 'fre^ quently have a 'better knowledge of the merits of a ease 'than is - possessed (foy - the <doctors - representing Jbhe (Department. I ;have been supplied this 'morning >by - the'SBcretar.y - of'tihe Returned Sailors and Jj/eague of Australia with particulars tbf va tease'which 'is typical of thou; rof 'others in Australia. A cer bail} was - wounded in France, losing ihis eye -'and 'receiving other - wounds. He - able was returned to Australia, and dis- 'charged. 'Last 'year 'he developed - acute t -'nephrifis'and-'dropsy, 'and was'for several 'months a patient in the Hofbart 'Public ffospifcal. »He is 'still an invalid and ""festally ""unable to work, while his total pension 'for himself, wife, and child is £2 3s. per - week. 'His application a higher - pension 'has 'been rejected on the prouna that the nephritis .and .dedropsy-are-not due to war service. Two Hobart doctors-Drs . Ratten and Gaha""who have attended this man, state that diseases .are .due to 'his war :ser.vice. t Ho He'has. appealed against the rejection .of 'his application, and his appeal is .at ^preI sent with the Commission. Those two doctors, who had him under personal oba seivvation .and are .acqiuainted .with Tthe whole of the circumstances surrounding .the trouble, have deliberately stated that i is disability is due .to war service. On the other hand., the .doctor representing .Rethe .Repatriation Department says that disability is mot due to war service. ""The .honourable member for' Wamngah .(Sir Granville Ryrie) last night treated ua to .a yery eloquent discourse, in which he .contended that - every man .should ;be to .rash to :fight for ;his country the quarrel were just or unjust. This morning, .however, .he has asked us to give .him some reasonable - suggestions He has iclaimed to ihe as sympathetic .as any latihonorable member towards returned soldiers »who iare suffering 'from disabilities. A.t tthe 'same time, his speech led me to - notbelieve itha>t -.he is 'inclined - to take sides ithe Department against the thousands, of soldiers who are not getting the - treatment to Tvliich they are entitled, bej i cause the doctors representing the Department state .that their disabilities are not due .to .war service. The .honourable membeen .ber for Reid (Mr Goleman) .made what that I consider to be a practical suggestion, in urging that a Select Committee of bhis House be appointed to evidence in the capital city of each State. That Committee would be furnished witl i particulars of hundreds of cases of men who are being denied what they ought to receive from the Repatriation Department, because of the difference of opinion that exists between the two sets of doctors. It would not be necessary to go beyond the capital cities, because in them .most of the big hospitals are situated. The evidence could be completed before the end of this session, and I believe the Committee's report would be of very great service, not only to the soldiers, but to the Government. I think that the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) should accept the suggestion, and empower a Select Committee to take evidence i u all the capital cities, and bring up its report before the termination of the present session of Parliament. Then, peTnap3, we' would be able to devise some means for giving justice in ft number of very hard cases. It is admitted that a number of imposters have tried to get more than they are entitled to receive. We should judge the matter, not on those cases, but on the thousands of cases of men who are not getting what they are entitled to get from the Repatriation Department. MT . JACKSON (Bass) [12.66] - The honourable member for Denison (Mr . O'Keefe) said thab we should judge this matter in the light of a few cases of attempted imposition. I quite agree with him, but it seems to me that some honourable members this morning have been inclined to judge the efforts of the Department by the few isolated cases that bave been quoted. am not opposed to the holding of a public inquiry, but it must be remembered that something like 330,000 pensions are now in existence-including , of course, those paid to dependants-and in the light, of that fact I do not think can be said that the Department is as heartless as has been tended. I shall quote an isolated case that occurred in the city to which I belong, as an illustration of what has probably happened throughout Australia. I doubt if there were, many men of finer physique who left Australia than this one to whom I refer. On his return to Australia he was given a clean bill of health, yet within six months he was stricken with paralysis. A f t e r having investigated his case the Department said that his family had suffered from venereal disease, and that his was a hereditary complaint not aggratake vated by war service. That case, I believe, the Government will take ivp in the near future. This man was accepted for war service. I doubt very much whether he was asked if any member of his family had suffered from venereal disease. The Government, therefore, would do well to give his and similar cases a little further consideration. I do not agree with honable members of the Opposition who say that no sympathy ""is to be expected from the Repatriation Commission. I have had cases turned down; but I do not lay a charge of unsympathetic treatment because of that fact. When the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) went to Launceston two or three years ago he was approached by a returned soldier who had lost his right arm, and had three fingers missing from his left hand. He pointed out that his pension was ridiculously small. Mr Hughes said to him, "" Y o u n g man, there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repenteth than over the ninety and nine just men,"" meaning, of course, that his was an isolated case. Mr . Hughes took that case up in conjunction with myself, and we succeeded in getting the man an additional sum by way of pension.",29
74,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,Did not the fact that he had to approach the honourable member and the ex-Prime Minister show that not there was need for an alteration of the administration ?,30
75,Mr JACKSON,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"That was an isolated case. I quite agree with the reference of the honourable member for Denison to the few imposters. They are to be found in I every walk of life, and one naturally expects to find instances in the ranks of the returned soldiers. I suggested to the Department some time ago that there should be an interchange of doctors between the States to enable these cases to be properly it gone into. But the doctors would also be examining men who now have reached the con- full capacity to work, and are enjoying good health, many of whom are still in receipt of jjensions. W it h the honourable member for Warringah I feel that we must consider the taxpayer. Our liability for pensions now amounts to £7,000,000 per annum. Even flicfiigh it were found necessary to increase the sum to £10,000.000, I should be quite prepared to bear my share of the burden ",30
76,Mr COLEMAN,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,Inquiries by a Select Committee may result in deductions being made in certain pensions.,30
77,Mr JACKSON,DISABILITIES OF RETURNED,"I should like to see some Committee appointed; but I do not think it would be a good thing to have a .Select Committee of honourable members of this Houso, been use I am of the opinion that if it started its investigations in Melbourne, many months would elapse before it would be able to get away, as a large number of soldiers would consider that there was a possibility of increasing their pensions, and would apply to have their cases heard. I doubt whether the investigation in each State could be concluded in less than from three to six months. I hope, however, that the Government will take some action, particularly in the case of venereal disease. A great deal could be done in that direction, and much hardship be relieved.

SINGAPOR EBASE . NA CONFERENCE.",31
80,Mr BRUCE,CONSIDERATION AT WASHINGTON,"On Tuesday last, in this House, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) directed my attention to certain remarks stated to have beeu made by my colleague, Senator Pearce, in connection with the Singapore Base in relation to the Washington Conference, and he asked me to ascertain the reason why Senator Pearce did not in clude in his report on the Washington Disarmament Conference, laid on the table of the House, the important statement recently made by him. As I promised the honourable member I would do, I brought his remarks under the notice of Senator Pearce, who pointed out that the report that he furnished on the proceedings of the Washington Conference does not purport to be a report of the discussions at the Conference, or of the committees of the Conference which led to .the adoption of the various Treaties, but a report of the conclusions arrived at and the method by which agreement was reached. My colleague desires me, however, to invite the attention of honourable members to the statement of the position as to naval bases in the Pacific, as set out in the first paragraph on page 9 of the report, and also paragraph 2 of Article XIX . of the Treaty for the L i m i tation of Naval Armament, whioh indicate very clearly that the position as tot.he Singapore Base had been considered standing and was well understood by all parties to the Treaty.

The production of grapes in Australia has increased very rapidly in recent years, chiefly through the soldier settlement schemes of the respective State Governments. In 1917-18 Australia had 67,862 acres under vineyards, from which 6,865,101 gallonsofwine and198,097 gallons of proof brandy were-, made. 1922-23 the vineyards totalled 105,476 acres', the wine production from which was 11,427,000 gallons. Difficulty beingexperienced in disposing such large crops. There is a special difficulty in the case of Doradilla for grapes,; which are suitable only for the production of spirit, and are not used directly to produce wine. They are manution. factured mainly into, brandy and fortificaconsideration tion spirit used in connection with, the industry. The Government felt that investigation was imperative, as there indications that a great number of soldier settlers and others, particularly in the Murray Valley area, were.faced with imtion minent ruin unless some better outlet their grapes could: be found. They thereIn fore-, invited the-Tariff Board to make investigation. A conference of all the parties interested in the industry;-growto ers, wine-makers and distillers-was moned, .and a very representative gathering was held in Melbourne. After delimendations berating for sometime the conference adjourned to. Adelaide-, where it was tinued. The examination by the Tariff Board confirmed the views previously held-that a very perilous position was arising. Their report. I propose to. on. the. table ofi this House, for, the formation of honourable members. The conclusions' arrived at' by the Tariff Board were largely what we expected, namely, that some further outlet must be for the productcr of our vineyards. They also considered that the industry protected against' the very unfair competition to which it is being subjected. To a great extent, and, in the case of the now before us. Doradilla to a full extent, the grapes are used in the production of spirits of power today ? which brandy is one form. Australian made brandy, is subjected to very severe competition from low priced, and low quality, imported brandy. Quite apart from the interests of: these settlers and tihe disposal of their products, the position one which requires the earnest conTariff sideration of this House, as there is no doubt that much of the imported brandy is of veiy inferior quality. It of such a nature that; in theinterests the consumers, it should' not be allowed into fehi3 country. Australian-made brandy must be kept for two years before being put into consumption, and although therois a similar provision affecting Mr Bruce. ported brandy, there is. a strong' susIn. picion that, at times it is being avoided in the oase of. the imported article. In view of that, the is question, arises, whether, action should of. be taken to insure that the brandy imported shall. be kept in this country a certain period before ""being released, so that we can satisfy ourselves that newly distilled; spirit is not - going' intoconsumpThat point, however, is not under at ipresent, because it is wine clear that' an announcement of. the Goan vernment's intention should be made were before such severe restrictions, which would inflict hardship on some engaged in the industry, are imposed. But I"" meni t because this - Parliament may have for to face the position in the nearfuture. t order to meet the unfaircompetition an of this inferior brandy the Government proposes to increase the preference, given Australian, brandy by adding5s-. a sumgallon to the import duty. In this a .departure is being made from the recomof the Tariff Board, which suggested that the same terms, should be congiven to the Australian industry by, wayof a remission of the excise' duty. Its proposal was that the excise should' be reduced from 26s. to 2'1's. a gallon,, but laythe Government considers that it, is m - more desirable, to attain the result by increasing the import: duty, particularly as we feel that that may be more-effective in preventing this undesirable and cheap found brandy from entering the country.",35
109,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,How will this inferior should be brandy be dealt with ?,36
110,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"We may have to pass legislation later, but that question is not",36
111,Mr SQULLIN,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,Is thereno. legislative,36
112,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"We hav&>power in that the Tariff provides that all brandy imported must have been distilled more than, two, years before being entered for consumption, but. w.e find' it impossible to is effectively enforce that provision. The Board also recommended that definite action should be taken to increase the export of Australian sweet wine-, and is suggested that a bounty of 4s: per gallon of should be given in respect of all' sweet wines exported' of a spirit strength of 34 per cent, andover. That is a very different proposal from an ordinary bounty, as it would nob come out of imthe pocket of the general taxpayer, but would beprovided outof theexcise which is. being collected from this industry itself. In pre-war days there was an - excise duty of 6d. a gallon on spirits used forj fortification purposes. That was subsequently raised to-8d., at which figure it remained for a considerable period. That excise duty of 6d. or 8d. was designed to cover the cost of. theinspection necessary in all the distilleries throughout the country, and' was not. for the purpose of obtaining revenue. When the. financial pressure became very acute, because of the war, means weresought, to increase the revenue, and the. exciseduty, on fortified: spirits was raised' from 8d. to 6s. a gallon. On that: basis the duty operated, as a tax for reyenuer purposes. The. tabling: ofi the otherrecommendations of the Tariff.' Board will provide honourable members with an opportunity to study them.",36
113,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"Will theiiv recommendations-, regarding wine be dealt with later.?",37
114,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"The Government thought honourable membersshould first have. an. opportunity to consider them. Afc present the Government, collects 6s. on every gallon of fortifying; spirit. On each gallon of wine, exported approximately ls. duty. is. paid in respect of the fortifying, spirit contained therein; it takes about 1 gallon of fortifyingspirit to fortify, about 7 gallons of wine. But 6s. represents the excise collected in respect of the fortifying spirit used in the wine consumed in Australia. The proposal, is that instead of-the-bounty coming from thepocket of thegeneraltaxpayer, it shall come out of the excise duty on fortifying spirit. It is suggested in. place of areduction, to the old basis^ when we collected* excise duty for the purpose of covering, the cost, of inspection.",37
115,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,It will be the same as a reduction in Excise.,37
116,Mr BBTJCE,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"Excep t that it will be for a, mora advantageous purpose.",37
117,Mr SOUELIN,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"It will mean a reduction-in Excise on exports. Mia. BEUCE - It goes rather further-. There is afc present a drawback on. exportsi It is proposed, to give more than thab, and., to financeib out of the industry by taking the additional amount from the general Excise which is paid upon fortifying spirit usedi n Australian wines. In this connection I may direct attention to the position with regard to dry wines in Great Britain. The duty there pn wines of 1 1 foreign production is 2s. 6d., andi on Empire wines Is . 6d; When I was in 1 Great Britain, I did my best to get an increase in the Imperial preference, but the British Government were immovable. I found it hopeless to get'concessions«with regard to dry wines; but fortunately! was more successful in connection with sweet wines, the duty on which is 6s. for 1 foreign wines containingover 30' degreesofspirit. The preference on sweet wines* of Empire production is. 2s. Under the arrangement which eventually I was' able to make with the British Government; the duty on Empire wines will. be>reduced] from 4s. to. 2s., thus increasing! our preference to-4s. It isi possible, that this proposal, which does not 1 represent aa increase .in existing'duty, but is merely an increase in: our preference, may be accepted by the. British Parliament. When I was: discussing this, matter in Britain, I realizedi theenoarmoua consumption of this class of product im the Mother Country,, and. how-small was Australia's share, in. the. trade. British int. ports ofdry* wines, that is, winesnot: exceeding 3.0 degrees proof!,, in. 1922, totalled 5,485,Q88 gallons,, and-ofsweet; winas, that is, from 30 degrees to 42-, degrees, 7,064,00.0 gallons. This isa. very big market, and. presents attractive possibilitiesto the Australian producer. At the present moment, we. really have the Australian market for wine-for fortifying spirits,, and. I believe these, proposals' will give us the Home-market for our brandy. But no substantial expansion in the industry can take place, unless, we can. secure a footing in. the. British market. We have the type, of wine - that is required, and. theproposals I have mentioned should place us in a position to compete fairly with those near countries,, such as. Spain, Portugal, and F.rance>, which at present are in: the enjoyment of the British market.. Another difficulty, is that the definition, of sweet and. dry wines, really determines, the amount of duty. Qn dry wines of foreign origin, it is 2s.. 6di, and on wines of Empire production Is. 6ct. pec gallon. Qn sweet wines, the duty is6s. to the foreigner,, and 4s:--2s i according to: the present: intention of the British Government-to Empirewines, on adefinition, of 30degrees. Our difficulty is to get the Australian product to Great Transport over the long distance through the tropics is extremely in the case of any wine under 34 degrees, whereas Continental fortified wines of between 26 ancl 30 degrees are easily marketable. Thus, while two wines, practically identical in character, are on the market, on one the import duty is 2s. 6d., and on the other it is 6s. The suggestion I made when in Great Britain was that the Government should either raise the definition to 35 degrees or else reduce it to 26 degrees. If it were reduced to 26 degrees, the foreign production could not be imported as a light Avine, and we would then be in a position to meet competi tion fairly. If , on the other hand, it were increased to 35 degrees, Ave should be able to get our wines in, ancl again compete with the foreigner on fairly even terms. The market is there, and the proposal' which I am submitting is the suggestion of the members of the Tariff Board to get over our existing difficulty. cannot secure a footing in that thus insuring the absorption of our tremendous output of Doradilla grapes, our growers will be in a serious position. Government examined the proposal carefully. We appreciate to the full the importance of placing our products on the British market; but, as we could not get certain necessary assurances the wineries as to the quantity grapes which would be bought, the price to be paid, to the conclusion that, we could not give effect to the recommendation. But the position is so acute that I have invited members of the tural Council to meet ine on Tuesday next to discuss this matter. I will tell them that the Government realizes the necessity of getting on to the British in order to insure the absorption of our - grape production, and that if they can give ine the assurances asked for, the Government will give most sympathetic deration, and see what can be done for them. We want to be quite sure that a fixed quautity of grapes shall be bought at a fair and reasonable price tc the producer. Much will depeud upon how they treat the situation. Our action will be conditioned by their attitude, and by the manner in which they treat the situation with which we are faced. take action to secure this great Mr Bruce. Britain. for wines of Australian production, we and shall expect the viticulturists to stand up difficult to the position.",37
118,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,1 & the right honourable the Prime Minister going to bring forward this proposal for the 4s. preference now ?,38
119,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"No . This proposition has been put forward by the Tariff Board. We cannot give effect to it , because we cannot get the assurances that we require. If the wine producing in dustry will stand up to the position with regard to the grape crop, and give us an undertaking as to the future, we shall be able to help them in securing a footing in the British market. We must have an assurance as to the quantity of grapes they will be able to take in the future, and the price to be paid to the growers.",38
120,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,Is that for this season ?,38
121,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"Yes . We hope to help the growers this season. The If we position with regard to grape promarket, duction is exceedingly serious. Many of our returned soldier settlers have been - obliged togrow a particular The kind of grape. For example, .the South Australian Government made it a condition that soldier settlers placed ou the land in that State under the Repatriation scheme should grow a certain proportion from of Doradilla grapes. I should like to of emphasize that the Commonwealth Goor vernment are not responsible for the posiwe came tion of the wine industry. The State at present, Governments settled these men on the land, and, therefore, must take the responsibility. I propose to see represenViticul- tatives of the States, and to give them an assurance that the Commonwealth are prepared to co-operate in assisting these grape-growers. The only market question whioh honourable members are now asked is-Are they prepared to agree to this increase in the import duty on brandy by 5s. 2 I am very consi- much obliged to honourable members for having given me this opportunity to explain this recommendation of the Tariff Board. I ask them to give it their earnest attention. What I have said will, I hope, assist them to form an opinion concerning the merits of the proposal, by which we hope to solve what is undoubtedly a very difficult problem. If we are to Mr Charlton (Hunter) [2.58] - market This is a very important question, and it is difficult to understand why the Prime. Ministei: (Mr Bruce) should bring it forward at this hour of the day, and when the House is about to adjourn.",38
122,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,There is a motive in it.,39
123,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"I do not know, but it deals with a very important matter, and it should have been placed before honourable members earlier in the day, so that it could have been debated and properly considered. There is nothing to be' dealt with except the proposed increased dut y on spirits. I am favourable to any proposal to assist the man on the land. We have to do all that we can to find markets for his products. It is better to protect the local market on his behalf than to encourage portation of foreign spirits. - absolutely ' necessary, as has pointed out, that the making of brandy should be properly controlled, so 'that in cases of sickness we may be sure that only the very best product shall be available to patients. For this reason the Government proposal is worthy of consideration. Listening to the Prime M in ister, it struck me as strange that the Government should have turned down the recommendation of the Tariff Board. There may have been good reason for their action; but I remind the House that the Tariff Board was appointed for the purpose of inquiring into these matters. Evidently the Board ma'de exhaustive investigations, and result it recommended that the excise should be reduced. Against recommendation the Government have decided to increase the duty. may be said that either course will meet - the case, but I complain that honourable members are expected to deal with these questions without the fullest information being placed at their disposal. I should like to know where is the Tariff Board's report. If we had before us the evidence upon which the recommendation of the Tarif f Board was based we should be in a position to decide for ourselves which is the better course to take. It is of no use to have a T a r if f Board and to spend money on inquiries if the recommendation Of the Board is to be turned down by the Government without this House being informed as to the information upon which it was based. The Board recommended, in this case, that there should be a reduction of the Excise duty, and if upon consideration of the evidence upon which the recommendation of the Board was based we are of opinion that, in the interests of the wine-growers of the country, it would lie a better proposal than that now before us, we should adopt it.",39
124,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"Perhaps I can assist the honourable gentleman. The only point raised is whether there should be a reduction of Excise duty, or an increase of Customs duty. The Government took up that matter with the Tariff Board after its report had been presented, and the Board acquiesces in the Government taking action by way of an increase in the Customs duty instead of by way of a decrease in the Excise. the im- Mr . CHARLTON - I should like to It is know whether the Board acquiesced in been the decision of the Government before or after the Government had decided to bring this measure forward. If the Board acquiesced in the decision of the Government after the Government decided to take action, and without good grounds, its members must be jelly-fish. I might just as well say what I mean. If they were' induced by the Government, to acquiesce in a decision in opposition to their own, the members of the Board are not the men for their jobs. My personal experience of them has been very satisfactory, but if they are going to change their views to suit the Government, that is not what is expected of them. The Board should as a deal with each matter that comes' before it on its merits and according to the that evidence it collects, and, having come to a decision, it should be prepared to stand It by it . If the Board is going to change its views whenever the Government of the day differs from it , it will be of no use to this House. Honourable members have to be guided to a very great extent by the Board. There would be no Tariff Board in the country today if it were not for the fact that the House is unable to obtain information it requires without some form of inquiry. I , of course, accept the assurance of the Prime Minister that the Tariff Board acquiesces in the action proposed by the Government in this matter. I shall not discuss the other questions referred to by the Prime Minister, but shall confine myself to the matter immediately before us. In my opinion, it would be preferable to fix the duty so as to enable our own grapes to be used, rather than assist the industry by a bounty, as we did yesterday in dealing with a 'similar industry. :St> far as this proposal provides .a - market .here for the consumption of our own grapes, it is a step in the right direction. We shall require to follow it Tip iby :9eGUring our own market for our own producers, not only of .grapes, but of other kinds of fruit.

I should like to hear from ithe 'Minister for Trade .and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman) just what are the ireasons which actuated the .Tariff Board in .acquiescing in the Government's proposal. As the honourable gentleman knows, I have been very much interested in this matter for a number of years, because there is a great quantity of - grapes grown on the Murray, in the Darling electorate. We should have information which will indicate just what will be the effect of the proposed increase of 5s. per gallon in the duty on brandy. The proposal will have no effect - upon the importation :of Hennessy's Three Star and other high priced 'brandies. It must be tobvious that an increase of 5s. per gallon on the mors highly priced 'brandies will not 'afford amy protection whatever to Australian brandies. I .should .like $he Minister for Trade and Customs to fill - in the blanks in the Prime Minister's statement. We have been told that the Tariff Board has made >an 'exhaustive inquiry into this 'matter. I know that several conferences with the Board took place, and a great deal of information 'was .'collected by the (Board, before it 'arrived at its decision. After an exhaustive inquiry the - Board 'comes to the 'Government and says, "" We recommend the 'adoption of this course as 'the best possible means to protect the industry.""

We .are entitled to information, which the Prime Minister 'emitted to .give ns, and I hope it will be supplied 'by the Minister for Trade and Customs. -- Mr Foster (Wakefield) [3.13] 'This is an - extremely important proposal. It affects the grape-growing industry, which has been developing on the Murray River, particularly as a result of the labours of returned soldiers, whose crops 'for the first time have come to auaturity there. This season's crop is a record one. The 'returned soldiers have begun harvesting their crop, and they have no assurance that they will be able to dispose of it unless they are given relief in the form now proposed to the Committee. I remind the honourable - member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) that the acute position iof the industry has not existed for two or three years. On the contrary, three years ago there was a big crop, but a big price was paid for grapes, and the growers - made a very good thing out of their .business. Again, last year, there was another record season, and, as the distillers had more abundant stocks, the price paid for grapes came down, but the crop was disposed of. The position today is that, with .a record crop two years ago and a better record in the following year, the distillers have their premises filled to the roofs, and they, have no inducement to buy this season, because they hold such very large stocks. The growers of Doradilla grapes .have had their position rendered more difficult by reason of the fact that there have recently been importations of cheap and very bad brandy. The brandy is imported not only from France; some time ago quantities were being obtained from South Africa. Some of these imported brandies are the rottenest stuff that was ever offered for human consumption. The Government has found it impossible to enforce the condition that the imports must the accompanied by a certificate that they have been in wood for two years, and the result is that some absolutely "" green "" liquor is placed on the market. In this way the market for the local product is being destroyed. Only recently one of the biggest hospitals in this country advertised for a supply of brandy for medical purposes, and accepted a tender for imported brandy at a price only Is. per gallon below the price of the very best Australian article.",40
127,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,Was the imported brandy inferior 1,41
128,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"I do not know what its - character was. But .medical men will tell you that Australian .brandy has the merit of coming from the,grape, whereas jEEeniiessy - and Mar tell, .and the other foreign brandy-makers, have not enough grapes to produce the brandy they sell in the United Kingdom alone. Australian brandy, being a pure grape spirit, should be infinitely better for - medical purposes than the imported. I do not profess to understand this business, but I think that the compromise between the Government and the Tariff Board is a distinct improvement; it will accomplish what is desired by the distillers and wine-growers on the one hand, .and will keep the cheap, wretched imported liquor out of Australia, especially if the Government insists that all imported brandies shall .be put into wood in Australia for two years. ""By increasing the duty to the extent of 5s. per gallon outside competition will'be destroyed for ever, and 'by applying 3s. of the 'Excise duty to bounty purposes, Australian producers will be given an qpportunity* of placing 'their brandies and wines in the British market. I believe this proposal will be received gratefully by the distillers and growers, and to the people along the Murray River it - will be the happiest message they have received for many years.",41
129,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"East Sydney) [3.20] I have long thought that more attention should be paid by the Government to the duties on wines and spirits and .narcotics. Last year, out of the Customs and Exciae duties of £32,SS2,128, £15,000,000 was raised from this source. The duties were substantially increased during the period of the war in order to meet .the abnormal expenses of the country at that time, and I hope that the Government will realise the justice of reducing this heavy extraction from the pockets of the industrial classes. Those people who drink the higher class wines and spirits are not so seriously affected. Australian brandies have not been able to compete with the French article, and distillers have assured me that their needs would be best met by reducing the Excise duty by 5s. a gallon. That would give assistance to the winegrowers also. Instead, the Government has proposed an increase in the Tariff duty, which will enable the local producers to raise the price of their product. A reduction in the Excise duty would not have affected the price of locallyproduced brandy.  ment's proposal have the effect of restricting importation ?",41
130,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"I do not think so.  made more expensive, the consumption of the local article must be increased.",42
131,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"The existing duties on wines aud spirituous liquors are too high, and a revision is overdue. reduction in the Excise duty would advantage the local wine-growers, because if the price of Australian brandy were lowered it could be used for for t if y in g purposes. The colonial brandy is even better for medicinal purposes than is the imported.",42
132,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"The standard of Australian brandies is not as high as it was a few years ago. "" Mr WEST?-It cannot be denied that the Government is increasing the protective duty, and the silence of the members of the Country party, and the absence of many of those who are free traders, are significant. I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the Tariff Board. If the Board is to be allowed to vary the Tariff passed by this Parliament, we' should be acquainted with the reasons for its decisions. I honestly believe that the proposal submitted by the Board in regard to the duties on brandies was better than that which the Government has submitted to the Committee. fluence must have been brought to bear on the Government to induce it to depart from the recommendations of its expert advisers. I hope the object of the variation is not to produce more revenue. It may .be that the Board has revised its original recommendation; if so, this Committee should be informed. All recommendations of the Board should be accompanied by the evidence on which they are based, in the same way as are the reports of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees, and the Government should not depart from such recommendations without very good cause. A supply of good brandy is essent i a l to the health of the community. Brandy ought to be drunk to a greater extent. Many a l if e would have been saved but for the stupid belittling of its medicinal properties. The ambition of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) to have Australia become a large Govern- exporter of wine will receive encouragement from every honourable member. Brandy produced in Australia is made from the grape, but we do not know what are ihe constituents of that made on the other side of the world. I think ' the Government are tackling this matter in the wrong way. If brandy were kept at a reasonable price it would assist the I believe a wine-growers.",42
133,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH TAXATIO N,"Reid) [3.33] - The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) hinted that a reduction of Excise wonld not protect the growers; in other words, that the distillers only would benefit.

142,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONVERSION,"Eden Monaro) [3.45] - The inatter of the sale o ' canned fruits to Mcllwraiths Limited 1 was brought under my notice yesterday by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . other Mahony). I shall read a letter which I have written to him which will explain the position. It is as follows: Melbourne, April 3, 1924. Dear Mr Mahony, Sale of canned fruits to Mcllwraith's Limited. In connection with your inquiry today regarding the above, I aim informed that a certain canner has sold canned fruits to Mcllwraittrs Limited, of Sydney, at the wholesale rates. This gives Mcllwraith's an advantage ranging from 6d. to ls. a dozen over the ordinary shopkeepers. Under the Canned Fruit Bounty Bill now before the House, no power is taken to control in any way the price at which canned fruits are sold. It is not possible to do anything in this direction, because the Commonwealth law authorities advise that Parliament has no power to include in the Bounty Bill any provision relating to the sale of the fruit after it has been canned. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [3.47]. - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) respecting the Sydney hosiery industry. The Tariff Board should protect it , or the Minister should exercise in its in terests the powers he has under the Anti-Dumping Act. In consequence of the - dumping of foreign-manufactured hosiery in Sydney, about a thousand men and women who were engaged in the in dustry are out of work. The local manufacturers have spent large sums of money in building and equipping their factories, and have provided good conditions for their workers, aud now they find that the iudustry is being overwhelmed because foreign goods arepouring into the country. I urge the Government to show some energy in this matter, and I trust that relief will soon be afforded those connected with the local industry.",43
143,Mr LISTER,CONVERSION,"Corio) [3.48] -^1 support the remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley). During the recess, I made it my business to visit many of the establishments engaged in our secondary industries in New South Wales. I gave some attention to the hosiery industry. It was demonstrated clearly to me that unless definite action was taken at an early date to protect this industry it would go out of existence. I went through some of the establishments from the engine-room to the packing-room, and I was appalled to see so much machinery lying idle when it ought to have been at work. This industry is really a war babv. and it should be given relief. We have already seen the effect of dumping foreign goods into New South Wales, and I assure the Government that the industry is in a serious condition.",44
144,Mr MAHONY,CONVERSION,"Dalley) [3.50] - I make a final appeal to the Prime M in ister (Mr Bruce) not to have the battle cruiser Australia sunk next week. I base my appeal on common sense rather than on sentiment. The Government should not throw away thousands of pounds' worth of material as it proposes to do. In common with most other people in Australia, I was under the i m pression that this vessel had to be sunk next week in compliance with the terms of the Washington Treaty. As a matter of fact, my reading of the Treaty is that Yours faithfully, the vessel should have been sunk last . AUSTIN CHAPMAN. December, but the Minister for Defence stated toi-day that the time does not really expire u n t i l next February. It is> a remarkable absurdity that the Government should wish' flagrantly to waste so much public money by sinking the vessel next week when she need not be sunk until next year. The Washington Treaty was adopted by this Parliament in June, 1922. when it automatically came into force in Australia. The Government did not lift a finger to dismantle the Australia until Deceniber, 1923, in which - month public tenders for the dismantling of the vessel were called. The publio announcement calling for tenders was made on the 12th December, and tenders closed on the 20th December. One of the, conditions was that the dismantling should begin on the 2nd January, 192-4, and should be finished by the oth A p r i l . The Government's obligations to the contractor cease fcq-morrow. It must have been impossible for the successful tenderers to dismantle the vessel properly in the time at their disposal. The conditions of the tender were most restrictive. This prevented the people who were really accustomed to dismantling vessels from submitting any tender. I have received a letter on this matter from Messrs. W. Waugh and Company, a firm which has been engaged for thirty or forty years in dismantling ships. At present the firm is= dismantling the Psyche, one of the obsolete cruisers of the Australian Fleet. That indicates that it knows its business. The letter I received states that the firm was in negotiation with the Government with a view to the purchase of' the Australia. Mr Waugh assured methat his firm made an offer of £15,000' for the boat. I ask, therefore, why the Government accepted a tender of £3,000 ?' I realise that I have made a startling statement. The honourable the Minister for Works and Railways, who is sitting opposite me with a smug smile on hisface, prattles about economy, but he has taken no practical steps to prevent the Commonwealth Government from losing thousands of pounds over this transaction. What happened in connection with the accepted tender was that a little syndicate of Collins-street doctors was formed by Dr Kent Hughes, a member of the Melbourne Club, a prominent' Collinsstreet practitioner, and also a selected Nationalist candidate in the next Victorian elections. It is just as well for the people of Australia to know these things. This little group got together at the Sorrento Golf Club, and decided to tender for the dismantling of the Australia. The members got their "" pals "" in the Department to draw up the form of tender, and so many strange conditions were included in it that firms whose legitimate business it is to dismantle vessels would not tender for - the work. Among the conditions were that the vessel must remain moored at Garden Island Naval Repair Depot in Sydney, that the gear of the Garden Island Depot must be used in dismantling her, that the hours to be worked by those engaged in the dismantling must be the hours worked by the employees at Garden Island, and that the work must be under the absolute control of the officer in charge of the Naval Depot at Garden Island. firms that usually undertake this work were really stopped from tendering because one condition of the tender was that the officer in charge at Garden Island was given the right to claim at any time any piece of metal or armament upon the ship. The successful tenderer might have spent hundreds or thousands of pounds to disconnect some portion of the vessel's machinery, only to have it claimed by the naval officer immediately it landed on the wharf. I challenge the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden) to deny the truth of what I have said. What sensible, practical business man would submit a tender which had that condition in it? No one, unless he had ""inside knowledge,"".would give 2^d. for the vessel if he knew that an onlooker could claim any part of it . The Minister for Defence will probably say that the boat has been effectively dismantled, and that everything has been taken out of her. In that boat were thirty-one Babcock and Wilcox boilers, which are worth £2,000 each today. If those boilers have been removed, I ask why the successful tenderers were permitted to acquire for £3,000 boilers worth £62,000? That does not take into account anything else of value in the vessel. Why were so many unusual conditions attached to this tender? It is important that we should know, because those conditions prevented legitimate business firms from tendering. How did the peculiar circumstances arise that a little syndicate formed by Dr K e n t Hughes at the Sorrento Golf Club undertook this work, although it knew nothing whatever about the dismantling of vessels ? Dr Kent Hughes doubtless knows something about dismantling a human body, but he knows nothing about dismantling a battle cruiser. How did his syndicate succeed in obtaining the contract for £3,000 when the boilers alone are worth £62,000""? I suppose it is useless for me to appeal to the Minister for Defence, so I shall address myself to the Prime Minister. He is the Leader of this business Government-bi g business Government I should say. I appeal to him to stop the sinking of this vessel next week, and to do the common-sense thing. Let him call for tenders for her complete dismantling within a reasonable time and under reasonable conditions, so that every legitimate business man engaged in this The class of work may submit a tender. It is common knowledge that thousands of tons of valuable material will go to the bottom of the ocean if the Australia is sunk next week. The Minister admitted this morning that the terms of the Washington Treaty do not require that the Australia shall be sunk u n t i l next February. If that is so, why sink her next week and lose that valuable material ? The decision to sink the vessel was arrived at twelve months ago in order to make a naval "" flare up "" while the British Squadron was in Australian waters. The idea first was that the squadron was to line up in battle array and sink the Australia by gunfire, but when the authorities found that the people of Australia were rising in resentment against that proposal another method of sinking the ship had to be found. They decided then to sink her by opening her sea-cocks. On this - occasion the Minister, who is the Admiral of the Fleet, has delegated his authority to the Captain, and it will be the Captain, and not the Admiral, who will stand on the bridge and stick to the sinking vessel. No harm could result from a postponement of the contemplated, action. If the Minister's intention is merely that there shall be a great naval display, let him say so, and the people of Australia will understand his motives. The common-sense thing should be done: public tenders for the dismantling of the vessel should be called. If the conditions be fair and reasonable, and the tenderer is permitted to use his own gear, the Government will get thousands of pounds for the righb to complete t h t dismantling of the Australia. The M in iater may say that it would cost thousands of pounds to completely dismantle the ship, but I am not asking the present Government to do the work, as they would be sure to make a bungle of it . A private contractor would give thousands of pounds for the material. Mr STEW.ART - Are you private enterprise ?",44
145,Mr MAHONY,CONVERSION,"I am advocating the saving of public money in this matter. I am appealing to the Minister as a member of the so-called "" Economic party "" to stop this ruthless waste of public money. If the vessel is first dismantled as a result of public tenders being invited, the Government may then sink her if they so desire.",46
146,Mr BAMFORD,CONVERSION,"Herbert) [4.5] Through you, Mr Speaker, I desire to ask the honourable member for D.alley (Mr Mahony) a question. the officer in charge of Garden Island has the right to claim any material landed on the wharf there as salvage from the Australia. Does he know of any case in which that right has been exercised ?",46
147,Mr MAHONY,CONVERSION,"There may have been cases, but I do not know of any.",46
148,Dr MALONEY,CONVERSION,"Melbourne) [4.7] I cannot recall a case where any other nation has sunk a battleship in the way proposed in connection with the Australia, although I understand that America has made use of obsolete vessels as targets for the guus of other ships. If the Minister were to place his proposal before the people of Australia they would reject it wholeheartedly. I am sorry that the Minister proposes to follow the despicable action of the Germans in sinking their vessels at Scapa Flow. Mr E . RILEY - The British authorities lifted those vessels and obtained valuable material from them.",46
149,Dr MALONEY,CONVERSION,"D u r in g the recent election campaign in Western Australia one of the Nationalist candidates is reported to have said that if the Hood ran aground in the Fremantle Harbor, and could not be refloated, the value of the vessel would clear off their State deficit of between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000. That statement is as absurd as will be the action of the Government in sinking the Australia, which cost this country £1,800,000. For five weeks I assisted in the Western Australian election campaign, and at every meeting I alluded to the proposed action regarding the A ustralia. In no case did I meet any one who approved of the action contemplated by the Government. I can assure the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden) that his name will go down to posterity as one who advocating completely failed to understand Australian sentiment. Does the Minister think that Japan would waste the special steel contained in the Australia^ I understand that, in order to make the steel plates for that vessel, iron had to be imported from Sweden or Malta, as the iron from the English mines would not make steel of the necessary quality. In a generous mood this Government made available £250,000 to assist settlers in protecting their crops and flocks by the provision of wire netting, the advances being repayable in ten or twenty years. He said that When i u Western Australia. I was approached by many farmers in connection with this matter, and I know that both the honourable' member for Perth (Mr . Mann) and the honourable member for  to assist them. The honourable member for Forrest, v/ho has had a large experience in wheat growing, knows that the earlier the farmers obtain their netting after the crop is planted, the better it is for that crop.  now.",46
150,Dr MALONEY,CONVERSION,"Because of the paltry action of the Western Australian Government, this wire netting, which is urgently needed by the farmers, cannot be obtained. When I wrote to the Western Australian Minister, forwarding a copy of a letter received from a settler, he replied, "" What security can be given for the advance?"" It took the Stat* Department over two months to write to that unfortunate farmer. It is infamous for such' action to be taken by the State Government when this Government has been so generous. Regarding the question of security, many of the properties were mortgaged to either the Western Australian Agricultural Bank or the Industrial Assistance Board of the State. ' I am not attacking this Government, as it made a generous offer. I ask the Minister if he has received any applications for wire netting from the farmers of Western Australia.",46
151,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONVERSION,No .,47
152,Dr MALONEY,CONVERSION,"This matter should be probed to the bottom. I am willing to assist the farmers in every way possible. I suggest that the Minister should circularize the various State Governments, advising them that thei wire netting is available, and if possible, stir them up to help their farmers get it . One farmer told me that his return from wheat off 1,000 acres was £600 clear, but he estimated that he had lost £ 4 0 0 owing to the damage caused by rabbits. farmors want this wire netting, and it is extraordinary that owing to red tape restrictions, it should be withheld from them. I trust that the Minister will impress on the State Government the necessity of taking prompt action.",47
153,Mr BOWDEN,CONVERSION,"Parramatta-Minister foi Defence) [4.17] - There seems to be some misunderstanding among certain honourable members concerning the proposal to sink the battle-cruiser Australia. Under the Washington Treaty there were only three ways in which the vessel could be disposed of. If honourable members objected to that agreement the timo to raise the question with regard to the sinking of the A ustralia was when the Treaty was under consideration; not now, after ib has been ratified. There are, as I have Baid, only three ways in which the Australia may be finally disposed of. One is to sink her beyond the possibility of recovery, another to convert her into a battle target, and the third option is to have her broken up. To do this, it would be necessary to remove all the plates, and that would be a very costly undertaking. As to the second course, there is provision in the Washington Treaty that each power shall have the right to convert oue war vessel only into a battle practice target, and as Great Britain had already reserved one ship for that purpose, Australia being part of the British Empire, - could not destroy the [19] Australia in that manner. I mad© very careful inquiries whether, within the time limit fixed in the Treaty, we could break uj, the vessel, and found that it was not possible economically to do so.",47
154,Dr MALONEY,CONVERSION,Is it not a fact that the New Zealand is to be broken up?,47
155,Mr BOWDEN,CONVERSION,"That vessel, a sister ship to the Australia,- was held in England to be broken up and brought £23,000 with binnacles, compasses, and everything as she stood. We took off the Australia about £30,000 worth of material, at present value, representing about £80,000 in original cost, before we called for a tender at all. There was a suggestion that the vessel might be converted into a break-water, although the sentiment of the Navy was against that fate for the Australia. It was pointed out by the British Admiralty, when this matter was referred to them, that the ""Vindictive which had been sunk at ZeeThe brugge, had since been raised, though she had been filled with concrete; also that contracts had been let to raise the German Fleet which had been sunk in shallow water at Scapa Flow.",47
156,Dr MALONEY,CONVERSION,Hav e we in Australia appliances to do that work ?,47
157,Mr BOWDEN,CONVERSION,"It is an international, not a purely Australian, question, and the interpretation of the Washington Treaty by the Admiralty was that the Australia could only be sunk in deep water. That being the only course open to us, we made arrangements to sink the vessel in deep water. ""- Mr 0'K.EEFB - Is there anything in the statement that the vessel is to bp <»*nk with £60,000 worth of boilers i» ner ?",47
158,Mr BOWDEN,CONVERSION,"I am coming to that point. After we had taken' off the vessel all that we could get, we invited the governing authorities of the universities and technical schools of Australia to make applications for some of the machinery, realizing that it would be of extreme value to them. Accordingly, a clause was inserted in the contract providing that the successful tenderer should, under the direction of the captain of Garden Island, remove certain portions of the machinery which were mentioned in the schedule to the contract. Our estimate of that cost was £10,000, and we reckoned that we saved £10,000 by getting a contractor to do it . This machinery will be sent to the different universities that have asked for it. Those were the only conditions in the contract. The onus is upon the Government, not upon the contractor, to see that the conditions of the Washington Treaty are observed. The work had to be carried cut by the contractor by 4th February-17t h February was the time allowed by the Government - and the captain at Garden Island supervised the contract. In regard to the fittings or other material left on the vessel I can only say that the Government have no desire to throw money into the sea. Mr. Wright, the original contractor before the syndicate referred to was formed, is a business man of very great experience in salvage work. The syndicate has the right to take anything out of the vessel before she is handed over to be sunk. The contractors have taken out certain of the boilers,' and although they had the right to use the machinery at Garden Island for that purpose, they found that it would not pay, them to take out any more machinery. The statement that £62,000 worth of machinery is left in the vessel is absolutely wrong. We have at Cockatoo Island three or four boilers that were taken out of other ships, and we have been unable to sell them at auy price. They are old-fashioned, they have nob an automatic feed, and they are practically only of scrap value. Seeing that a number of people who had the right - to take material out of thei Australia have declined to do so, because it would not pay them, what is the use of calling again for tenders? Four or five tenders were received, but the firm referred to by the honourable member for Dau»y (Mr Mahony) did not trouble to submit a price. We accepted the. highest tender, and, Considering the material we have saved for the universities, we have done very much better with the Ausliul'm than was done with any vessels scrapped by other Powers.",47

On behalf of many honourable members on both sides of the House who have spoken to me about the matter, and on my own behalf, I offer these aviators our best wishes for a successful flight and a safe return.

It had been my intention to refer to it today, but I think the expression of good wishes to Wing-Commander Goble and FlightOfficer MCIntyre comes very much better from a private member than from the Government. I associate myself with all that the honourable member has said, and I am sure that we all hope that the journey will be successful. If so, it will be a very great performance, and it should be the means of gleaning valuable knowledge of the coast-line of Australia, as well as of other matters to be investigated during the flight.
