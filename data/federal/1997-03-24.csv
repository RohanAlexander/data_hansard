NA Small Business Deregulation Task Force Report: Government Response",13
2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have pleasure in tabling the government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. The government's response is the fulfilment of yet another election promise of the coalition parties. The government thanks the members of the task force, which was chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, the Managing Director of MCDonald's, for their work in developing a comprehensive blueprint of practical reforms to significantly reduce the burden of regulation and red tape on Australia's small businesses. The Bell report was entitled Time for business and, appropriately, the government's response is entitled More time for business-it is all about giving small business men and women in Australia more time to be productive in their businesses. The government endorses the great bulk of the task force's 62 recommendations. Importantly, we have also decided on additional measures to assist small business. Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Small business is an integral part of the decentralised network of called family, workplaces and community which is the most effective guarantor of freedom and choice in our society. Small business is also a job creation machine. In the decade to 1994-95, small business accounted for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million net jobs created over that period. According to surveys undertaken for the Bell task force, half of all small business operators surveyed said that a significant reduction in compliance costs would allow more time to run the business and more than a quarter saw it as increasing profitability, with benefits for economic growth and jobs. Our aim is to get governments at all levels off the back of small business. Small business should not be bogged down in paperwork and forced to deal with a multiplicity of overlapping regulatory bodies. Small business cannot afford excessive overheads and on-costs. The overriding priority is to maximise time for business, which will generate economic growth and jobs for all Australians. We promised small business a new deal at the last election and we are delivering on that commitment. Our macro-economic policies are contributing to higher national savings and delivering low inflation, which have taken pressure off interest rates and delivered lower debt servicing costs to small business. We understand, however, that many small businesses are still doing it tough in the new, very competitive, low inflation environment. We announced in the last budget capital gains tax rollover relief, which will encourage the expansion of small business. Another budgetary measure, the capital gains tax exemption on retirement, will provide a nest egg for small business owners who have been too busy ploughing all their capital back into the business to worry about superannuation. The provisional tax uplift factor has been reduced from eight per cent to six per cent at a cost to revenue of $180 million, improving the cash flow of small business. We have swept away Labor's jobs destroying unfair dismissal laws. Compulsory unionism has been abolished and a new, more flexible industrial relations framework established to encourage greater cooperation in workplaces. The Bureau of Statistics is reducing the burden of statistical collections on small business by 20 per cent. New regulations affecting business are subject to a sunset clause and we are reviewing existing business rules and regulations to abolish outdated ones. Our response to the Bell report builds on these achievements. The overall package involves reforms to business taxation and regulatory programs at a cost of over $600 million over four years. Our willingness to fund this package in the current budgetary circumstances is a reflection of the government's strong support for the small business sector. I now wish to outline some of the main measures. Taxation Dealing with our complex tax system was the number one compliance issue identified by small business in submissions to the Bell task force. The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business. Few areas of taxation are more complicated than fringe benefits tax, FBT. There are around 55,000 small businesses that currently pay FBT, many of which pay relatively small amounts but incur substantial paperwork and compliance costs. We have, therefore, decided to abolish the FBT record keeping requirement for businesses which provide less than $5,000 in taxable benefits in a base year and which maintain a similar level of benefit from year to year. FBT paid in subsequent years will be based on the base year liability. This will benefit up to half of all small FBT payers. Employers would be required to establish a new base year if they elect to have the amount of FBT varied down in later years or the benefits provided increased by more than 20 per cent above the base year. However, once they have established a new base year, they will again not be required to keep records as long as the taxable value of benefits does not materially alter thereafter. The FBT treatment of car parking will also be reformed. From 1 April 1997, car parking provided by small businesses on their premises will be completely exempt from fringe benefits tax. Certain provisions denying deductibility for self-employed car parking will also be removed from 1 July 1997. All businesses will benefit from the extension of the FBT exemption for taxi travel to cover travel to and from the place of work at any time of the day or night. We will also liberalise capital gains tax rollover relief even further. It will now apply to the sale of shares in a small business. This will assist those small business owners who prefer to realise their interest by selling shares rather than the underlying assets of the business. This further liberalisation will increase the cost to revenue of the measure by about $90 million to around $300 million per annum. The capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a small business for retirement will now be extended to taxpayers who operate their small business through a private company or trust. This will increase the cost to revenue of this measure by about $35 million to an estimated $50 million per annum. These new capital gains tax provisions will apply from I July 1997. The use of asset registers for capital gains tax purposes will be allowed, eliminating the need for taxpayers to keep source documents after five years. Businesses will be better able to manage their cash flow through changes which will enable them to make voluntary tax payments at any time from 1 July 1997. The amount of time in which small companies and small instalment taxpayers can lodge their returns and pay liabilities will also be ed. The government has not accepted the task force's recommendation for changes to the wholesale sales tax system, which would have involved increasing taxes for a range of goods and taxpayers. Unfair Dismissals The Bell report recommended a review the new unfair dismissal laws after 12 operations. months. We support that recommendation but we have decided to go further in recognition of the particular difficulty small business in dealing with complex industrial relations requirements and our concern to stimulate employment, particularly youth employment. I announce today that businesses with 15 or fewer employees will be exempt from the federal unfair dismissal provisions for new employees until they have been continuously employed for a period of 12 months. This will apply whether they are full time or part time or on a regular casual basis. This will give small business every encouragement to hire new staff confidently, particularly younger, less experienced employees. Safeguards will remain. Small businesses will still be required to provide the statutory minimum period of notice on termination and to satisfy the provisions of the law preventing employees on discriminatory grounds, such as pregnancy. I will write to state Premiers to encourage them to adopt similar provisions in their jurisdictions. I hope all of them do so, and warmly encourage those Premiers who have in recent months frequently asked the federal government to lift the burden of red tape small business to replicate what I announce today in relation to unfair dismissals. Also, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be required to improve the system for parties in terms of when and where industrial matters, including unfair dismissals, are dealt with. This will be particularly relevant to small business. Regulation and Compliance Initiatives Small business cannot afford the time or expense of dealing with multiple regulatory authorities, including duplication by different extendtiers of government. The former Industry Commission found, for example, that the proprietor of a small hotel in one jurisdiction had to be familiar with 12 separate statutes and six codes of practice just to be sure of complying with state and Commonwealth occupational health and safety laws. Business regulation should be as efficient and streamof lined as businesses demand of their own We will therefore establish a single registration process for the Australian Taxation has Office, the Securities Commission, the Bureau of Statistics and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission by July 1998. We will work with state and territory governments to develop a single point of entry for all levels of government through which business can obtain information on all government requirements and programs. Over the next four years we will create a comprehensive national business information service-including a business regulation freecall service-streamline business licensing and approvals processes and merge similar licences into single, 'common' licences. These initiatives, which will cost around $23 million over the next four years, will result in considerable savings in compliance costs for dismissal of small business. The preparation of regulation impact statements for all Commonwealth regulation or legislation that has the potential to affect business will be mandatory. The Co.sts and benefits of regulation will be weighed up I carefully to ensure that the putative benefits are not outweighed by excessive economic and financial costs, including the compliance on burden on business. The Assistant Treasurer will be given the authority to enforce these rules. A tangible demonstration of the government's determination to avoid unnecessary additional increases in the regulatory burden on industry was our recent decision not to implement privacy legislation for the private sector at the Commonwealth level. I also raised the matter at last week's Premiers Conference. I have asked the Premiers and Chief Ministers not to introduce such legislaover tion at the state level. Queensland and the Northern Territory have already agreed to our request and the other states will consider the Commonwealth's request further. I will write to the Premiers this week to set out my concerns. In cooperation with state and territory governments, the federal government will be accelerating processes to reform regulations in the areas of food, agricultural and veterinalong ary chemicals, building codes, occupational health and safety, workers compensation and the environment. The former Industry Commission has estimated, for example, that savings of $350 million a year could be made from more efficient building regulations and a further $750 million from improved planning. Our reforms will reduce overlap and duplication, encourage greater national tency and simplify processes. We will not be pursuing uniformity for its own sake. The aim is to achieve lower compliance costs for all businesses, both large and small. Access to Finance The government recognises that small business must have adequate access to finance if it is to grow and prosper. Apart from its reforms to capital gains tax and provisional tax, the government has made it easier for banks to invest equity capital in business by changing prudential guidelines on equity investments and making the tax treatment of equity investments in small and medium sized enterprises more attractive. We have now decided to go further to encourage our small technology based firms. The high risks and long time horizons in the high technology sector justify targeted assistance. We are setting up a Small Business Innovation Fund, under which up to six early stage capital funds will be established to invest in more than 100 small high technology firms over five year. The Commonwealth will provide $130 million from the R&D Start program and private sector fund managers will be responsible for finding matching private contributions on the basis of $1 of private capital for every $2 contributed by the government. This will provide up to $200 million for investment in this growing sector the next few years. This support will provide more jobs and exports in this important and growing area of the economy. Conclusion During the election campaign we committed ourselves to the goal of reducing the burden of paperwork and red tape on small business by 50 per cent in our first term. I am confident that our response to the Bell report, with other initiatives that we have already taken, will make a substantial contribution to that objective by the end of our first term. As evidence of our good faith, we are establishing objective performance indicators which can be used to measure our efforts by June 1999. The new package will require the ongoing commitment of governments at all levels and consisregular feedback from, and constructive dialogue with, small business. I appreciate the willingness already indicated by Premiers and Chief Ministers to cooperate on matters involving Commonwealth-state regulation. I look forward, if I may say so again, to a speedy endorsement at a state level of the Commonwealth's initiatives in the area of unfair dismissal laws for small business. We recognise that we can never meet all of the expectations of one sector of the community. We have kept faith with small business and we have gone much· further in many areas than we promised before the election. We also know that the ongoing challenges which small business faces are immense and that our small business policies must be subject to a process of continuous improvement. That is why I pledge that my government will keep on listening to small business and acting on what we hear. I commend the government's response to the Bell report to the House. I present the following paper: Small Business Deregulation Task Force Report: Government Response-Ministerial Statement, 24 March 1997 Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not ing 18 minutes.",13
3,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"If there was a huge audience of small business people here-there is not, of course, because they are out earning a quid-this speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would not exactly be laying them in the aisles. If you were going to make any analytical point about this at all I suppose you could say that, in the course of the confabs that the government has had on this issue over the last few months and their delayed response to the Bell report, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has defended his turf pretty well. The only announcements that the Prime Minister has had to make, at least in so far as they impact on the budget at all, are reannouncements of statements that they in effect already made on the capital gains tax. They are re-badging what they have had to say about their R&D fund, extracting a proportion of that and now saying that that is committed to small business. When you contemplate the billions-and I will get on to this a bit later-that have been lost by small business through the changes that the government has put in place over the four-year period-the R&D tax concession elimination or reduction and the opportunities now forgone because of the changes to the export market development grants schemethis does not exactly look like the sort of financing that small businesses, particularly those in the R&D area who are the principal innovators in both our economy and our business sector, are looking for. And as for saying that election promises are kept-they are not kept. The most extraordinary feature of this is the fudging of all targets. There are one or two subliminal elements of this which I suppose we on this side of the House can take a bit of belated credit for and enjoy. The low inflationary environment to which the Prime Minister referred is one of them. That is entirely a product of the administration of this country by the Australian Labor Party over the last fiveor six-year period. But, as the Prime Minister also comprehends, this is not something which is regarded by small business with unmitigated exceed- joy. You do not go around the countryside hearing small business say to you, as you speak before them--even though you know it is in the interests of the economy overall'Thank you so much for reducing the inflation rate. Thank you so much for putting that in place.' That does not feature in their conversations with either governments or oppositions. They have very mixed views about all that. What they do seek from government, however, is not an increased inflation rate, which would be an absurd thing for them to ask for, but a set of decisions which actually meet their real needs as opposed to what government thinks they ought to be worrying about. They look for governments getting off their backs somewhat, not promises of best endeavours and undertakings. That is the sort of thing they look for and, above all, they look for a level playing field being applied to them in relation to big business. Above all, they look for that-whether they happen to be franchisees, people who are renting from shopping centres or people running petrol stations who are in competition with vertically integrated operations in the shape of the petrol companies. This is the area of massive expansion of small business. Is there a darned thing in this which makes a dime of difference to one of them? Not one. The Prime Minister was inadvertently nice to us about one other thing. He pointed out that there have been 1.2 million net jobs-in fact, two million gross jobs--created over the last decade. What an extraordinary figure for him to put in place, that extraordinary great job growth that occurred entirely when the Labor Party was in office. He pointed out that the so-called persecutors of small business in the Labor government of the day managed to preside over a situation where 90 per cent of the net jobs and 70 per cent of the gross jobs were created by small business under a Labor government-a job growth rate that operated at twice the level it did when the current Prime Minister was Treasurer. You cannot exactly say that the objective evidence is out there that smaIl business so persecuted during the period the Labor Party was in office that they could not do a thing-that they were hamstrung, hogtied and all the rest of it-when they had the biggest expansion of small business employment in Australia's history-and that was under the Labor government. They became the principal employers. During that period every employment program that we put in place, which in half-baked ways you are trying to introduce, had small business at its centre. We consulted small business on everything. We consulted members of area consultative committees which you started to abolish but then recreated--everybody from the business sector sitting on those area committees, and all of them small business people. When you go through all those job programs that providthis-that ed support for employment, you see that every one of them was going into small business with employment opportunities being created in small business. You come in here and say that exemption from the unfair dismissal law is a great concession to them. Don't you recollect when we put in place all those training places for young people? Remember, this is for young people and we were talking about a bit of reciprocal obligation with smaIl business. We said that if they were in smaIl business and putting in places that had an appropriate amount of training associated with them so young people being employed by small business were developing skills they could use for the rest of their lives, they were exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. They appreciated that. The situation they now confront is exactly the same because as we all know, as all business will tell you, behind their hands when they come up to you at meetings of big business-the Business Council, the ACCI or a bit of a mix between the two of them---{)r when you go to your area consultative committees, they say, 'Leader of the Opposition, you do realise, don't you, that the unfair dismissal laws are exactly the same as they were when you were in office?' We say, 'Yes, we do realise that. We do comprehend that.' They are exactly the same unfair disfelt missal laws, in effect, as when we were in office. There has been a small roll back by the Treasurer on fringe benefits tax-and we welcome that. That is a sensible part of this proposition. But do not think that the huge numbers of small business people are going to suddenly dance in the streets for this and say, Thank God.' This applies to six per cent of small business; 94 per cent are not involved. While that will be welcome for those six per cent, of course the other 94 per cent will just say, 'Big deal,' and go on with the business they choose to go on with. That will be very fine for them. But there are a couple of areas of small business which will not be at all pleased with is, the fudging of the principal promises. The biggest fudging of a promise is this promise on reduction. It is so hard to get targets out of this government, but they got one. We have been trying to get targets for the jobless out of this government, without success-targets for putting people in this country in work, without success. They will commit themselves to nothing. The small business community can say hallelujah about one thing: until today they had secured from the government a target. The target was that they would get a 50 per cent reduction in small businessMr Hardgrave-You're the target.",17
4,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The gentleman says that I am the target of all this. I am the target of the work for the dole scheme. I am the target of every conceivable position that your government brings out, old fellow. The only thing that matters to you is the polls. Decent government in this country does not matter to you at all. So I am the target of small business statements, I am the target of work for the dole, I am the target of every budget that you bring down because for some reason or other you have taken it into your head that the only thing you have to do is to govern in competition with me, not govern in the interests of the Australian people and develop some decent public policy. Yes, old son, I am the target. I am thoroughly well aware of the fact that I am the target as far as this piece of legislation is concerned. But what has happened to this wonderful target? The Prime Minister says: As evidence of the government's good faith, we are establishing objective perfonnance indicators which can be used to measure our efforts by June 1999. At least we got out of the Prime Minister enough of an inflection on this to actually clarify for us what is a very ambiguous statement. There are several ways of reading this. One is that you will get performance indicators by 1999; otherwise, you will get a set of tests against some performance indicators. But why are we establishing objective performance indicators? Because the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs e Mr Prosser), in answer to a question along those lines-not asked by us but I think by the member for Curtin e Mr Rocher) on the backbench, his nemesis; there is a mutual obligation on the nemesis front between the two of them-said: We have in place the benchmark to be able to give . . . the measurement of our achievement in this area. Not 'that we are establishing objective performance indicators' but 'we have in place'. Is that 50 per cent? This which has allegedly been presented to the parliament as actually in place and operating now does not exist. They are now trying to develop those indicators. And what will they do? Will they give small business the capacity to test them against that 50 per cent red tape target that they put down? Will they give them a chance to test them before the next election? No, they will report in June 1999. Why report in June 1999? Why not report in June next year? Why not report in December next year? Why not report at the end of this year? Why not report in March next year-give it a 12-month spread? Why not report after an IS-month spread-as I said, in December next year? I think there is one reason, and it is pretty obvious to those of us in politics. It is the one date they can think of guaranteed to fall after the next election. That is the significance of that date. 'Let us fudge that red tape thing right out the back door, and let us come down with a report on all of this at a time after the next election comes around. We commit ourselves to nothing.' So the one great target for small business, the one thing that they were prepared to commit themselves to while their 'so-calleds' point to the ground was that they would have 50 per cent of it removed, but there will be no objective tests. And, Mr Speaker, well might there not be because, when we look at the government's performance in terms of red tape in relation to small business as opposed to whether or not they have objective tests or anything else, we discover one or two things. I wonder what small business felt about the burdens that were imposed on them to implement the family tax initiative which could have so easily been done through the child payment system but, for ideological reasons, they did not want to do? No, small business had to be drummed out-not the Taxation Office or Department of Social Security: small business was whacked out there. Their employees were told, 'Get stuck into your boss; make sure your boss goes through all the paperwork; get that family tax initiative in place. Off you go; trundle away!' Their four hours go up to 4Y2 or five, not down to two, as they go through that particular exercise. Then there is the other little bonzer one, the superannuation surcharge. There is an outside chance we might all come to understand what it means some time between now and Christmas. I have good news for you, team: we will pass this little doozey. We will give you an opportunity to be judged on this one. We will not do what Andrew Robb and all the rest of us and you desperately hope we will do-that is, knock this one off. No, you will wear this one, and you will explain it to small business. And as for the best efforts of the member for Stirling e Mr Eoin Cameron) who has said he will vote against it, I have news for you, Eoin-they will come to nought. You will be standing in splendid isolation on all of this when this thing goes through. This will be a beaut little opportunity for you to work this one through your small business constituency and, as you put that surcharge in place, you will have an opportunity to explain to them what a fine job you have done on red tape as they go through the process of working that out. Red tape: red face. Then you have the diesel fuel rebate. What does the NFF say about that to those small business people who actually happen to be farmers or are in the agricultural industries? 'Under the present bill,' says the NFF, 'a farmer will have to keep a log book on every tractor.' That is a beaut little reduction in small business red tape, isn't it? That should really have them rocking in the aisles as they go through the opportunity to have a reduction in red tape when it comes to that little exercise! Then there is their Start scheme for R&D. This is a $120 million share of what was once a $1.2 billion tax concession. What do they do to get it? They get themselves stuck solidly into the red tape-not just signing off on their tax forms that they are claiming an R&D concession in relation to it; they have to go through the process of developing their submissions to the board. So away they go as they try to get their R&D tax concessions in place. The simple fact of the matter is that we know, as we have governed this country for a while-and you should know it by now too-that the one area of the private sector which is performing well on the R&D front is the small business area. You do not actually get it out of big business. Many big businesses are in foreign hands. Their R&D takes place in the mother country, and it comes out here maybe for a bit of Australian adjustment, but that is about the best of it. But the derful performance that we have put in place on software, the superb performance that has come about through Australian inventiveness-and day after day those inventions are announced-comes out of small business, or people about to be small businessmen. And what have they had? They have had themselves whacked over the back of the skull by a reduction in that concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, and they are supposed to dance in the aisles with thanks for the wonderful things that you have been doing with small business! I will talk about one other area, and I do not have much time to conclude on it. There was one thing that small business went on their knees to this government for after the last election, and that was for the legislation that we have put in this House but which the government does not bring on-that is, for oppressive conduct. There is a simple reason why they will not do this. The biggest growth area for small business at the moment is the franchising area. It is growing at 14 per cent per annum. It is a $42 billion per annum industry. We set up a franchising code council to administer a voluntary franchising code of practice, and gave it funding for four years. It tried to amend the Trade Practices Act to underpin the code. This code is about the oppression, potentially at least, of franchisors on the franchiseesin other words, the owners of the franchise on all the small business people. What happened with that? The council collapsed. The minister said the code could be policed by franchisors-well, that is pretty cool!-and the MTA says that this is like handing the umpire over to one side. And well they might. So this piece of potentially oppressive conduct goes straight out the window for the all fastest growing area of small business. The burden is not off them, but the burden is on them-and all their prot-ction is removed. More generally in small business, all those who are competing with vertically integrated big business companies-be they petrol station owners or people owning small fabrication operations trying to buy products off BHP, Comsteel and all the rest of them-all won- these outfits which absolutely require the effective operation of the Trade Practices Act to protect them from forms of oppressive action, have they received any comfort in these statements? Not one word. But this is what the head of the small business organisation described after the last election as their priority, the thing that they most wanted. So what we have had here is re-badging. What we have had here is not a bad initiative as far as capital gains tax is concerned, but a pretty solid defence by Treasury on the rest of it and a much worse position, net terms, for small business with all the other concessions that have gone out the window. On top of all that, as a symbol of this, we have had the fudging of the one target they set themselves-the 50 per cent reduction in small tape. (Time expired)  journed. NA Cord Blood Banks",18
5,Mr EOIN CAMERON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges developments in umbilical cord blood transplantation which can save the lives of children with leukemia and other life threatening illnesses; (2) recognises that cord blood is expensive to test, store and freeze; (3) recognises that providing Cord Blood Banks across Australia will reduce the search time for compatible bone marrow donors for children and young adults with serious blood diseases; and (4) calls on the Government, via the relevant House of Representatives committee, to investigate the costs and feasibility of lishing Cord Blood Banks in each State and Territory, in conjunction with the relevant State or Territory government, hospitals and interested professional and community organisations. This motion is about providing biological insurance for children. Obviously, this insurance does not assist with the payment of bills. It is about storing a resource-a resource which was previously disposed of-as a lifesaving treatment for leukemia and other life threatening illnesses in children. The substance of this motion is about seeking to provide the infrastructure to store a resource that can give kids another chance when they would otherwise be facing death. Leukemia is a dreadful disease for anyone. It is even more distressing, though, when a child is fighting it. In my time in the media, I have been associated with Telethon and Appealathon in Perth, which raise money for children's health. As part of this, one is able to see the children our fundraising assists. To see young kids fighting these insidious diseases is just unfair. They do not deserve it and it defies logic that these young, innocent children can have their lives taken from them at such a young age because of these diseases. The least we can do when something comes forward which can be beneficial in helping these kids and save their lives is to encourage the development of the research, provide the necessary infrastructure to see the research to fruition and, if necessary, ensure the funding is in place to make sure the concept gets off the ground and remains in place so that something that can save lives is not left in the too-hard basket or the too-expensive basket. Baby cord blood is one such item which cannot be left in the too-hard or too-expensive basket. Nor should the government not play any role in seeing this new development get off the ground. We have a responsibility to playa role so that we give those kids fighting diseases another chance or, at least, the very best chance possible. Previously in treating leukemia, patients were, if the right match was found, given a bone marrow transplant. The problem with such transplants was that often a suitable estab- match was unable to be found and the patient died whilst waiting for a suitable match. Research has found that the blood from the umbilical cord of newborn babies can be used in place of bone marrow. Cord blood is considered to be an exciting new resource in medicine. The reason cord blood is considered to be so valuable and important is that it contains stem cells. These are the building blocks of the blood and immune system and a vital component in the treatment of many life threatening diseases such as leukemia. Previously, the only form of treatment utilising stem cells has been with bone marrow, which has various problems even when a match is found. Furthermore, unlike umbilical cord blood, bone marrow treatment is said to be painful and invasive, it is expensive to collect and it is extremely difficult to match donors and recipients. What is more, patients who have had an umbilical cord blood transplant have a higher rate of survival, a better quality of life after the transplant and less frequent hospitalisation due to complications as compared with bone marrow transplants. On 27 September last year, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services issued a media release following the opening of the first National Cord Blood Conference. He concluded by saying: In 1995 a seriously ill boy in NewcastJ- d--perately required a bone marrow transplant but despite checking something like 3.5 million donors on worldwide registers there was no suitable donor '0 be found. Upon checking one cord blood bank, 10 possible donations were found and today, some 10 months later, that boy is well and has a much brighter future. That is but one example of many that I have heard of in the success of this new and exciting treatment. As this motion recognises, umbilical cord blood transplantation is an important and major development in fighting potentially fatal diseases like leukemia. Obviously, the use of umbilical cord blood is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, the research conducted thus far and the results arising from the research and the actual use of the cord blood indicate the future use of it provides an exciting and optimistic future for its application in medicine, not just with children but also with adults. I am informed, for example, that the stem cells can also provide a match for the mother in treating a variety of diseases, including gynaecological and breast cancer. Currently, one of the developing areas in stem cell technology is the research into gene therapy to treat AIDS. This motion could perhaps have alluded to the progress in research for the application of cord blood in treating adults. I have been advised as follows by W. Beresford of Royal Perth Hospital: Research is being undertaken to attempt to expand the number of stem cells in the cord blood by many laboratories (including RPH) so that the cord blood stem cell numbers could be increased in number sufficient to be effective in adults. Dr Andrew Cumming, of the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, has provided similar advice: ... the available blood in one donation is only sufficient to provide treatment to paediatric or very small adults. There is, however, the potential in a few years time for the cells to be cultured and provide a possible therapy for adult patients. This is certainly a positive development and offers optimism for the future development of this area of medicine. Notwithstanding the benefits of cord blood, it should be remembered that. it is also expensive to test, store and freeze. The ac!vice I have received from Dr Cumming is that approximately $700 is ne-ded fm :!ach cord blood to be tested, frozen and stored. Dr Cumming also mentioned that this does not include any follow-up testing which may be required on the blood or tIle donor and that, in Western Australia for example-on present advice-a bank of 5,000 donations would be the minimum requirement, which translates to a cost of $3.5 million. Dr Cumming further advised that it was anticipated that it would take approximately four to five years to collect and store this amount of blood in Western Australia. I note that the government has already provided $200,000 in a grant to the Australian Cord Blood Bank to evaluate the importance of cord blood banks in Australia. This is something, I am sure, which would be welcomed by anyone interested in children's health, and I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for making the funding available. I do not think the importance of blood banks is in question. What needs to be considered in any evaluation are the costs and feasibility of establishing cord blood banks across the country-whether it is necessary to have one in each state, to have them in selected states or just to utilise the Australian Cord Blood Bank. When it comes to searching for compatible donors, I am informed that, with searches being computerised, it should not be slower to find a compatible donor in another state or, for that matter, another country. Therefore, this poses, firstly, the question: is cord blood an appropriate medical resource-which I think it is-and, secondly, what is the feasibility of establishing cord banks in Australia, and where should they be established? Obviously, the costs and feasibility of establishing cord blood banks in each patients state and territory should be addressed-I have already mentioned the logistics of doing this in Western Australia. While I am not advocating these banks be established in all states and territories, we need to have a bank or banks established where they are available to treat all Australian children. We have in Australia, that I know of, the Australian Cord Blood Bank. The Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital is raising money for such a bank and I note that there is a move in Western Australia to establish bank involving the Red Cross blood transfuthe sion service as the storer of frozen cord blood-the collection being through the obstetric services at King Edward Memorial Hospital. Decision makers at these hospitals will obviously be affected by whether any evaluation or investigation recommends one or a number of banks and by where the funding-if any-comes from, when decide whether they maintain the bank or pool resources at just the one bank. In evaluation, it is also necessary to look where the recurrent funding will come from. While we all know that both the federal and state governments have limited funds, we need to look at how this will remain viable. More than likely, there would need to be little some government involvement. In conclusion, cord blood is landfill at rubbish tips at present, when-as we have proven here in Australia and overseas-it does have the potential to save lives. We need to look at protecting this resource with the process. same enthusiasm with which we seek to protect our natural resources in this great nation of ours. To return to my motion's wording, the motion: (1) acknowledges developments in umbilical cord blood transplantation which can save the of children with leukemia and other life threatening illnesses; (2) recognises that cord blood is expensive to store and freeze; (3) recognises that providing Cord Blood Banks across Australia will reduce the search time for compatible bone marrow donors for dren and young adults with serious diseases; and (4) calls on the Government, via the relevant subject: House of Representatives committee, to investigate the costs and feasibility of estabseems lishing Cord Blood Banks in each State and Territory, in conjunction with the relevant State or Territory government, hospitals and interested professional and community organisations. I recommend to anyone who is interested in the subject of cord blood banks that, if they have-or can get-access to the Internet, it is something worthwhile doing. I managed to retrieve a quite extensive amount of information from the Internet just this morning, a including some quite extensive material from University of Arizona's Health Sciences Centre. If anyone would like further information on that, they can contact my office. I commend the motion to the House.",21
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded? Mrs Johnston-I second the motion and they reserve my right to speak.,23
7,Mr GRIFFIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I any would like to start by congratulating the at member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) for bringing this motion before the House. I will admit ignorance of the detail of this issue until I saw the motion on the Notice Paper. But, in the brief time that I have had to do a research on the issue, I have found it a fascinating subject and something that, as the father of three children, I admit I have been somewhat remiss about myself: I recall that I cut the umbilical cord of my last child-if only I had realised what I was wasting in the The motion is timely-it is something that this parliament should debate-and it raises some important issues. We can all agree on one thing: the question of an umbilical cord blood bank is an issue of national importance lives and international significance. It ought to be progressed as effectively as it can be, although noting the issues that the member for test, Stirling mentioned around the question of feasibility and location, et cetera. I will kick-off with a couple of paragraphs chilfrom a number of articles on this issue. One blood is in LAB News of September 1995 and encapsulates some of the background to this First it was bottles and cans, then paper, now it blood could be the next resource to find a place as a recycled product. Not your regular adult variety with its reactive properties, antibodies to past infections and possibly viruses, but the unsullied blood produced by a foetus in the womb and normally lost following birth when the placenta is discarded. Up to 250 mL of this valuable resource is contained within the placenta and umbilical cord after the baby is delivered. So called ""cord blood"" is rich in bone marrow stem cells, the precursors of various types of blood cells, and is ideal as a way to treat disorders in children such as leukaemia, thalassaemia, aplastic anaemia and a myriad of genetic diseases. Cord blood is also less reactive than the bone marrow used at present in the treatment of these conditions. Donor marrow contains lymphocytes that often look upon the patient's own blood and tissue as foreign. These donated cells attack this alien matter causing the severe and often fatal reaction graft-versus-host disease. The new Australian Cord Blood Bank at the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital in Sydney is the first organisation in this country to exploit the benign nature of cord blood in the management of critically ill children. The Bank, officially opened on June 19, will collect about 3000 donations over the next three years. This blood will be made available to physicians and scientists throughout the country and overseas for further research into the benefits of cord blood transplantation. Many children with conditions affecting the bone marrow die for the lack of a substitute for bone marrow transplantation. This is where cord blood can have greatest impact. ""In Australia, 40 to 50 children each year are likely to benefit from cord blood transplants,"" said paediatric oncologist Professor Marcus Vowels, co-director of the fledgling bank. ""As many as 25 of these will be patients with leukaemia who don't have suitable donors."" The non-invasive nature and safety of cord blood donations should encourage mothers to agree to the blood being collected. They will be given all relevant information about cord blood and its uses and be asked to sign a consent form. In cases where mothers wish to take the placenta home with the child for cultural reasons, it may be possible to extract the cord blood and then return the placenta to meet the mother's cultural needs. Although cord blood is less reactive than bone marrow and does not need to be perfectly matched to the recipient, donations from all cultural groups will be necessary to provide a comprehensive bank with blood types suitable for all children with bone marrow disorders. Professor Vowels said that it is very likely in the future that all mothers would be prepared to donate cord blood. This is a resource with a tremendous potential for children with diseases affecting the bone marrow, so we should make the most of it. The first cord blood transplant was performed in 1988 in Paris, France. The patient was a five-year old boy with Fanconi anaemia who is alive and disease free today. Since then, cord blood transplants have been successfully performed on patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myelocytic leukaemia, nueroblastoma, juvenile chronic myelogenous leukaemia and a range of other diseases that I am afraid I am incapable of pronouncing. Although early cord blood transplants involved only sibling donors and recipients, 90 transplants were performed between August 1993 and November 1995 using cord blood from an unrelated donor. In most cases, the cord blood donors and transplant recipients were not HLA matched-that is, proteins on the surface of white blood cells, HLA antigens, that play an important role in transplantation were not identical. Despite the mismatch, the transplants have been successful. Some of that information is from BMT Newsletter. To put this in the context of the personal I would like to quote from an article in the Australian regarding the launch of the Cord Blood Bank. It states: In an auspicious start to her life, six-day-old Claudia Granneman has paved the way for a revolutionary technique in treating leukaemia and congenital diseases in children. Claudia and her mother, Ms Anne Mortimer, are the first donors to Australia's first bank collecting blood from the umbilical cord, which was opened in Sydney yesterday. The Australian Cord Blood Bank-the first outside the United States-will collect the placentas from the more than 258,000 births every year Australia in the ultimate form of recycling. Professor Vowels performed the first transplant in Australia of related cord blood on a boy, now aged eight, in October 1991 who was born with a genetic immune deficiency which usually kills children in the first 10 years of life. ""His brother died at six years from the disease ... but he's alive, well and cured,"" Professor Vowels said. ""We have a rich resource that is currently being discarded. "" Professor Vowels said the blood could benefit 100-150 Australians each year unable to find donors of bone marrow on the international registry. In addition, of the 180 children in Australia and New Zealand diagnosed every year with leukaemia, about 30 children were left with no option after not responding to drug therapy and unable to receive a bone marrow transplant. I have quoted extensively because this issue is quite technical in nature and does require the wording of others on some occasions to actually encapsulate the information in the time that I have. But certainly what we do have here is a tremendous opportunity and something that should be supported by both sides of the chamber. I also congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for the government's initiative of some $200,000 last year to help kick off the funding required. My understanding is that something like $500,000 is required to get this bank up and running. I am unaware of the detail in terms of where fundraising is at at this stage, but I certainly hope it is an initiative that all Australians get behind. There is nothing like the death of a child and the possibility of saving that child from death as an initiative that we see as positive for our future. As I understand it, the proposed cost of this in the Australian context will be negligible. This contrasts with the cost, prior to the setting up of the bank, of something in the region of $28,000 per person to arrange for the importation of the necessary material from the United States. As I mentioned earlier, one of the advantages of this particular type of transplant is that at the moment with bone marrow the circumstances are-and I am no technical expert, but I will ramble on a bit-that there are something like six components of bone marrow which are required for a match. For bone marrow to be transplanted a six-six match is required in terms of the bone marrow components. The situation with cord blood is that, because it is newer and has not developed all the various biases and viruses that our bodies develop over time and we develop over time, it has a certain naivety which makes it of much greater significance. On that basis, there have been successful matches with cord blood where only three in six of the components have been required. This therefore means that somewhere in the region of maybe only 100 cord blood samples should be required to get a match for anyone individual. That is great news for people with children who are suffering from this type of disease. It gives them a real chance at life. The other thing I was interested to find out is that the stem cells, even though they are injected into a vein, which is the normal process, head straight for the bone marrow. So they are quite clever in that respect; they know where they live. The situation the last I had heard was that there had been three cord blood transplants in Sydney-two within families and one unrelated-and they had all been successful. The condition has a capacity to be expanded in terms of a range of different types of gene therapy. This means we are really seeing the commencement of a form of medical revolution which can relate to seriously improving the chances for our children to live longer lives. I congratulate all those involved with the motion. I think it sets out a process for the future in terms of proceeding with this and I commend it to the House. (Time expired)",23
8,Mrs JOHNSTON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise today to support the motion on the benefits of baby cord blood standing in the name of the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). In doing so I add my support to the concept of setting up an inquiry to determine the suitability of using baby cord blood in helping to save lives. A brief look at the history of this subject tells us, as the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) has also already suggested, that the first successful human cord blood transplant took place in France in 1988 on a child with Fanconi anaemia. It was in France again, in 1991, where another successful transplant was performed on a child with chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Since that first operation in 1988, there has been the development of cord blood banks both in the United States and in a number of European countries. These banks are linked with each other not only to enhance the matching process but also to facilitate an ongoing exchange of dialogue and information. Closer to home in Australia, I understand that some 500 collections are now stored in Sydney. It was here that a cord blood transplant program was established some four to five years ago at the Sydney Children's Hospital under Professor Marcus Vales. Closer still, in my home state of Western Australia, one cord blood transplant has taken place at Princess Margaret Hospital. As a nurse I have cared for many children with leukaemia and I do indeed welcome any breakthrough that will save these kids' lives. When arguing for or against the merits of using cord blood there are different schools of thought. Many clinicians and researchers, for obvious reasons, take a cautious approach and, generally, I would agree with this. They readily acknowledge the benefits of cord blood transplants in cases involving related donors and recipients, such as family members. But they have doubts about the value of cord blood, within the limits of current clinical knowledge, where the donor and recipients are unrelated. Some also hold the view that there is little benefit from a proliferation of cord blood banks throughout Australia. Many great benefits can be derived from the use of cord blood, but we should advance these in conjunction with correct clinical knowledge and practice, not development in advance of it. Let me briefly outline the possible ges of cord blood use. Human cord blood is a valuable source of stem cells which normally exist in the bone marrow. These stem cells generate the functional cells of the blood and immune systems. Cord blood can thus be seen as an alternative to the use of bone marrow. The process of retrieval of bone marrow is invasive. It is painful and it may often require a general anaesthetic. However, cord blood is obtained without risk or pain and uses a by-product of the birth process which is normally discarded. Another advantage of cord blood is that it can be stored for a number of years and that its collecting and storing is logistically easy. It has been argued that there may be less risk in cord blood transplants of infectious disease transplantations, such as HIV and other viral diseases. It has also been suggested that there may be fewer side effects from cord blood transplants, especially in relation to graft versus host disease. However, some people claim that the conditioning regime and drug programs for cord blood transplants between unrelated donor and patients are very similar. The range of uses for cord blood is wide, including treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. Time does not allow me to mention them all, but many members will be familiar with the traumatic effects that diseases such as mUltiple myeloma, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, neuroblastoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, aplastic anaemia, Fanconi's anaemia, Hunter's syndrome and, most importantly, osteoporosis, have on people. I believe that one of the most excttmg developing areas in stem cell technology is the research into gene therapy, which was alluded to by the member opposite, to treat people who are infected with the AIDS virus. Cord blood also shows promise for the treatment of metastatic cancer and in molecular medicine, whereby defective genes are replaced with functional genes for diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, haemophilia and many others. In summing up the advantages of cord blood, let me quote Mr John Wagner, who is the Director of the cord blood transplant advantaprogram at the University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinic in the USA: Collecting cord blood poses no risks or discomfort for the donor. Moreover cord blood is rarely contaminated by viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr (EBV) that can cause serious problems for the transplant patient. I made reference earlier to Sydney currently having a bank of 500 deposits. Many other Australian capital cities are now also looking at establishing cord blood banks. (Time expired)",25
9,Mr FITZGIBBON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Hunter) (l.34 p.m.)The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Alan Ramsey, in his article in that paper's Saturday edition, devoted some time to talking about priorities in this place and the fact that the perception in the community that sometimes our priorities are misguided does not do much for the perception amongst those people of politicians. I think it is fair to say that it is motions such as this, which of course has attracted bipartisan support today, that I think help to lift that standard, at least in the eyes of the Australian community. I congratulate the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) for putting forward the motion, one which I am happy to speak to and to lend my support to. The umbilical cord blood bank infrastructure which the member for Stirling seeks to have established would capitalise on one of the marvels of nature and would expand on the very good work already being done by those at the Australian Cord Blood Bank which, along with the work done at the Sydney Children's Hospital, has already provided a number of young children with another chance at life. I do not think that there could be an issue before the parliament any more important than that. The new science has enormous advantages over the traditional method of replenishing stem cells, which many members have made reference to. It is not necessary for me to go over it again now other than to say that those stem cells are attacked by the very treatment that doctors prescribe for the leukaemia and other diseases. The decimation of those cells is an unfortunate implication of those treatments. As a father of three young children, I often wonder how strong I would be if I were called upon to deliver one of my own children for chemotherapy or some other similar treatment if they were to become ill with one of those devastating diseases. How difficult it would be to attempt to explain to a child so young that he or she is being regularly presented for this treatment for his or her own good. I think it would be absolutely one of the worse nightmares for a parent of a child of any age. It would be exacerbated considerably if, at the end of all that, there were some complication with stem cells and if, as a result of a lack of government commitment, the child were not able to access that new technology. I think that would be very sad indeed and a most traumatic situation for any family or any parent. We are not talking today about doubt about the long-term success of the procedure. We are not talking about doubt about the commitment of health professionals working in the area. We are simply talking about the doubt of governments' commitment to the funding of this new technology. It is fair to say that the motion of the government member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) does recognise that the government has made some commitment in its $200,000 announcement last year-something I would also like to take the opportunity to recognise and to support-but the commitment is less than is necessary to ensure that all Australians, and in particular young Australians, are afforded the opportunity to access this very important new technology. The House does not have to take my word for that. One needs only to listen to a tape or read a transcript of the Science Program of 3 February on Radio National last year. On it, the coordinator of the Australian Cord Blood Bank, Kerrie Carlton, made it quite clear that the major hurdle facing her team and all those involved in the industry, if I can call it that, is the question of funding. It would be a tragic shame if even one child in this country was denied a second chance because of a lack of commitment on the part of this or any other government, be it federal or state. This is a remarkable breakthrough that our health professionals have made. The member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) has also already mentioned how it is that rather than have to make six matches as in the case of bone marrow transplants-(Time expired)",27
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Nehl)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.,27
11,Mr HICKS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (l) expresses its strong support for Australia's teachers; (2) notes its concern at the greater responsibilities and increasing stress being placed on teachers because of many social factors, including disintegration of many of Australia's families and resulting lack of discipline within school environment; and (3) recommends that more authority be given teachers so that teachers and their students not placed in danger and teachers can get on with the job of educating those students who wish to be taught. The motion put forward today expressing support for Australia's teachers and citing reasons, which should be self-evident, for the need for that support is an extremely importthat ant matter for the future well-being of nation. Unfortunately, in the short time. I have I can only just brush the surface of the subprimary ject, which is very complex and touches on very broad area of human behaviour. There is no doubt that we live in a time of great change, and probably one of the greatest changes taking place is within our family structures and is being caused by dysfunctional families and family breakdown. There is enormous vulnerability in the family today and, while many argue that children are not affected by parental divorce or separation, statistics tell a different story, particularly relation to discipline, psychological difficulinappropriate ties and health related problems. This comes even more acute when the single achievement. parent is unemployed. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures reveal the number of parents with dependent children has grown from 173,700 in 1975 to a massive 463,800than nearly half a million-in June 1995. There has also been a change in the way people live and react to one another. It is argued that competition and consumerism literacy have replaced humanistic and more social societal forms such as the family and religion. Many informal support mechanisms no longer exist and individuals are becoming more isolated in their local communities. The fear of not having the skills to compete or live Teachers to the perceived standards of others causes alienation for many people. These are not the only causes of disciplinary problems being faced by educators but are a few of the many. Throughout the community, many parents feel they are unable to exert appropriate discipline on their children because of their personal situation or interventhe tion from one source or another or, for many reasons, they simply refuse to exert discipline. the As a result, there is now tremendous pressure being placed on our teaching system, which to expects teachers to be not only the educators are but also most of what a parent should be. As we would all be aware, this is particularly so in the nation's secondary schools. The House of Representatives Standing Committee the on Employment, Education and Training stated in their report entitled Sticks and stones teachers are reporting that junior primary our students and girls are now more likely to involved in antisocial behaviour. I recall a school I visited having a student sit a on the roof of the school for the whole day with no-one being able to entice him down. I am aware of another teacher who was assaulted by students in her class. She was told her services were no longer required in the short term while the students received counselling. The report says that some teachers link violent and antisocial behaviour with poor academic achievement and low self-esteem. in The teachers believe that students exhibiting behaviour have low self-esteem beas a result of low literacy and academic The committee's previous reports-Literacy sole needs and the workplace and The literacy challenge-identified respectively that more one million Australians were illiterate, about 35 per cent of whom were native English speakers, and between 10 and 30 per cent of children finished primary school with problems. The students at risk component of the national equity program administered by DEETYA funded a project in 1993 for at risk students which addressed illiteracy. The funding proposal stated that illiteracy is often one of the root causes of many other up problems such as homeless children, teenage suicide, violence and young offenders against the law. The ability to read and write is so tied up with the child's self-esteem and confidence that people who work in the field see these problems starting to emerge as early as infant school and escalating as they approach the high school years. That is one reason why, after decades of experimentation by social engineers, I welcome the federal government's moves, in partnership with the states, to test for literacy and numeracy skills and to direct additional financial resources to ensuring all Australian students are competent in these skills. The majority of evidence suggests that inappropriate behaviour is identifiable in children as early as preschool and kindergarten. Changing a child's behaviour patterns after the age of eight requires significantly more resourcing with reduced chances of success than if the problem is addressed in the earliest schooling years. Given the ever increasing number of dysfunctional families in Australia, one can seen how difficult this situation becomes. If a child is not guided in the right direction at an early age, that student, right through his or her student life, can make things extremely difficult for themselves, their fellow students and certainly for the teacher, where the buck always seems to stop. In recent times of great unemployment, many students who would normally have obtained work after year 10 have continued to stay at school, especially with the implementation of Austudy. Austudy, while well intentioned and certainly needed, has encouraged a number of poorly motivated students to remain at school because attendance is the only criteria for payment. I recall a teacher telling me of one such student whose great trick to impress the crowd was breaking the legs off plastic chairs at the back of the classroom.",28

NA War Service Loans,29
13,Mr SA WFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise on a matter of importance to the ex-service men and women of Australia. Veterans entitled to a war service loan under the defence service home scheme are one group in the community not to have benefited from the drop in home loan interest rates. When interest rates some years ago were high, the interest payable on war service loans was set at a rate much lower than the going variable rate. But, as the variable rate has dropped, the rate on war service loans has remained virtually static. There is now little difference between the variable rate available to the general public and the rate which is payable on the defence service loan-which currently stands at 6.85 per cent. Given the spedal contribution of veterans to this country, I believe veterans deserve better. The rate on war service loans should be set at a certain number of percentage points below the general rate in order that it reflect that special service. Alternatively, veterans should also be given the opportunity to cash out their loans so that they can put the cash towards home maintenance or home improvements. Many veterans may find this much more beneficial than continuing with the loans--even at a lower rate. They should be given a choice between continuing with a loan at an interest rate pegged a few percentage points below the going rate, or cash. The cost to the government would not be great. The maximum loan is $25,000 and the cost, at current rates, is probably about $10,000 to $12,000 over the life of the loan. Pegging the interest rate for war service loans a few points below the variable rate and offering veterans the chance to cash out the benefit would ensure that veterans are treated with the respect they deserve. I urge the government to act on this proposal. Australian Public Service: Experiential Training",29
14,Mr MUTCH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to raise a matter of public concern regarding the use of experiential training by the Commonwealth public sector. Recently a constituent of mine who works at ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, brought to my attention an internal memorandum dated 5 February 1997 advising of 'an integrated program of team building beginning by using experiential learning techniques at Silver Wattle', which is a training facility at Bungendore, New South Wales, near Canberra. The memorandum states: The Silver Wattle experience is fast becoming of the folklore of ANSTO and we are now rolling out the program to leaders across ANSTO. My constituent, who has not himself undertaken the experience, asked me whether such courses are a valid use of taxpayers' funds. I have written to the minister seeking advice on the details of the courses undertaken by ANSTO employees at Silver Wattle. My concern is about the types of courses being offered to the executives of ANSTO. I ask the government to investigate these experiential courses, to examine their content, to find out if they are accredited and if they have proper curricula suitable for the training of public servants. Of some concern to me is the fact that the convenor of the Silver Wattle experience is Peter Ring, who himself attributed the success of Silver Wattle to the influence of Ken Dyers, the leader of an organisation known as Kenja, which portrays itself as a provider of personal development courses but which I would describe unequivocally as a cult whose leader claims that his method can free people from their 'inner repressed psychological blocks'. (Time expired) Blacktown Senior Citizens",29
15,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Sunday I had the pleasure of attending the Blacktown Council's senior citizens luncheon and concert to celebrate Senior Citizens Week in New South Wales. Over 600 senior citizens from local nursing homes and senior citizens organisations from the Blacktown local government area were in attendance. Our nonEnglish speaking background senior citizens were well represented, with people from the Filipino, Egyptian and Sudanese communities in attendance. I believe that it is important that senior citizens remain in the mainstream of our community life as these people have a lot to offer Australia in general because of their wisdom and experience. The highlight of the function was the awarding of the Blacktown Senior Citizen of the Year award for 1997 to Conchita Soriana, President of the Filipino Golden Citizens organisation in Blacktown. Conchita came to Australia in 1986 with her late husband, part Antonio. Since that time Conchita has been involved in numerous local organisations but most particularly as the President of the Filipino Golden Citizens Club, of which she was a foundation member with her late husband. Conchita is also involved in the United Justices Association, Civil Marriage Celebrants, the Doonside Neighbourhood Centre and the Senior Citizens Advisory Committee of Blacktown council, to name just a few. Conchita is a very active local worker both within the Filipino and the general community and is a worthy recipient of the Blacktown Senior Citizen of the Year award. State Bank of South Australia",30
16,Ms WORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The people of South Australia continue to suffer after being king-hit by Labor's double whammy. South Australians are shelling out $83,000 every hour of every day of the year to service failed State Bank bail-out borrowings. The debt now stands at $4.3 billion. This is on top of the Beazley $8 billion black hole. Think of what this money could have been used forhospitals, schools, better roads and infrastructure. Premier Olsen has recently estimated that these funds could have been used to build four Alice Springs to Darwin railways and link South Australia to new export opportunities. It could have undergrounded overhead cables throughout most of Adelaide. It could have provided world leading medical and educational services to all South Australians. But what is Labor's response? They will not even support the Liberal government's attempt to undo the mess with more responsible public spending, let alone apologise to the people of South Australia. That is why there are so few Labor members in this chamber, and so few in the state parliament. South Australian taxpayers have been saddled with one huge financial mess. Many years into the future South Australians will still be missing out on much needed government services. This is Labor's shameful legacy. Watson, Ms Bonnie",30
17,Mr WILTON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to draw the attention of the federal parliament to the selfless community activities of a highly respected Isaacs constituent, Bonnie Watson. Despite suffering significant tragedy and hardship in her life, Bonnie, who now lives alone, has devoted much of her life to her beloved community of Carrum Downs. In fact, I would suggest that she loves that community as much as it loves her. Bonnie has been actively involved in number of community based organisations and efforts. I will list just a few: she has the Vice-President of the Carrum Downs Progress Association; she started the local Neighbourhood Watch; she started the Carrum Downs over-55s and Senior Cits; she was actively involved on the steering committee responsible for the construction of the Lyrestand. bird Community Centre and Library; she helped to organise Teens on the Move, a club to get kids off the local streets; she was motivator behind what is known locally Kids Rock held every three months-a dance where local bands are able to play-and she also fought for the completion of the widenthose ing of Hall Road, being the major thoroughthat fare through Carrum Downs. There is no doubt that Carrum Downs owes a debt to Bonnie Watson. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all its residents in thanking her for her tireless efforts. We wish her tinued success in her endeavours and acknowexhibition ledge, as a token of our appreciation, all she has done for the community. Cooma: Closure of Sawmill and Gaol",31
18,Mr NAIRN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, tion I want to inform the House that the one and only sawmill in Cooma, in my electorate, forced to stand down its 13 employees last week. This is a result of the New South Wales Labor government continuing to break the agreed regional forests agreement process. The problem is that the New South Wales Labor government has found that it cannot keep its contractual responsibilities and is having difficulty providing resource. Recently, we saw Bob Carr gloating as he announced a national park in the south-east of 90,000 hectares, an announcement that totally preempted the scientific process. His agenda is to destroy the hardwood industry by locking everything up before all the appropriate studies are completed. He even has the state forests providing resource now out of Victoria. So we might see Jeff Kennett putting in a bid for New South Wales state forests very soon. This disastrous announcement for Cooma, for the loss of their mill, comes on top of another New South Wales Labor government a decision which will see the Cooma gaol closed. Cooma gaol runs at a profit. It is been specifically for sex offenders and has an excellent record when it comes to re-offenders. The number of re-offenders is very low. I will say more about this closure at another time, as it is a decision by the New South Wales government that no-one can underThese two examples are, yet again, exama ples that the New South Wales Labor governas ment is, firstly, working to an agenda to satisfy the extreme greens in the urban areas and, secondly, that it is only concerned with in city areas, thus adding to the theory 'NSW' means 'Newcastle, Sydney, Wollongong'. East Timor: Photographic Exhibition",31
19,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to condraw the parliament's attention to the photo being hosted on the first floor this that week by Parliamentarians for East Timor. Today I attended the launch of the exhibition by Tom Uren, my friend and former work colleague, and Paddy Keneally. This exhibiis timely because it highlights the contributions of the Timorese to the Australians was who fought on Timor during the Second World War. Anyone who sees these photographs will have to acknowledge the great debt which all Australians owe the Timorese people-a debt which, unfortunately, has not been repaid in an appropriate manner. I think it is timely that Australia reconsider our position on the East Timorese question. It is timely that we support some self-determination for East Timor and consider the plight of refugees currently seeking asylum in Australia in the light of the debt that we owe them, given their contribution to sustaining Australian soldiers during World War II. Wong Sue, Mr Jack",31
20,Mr BILSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Jack Wong Sue is a very special veteran and is the subject of a 55-minute human interest documentary being co-produced by Melbourne's Blackwood Films and a local journalist, Keith Platt. Jack grew up in Perth during the 1930s to Cantonese parents and was subject to a number of racial taunts right throughout his life. In 1942 he sought to enlist but, at 16, was too young. Instead, he ended up spending a period at sea on a Norwegian fuel tanker, commonly known as a floating bomb, before training again to enlist, first with the navy, who rejected him because his father was Chinese, and secondly with the RAAF. He was accepted by the RAAF, not for a cockpit position because of his poor eyesight, but because he had experience at sea. He was involved in a rescue unit. He later became part of the Z Force operative team that was doing clandestine and dangerous assignments in the Pacific. His history is very exciting and a very interesting example of how people of non-Australian background have made a substantial contribution to this nation. I would encourage both the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to consider contributing some money towards the documentary for its production and then subsequent broadcast on the SBS Cutting Edge series. It is an example of what a great contribution people can make to our country, regardless of their skin colour and cultural heritage, and his story deserves to be told and heard by as many people as possible. Muswellbrook Underground Coalmine",32
21,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Two weeks ago th- Muswellbrook underground coalmine in my electorate closed its doors and 52 miners lost their jobs. The closure was due in no way to the fault of any government but rather was due to geo-technical problems and associated safety issues. But this government can do something to help those displaced coal miners, who are now at risk, in my view, of becoming long-term unemployed. While as members of the United Mine Workers Union they will have first crack at job vacancies within their industry, they will enjoy no exemption from the now very rigorous examinations that those seeking to enter the mining industry face when applying for such jobs. Many of those who worked at the Muswellbrook underground mine have been there for many years and have worked in no other industry. As a result, they enjoy very limited educational standards. I believe there is a special case here for granting the miners who lost their jobs at the Muswellbrook underground mine immediate classification for case management so that they can be skilled up in order that they might face those examinations and interviews at other mines with some confidence and with some enhanced ability. Transport Funding: Frail Aged",32
22,Dr NELSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Warwick Try is not a household name, but it should be. In some North Shore Sydney homes he provides a service that is essential to life itself. As so often is the case, Warwick takes out responsibilities that should be borne by government and responsible communities. Warwick Try owns and operates the North Shore Community Bus. While few of us would know of its existence, those who do and whose loved ones rely on it for transport understand that this service saves them from isolation. The North Shore Community Bus comprises a fleet of predominantly wheelchair-equipped buses. It transports people who are frail, elderly and disabled, who need special care and attention. Its passengers are those who see the service not only as access to shopping, church services, health services, and so on the things that we take for granted-but as a lifeline from the despair of loneliness. Mr Try has spent $1 million of his small company's money over the last decade subsidising this servire. Frankly, I find it absurd that, in New South Wales, the taxi tariff concession scheme will enable a disabled person to get a 50 per cent discount when they use a taxi but not when they get onto a bus accredited to provide services for such people. Frankly, it is embarrassing to be part of a system that guarantees funding for the Olympic Games, but-(Time expired)",32
23,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed earlier today the time for members statements has concluded. NA Superannuation",33
24,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I ask whether the Treasurer recalls that the coalition's superannuation policy released in February last year just before the last election contained the following unequivocal coalition promises: A coalition government will provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 budget to match compulsory contributions according to the pI""?po-ed schedule, will deliver this government contnbutlOn into superannuation or like savings. And, again: We will deliver the full benefit of the proposed contribution. How can the Treasurer now justify spending any less than $4.5 billion on superannuation or like savings? This is not Paul Keating's promise; it is his.",33
25,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have always made clear, the government reserves the right to determine, and will determine in the context of the forthcoming budget, what it does to promote savings vehicles. I can certainly inform the House that we are not enamoured of a proposal that was put forward by the Labor Party in May 1995-never have been. It was unfair to low income earners. It had no way of working. With all these crocodile te.as about compliance costs for superannuation funds, what would the compliance costs have been for superannuation funds who would have been required to keep an account for every single person who made an employee contribution, and report it to the government, and get a matching contribution, and have an exchange of tax file numbers, and run an account accordingly? There was no way in which it could work. The public service knew there was no way in which it could work. Every time. I see these crocodile tears in the Labor Party about how they really do support the superannuation surcharge, but they do not, I think of the way in which that scheme could never have worked. Let me disclose to the Leader of the Opposition one other part of that scheme. I assume you still support that scheme; is that right?",33
26,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Absolutely.,33
27,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, absolutely. Let me tell him what an integral part of that scheme was. An integral part of that scheme was a one per cent deduction from every employee's salary from 1 July 1997. Are you still in favour of it? It was to be introduced on 1 July 1997, and Labor policy confirmed again today taking one per cent out of the after tax employee wages from 1 July rising to two per cent out of the after tax employee contribution from July 1998 and rising to a three per cent deduction out of the after tax income of battlers from 1 July 1999. It is no wonder the battlers voted coalition. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the Treasurer not aware that this money is going straight back into people's own savings accounts? That is the basis for them. Why does he not acknowledge the relevance",33
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,33
29,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad he rose to his feet because he has obviously not anticipated until now that it is Labor Party policy from 1 July 1997 to deduct one per cent from employee pay packets. That is L-bor's policy. It will rise to two per cent and rIse to three per cent, confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition today and Laurie. That is why the battlers voted for the coalition in the election, and we will not let them down.",33
30,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise to ask a supplementary question. Is the Tr-asure- not aware that you can provide for thIS entIrely via a rebate process and that his view of the complexities associated with this is the product of his mucking up of the superannuation scheme he is currently dealing with?",33
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The supplementary qll'':stion is disallowed. Small Business: Coalition Commitments,34
32,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that today marks the beginning of a new phase in the rela.tionship between governme-t and small b-sIlless and fulfils the commItment made III the election campaign? What are the benefits for enterprising Australians and for the job prospects of young Australians .of the government's new deal for small busIlless?,34
33,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can confirm for the honourable member for Bendigo that the report More time for business, which I tabled when the House sat this morning, means extremely good news for small.busines-es all over Australia, and not least III the CIty of Bendigo. I normally do not like to say too much about the opposition, but really the Deputy Leader of the Opposition surpassed himself this morning. Mr Costello-Impossible!",34
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know it is hard to believe, but he really did. Do you know - hat he said? He said our policy on small busIlless was too little, too late. That is a bit rich. You had 13 years in government, you left the small businesses of Australia drowning in a sea of regulation and unreasonable industrial relations restrictions, and you have the nerve to go on a radio interview and say that it is too little, too late. It is a fact that during the election campaign the coalition parties made a number of very important commitments to the small business sector. I am very proud to say, as leader of this government, that we have not only honoured those commitments but in many areas surpassed those commitI?ent-. We have delivered more than we promIsed III the area of capital gains tax. We have delivered more than we promised in some of the areas of industrial relations. We have delivered more than we promised in a number of other areas. I particularly remind the p-rliament that the capital gains tax rollover relief represents the most generous taxation incentive for small business any government has delivered in Australia since the early 1960s. It will mean that, effectively, any small business operating in Australia can sell a small business and invest up to $5 million of the proceeds o.f the sale of that business into not just a busIlless of a like kind but a business of any kind and defer the capital gains tax liability. We have also made the details of the retirement concession which is in relation to up to $500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of a business when the former owner of that business goes into retirement, infinitely more generous than was originally promised. We have extended the relief to small business in the area of unfair dismissals. As a result of the announcement I made today, any firm employing fewer than 15 peopl- will effectively be able to apply a probatIOnary period of one year for any new employee, whether full time, part time or casual. What that means is that, if it is not working out, you can let the unsatisfactory empl.oyee go without landing up in court and havIllg your business go broke as a result of ridiculous litigation. It will not mean that you ca.n sack somebody without the statutory penod of noticeMr Crean-Oh!",34
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Are you opposed to it, Simon? Mr Crean interjecting",34
36,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, are you opposed it? Mr MCGauran-He wouldn't know.",34
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He does not know. Kim gave it a tick; your leader gave it a tick. What this means in reality is that we have ushered in a new era of common sense so far as the employee/employer relations-ip is concern.ed. It only stands to reason that, If you are gOIllg to take on a new employee, they should have a probationary period of 12 months. If it does not work, you ought to be able to let that employee go without the threat of court proceedings. But you should not be ab.let? l-t that employee go if it is because of dIscnmlnation based on their race, gender or some other kind. And of course you must always, as we will insist, pay that person the stipulated rate in the Australian workplace agreement and also observe the statutory period of notice. We are giving more generous tax concessions. We are introducing more intelligent industrial relations laws. We are introducing more workable unfair dismissal laws. With our macro-economic policies, we are taking the pressure off interest rates. There has been a reduction of 1Y2 per cent in official interest rates since this government came to power. We have announced new incentives for high technology small businesses, which over a period of time will encourage their growth. When you take all of these things into account you have a very intelligent, well targeted package. You have a package which is designed to tackle the things that small business complains about. It is a package that vindicates the faith of small business in the coalition. It is a package that more than delivers on the commitments I made on behalf of the coalition in the election campaign. It is a package which demonstrates that, when it comes to small business, the only two parties in this parliament that are really interested in them are the Liberal and National parties. NA",34
38,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I notice in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Tom Uren, a most distinguished Australian and a former very distinguished member of this House. Welcome home. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Superannuation",35
39,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and it follows that question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. I ask whether the Treasurer recalls saying in answer to a question from me after the budget last August: ... who is going to pay the J-a-w tax cuts? ... are going to fund them and we are going to pay for them. Isn't it true that, when the Treasurer abandons-as he foreshadowed yesterday-the $4.5 billion superannuation contribution, this will not be a matter of Costello reneging on a Keating promise but Costello ratting on a Costello promise?",35
40,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am withered by the attack-absolutely withered. The one thing you can be sure of is that the coalition will not be introducing the scheme that you talked about in the May 1995 budget, because we do not want to cut workers' wages. That is the one thing you can be sure of. Mr Crean-Is that right? Where is the evidence for that?",35
41,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the essence of your scheme. That is the evidence of it. It was called 'Saving for our future'. It proposed taking out one per cent of employees after tax, take-home pay from 1 July. But hang on! You only got into the matching business if you gave up one per cent of your wages. You only got into the matching business by giving up your after tax, take-home pay. We do not want to cut workers' wages. Why does the Labor Party hate the battlers, Mr Speaker? Why is it that the Labor Party hate the battlers? Why do they keep ripping it into them? We certainly will not be doing that. The other reason we will not be doing it is, as I said earlier, can you imagine the complexity of the scheme? This was the scheme: first of all, you had to change all the awards so the awards had a one per cent deduction from employees' after tax pay. Then you had to get the money out of the awards and into the funds. Then the funds",35
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of relevance, which goes to this business about one per cent. Our policy is exactly the same policy as theirs-matching contributions; three per cent off employees, three per cent off you.",35
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,35
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We take insults in this We place, but we will not abide the insult that our policies are the same as yours. We will not abide that insult.",35
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Your policy is exactly the same as ours.,35
46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He knows how to hurt and that hurts. To compare us to you hurts us immeasurably. We are infinitely better than that. The second reason is, as I said before, can you imagine the complexity of the scheme? First of all, you would have to change all the awards to deduct one per cent of after tax employees' wages. Secondly, the superannuation funds would have to get all the tax file numbers. Thirdly, they would have to report to the government on those employees who had made it. Fourthly, there would have to have been a payment back from the tax office to match, under the tax file number, the employee contribution. Fifthly, you would have to have a separate account in relation to them. It was an administrative nightmare. Of course, Labor had never thought about introducing it because it was never really serious about a co-contribution at all. This was a 1992 promise. Sorry, did I say promise? No, it was l-a-w. It was l-a-w before the 1992 election.",36
47,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Treasurer is talking about before the 1992 election. The question was asked about his promises before the 1996 election and before the August budget, not 1992.",36
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition, but the Treasurer is addressing the detailed aspects and elements of the question, and I would ask the Treasurer to proceed.",36
49,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, Mr Speaker. It is bad enough that they say our policies are like theirs, but to accuse us of breaking their promises really is the bottom of the barrel.",36
50,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order, we are not asking them about keeping our promises but keeping theirs-their 1996 promises-which they will not do.",36
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer has concluded his remarks. Mr Gareth Evans-I seek leave to table the policy statements of the opposition, making it clear beyond doubt that the Treasurer has dogged it on this particular question. Leave not granted. Small Business: Fringe Benefits Tax",36
52,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a question for the Treasurer. Treasurer, can you inform the House of measures which will relieve the paperwork burden on small business in such areas as those who provide minor levels of fringe benefits? Are there other measures which will encourage investment and new jobs in the small business sector?",36
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The announcement by the Prime Minister in relation to small business is one of those announcements which will be welcomed by small business throughout the country. This was a statement which was made by the government because the government was determined to reduce the paperwork compliance business of small business in this country. As announced by the Prime Minister today, the government will be introducing an exemption from fringe benefits tax record keeping where an employer in a base year has $5,000 or less in taxable benefits. What that means is that if somebody has, in the past year, had $5,000 or less of taxable benefits, they are absolved from keeping their fringe benefits tax records. In relation to those benefits, they pay the tax that was assessed in relation to that and continue on without any requirement to keep records whatsoever, unless there is an unusual year and a variation by 20 per cent. If any small business believes that assessing the tax at the level in the base year would be unfair, they can keep records and have it varied down and establish a new base in the future. This announcement in itself has the capacity to exempt about half the small businesses that are currently paying fringe benefits tax from record keeping requirements. One of the things that came back to the government, as a result of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force report, is that it was not so much the level of the taxation that was payable, but it was the compliance cost of keeping the records and having that level assessed that was really worrying small business. This government is proud that it has been able to have a major breakthrough in relation to record keeping of fringe benefits taxes. In addition to that, this government has taken significant steps forward in two other areas. First of all, the government has announced that, for small businesses that provide car parking on their business premises, there will no longer be fringe benefits tax payable. The fringe benefits tax on parking was one of the most complicated to administer and in revenue terms not significant at We have cut through the red tape and have exempted that whole area. In addition, the government has announced new measures in relation to taxi travel which will extend the fringe benefits tax exemption for employee taxi travel to cover travel to and from work at any time of the day. It will not be necessary, as it was in the past, to prescribe hours during which fringe benefits tax would apply. This is a benefit, in relation to travel to and from work, from fringe benefits tax, whatever the hours are. The government is pleased that it has been able to cut through the red tape of fringe benefits tax on car parking, cut through the red tape of fringe benefits tax on taxi travel, and cut through the red tape for small businesses providing benefits of less than $5,000. It was long overdue and the coalition government is proud to deliver it. Banking",36
54,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question to the Treasurer is about a coalition-Labor policy that is the same. I refer to a report in today's Australian quoting a study by the University of Southern Queensland which claimed 320 bank branch closures in country communities over the past four years has caused personal suffering and business hardship. I also refer the Treasurer to a recent ABC Four Corners television report revealing immoral business practices undertaken both by Australia's major banks and by newer banks. As the Treasurer is now considering the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry, can he indicate whether this government will continue down the profit-at-all-costs deregulation path of the former government, or will it ensure banks are forced to recognise they also have ethical and moral obligations to the Australian people and that a bank licence is a privilege and not a right?",37
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Banks have legal obligations and they have ethical obligations, and the government believes that they should observe both. If there is any evidence of where banks have broken the law, either by private legal action or by report to an applicable authority, they will be followed and consumers will be protected. This government all. believes certainly in reducing the cost of doing business in Australia and certainly in heightened bank competition to deliver to consumers, but at the end of the day we take those consumer obligations seriously and we believe banks should always act within the law. Small Business: Single Entry Point to Government",37
56,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Is it a fact that in some cases to start a small business you may have to deal with up to 15 departments and regulators? Can the minister explain how today's new initiative of a single entry point into government will ease the regulation burden on small businesses and enable enterprising people in my electorate of Swan to start new businesses much quicker?  Swan for his question. The single entry point for small business is a significant initiative. Small business knows that dealing with government can be complex and time consuming, and that is the very point the member for Swan is raising. The government will create, I am pleased to announce, a single entry point to government for information and compliance needs. A single entry point will cover the registration requirements of the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities Commission, the ISC and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The government will further develop a strategy, by September this year, to expand a single entry point concept to other agencies' information requirements. But, more importantly, the government will spend $22 million over the next four years to establish a national business information service to provide a comprehensive service to small business. Small business wants less paperwork and fewer government agencies to deal with. I think it is important that the whole House recognises the significance of what I would describe as the most important small business statement ever made by an Australian government. Let us look at what the headlines say. One headline reads 'Tax Victory: small firms hail red tape reforms'. The Australian Business Chamber describe it as a 'significant confidence booster'. What do the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry say about this package? They describe it as something that will 'significantly cut compliance burden on small business and boost confidence in the sector'. We are very aware that the industry organisations recognise the absolute significance our package and the creation, in addition, of a one-stop shop for all government business registration and licence information. This information service will cover all three tiers of government: federal, state and local. Priority will be given to information on taxation requirements, industrial relations, workers compensation, superannuation, and occupation health and safety. For the first time, expanded information packages will be available in one place, bringing together previously separate and uncoordinated material. Superannuation  er. Does the Treasurer accept that if the $4.5 billion superannuation co-contribution is abandoned in the budget, as he indicated yesterday it would be, a worker in his or her mid-30s, now on average weekly earnings, will have over $100,000 slashed off his or her superannuation retirement package? How can he begin to justify this assault on ordinary working Australian families?",37
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said earlier, the proposal from the Labor Party in relation to co-contribution was a proposal to take the money out of the employee's after tax money. So what are you saying? Are you saying that the employee is being done a favour by having his money compulsorily taken out? Is that your argument? It is their argument. Oh, good; that is the same argument for tax rises-let's do them a favour by increasing their taxes. Is that also your argument? This was a compulsory tax. It was to take money out of their after tax income. It could not work.",38
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: is it relevant for the Treasurer to imply that somehow or other this was somebody else's scheme when he said in his policy speech 'to match compulsory contributions according to the proposed schedule'? That was your policy.",38
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,38
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to employees, the Labor Party's arguing they were doing of people a great favour by taking money out of their after tax income indicates how out of touch you were. What is more, it is entirely clear from the material that is now available that it had no hope of working and the Labor Party didn't know how to make it work. The third point is that the only reason it got released in 1995 was that the Labor Party had never delivered on a 1992 law-not a promise, a law; l-a-w. It was a law. You fraudulently stole an election.",38
61,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. It is plain that the Treasurer is being asked whether or not it is a fact that the abandonment of this Liberal Party commitment will result in a person who would have otherwise have retired on average weekly earnings losing $100,000 in benefits. That is the question and that is the question he should answer.",38
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is fully aware of the question that was asked. There is no point of order.,38
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A concerted campaign by the Labor Party to take points of order will not stop you in the Labor Party hearing this. That is the important thing. We know the Labor front bench has said the Leader of the Opposition has got to get more aggressive in question time. I am going to finish the answer. The answer is that in 1995 this was put down as a measure in relation to the budget because the Labor Party had not delivered on a 1992 law. In 1992 you enacted income tax cuts which you could not pay. You said that income tax cuts could be paid without a GST and you won an election. We all know about it. By 1995, not having delivered on that l-aw, you were looking for some way to get out of it. You put down in the 1995 budget that you would pay it when? In the year 2001nine years after you enacted it. But there was no technical way in which it could be done; it couldn't be made to work, even if you wanted it to. What I said yesterday, and I say it again now, is that it cannot be made to work. What is more, for an opposition that supposedly supports the superannuation surcharge-we keep hearing that you supposedly support it",38
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We're going to put it through.,39
65,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have said now, 'We're going to put it through.' Thank you. We take that from you. Can you just confirm that? You will be putting it through. Is that right?",39
66,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Absolutely.,39
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely. Good, thank you. But you say you are concerned about compliance. Let me say that this was a compliance nightmare. Compared with the surcharge this was an absolute nightmare. It could not have been done. There was no way in which it could be done and this government is making it clear that we will not even try to make it be done. Small Business: Industrial Relations",39
68,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I remind the minister that a sensible industrial relations framework is crucial to small business and jobs. What measures is the government taking to make it easier for small business to employ people while at the same time maintaining sensible safeguards for employees?,39
69,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. This government is unashamedly pro small business. The reason we have brought down the statement today is to give some encouragement and institute some practical, sensible measures to help small business. In the area of unfair dismissal, only my predecessor could have invented a solution to a problem that did not exist before he arrived, which is why we have had the tremendous problems we have had with unfair dismissal. That is why, when we drafted the legislation on the Workplace Relations Act, we made provision for reasonable exemptions, and particularly exemptions that related to small business. What we have announced today is in conformity with the legislation. We intend to bring down a regulation that says a small business with 15 employees or less will not be subject to the unfair dismissal provisions in respect of new employees in their first 12 months. I think the response of the small business community will be that they will have greater confidence that they can go ahead and give people the chance of a job-which hopefully most Australians, apart from the Labor Party, would actually like to see. The fact is, if you are running a small business-as even the international conventions show-you do not have a human resources department and you do not have lawyers on tap at great expense to defend claims of this sort. What you need is a practical, user-friendly system that will encourage small business to give people jobs. It is an innovative step for Australia, and an important and useful one, but I would have to say when you look around the world you will see we are not alone in introducing such exemptions. Mr Speaker, I am also pleased to say that the regulations contain other exemptions. For example, we have exemptions in respect of short-term casuals up to 12 months; we have exemptions in respect of trainees under the national training wage and under the modern apprenticeship training scheme; we have clarified the situation in respect of probationary periods up to three months for people taking on new employees; and we have a better regime in respect of fixed term contracts. All of this is aimed at one particular objective-that is, to give our businesses, and particularly our small businesses, some real encouragement to give people the opportunity of a job. Interestingly enough, those regulations were the subject of discussions between the government and the Australian Democrats last night. We have come to a sensible position on those regulations, so your notice of disallowance in the Senate will get knocked off. I will tell you why it should. It is for no other reason than this: one of the things you wanted to do was knock off the $50 application fee for lodging an unfair dismissal. Instead of saying to employers and employees, 'We are going to have a fair system', the message you want to send to small business and to employees is that it is just an easy system that you can go in and knock off an employer regardless of the circumstances of the dismissal. It really shows your true colours. When it comes to small business, quite frankly, you walked away from them for 13 years, and you have the hide-even in opposition-to attempt to knock off the very sensible measures that we have introduced to help small business. This is a fair deal. It retains the unlawful discriminatory provisions which protect employees, so if you are dismissed on the grounds of race, colour, sex, pregnancy, disability, union membershi-and even non-union membership-those safeguards are still in place. It is a fair deal for employees. It gives them the chance of a job. Superannuation",39
70,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer recall the estimate in his Commission of Audit report that, when the full three per cent plus three per cent government and employee co-contributions are taken into account, aggregate superannuation fund assets will rise from under $300 billion now to over $600 billion by the year 2005, and to around $2,000 billion by the year 2020? When higher national savings continue to be a key economic objective and when the $4.5 billion government superannuation contribution would have hap such a major impact in generating them, how can the government possibly justify in economic terms now abandoning that promise?",40
71,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, Mr SPEAKER come in spinner! What is the argument? The argument is that the government should go out and deficit-fund money into superannuation funds. And in what way could that possibly build savings? Mr Speaker, here is a Labor Party that was running an $11 billion deficit and saying, 'And, what's more, we were out borrowing $11 billion to pay money into superannuation'! How could that possibly have developed savings? And you know, of course, who was responsible for that $11 billion deficit. You know, of course, who was the finance minister during the election campaign. You know, of course, who ran around in February 1996 saying that the Australian accounts were balanced and would be for the foreseeable future. You know who was Australia's worse finance minister ever. You know who it was who put out those false claims before the election. It was the bloke who likes to get to his feet and make points of order at just about this point. I am just giving him the chance. Small Business: Capital Gains Tax",40
72,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of progress on the implementation of the government's commitment, announced in the 1996-97 budget, to allow capital gains tax roll-over for small business? Can the Treasurer explain how the implementation of this measure will assist small business to undertake new job creating ventures?",40
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. Mr MCMullan-There's lots of small businesses in South Australia. AN-that's a small business now.,40
74,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I thank him for waking up the member for Canberra. In the election campaign, the government announced that it would be introducing rollover relief for capital gains tax where small businesses sold one asset to purchase a like asset. Mr Tanner-Capital gains tax is deadthat's what it means.",40
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne!,41
76,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the 1996-97 budget, the government delivered on that promise in full. Further than that, the government also indicated that the like asset test would not be stipulated-that, in relation to roll overs where a business sold an asset to trade up into another asset, that would also qualify for capital gains tax rollover relief. Today the Prime Minister announced that the government will extend rollover relief even further. Mr Latham interjecting",41
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Werriwa!,41
78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today, the government's announcement of capital gains tax rollover relief will apply in a situation where a business rather than rolling over an asset rolls over the company, as it were, selling the shares to buy shares in a new company. Mr Latham-It means Kerry Packer can have shares.",41
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Werriwa!,41
80,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What that means is that, in relation to a small business trading up or in relation to a person trading a small business to a larger one, capital gains tax will apply up to the limit of $5 million worth of business assets. There will be provisions built into the capital gains tax rollover relief to prevent it being opened up to people who engage in share trading activities. It will only be applicable to genuine business people who have an active business and sell that active business to roll over the proceeds into another active business. The legislation to provide the relief for sale of shares will be complicated and, as a result, the government will be engaging in consultation with the capital gains tax subcommittee of the taxation commissioner's National Tax Liaison Group and with representatives from the commissioner's Small Business Consultative Group to ensure that the provisions are, as far as possible, userfriendly and are put into practice in a way which will give the maximum rollover relief. Mr Tanner-What about retrospectivity?",41
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Melbourne!,41
82,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I just say, in response to the member for Boothby's question: the object of this is to get the penalties out of the system that used to apply where a small business was sold because someone wanted to trade up to a bigger business and the capital gains tax cut in, took the proceeds of sale and prevented their reinvestment into another business. That was a capital gains tax application which prevented small business growing bigger. The announcement that we have made today in association with the announcements that we have made in the budget are designed to take that disincentive out, to give small business the opportunity to grow bigger, to create more and to give more jobs. This will be, I believe, recognised as probably the most significant small business tax relief measure in relation to capital gains tax that we have seen--one of the outstanding achievements of this government and one of the outstanding achievements in tax reform certainly during this decade. Small Business: Red Tape",41
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the not Prime Minister, and it goes to the subject of his claims in relation to a speech on red tape. I ask whether you recollect your small business minister answering the member for Curtin with this statement: We have in place a benchmark to be able to give the measurement of our achievement in this area? Do you recollect saying a bit earlier not that you had in place a benchmark but that 'we are establishing objective performance indicathe tors which can be used to measure our efforts by June 1999'? Is that date of June 1999 when you are going to have these measures effectively examined, according to your statement, because it falls after the next election? And do you still commit yourself to the position that you indicated that you will reduce small business red tape by 50 per cent before the next election comes round?",41
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It really is a very interesting commentary. Does the Leader of the Opposition ask a question about capital gains tax? No. Does he ask a question about venture capital? No. Does he ask a question about unfair dismissal laws? No. Does he ask a question about fringe benefits tax? No. Does he ask a question about anything that goes to the substance of our small business reforms? No, he doesn't. It is a measure of the absolute paucity and bankruptcy of the Australian Labor Party that we have brought down the best small business statement ever, and has he got anything to say about the substance of the statement? Absolutely not. Can I simply remind the Leader of the Opposition to go away and have look at the commitment made in relation to the goal of cutting red tape by 50 per cent during our first term. If it was time specific to your term, it is hardly surprising that the date should be in 1999. Small Business: Financial Support",41
85,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is it true that many small businesses which are seeking to develop new technologies and services often find it difficult to access appropriate financial support? How important are these new businesses to the economy? What initiatives does the government propose to deal with this issue and what benefits will there be for jobs and exports?",42
86,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question because it goes very much to one of the significant parts of the Prime Minister's statement. I am pleased to be able to provide the House with further information on the establishment of the small business innovation fund, announced in the statement. It is a significant new measure to assist small technology based companies. It has never been attempted in this country before and it addresses a major problem that the opposition did not have the vision to overcome. As small business knows only too well, one of the greatest challenges they face is getting access to start-up capital. It is the small technology sector in particular which has found this challenge the hardest to overcome. That is why this government acted to provide improved access to early stage capital for selected small businesses. This fund will provide a pool of around $200 million to enable small technology firms to develop their ideas, similar to the highly successful programs in the United States and Israel. The government will provide $130 million on a two-for-one matching basis with private sector capital. The management of the fund will rest with the private sector. Investment decisions will be made by the private sector fund managers under the guidelines set by the Industry Research and Development Board. Importantly, I expect the capital funds will invest in more than 100 small technology firms over the next five years. The small business innovation fund reprefirst sents the most significant opportunity the Australian technology sector has ever had to access capital. Unlike the opposition, the government has an absolute commitment to enhancing Australia's research and development capacities. This was further demonstrated last week when the Industry Research and Development Board announced the recipients of $44 million worth of grants under the new Start program. It is highlighted again today by the Small Business Innovation Fund. The government recognises the important contribution made to the economy by firms in the technology sector. These firms are the most dynamic source of economic growth, employment and exports. They have the means to translate Australia's strong research and development capacities into commercial success, providing growth and well paid jobs. I invite investors to look closely at the opportunities provided in these schemes and to participate in Australia's future development. Premiers Conference",42
87,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and refers to last Friday's Premiers Conference debacle-the second in two years. I ask him: is it the case that the reason this year's conference was an even bigger embarrassment than last year's is that neither you nor the Prime Minister could agree on what the Commonwealth's position was? Did Joan Sheldon get it wrong when she said, referring to you and the Prime Minister, 'One was saying one thing and one was saying the other, and that's a very difficult situation on which to bargain and which to deal'? Did Mr Stockdale get it wrong when he said, 'There was ambiguity in the morning in the minds of the Commonwealth representatives about what it was they were offering'? Didn't Mr Kennett get it right when he said that you and your government have 'a lot to learn about governing'?",42
88,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is that it? Is that the question? I am being savaged, and I have no idea when it will end. At the Premiers Conference the premiers and the Commonwealth agreed on financial assistance grants. They provide for a $600 million increase to the states in the forthcoming financial year. In relation to specific purpose payments, the Commonwealth, in the past, has never identified amounts and nor has it ever sought agreement. This year we did something that has never been done before: we actually put amounts on it. But we were not negotiating those special purpose payments. I am informed that no Labor administration even raised specific purpose payments. They certainly did not put amounts on them and they certainly did not indicate ceilings. So what has happened in relation to specific purpose payments is that more information has been provided than ever has been before.",43
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You didn't know what the Prime Minister was taking about and he didn't know what you were talking about.,43
90,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is one person over there who does know-and it is not you, it is the member for Gellibrand-what happens in relation to specific purpose payments. In relation to the Premiers Conference, I think there were some other important things agreed. There was certainly discussion in relation to a number of taxation matters and some good progress was made. But I would not hold my breath waiting for the day when the premiers come to Canberra and go back home saying, 'We've won everything we wanted.' I doubt that it has ever happened in the past and I doubt that it will ever happen in the future. Mr GARETH EV ANS-Arising directly out of that answer, I ask the Treasurer a supplementary question. Did the New South Wales Treasurer himself get it wrong when he said, This is the first Premiers Conference since Federation that has adjourned without an agreement being reached between the Commonwealth and the states'?",43
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer has answered the question fully and we are about to move on. I have ruled on it. Small Business: Traineeships,43
92,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer to the government's commitment to helping young unemployed Australians overcome the disadvantages they face in gaining employment. Given the fact that the opportunity to undertake apprenticeships and training inevitably enhances the chances of young Australians to obtain permanent employment, I ask the minister how the government proposes to encourage small business to take on more apprenticeships and trainees.",43
93,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Stirling for his question. Certainly one of the most encouraging features of the small business scene at the moment has been the response of the small business sector to the government's efforts to encourage the increasing take-up of apprenticeships and traineeships. The government has strongly promoted apprenticeships and traineeships in the fulfilment of its commitment to provide young Australians with expanded quality training opportunities. Of course, these training opportunities are to the advantage of small businesses, because they improve the bottom line, as well as to the trainee. Last year we established an initiative in 10 regions of Australia with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Nettforce group training companies to promote traineeships. I am very pleased to say that, in the year to date, 199697, traineeships are up 68 per cent over the previous year. The government is, however, aware that the complexity of the training system which has been left in place by the previous government still requires significant reform. The government is taking a number of actions to simplify the training arrangements. Of course, all members of this House would be aware that, in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. You had 10 years to get apprenticeships up and you could not. The government is taking a number of steps to simplify access to quality training for small businesses. I have already announced the establishment of some 19 one-stop apprenticeship shops, which will cut through the red tape and end wasteful duplication between levels of government. Later this year, the government will be contracting out the services provided by government for entry level training, recognising the very broad interests and the capabilities which now exist in the broader market to promote the take-up of quality training opportunities. Coming through in the second half of this year will be a range of new, flexible apprenticeship and training opportunities made possible by new national training packages and by the new industrial relations legislation. The government is currently working on a model training agreement under the industrial relations reforms so that training arrangements will be readily accessible by small business and by trainees at minimum training wage levels. Under the new national apprenticeship system, qualifications will be recognised throughout Australia, training providers in one state will be recognised in all states and training will be able to be customised to the needs of business. These are the training reforms which Australia has been waiting for for 13 years, which the previous government failed to introduce, which small business desperately needs and wants and which young unemployed people desperately need and want. This government is delivering on its promises and the benefits will flow through, ; 1 expanded real job opportunities, to young Australians. Public Hospital Funding",43
94,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. I ask whether the minister is aware of a memo to MW from BH dated 27 February about public hospital funding stating: If polling tells us that waiting lists are a big problem, and this is perceived as the Commonwealth's problem, and then the Medicare Agreements will have to have solutions to fix this. We need to be careful not to take on problems that aren't ours-so if states are copping the blame for waiting lists, we don't want to take on the burden. Is it not a fact that the Treasurer's announcement at last Friday's Premiers Conference will result in further increases in public hospital waiting lists? Is this not further evidence that the government is implementing BH's strategy and that you and your government are walking away from the crisis in public hospitals?",44
95,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a bit of a puzzle, Mr Speaker. I do not know where he got this document from. You did not get it from Ralph, did you-Ralph running down the corridor with a manila envelope saying, 'It's got ""confidential"" on it'?",44
96,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Check the Treasurer's office.,44
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Banks!,44
98,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to admit that I actually do like polls because polls can tell you some very good things. Take for example the Newspoll in the papers last Monday which compared the qualities of the Prime Minister and the qualities of the Leader of the Opposition. In terms of best to handle the economy, it was two to one for the Prime Minister. What qualities did the Prime Minister do better than the Leader of the Opposition on? He cares for peopleMr Lee- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was strictly on funding for public hospitals. I ask you to bring the minister back to the question.",44
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address the question.,44
100,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, as you know, it was a very broad question. The qualities that the Prime Minister did better than the Leader of Opposition on were: cares for the people, decisive and strong, trustworthy, and less arrogant. The Leader of the Opposition only did better on one quality and that was that he was less inflexible.",44
101,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question did not call for a list of obsequiousness from the minister, it asked for an answer on hospital funding.",45
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,45
103,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I really have to say that you can understand people thinking that the Leader of the Opposition is less inflexible given the flip-flops on policies that we have been having from the Labor Party in the last three months. I am not aware of any announcement that was made by the government on Friday that would effect waiting lists. Waiting lists will be affected over the next 15 years by a number of factors. They are demographic factors, epidemiological factors and the cost and structure of services. For the demographic factors, we have increased utilisation of hospitals by older people, we have an ageing population as such with the number of people over 65 doubling by the year 2021 and the number of people over 80 going to go up four times by the year 2021. In terms of epidemiology, we have a greater shift to chronic illness. Between 1991 and 1994 chronic illnesses went up from 71 per cent of all admissions to 77 per cent of all admissions. We have new illness like Hepatitis C which will place an enormous burden on our hospital system over the next 15 years. With costs and structure of services, we have increased services such as cardiac surgery, which went up 40 per cent, I think, over the last five years. These are going to add together to place increased pressures on services. What the government is going to attempt to do is use the next Medicare agreement to institute some reform that will give us a capacity to deal with this. The reforms are sensible, such as increased day surgery, better step down facilities and better community care. We may not succeed, but at least we are going to try. All the last Medicare agreement was was a bribe to get the states on board before the 1993 election. You instituted no reform. You threw extra money at it. The states pulled money out and the net effect was nothing. You have a crisis in every state in Australia due to your inability to get any long-term reform. You went round at the last election and you whinged about states pulling money out and you had no ability to do anything about it. I do not intend to sign on to your failures. Small Business: Regulations",45
104,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I note that a number of the reductions in small business regulation will need the active involvement of the states and territories. Does the Commonwealth have a plan to progress these issues? What benefits will there be for small business and is there any feedback from the states and territories yet of their willingness to join this revolt against red tape?  Griffith for his question. All levels of government add to red tape and compliance. Therefore, responsibility falls on all levels of government to work together to strip away red tape and compliance. Mr Bevis-Shut your folder.",45
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I warn the member for Brisbane.  ness summit that I held in June of last year started the working relationship between the states in the area of red tape and compliance and our commitment towards that area. I am pleased to announce that the existing Commonwealth-state reform process will be accelerated. Substantial reforms have already been achieved in the building sector. For example, a new national certification scheme for building products took effect from 1 January this year. In the case of the gfOundbreaking initiative on the single entry point for service, state and territory ministers have already agreed to work towards comprehensive service across all levels of government. The Commonwealth wiJI lead the way by establishing a single registration process for its major regulators by 1 July 1998. It would seem unfortunate that the opposition does not seem to recognise the absolute importance of this commitment. I am pleased to say that others representing the small business sector recognise the importance of what we have done. The press release of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that the big positives for small business include, among many: greater effort to be focused on simplifying business compliance in a range of areas, as well as improving communication and information systems. In some areas the government's response has in fact exceeded the recommendations of the task force. While those on the other side unfortunately do not recognise the absolute importance of the statement today, I am pleased to see that the small business sector does. The states and territories have agreed to establish with the Commonwealth a business regulation complaints service, available free, starting from December this year. With these reforms small business will benefit from a streamlining of government regulations, greater access to regulatory information and the capacity to have heard their complaints about the demands of regulation. As far as possible, duplication and any inconsistencies between jurisdictions will be reduced, ensuring that the business environment is friendly and conducive to small business growth. Housing Assistance",45
106,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall that on 13 September 1996 he wrote to all premiers outlining changes to housing assistance? Does the Prime Minister recall that in that letter he said that neither the Commonwealth, the states, nor public housing tenants would be financially disadvantaged? On Friday last the Commonwealth cut specific purpose grants by $400 million. In New South Wales alone, this will mean an additional $150 million taken from its budget and as much as $50 million taken from public housing. Why did the Prime Minister mislead the premiers last year on funding for public housing and is this not just another example of how the Howard government is taking housing from the neediest Australian families?",46
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We did not cut specific purpose funding by $400 million. Never believe Michael Egan when it comes to specific purpose payments. Really! You've got to be joking. Let me make it very clear that there was no cut of $400 million-none whatsoever. We said to the states a very simple thing: 'See the figure in the forward estimates? We promise you that the reductions small on that, when the final budget figures have bedded down, are not going to be greater than 1.3 per cent.' End of story. Do you know what that amounted to? It was $139 million maximum. You are peddling this silly figure of $400 million. It is disgraceful deception by the New South Wales Treasurer. You, Jenny, oughtn't to believe somebody of the New South Wales Right. Never believe somebody of the New South Wales Right. How can you, Jenny? I tell you what, Daryl will educate you in the ways of the New South Wales Right. Daryl will talk to you. Mr O'Connor- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would ask you to draw the Prime Minister's attention to standing order 80. He should refer to members by the name of their electorate.",46
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Corio.,46
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If Daryl doesn't I will get my brother to do so. So I simply say this: do not ever believe a New South Wales Labor Treasurer about a Premiers Conferencenever. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question I asked was about public housing tenants, and t would appreciate it if he would answer the question.",46
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is addressing the question.,46
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was about deception, and I am pointing out who deceived you. The truth of the matter is that you believed Michael Egan. Michael Egan was telling whoppers. He knows it, I know it, you know it, and I think most of the Australian public know it. Small Business: Task Force Recommendations",46
112,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Now that the government has responded in a comprehensive way to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force report, will the minister please outline to the House what steps the government will take to implement its responses to the task force recommendations?  Lilley for her question. It would seem that other side, unfortunately, have not read the details or the headlines of the positive news coming from many in the small business sector. The government will carefully monitor the reform process to ensure that it is quickly and effectively implemented. I have responsibility for monitoring and reporting on progress. The task force research identifies the most important ingredients for successful reform. The government addresses each of these in More time for business. The first factor was political commitment and support and, unfortunately, that was something that never came from the previous government. I am pleased to say that the Prime Minister, in delivering the package, gives complete support and commitment to the small business sector. We have delivered significant initiatives to small business progressively since coming to government, and we will continue to do so. Another factor is the need to put in place systematic evaluation of the cost and benefits of regulation. More time for business contains a comprehensive strategy for upgrading the quality of regulation and includes regulation impact statements and making the regulation process more open and transparent. A third factor for success is concentrating on steady incremental changes sustained over the longer term rather than gimmickry or quick fixes. More time for business delivers immediate practical outcomes and sets a challenging agenda to actively achieve quality outcomes. Importantly, the government has committed itself to specifically delivering dates that are realistic and ambitious. A fourth factor is the need for thorough research and analysis to support policy decisions and to test the need for any new regulation. We are building a solid research and information base on the needs of small business. Just two weeks ago, I launched' A Portrait of Australian Business' which provided detailed statistical information on a huge number of aspects of small business operations. Finally, there is a need for the government agencies to adopt and instil a culture focused on customer service. The government is committed to improving the culture of the the Australian Public Service. Service charters will assist here. The Minister for Industrial Relations is in charge of public sector reforms. It is significant that, after the headline 'Tax victory' I referred to in the Daily Telegraph, describing this significant package, the article went on to say that red tape will be slashed for small business. That says it all. We are committed to slashing red tape in addition to the important initiatives that are announced with the FBT, capital gains, venture capital, IR reforms and unfair dismissal laws. This is a very significant package, the most significant package ever delivered by a government in regard to small business. I would hope that all in this House get behind the package and support it, like the small business sector are doing. They welcome the initiatives. Mr Bevis- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is obviously quoting from documents. I request that they be tabled. a While he is at it, he might just lay the folder here so that we don't have to go through any more questions like that.",46
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the honourable minister been reading from documents?  those Queensland members don't get the Sydney papers, I am pleased to table the newspaper article 'Tax victory-small firms hail red tape reform.' Mr Bevis-That is not the document he quoted from.",47
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister has been invited to table documents if he was reading from them. The minister has decided that the most appropriate document to be tabled has been tabled. Mr Bevis-But, Mr Speaker, that is not the document he was quoting from. That is the document he quoted from in the previous answer.",47
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was one of several documents that I saw. The minister, referring to confidential documentsMr Bevis-Quoted from the previous answer.",47
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has tabled the document that is unclassified. Travel Allowances,48
117,Mr SERCOMBE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I ask whether he recalls attacking the Commonwealth Ombudsman when he said: Could Phillipa Smith have cut her own costs by perhaps living in Canberra instead of commuting to Sydney all the time? Is it a fact that taxpayers, through Telstra, funded accommodation for the former Telecommunications Ombudsman in Melbourne, his air fares to and from his home in Launceston and travelling allowance? Mr Leo MCLeay-That was him.",48
118,Mr SERCOMBE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Was that you, Minister?",48
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You will address your question or resume your seat.,48
120,Mr SERCOMBE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, do you have any objections to your departmental secretary approving the payment of $l7,000 per annum tax free to himself for accommodation expenses in the same way Max the Axe has done?",48
121,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised at the question, but let me make one point. There is a vast difference between a statutory ombudsman and an industry ombudsman. You should be careful in pursuing a line of questioning which may elicit a response that you may not expect. On the issue you relate of my departmental secretary getting access to travel allowance, any access by a departmental secretary to travel allowance is in accordance with the rules. Cyclone Justin: Natural Disaster Assistance",48
122,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Cyclone Justin passed through Townsville early this morning. What provisions are in place for the Commonwealth to provide aid and assistance to communities adversely affected by natural disasters? What steps is the government taking to monitor the impact of tropical cyclone Justin on North Queensland communities, including those in the electorates of Dawson, Herbert, Kennedy and Leichhardt?",48
123,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that all honourable members would be aware of the devastation caused by cyclone Justin in Far North Queensland over recent days and the impact that cyclone has had on communities, particularly those in the electorates of Dawson, Leichhardt, Herbert and Kennedy. Under the natural disaster relief arrangements, there is an established Commonwealth-state framework for the provision of assistance following the declaration of a natural disaster. The prime responsibility rests with the states and the territories, who provide actual emergency response services. Those services include rescue and protection of goods and property. They also provide basic personal hardship and relief payments and grants and loans assistance to victims on an emergency basis. There is a Commonwealth reimbursement provision to the states and territories by way of financial assistance, and that includes concessional interest rate loans and grants and the restoration or replacement of essential public assets. It can also include direct benefits to victims through the Department of Social Security. The arrangements provide for the Commonwealth to mee- half of all state and territory outlays incurred in providing personal hardship and distress payments where the states' or territories' expenditure exceeds the small disaster threshold of $200,000. In respect of non-personal hardship and distress measures, Commonwealth assistance is provided on a dollar for dollar basis, above an assessed financial threshold, and increases to $3 for every dollar out laid by the states and territories where the states' and territories' expenditure exceeds 1.75 times the state or territory threshold. On the question of the monitoring of natural disasters, as pointed out earlier, the primary responsibility for emergency relief lies with the state and territory governments. Again, however, requests for practical Commonwealth assistance with disasters are passed to the emergency management authority by an authorised official in each state. The EMA coordinates such assistance and remains in close contact with state emergency services organisations and state and federal governments. The EMA operates under the direction of the Minister for Defence. This weekend's cyclone damage in far north Queensland is the fourth natural disaster to strike Queensland this financial year. Queensland's current funding threshold is $27.34 million, and expenditure for disaster relief has exceeded 1.7 times that threshold this year. As a result, current relief from the Commonwealth for Cyclone Justin damagewhen assessed-will be reimbursed by the Commonwealth to the Queensland government at the rate of $3 for each dollar out laid. Tomorrow morning, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) and the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) will be visiting the area. I am sure all members of the House would commend the work done by communities and emergency workers over the past few days and extend our condolences to the families of the two victims as a result of Cyclone Justin.",48
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Australian Television Service: House Monitoring System",49
125,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I ask you a question without notice. You will be aware that there has been a circular distributed to senators, members and occupants of Parliament House from the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff Sound and Vision Office, which advises that BBC World Television is to be included on channel 28 of the House monitoring service, to supplement-or rather, as the brochure states, to 'complement' - the present CNN service. In view of the fact that the BBC essentially promotes the UK version of the world and CNN the American, I ask whether ATV, the Australian television service which is desi.gned to provide coverage of the Australian VIew of world affairs, might also be included on our House monitor? As this is the Australian parliament, it would seem to be more relevant.",49
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"We are trying to increase the diversity of news information services available to us. I am not sure that the ATV signal is available to us, but I will take the issue up separately and advise you and the House at a later time. NA",49
127,Mr NEVILLE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",49
128,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the member claim to have been misrepresented?,49
129,Mr NEVILLE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,49
130,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,49
131,Mr NEVILLE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the House on Thursday, 20 March, the shadow minister for tourism and member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) referred, in a question to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), to reports that National Party members in north Queensland had been telling the media and the tourist industry that the Howard government's visitor tax was uncollectable. I have no recollection of ever having made such a statement. FurthermoreMr Martin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Personal explanations are to show where the member has been misrepresented personally. If you look at the Hansard report, you will see that no specific member was all mentioned and, therefore, this personal explanation is outside the guidelines.",49
132,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member for Hinkler claim to have been misrepresented personally?,49
133,Mr NEVILLE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The area of concern is so narrow as to be pointed at an individual member. I would like to conclude on this point: I am not in the business of being treacherous to the government nor misleading to my tourism industry. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I will put the member for Hinkler out of his misery-it wasn't him I was referring to, so he can sit down.",49
134,Mr NEVILLE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I am consoled. NA NA",50
135,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRA TION,"A number of members have expressed interest in the amalgamatio? of parliamentary departments. For the benefIt of all members in this place: on 5 March 1997, I informed the House that the President of the Senate and I had decided to implement a management structure for parliament, based on the two chamber departments. I indicated that the President and I had asked the departmental heads to provide us with an implementation plan and that they had established a working group to suggest detailed arrangements. We have now received the working group's report, entitled, Managing the parliament-the way ahead. We have also received some written comments, which we regard as being related to the detailed implementation stage and which will be considered during the consultative period. As a further step in the consultative process, the President and I invite written comments on the proposals in the report from members, senators, staff, staff associations and other interested people. All comments will be most welcome and should reach my office by Monday 14 April, 1997. No doubt there will be questions about the working group's proposals and other aspects of this matter. However, it would be more appropriate to canvass those issues after members have had the opportunity to fully consider the contents of the report. I hereby table a copy of the report. NA",50
136,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I seek indulgence in respect of the schedule of the House for the balance of the week. I bring to members' attention that we expect to have a late night on Wednesday night, due to the return of matters from the Senate during Wednesday evening. The Senate is makingMrs Crosio-What do you call late?",50
137,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"The Senate has in mind that it could be a very late night on Wednesday night, going to the early hours of Thursday morning, and so people need to be prepared for that. Because of the time constraints, it is also important that certain matters are dealt with in the House and transmitted to the Senate. We are having discussions with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) to ensure that what the Senate needs to deal with this week is sent to the Senate in a timely manner. We certainly need to get superannuation across there by close of business today and I would appreciate the cooperation of members. Obviously, in meeting the time lines that we have on us this week, we will be looking at ensuring that the House sits at every necessary opportunity. We will keep members informed as we progress.",50
138,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"I accept what the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has just said. I point out, however, that last week the Senate had agreed to sit for another extra day on the Monday. On Monday evening they actually ran out of government business. Hence we had brought on in a rush the euthanasia debate, which has been dominating time over there. We have sought to cooperate in terms of the government's schedule. We agreed to process all bills and legislation from this chamber to meet the Senate cut-off time, which has now passed. I find it extraordinary that this government, yet again, has shown its inability to manage its affairs and is imposing on all of us at the last hour, saying that the only way it can get us through is to keep us waiting. I would suggest that they get their own house in order and get proceedings over to the Senate in the time that we have accommodated for, and not, at the last minute, make people rearrange their affairs when, clearly, they have operated right from the beginning of this session on the basis that they would get home on Wednesday night.",50
139,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"These are the usual allegations that managers of opposition business always make. The smile on the face of the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) tells the story, as usual. We were seeking cooperation to get the superannuation legislation through last week. We did not do so. We appreciate there are a lot of members who want to speak and that is why it is on again today, but we do seek cooperation. I appreciate that we did have cooperation in respect of the cut-off time-that is true-and that was in everybody's interest. That is behind us. The fact is, the House has matters to deal with today and this week and we simply want to try to do so in an orderly manner. I will not respond to the usual allegamembers tions. These things need to be done this week and we do hope for that cooperation. NA NA  relation to the report you have tabled, has it been moved that the report be printed and is it necessary to do so? Secondly, is there going to be an opportunity for the House to debate the proposals, or will we only have an opportunity to debate them after you and the President have formalised proposals for both the House and the Senate?",50
140,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,"I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question. I do not think it is necessary to seek leave to have the report printed. The next phase is just another step in the consultative program that we have outlined and, in the event that the issues are going to be debated either here or in some other venue, you will get full notice. It will not be action that is taken unilaterally by the President and me.",51
141,Mr MCMULLAN,ADMINISTRATION,"Canberra) (3.27 p.m.)Mr Speaker, I appreciate the report that you gave and the tone in which you gave it, and your response to the member for Chifley (Mr Price). You will understand the concern of members is that when we return it will be on the day on which the budget is brought down. I seek your assurance that we are not going to see reflected in the budget any changes to the appropriations of the parliament reflecting the contents of any proposed administrative changes of the type referred to in your earlier statement or in your report.",51
142,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION,I thank the honourable member for Canberra. Every effort will be made to maintain our budgetary integrity. NA,51
143,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable 'active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded. There are two forms of benefits for ex-servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for 'Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex-members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam. It is claimed that: (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on 'active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications; (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial; (c) the Royal Australian Navy was 'allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently 'unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced; (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WAG 130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been 'allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found. (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the 'Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended; (f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for 'active service'. The fourth, for 'military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya. Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of able 'active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960. by Mrs Bailey (from 71 citizens), Mr Charles (from 10 citizens), Mr Jenkins (from 15 citizens),  Mr Taylor (from 50 citizens) and Mr Kelvin Thomson (from five citizens). Justice for all The help you got today, may be gone tomorrow!! To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled The Petition of the citizens of Australia Brings to the attention of the House the Federal Government's plan to make major cuts to Legal Aid funds. The Federal Government plans to cut $120 million from Legal Aid funding. This means that next time you visit Legal Aid, you may not be able to get the same help we've given you today. You may have to pay for your own legal expenses even if it's likely that you'll win your case. Last year we assisted 178,000 people. If these cuts go ahead, many Australians will be denied access to our services, and only the well-off will be able to use the justice system. The undersigned petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to call on the Federal Government to protect every Australian's right to equal access to the justice system by continuing to fund Legal Aid. by Mr Albanese (from 4,754 citizens). Meat Industry Review To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition by owners of meat producing livestock from all States of Australia draws to the attention of the House the present Meat Industry review being held for the purpose of industry restructure, under the office of The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, The Hon. John Anderson, MP. The petitioners believe the review has not been sufficiently wide so to enable all owners of meat producing livestock to be fully aware of all proposals available for restructure of the Australian Meat honourand Livestock Corporation, the Meat Research Corporation and Meat Industry Council, bodies which are funded by a statutory levy on the industry. Your petitioners therefore request that the House ensure that: (1) A referendum is held, available to all owners of meat producing livestock clearly detailing all options proposed for the restructure of the AMLC, MRC and MIC. (2) Such referendum contain an option that requires: (a) that the MRC and MIC be abolished, and that the AMLC be reconstituted so that it is required by Legal Aid legislation to be controlled by a Board, the members of which are directly elected, 'one vote, one value' by postal ballot available to all owners of meat producing livestock, at least once every three years; and (b) that the Board be required to ensure the AMLC does all things necessary to be involved on behalf of all owners of meat producing livestock in all aspects of purchasing, processing, transporting and marketing of stock, and such meat as may be derived from those stock, in such a manner to ensure those operations in which the AMLC is involved shall operate at all times at cost and to ensure, when purchasing livestock, the maximum price the market could afford is, at all times, passed on to the owners of those livestocks; and (c) that the reconstituted AMLC has the powers of 'single desk' selling with the Board required to exercise those powers in the event of any indication of 'price transfer' taking place in the industry. by Mr Anderson (from 33 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Longman draws to the attention of the House the growing number of sexual and violent material which is available in the community. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to impose greater controls and impose a greater level of censorship on sexually explicit and violent material which is available in our community. by Mr Brough (from 155 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia draws to the attention of the House of Representatives the extremely high Road Funding and Petrol Products Excise Tax imposed by the Commonwealth Government, which rose from 6.1 cents per litre in 1982 to 3S.6 cents per litre, for leaded fuel, in 1995. In addition, the attention of the House of Representatives is drawn to the current tax of 34.18 cents per litre on diesel and that the percentage of excise tax utilised for road funding is now less than 10 per cent of that collected as compared to a maximum of 70 per cent in 1981-82. Your petitioners therefore request the House urge the Government to reduce the tax on fuel in order that: 1. The cost of living of ordinary Australians is improved; and 2. Australia's overall international competitiveness is enhanced. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 59 citizens). To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned, urge that the House: (1) Closely monitor preparation for the upcoming Cambodian election in 1998 and to secure the agreement of the Cambodian Government to full and unhindered partIcIpation of international observers for the 1998 election; (2) Support the continuation of human rights monitoring in Cambodia by the United Nations. (3) Encourage Cambodia's other Donors and trading partners to raise human rights concerns with Cambodia; (4) Raise human rights concerns at the Donors' Consultative Meeting for Cambodia and during consideration of the projects in Cambodia to be Censorship financed by international financial institutions; (S) Provide assistance to Cambodia to broaden democratic civil society, to strengthen the rule of law and to ensure that future elections in Cambodia are free and fair. by Mr Crean (from 53 citizens). Elderly Australians To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the harmful and unfair Fuel Excise policies of the Federal Government concerning elderly Australians. In particular, the decision to abolish the Commonwealth Dental Health Program; the decision to charge up to $26,000 to enter a nursing home; the decision to increase charges for recipients of Home and Community Care; the decision to increase prescriptions for pensioners by SOc to $3.20, and the failure of the Federal Government to list the following medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Those medicines are: cetophil lotion, eurax cream, prantal powder, daktarin, anusol, senagar mixture, betamin, b-plexforte and vitamin C. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House calls on the Federal Government to reconsider these policies in the light of the detrimental effect they will have on older Australians. by Mrs Crosio (from 82 citizens). Labour Market Programs: Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to: the continuing high Cambodia levels of unemployment in Sydney'S south-west and the decrease in Federal Government funding to successful labour market programs in the area, including the SkillShare program and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, leading to the closure of employment centres and a reduction in the number of people in the area able to utilise these programs. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House recognises the deleterious effect that such a reduction in funding could have on employment levels in the south-west Sydney region, and restores Federal Government funding of labour market programs to 1995/96 levels. by Mrs Crosio (from 80 citizens). Animal Protection To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the lack of uniform laws across the nation of Australia to adequately protect animals from cruel or neglectful treatment by industrial or research establishments or by private citizens. Your petitioners therefore request the House to take the necessary steps for the Australian Government to work with the Governments of the States and Territories of Australia to establish uniform comprehensive laws to protect animals from cruel or neglectful treatment throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. Your petitioners additionally request that such action include measures aimed at: 1. abolishing the cruel practice of caged and penned animal farming; 2. enforcing the desexing of domestic pets; 3. abolishing research involving cruel treatment of animals; and 4. enforcing the laws of humane killing of both terrestrial and aquatic animals. by Mr Entsch (from 3,351 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales hereby expresses their dismay at the proposal to charge entry fees for people needing nursing home care. Furthermore, the petitioners are extremely concerned that the charging of entry fees will force people to sell their house in order to gain a bed in a nursing home. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives act to ensure that nursing home care is available to all who need it and further that the family home is exempted from any asset test relating to payment for such care. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Laurie Ferguson (from 379 citizens). Gun Laws To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Federal Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for tight, uniform gun control laws. Your petitioners therefore request the House to do all in its power to: (1) ban private ownership of semi-automatic and automatic weapons (2) require that all firearms are registered on a firearm register (3) ensure strict requirements for private gun ownership licences (4) encourage all State and Territories Premiers to cede their responsibilities on gun control to the Commonwealth by Mr Hockey (from 61 citizens). Glenthorne To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors from the State of South Australia draws the attention of the House to the following: The significance to the people of South Australia of the property known as Glenthorne, an area of approximately 209 hectares situated at O'Halloran Hill. Glenthorne was purchased by the Commonwealth Government in 1913 and has been used by the Commonwealth for a variety of purposes. The current owner of the property, the CSIRO, no longer requires the land. The opportunity now exists to restore the land to its original condition and to integrate it into the surrounding Metropolitan Open Space. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: Protect the land, currently known as Glenthorne, from urban or industrial development. Grant ownership of Glenthorne to the people of South Australia. by Ms Jeanes (from 264 citizens). Badgerys Creek Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that: 1. a proposal has been made by the Department of Transport to build a major no-curfew international airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW; 2. airports are a major source of air pollution and noise pollution; 3. westem Sydney already suffers from the worse air and noise pollution in Australia; 4. an airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW, will only serve to greatly increase such pollution; 5. an airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW, will harm the lifestyle and well-being of citizens living and working in western Sydney. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House not pass any Bill which would lead to the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW. by Miss Jackie Kelly (from 934 citizens). World Heritage Listing: Tarkine To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Tasmania showeth: That your petitioners support the protection of the Tarkine, the largest single tract of rainforest and rainforest wilderness in Australia. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray for the House of Representatives' immediate action in nominating the Tarkine wilderness for World Heritage listing. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Kerr (from 186 citizens). Holsworthy Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Campbelltown and Liverpool draw the attention of the House to the fact that our suburbs and quality of life will be severely depleted by the construction of Holsworthy International Airport. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to immediately abandon any plan to construct an airport at Holsworthy. by Mr Latham (from 1,622 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Liverpool draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Government's proposed changes to child care services will have a detrimental impact on the quality, accessibility and affordability of childcare. We urge the Government to reconsider any proposed cuts in Commonwealth funding or proposals to hand over childcare responsibility to State Governments. by Mr Latham (from 136 citizens). Cooked Chicken Meat To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors within the Divisions of Robertson and Dobell draws to the attention of the House our concerns relating to imported cooked chicken meat. Our concerns relate to two main issues: 1. The adverse impact on the local economy and employment-the Central Coast chicken industry directly employs over 1,000 people and has $46 million plus turnOver. 2. The possible disastrous effects that Newcastle Disease would have Australia wide on our bird industry. It has been identified that over 130 species of Australia birds have no antibodiescommercial flocks, fancy birds, pet birds, and native wild birds are all susceptible. We, the petitioners, request that the House completely ban the import of chicken meat into Australia as no risk to the safety of our bird life is acceptable, notwithstanding the number of local jobs lost. by Mr Lloyd (from 3,020 citizens). Child Support To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for reforms in the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to introduce and implement the following reforms: 1. That child support payments be calculated on the non-custodial parent's (payer) Net basic rate of pay, exclusive of all allowances, overtime and loading. Not on gross income as it is at present and the lowering of percentages. 2. Lowering of ""the cut off points"" as an incentive to continue in the workplace. Child Care 3. Child Support payments be calculated from the net income on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. 4. The non-custodial parent receives a reduction in the child support payment while he or she has the children for periods of time e.g. holidays. by Mr Marek (from 20 citizens). Provider Numbers To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petItIOn of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That we the undersigned are totally opposed to the Government's legislation to restrict the issuing of Medicare provider numbers to doctors. We consider that such an action would cause serious suffering, including a severe disadvantage to women, rural communities and medical research. We believe that it is the essential right of all Australian registered doctors to have access to provider numbers that allow them to provide services to the community which attract Medicare rebates for patients. We believe that the proposed restrictions are an attack on the most defenceless and vulnerable strata of the medical profession. We consider it to be a denial of natural justice and an attack on Medicare. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: Call upon the Federal Minister for Health the Hon. Michael Wooldridge MP, to revoke the restrictions on provision of Medicare provider numbers to doctors and to enter into discussions with representatives of the medical profession to identify alternative measures to resolve the problems facing Medicare and the Australian medical workforce. by Mr Martin (from 806 citizens). Freedom of Political Liberty To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned men and women of South Australia respectively showeth that: 1. We believe Independent M.H.R. Pauline Hanson has enlightened the undersigned to the truth behind party politics of the past and as is operating presently. 2. Few people in Australian Parliamentary history have shown such distinguished honour, courage, conviction and fortitude as Pauline Hanson M.H.R. has demonstrated thus far. 3. We believe that Pauline Hanson M.H.R. truly represents our will and views to Parliament. 4. We fully support her representative stand and we are hopeful that the Honourable Member will continue to be guided by her convictions to represent our will, and, that she will not give into those who would coerce, threaten or intimidate. Your petitioners are united in the above expressed view and therefore request this House to take immediate steps to see that existing Statute and Common law protections are enforced, regarding the freedom of speech of Pauline Hanson M.H.R. and those numerous Australian citizens who support her. by Mr MCLachlan (from 60 citizens). Mr Charles and Mrs Doris Gibson To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Cook draws to the attention of the House the plight of Mr Charles and Mrs Doris Gibson, residents of Caringbah, in the state of New South Wales. In 1981, Mr and Mrs Gibson, citizens of Great Britain arrived in Australia as visitors. Contrary to the laws of Australia, they overstayed their visas and have resided here from that time. Both elderly people, the Gibsons nevertheless have conducted for 14 years a business known as Your Friendly Pet Shop in the Kingsway Mall, Caringbah, and continue to conduct this business. During their 16 years in Australia, the Gibsons have enmeshed themselves in the community. They have made many friendships of a lasting nature and have been accepted into the local community. Your petitioners therefore request the House, in view of the exceptional and extenuating circumstances of this case, to do all that is in your power to achieve permanent residency for the Gibsons. by Mr Mutch (from 486 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of the undersigned residents on the electoral roll in Australia 1. Deplores the proposed funding cuts to the ABC and consequent major cuts to staffing and programs. 2. Commends to the Parliament the Coalition's national and community broadcasting policy, which states: 'The ABC must be an independent, truly national, publicly funded broadcaster devoted to excellence and objectivity and offering a clear alternative to the commercial broadcasting sector. The ABC should reflect the broad spectrum of interests, values and views in the Australian community' . 3. Reminds Parliament that the policy includes the following unqualified promises: The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC and retain triennial funding. The Coalition will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio. The coalition will ""Cease the politicisation of the ABC Board"" and ""will ensure that the future appointees to the ABC Board not only possess the broadcasting management, and fmancial skills needed to guide Australia's pre-eminent broadcaster into the next century but also reflect a broad cross section of the Australian community. The Coalition will insist upon strict managerial and financial separation of the ABC's Charter broadcasting activities from its commercial ventures ... The Coalition ""will encourage and support the ongoing expansion of ABC radio, including the extension of the highly successful Triple J network into regional Australia"" The Coalition will ""maintain current levels of financial support for the orchestra"" 4. Reminds Parliament that the Prime Minister made an unqualified commitment to keep his promises. 5. Calls upon Parliament: (i) To oppose any weakening of the comprehensive Charter of the ABC, and (ii) to honour these unqualified commitments which we, the undersigned, regard as core promises to the Australian people. by Mr Nairn (from 168 citizens). Petitions received. NA Debate resumed.",51
144,Mr HICKS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"In supporting teachers, there is no doubt that schools must have a principal who shows strong leadership and, through his teaching staff, ensures that, as well as being made aware of their rights, students are also made aware of their responsibilities both to themselves and to others. Rules should be applied consistently and fairly and have clearly stated consequences for positive and negative behaviours. The rules should be developed jointly between parents, teachers and students to create a sense of ownership. Appropriate behaviour should be taught not as a separate curriculum item but as an integral part of the teaching process. There is no doubt that teachers are responsible for the pastoral care of students in their class, irrespective of the academic subjects they teach. Having said what should occur in a perfect world, what is actually happening? From some of the feedback I received from schools, particularly high schools, all is not well when it comes to being able to discipline students for untoward behaviour. In New South Wales there are procedures in place to deal with dangerous and difficult students, and no doubt these are mirrored in other states. Procedures such as suspension, exclusion and expulsion are seen by the New South Wales Department of School Education as strategies to be used only in serious cases of misbehaviour. In accordance with these procedures, principals are asked to use their authority immediately if they believe the safety of staff or students is at risk. While one could believe all these measures would cover all eventualities, they do not, and because time is short I cannot raise a great many anecdotal cases of which I am aware. It is enough to say that, while most high schools may be considered as being not particularly violent, there is now a trend towards outrageous verbal abuse of students and teachers alike by miscreant pupils. Some of the verbal abuse is mixed with threats of violence directed towards teachers and, in a number of incidences of which I am aware, directed to young female teachers. The report Teachers Sticks and stones confirms this where it states: Teachers' unions expressed concern about the impact of violence on their members. The Committee was told that education departments had limited capacity to provide long-term care to people who were affected by violent behaviour. Teachers who were assaulted had great difficulty in returning to school. Many of them never returned. It was not always the physical assault that caused the major problems. Verbal assault, or a place in which their security was threatened by students, had a devastating impact on teachers' confidence and on their ability to feel safe in a school environment. Teachers were sometimes transferred to another school, rather than the system addressing the violence which had occurred. It is not equitable or just that one or two students, no matter what their background or history, should be able to detrimentally affect the educational process of their fellow students and demean the authority and standing of their teachers with unruly behaviour. While there is a process to be worked through in consultation with the student, teacher and parent, this often breaks down when the student is recalcitrant or, in some cases today, the parents or guardians are not supportive of the teacher, school or educative process or the parents cannot simply be found. As I said at the commencement of my speech, I am only touching the surface of this subject. It is really related to how we view teachers in our society, what we expect of them as in many cases they take on the role of guardian, mentor as well as educator. What education and ethical standards should we expect of them? What remuneration should they obtain for the difficult and now sometimes dangerous occupational role they fill? As parliamentarians, we should not only be pondering on these important issues but also be taking positive action as a matter of extreme urgency not only for reasons of equity but also, if surveys are correct, because of the growing number of existing teachers who wish they were anything else but a teacher. I am aware that the present federal government has made statements that it wishes to acknowledge the role of teachers, to give them authority and to lift their status to where it was some decades ago and to where it should be today. I, therefore, call on this parliament and all state and territory governments to take notice of this motion.",57
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded?,58
146,Mr COBB,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,58
147,Mr SA WFORD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) is to be congratulated for the first two points of his motion. His intention in the third point is honourable, but I believe it has a wrong emphasis. But I will come to that later. We live in a society that cares little for children and for the people who work with them. Teachers are often very much undervalued, poorly paid for their efforts, too often subjected to unfair criticism and let down time and time again by educational administrators. Over the last 20 years, primary schools-the very place where children gain literacy, numeracy, social, communication and technological skills-have been seriously overlooked and ignored. Twenty years ago, my own state of South Australia was recognised internationally as a world leader in primary education. What went wrong? Firstly, primary and junior primary schools were then administered by their own bureaucrats, by a department separate from secondary schools, TAFE and universities. Differential expenditure existed between the various sectors, but nowhere to the extent it exists today where primary schools are very much the poor relation. The amalgamation of the schools sector into a single bureaucracy very quickly ended any effective advocacy by educational administrators for primary and junior primary schools. Primary and junior primary staff, who then often enjoyed far more public confidence from the community than their secondary counterparts or TAFE or university counterparts, very soon realised that their needs were nearly always related to a third order of importance. During this period of administrative failure to primary and junior primary schools, the expectations on teachers in these schools were raised dramatically. Primary schools, largely organised with one teacher and 30-plus same age children for a year, were confronted with the following curriculum demands, and I bet I miss some of them. Language arts included reading, writing, speaking, listening, spelling, grammar, comprehension, poetry, literature studies, library skills and often a foreign language. Mathematics subjects included numeracy sets and logic, graphing, geometry, algebra and computing skills. Environmental studies subjects included geography, history, social studies, health, science, sex· education, road safety, girls our education, equal opportunity, Aboriginal studies included ethnic cultures, religious education, media studies, behaviour management, conflict resolution, collaborative learning and peer relationships. Expressive arts subjects included music, choir singing, drama, art and craft, home economics, outdoor education, physical education, dance, swimming, athletics and team and individual sports. All of this plus an understanding of poverty, unemployment, breakdown in families, child abuse and so on. And, God forbid, some people in this country wonder why there is a problem. The expectations were raised. The support to meet those expectations was taken away. Teacher training became confused and added to the responsibilities of the classroom teacher. Gender balance-or, more accurately, gender imbalance-grossly favoured female teachers. Many schools had no male teachers whatsoever. Recruitment of teachers was in turmoil. Entry into the profession by young teachers was difficult, and that necessary dynamism created by enthusiastic young teachers went missing. The existing teacher force got older, lost morale, learned not to complain and focused increasingly on retirement or another occupation, but nevertheless still tried to do their best in increasingly difficult circumstances. Some of the best teachers just left. Many others took packages to retire early or to pursue other careers. The remaining teacher force got older again, and silent resentment grew as the lack of empathy for teachers' and children's plight became commonplace in this country. Of those four major subject areas I mentioned earlier, may I state quite unequivocally the following. In 25 years as a teacher, a consultant and a primary school principal for most of that time, I have never seen or expected a teacher to be proficient in those four areas. Yet, in the face of the obvious, teachers and children were, and still are, deployed as one teacher for 30-plus children for the whole school year. Alternative and more appropriate forms of deployment require additional staffing, at one to two additional staff per 100 enrolments. But that issue-and that is the core issue-has never effectively been addressed by any state government or teachers union in Australia. In schools where I was principal I soon learned that to manage a quality educational program I needed to at least remove one of those subject areas from the responsibility of a classroom teacher. The area that I found most suitable was the specialisation in expressive arts. I did whatever was required legally-albeit questionable by some-to create a specialist music/drama teacher, a specialist physical education/dance teacher and a specialist arts and craft teacher in all the schools where I was principal. This allowed classroom teachers to concentrate on the other three areas and it provided time for professional development. As a consequence of that, the classes were marginally higher, but overall the benefits outweighed the disadvantages. However, I should point out that, if you were in a primary school with an enrolment of less than 300, the aforementioned deployment was well nigh impossible. Teachers resisted the introduction of specialist teachers, complaining about the increased class size and loss of control over all the curriculum. But after the implementation they never did. However, during this 20-year period innovative strategies in primary schools were strangled. Other institutions in this country did not help. The leadership expected from universities went missing. They saw the necessary increased expenditure for primary schools as a potential threat to their own. Similarly, no sympathy came from T AFE or secondary schools, except on very rare occasions. The leadership from institutions like the church went missing. Conditions in many private schools were worse than public schools, which explained some of their reticence. The leadership from trade unions went missing. Like the church, they became more preoccupied with their dwindling membership. The leadership of the media went missing. A Sydney study showed that 96 per cent of media references to children are negative. least Parents went missing. Two income families and single parent families became the norm in many areas and the opportunity for those parents to become involved in school matters diminished. But out in that wider community general resentment and anger grew and teachers in primary schools became easy targets for all sorts of pent-up emotions and stress, much of which had nothing to do with education. Teachers became an easy group to blame for any government policy poorly received in the community. Parents blamed teachers for their own inadequacies on issues of parenting and discipline. At the same time as those negative factors began to have a cumulative effect, teachers were asking for a fair go for the kids and a fair go for them. They were clearly stating in the mid-1970s that up to 10 per cent of children had poor literacy and numeracy skills. They were ignored. In the mid-1980s the 10 per cent figure had grown to 10 per cent plus. They were still ignored. In the 1990s the figures were 20 per cent and they were common. Several university academics denied at this time the literacy crisis. Their motivation was obvious. Primary education and early intervention were competitors for that education dollar. But the greatest denial of all came from state governments through very compliant educational bureaucrats. The 1970s to the 1990s were 20 years of failure to acknowledge a problem growing rapidly. The minister now regularly uses the figure of 30 per cent illiteracy. What is the federal government's response? Test the kids. Cripple government schools. Blame the teachers. But is there any substantive understanding or acknowledgment of the problem? No way. This government operates on the lowest common popular denominator. A small or indeed large transfer of enrolments to private schools will not solve the problem. Testing will not solve the problem. I am not opposed to testing, and I point out that teacher union opposition to testing is politically stupid-albeit correct in educational terms. The government's strategy is simply to adopt popular tokenism to a problem. Mark my words, it has no hope of success whatsoever. This parliament, albeit the federal government, is not directly responsible for primary school education, but it does need to display leadership to overcome the 'village hall' mentality of many state governments towards primary education. The motion by the member for Riverina is at least a small step in the right direction. It is an oft repeated cliche that our greatest resource is our children. The reality, however, in Australian society is very different. Kids get a rough go in this country. They always have and it is time that changed. It is time the people who care for them probably more than even their parents-and who do so very effectively-got a fair go too. It is all very well for some commentators to get up and point to headlines that focus on a very small group of incompetent or unsuitable teachers. That some of these teachers remain in the system is the fault of educational administrators. It is not the fault of the teachers. I commend the motion, with the exception of point (3). I simply say this to the member for Riverina: if you want literacy and numeracy to be tackled effectively you have to give primary schools-the very place where it occurs-the resources to do it properly. No amount of screaming or raving and ranting will change it. Teaching children who want to learn is very easy. The real challenge for teachers and for governments is to take on the children who for some reason or another do not want to learn. That is the real challenge, and that is the real challenge that this motion put forward by the member for Riverina needs to address.",58
148,Mr COBB,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I also congratulate the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) for bringing forward this important motion to the House today. I am pleased to support it. The motion, I believe, succinctly encapsulates the topic that is widely debated in conversation but is rarely espoused in the public area because it is not quite politically correct. We have something like 220,000 teachers across Australia who are responsible for one of the most vital jobs in our society, namely, the education of our children. The average age of teachers today is rising, as the previous speaker said. I think it is something in excess of 43 years now. Mr Sawford-Try 50.",60
149,Mr COBB,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"He says 50-he may be right. Their role and what they are expected to do have changed dramatically over the last quarter of a century. It is becoming increasingly difficult for teachers just to get on and do what they do best, namely, teach. They have to manage a whole host of emerging social problems without proper training and support and sometimes without proper authority. The time and effort spent on this means that they have less time available to spend with their students. It also causes disruption in classes to students who want to get on and learn themselves. All this, of course, discourages and disillusions otherwise good and dedicated teachers. We are seeing increasing reports in the newspapers about violence in classrooms becoming prevalent in some areas. This is putting an enormous strain not just on pupils but particularly on teachers--especially young teachers and especially young female teachers. There are some students in some areas that have become almost 'untouchable' in their behaviour. If we do not address this properly and fully and head on, it is a problem that will only grow. We are in many ways losing our way in this society. The responsibility for all this is multifaceted. Parents have a responsibility here. They seem to want every other child disciplined except their own. They will not back up teachers when the teachers are right. I do not think parents attend school functions and become involved in what is going on in schools as much as they could. I see that as I move around. Governments have taken away many of the common sense authority measures from teachers. Society in general seems to be putting too much emphasis on rights instead of responsibilities. There is a trend to move away from the necessary degree of regimentation and discipline that I believe should exist in schools. We need some public debate on this very important topic and growing problem. Education departments also have a vital role to play. They must revamp some training for their teachers. Teachers must be taught how to deal with aggression and inappropriate behaviour amongst students so that they can become better equipped in conflict resolution and develop effective communication and conflict skills. To a large extent, teachers have been left out on their own on this. Indeed, pupils themselves could be taught some of these skills. In fact, school rules in some instances could be tightened up to include a clear section for parents on the consequences of inappropriate behaviour by their children when they are students. Perhaps they should be asked to sign off on that. There are many areas here that do need addressing. It is an evolving problem that has happened to the degree that it has only over the last couple of decades or so. I do strongly support the member for Riverina in that teachers should be supported on that. In summary, I would say that the matters that I have touched on in this debate do need more attention. Our teachers must be backed up because they are at the forefront of having to deal with these matters. They have to receive greater support not only from the schools themselves and the education authorities but also from the parents. With that, the teachers will gain greater skills to deal with the problems, and they can get on with what they do best-teaching our nation's children.",60
150,Mr QUICK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"As a primary trained teacher of many years standing, I am delighted to be able to rise in this place to put on record my strong support for Australian teachers. Those in this place who are so inclined keep very close contact with all aspects of the education of young people and are very aware of the problems mentioned by the previous speakers today. Like other speakers, I thank the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) for bringing the issue of the need for greater support for teachers to this House. Hopefully, it will engender some debate out there in the wider community. Those of us who have been teachers in a former life, and especially those who operated in the primary field like my esteemed colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), have regaled many here on countless occasions with, 'I told you this would happen; it is only a matter of time.' It is interesting to note, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide said, the third part of the motion, which calls for more authority to be given to teachers so that teachers and their students are not placed in danger and teachers can get on with the job of educating those students who wish to be taught. In my humble opinion, this is not what it is all about. The problems facing teachers stem from the decision taken during the 1970s by governments of alI persuasions to restrict spending and resources to primary schools and the children they taught. Blind Freddy could have told you that removing the necessary support mechanisms from primary teachers would result in an inability to ensure that all children, irrespective of their social status or ethnic background, would leave primary schools and enter the next stage in their education without all the skills necessary to succeed. It is remarkable to note, but it is really simple, that unless you get the foundations built correctly, unless you can ensure that all the children you have in your care are immersed in the love of learning and unless you can provide each and every one of them with the resources and support to undertake the complexity that is early education not only are you selling the children short but you are going to place enormous stress and strain on the societal framework. Australian teachers are doing a fantastic job trying to cope as they are with the complexity that is modem education and having to face budget constraints year after year. We have a middle aged and weary work force. Without a huge injection of new blood into the teaching ranks, the problems alIuded to by the honourable member for Riverina will occur even more frequently. And what are governments doing about that? Absolutely nothing. The prospect of having to provide so many additional services within the schools is another problem, because they are not being undertaken by state community service departments, and this only adds to the teaching burden. I wonder how you can justify all the associated costs placed on taxpayers by having to provide youth shelters, homeless allowances and innumerable youth workers, for example, and having to respond to one of the world's highest youth suicide rates, seeing our youth increasingly being placed in juvenile correction institutions and having such appalIing youth unemployment rates when all that is required is a fraction of that money we currently expend on all the above to be returned to primary education in the way of more resources. What do I mean by more resources? An obvious first step is that all primary schools must have-as the honourable member for Port Adelaide said-full-time libraries to engender a love of learning and full-time physical education teachers to enable children, irrespective of whether they are academic or non-academic and whether they have good hand-eye coordination, to participate in all ranges of physical education. It is the same for music and special education. So we need quite to have librarians, physical education, music and special education teachers in every primary school so that every primary child can realise their full potential. It happened when I taught in the 1960s and the 1970s and then it gradually faded out until we had this-I do not know where it came from; somewhere overseas they used to allude-and we started to go down the drain. So, instead of having close on 15 per cent of our primary children entering high schools currently at risk, a simple reallocation of perhaps one-twentieth of the money we are spending when we are dragging them out of the gutters, taking the needles out of their arms, trying to counsel them by saying 'Don't kill yourself' could be spent giving our children what they deserve. Why can't the states do it? It amazes me. I thank the honourable member for Riverina for bringing this to the parliament's attention. Hopefully some of our state coIIeagues will listen and we can get this simple reallocation. I agree with the member for Port Adelaide: universities have had it too good for too long, and so have secondary colleges. (Time expired).",61
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Nehl)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Automobile Industry Debate resumed from 3 March, on motion by Dr Theophanous: That this House: (1) acknowledges the progress made by local car and component manufacturers and their labour force in achieving increased productivity, improved export performance and quality production to the benefit of Australian consumers; (2) expresses its concerns at the majority recommendations of the Industry Commission interim report on the automobile industry and especially the recommendation to reduce tariffs below 15%; (3) expresses its concerns that the Chairman of the Commission has chosen to publicly advocate this recommendation, while at the same time pretending that he will produce an objective final report; (4) expresses its firm belief that when all factors are taken into account (including Australia's obligations under the World Trade Organisation) the overwhelming national interest is for motor car tariffs to remain at 15% after the year 2000; and (5) is of the view that the reductions which have taken place in the tariffs to this point have not significantly cut the prices of motor cars for consumers and that to reduce tariffs below 15% will be tantamount to devastating the Australian automobile industry and destroying thousands of skilled jobs in regional Australia.",62
152,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"This issue has occasioned great division within government ranks. The Advertiser of 18 March referred to comments by Senator Minchin about some of his colleagues that they were essentially grandstanding. This is at a time when the Premier of South Australia was attempting to move on government policy on this matter. Martin Cameron, the President of the South Australian Liberal Party, commented: There is pressure from the Premier and the SA Government, and the party would support that pressure, for the Federal Government to take a stand on tariffs. Obviously people within the party are speaking to all members about the needs of SA. I clearly support the stand of John Olsen. But some of those opposite, such as the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), have been very dismissive of these kinds of comments, certainly unconcerned about the very great impact that these threatened changes will have. As the representative of Reid, which formerly had the Ford motor plant and has significant component parts manufacturing units within the electorate, I certainly associate myself with the motion of the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) which seeks to take into consideration a variety of countries in our region. We see his comments that in Vietnam there are import restriction levels of 60 to 200 per cent; in South Korea, 25 to 100 per cent; and in Malaysia, five to 200 per cent. Labor's policy, announced recently, is that there should be no change to 2005 with a review in 2003. This is the context in which this should be considered: the fact that we are not competing on a level playing field and the fact that Australian workers do have to compete against this level of protection. As people well know, that takes many forms. The wider context is the problems of manufacturing industry in this country. Michael Dwyer commented in the Australian Financial Review of 17 March: The March quarter survey of manufacturing in NSW, prepared by the Australian Business Chamber and released yesterday, provides more evidence of the current malaise afflicting the manufacturing sector. .... with employment considered a lagging indicator of growth, many large manufacturers will continue to shed staff before activity in the sector begins to lift in the second half of this year ... The staff reductions expected by NSW manufacturers, when translated nationally, would see 7,000 further jobs lost this year. This is the reality that manufacturers in South Australia and regional Australia face with the determination of this government to follow ideological facets rather than look at the economic reality that faces these industries. This comes at a time when the government condemns people to go to meaningless efforts in regard to dole diaries where employers around this country are saying, 'We are not going to have any part of it; we are not going to fill out these forms,' and these people are condemned to being thrown on the scrap heap and deprived of benefits. It comes at a time when these people, many of whom have worked in this industry not for the 12 months that the government says is going to be the tryout period in small business in this country but for 20 or 30 years, are going to be thrown out of employment; and they are going to be condemned to a situation where they, like many young people, will be forced into the requirements of working for the dole. This is a reality. This spells oblivion and long-term unemployment for people in their 50s and 60s. They are the people that are going to be sacrificed. They are the people that will not find employment on the farms of the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) or anywhere else in this country. It is all right for the member for Corangamite and others to come in here and say that we are going to get cheaper cars and we are going to have these kinds of benefits. The reality is that these industries are on the brink; they face major problems. What happened to the Ford factory in my electorate is what they now face. There must be grave doubts about the Productivity Commission's thrust. As Ian Webber noted: Cuts in assistance may easily have dramatic consequences on those areas heavily involved in automotive activities ... Tariff uled between now and the year 2000 are estimated to add 0.3% to the South Australian unemployment rate a decade from now ... It is not as though the South Australian employment situation at the moment is all that crash hot. We all know that, with our participation rate and the older population of South Australia, the employment situation is already at crisis point. I join in the debate on this motion by saying there should be consideration, there must be transparency and there must be a look at what is happening in our region. We should not hold to this blind ideological faith that this is the answer.",63
153,Mr MCARTHUR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) would fully understand that there is no level playing field throughout the world. The key feature he should understand is that tariffs around the world are at about five per cent. There are a few anomalies, I concede that point, but on balance tariffs have fallen and average five per cent around the world. However, this motion would have us believe that tariff reductions would be tantamount to devastating the Australian automobile industry, while at the same time it praises the improvements in the industry over the past six years, a period when tariffs have been falling each year by 2.5 per cent. As the member for Reid should understand, it was the previous Labor government's decision to lower the automobile tariff barrier from 57 per cent down to 22 per cent. It was gained with bipartisan support from the shadow minister at the time, Mr Ian MCLachlan, and people like me. That tariff reduction exposed the industry to greater competition and led to the great gains which the motion now refers to. By contrast, for most of this century, our car industry has been highly protected and uncompetitive by world standards. If tariff protection were an effective way to secure the future of Australian industries, then by 1990 we would have had the best car industry and the best TCF industry in the world following 70 years of protection-that is, if the arguments of the honourable member for Reid reductions schedwere to be sustained. Tariff reductions, far from being devastating, have arguably secured the future of Australia's car industry. I have visited a number of the automobile factories in Geelong. I have a good news story to tell about the improvements on the ground that have occurred in the factories and in their industry since tariff rates have been gradually reduced. At Henderson's Automotive Group, where they construct car seats for the four manufacturers, cost reductions of two to three per cent each year have been passed on to the four main car component manufacturers. They have an open mind on tariffs. They conceded that had tariffs never fallen the hard decisions would not have ever been taken in that factory. They now have a position where there are good industrial relations and good teamwork in the factory. They are even doing their own maintenance on their own equipment, and everyone is part of the team. Surveys of employer attitude show that higher pay is not the No. 1 issue, evidence of a real teamwork culture. I have also been to Pilkingtons, which manufactures windscreens for both the domestic industry as well as for exports. Costs are down 15 per cent over the last six years. Productivity is up a staggering 92 per cent. They have now got 13 unions down to one union. Quality performance has improved remarkably-the rate of 7,000 faults per million is down to 300 faults per million today. That is a remarkable change in the productive performance. This has led to a $50 million renewed investment by Pilkingtons in their Geelong operations, including a new factory. I also visited Paratus Industries which constructs upholstery for the motor car industry. It employs 70 people. Likewise, it has achieved cost reductions in each year on components for the Ford motor company. It has moved to two shifts, giving greater flexibility to the work force, especially to female workers. It has embraced enterprise bargaining with a focus on training and continuous improvement. It has regular work force meetings to discuss the progress of the firm, possible improvements and where it stands in the state of the market. On Friday, 14 March, I visited the Toyota factory at Altona in Melbourne with members of the government industry committee. This is a very up-to-date factory participating in a global car manufacturing operation with a potential to export to 21 countries. Profitabiliforce ty is improving in that plant. As they pointed out very clearly, the exchange rate was a key factor which eroded their profitability in 1996. They made the point that sales tax was a big issue-something that the Labor government put on. That 22 per cent sales tax was a bigger issue than the 22 per cent on tariffs. I also met with the Geelong Manufacturing Industry Task Force. They are very concerned about the tariff argument in Geelong. They talked about micro-economic reform, market access and industrial relations, not protection, industry assistance or backdoor subsidies. Theirs was a practical, on-the-ground assessment of how they saw the tariff argument. Protectionist arguments have been demolished both in theory and in practice. This motion simply wants to have it both ways: to concede that competition has brought about great improvements in the local automobile industry while at the same time claiming that protection is the answer for the future. Protection never secured the future of any industry. It never led to efficiency, and it certainly never protected jobs in the long term.",64
154,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The importance of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry to Australia really goes without saying. That is part of the problem, I suspect. This industry is so important that we can, at times, take it for granted. I suspect that the leadership of the government in this place is taking it for granted and is at risk, in its the adoption of the Industry Commission's recommendations, of putting the jobs of those workers not only in my electorate and my state but indeed right across Australia at risk. Because something is so important that it goes without saying does not mean that we should not, from time to time, remind ourselves of the very great importance of that industry to Australia. Nearly 50,000 jobs across Australia-half of them in manufacturing; half of them in the related component manufacturing industriesare vitally important to the 50,000 families that are associated with them and to states like South Australia, which play a very vital role in the industry. My own state of South Australia has some 25 per cent of the work employed in the motor vehicle industry. That means that it is a very important industry to us in South Australia. The impact on regional economies can never be understated. We must constantly remind ourselves of the devastating impact which any withdrawal of support for this industry would have on the regional economy of South Australia. I do not support the maintenance of inefficient industries through high levels of tariff; but, unfortunately, the Liberal and National parties throughout history have had only two levels of commitment to tariffs: they have been either on or off. During the Second World War and post the Second World War, they promoted massive tariffs across the board, and in particular on this industry, and then we saw in the Fightback options and beyond a commitment to zero tariff policies. It is this on again, off again adoption of tariffs which has been the cause of the problems to date. Indeed, the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) has correctly pointed out the gains-as has been pointed out by the member for Calwell, Andrew Theophanous, in his mction-which we have made through managed tariff reform. That is the distinction to be drawn here: managed, moderate tariff reform-in other words, the Button plan. It was the Button plan which gave us the increase in industry productivity. It was the Button plan which gave us the massive increase in exports from this industry. It was the Button plan that protected jobs and gave that industry-and particularly the industry in South Australia-a future. It is the managedMr MCArthur interjecting Mr MARTYN EV ANS-Of course, the member for Corangamite interjects outside of his seat, but the reality is that his remarks ignore the importance of this industry to South Australia. I am sure that some honourable members opposite-some-will speak in this debate, as they have done outside this debate in the public sector, and indicate their support for a retention of a managed tariff policy. That is what is vital to South Australia-not the abandonment of tariffs overnight, not the introduction of high levels of tariffs and protection. That will not support the industry either in the long run. A managed transition is what is so vital. It is a managed transition which the Industry Commission seeks to pull away from this industry. It is a managed transition which this government is, I suspect, in danger of walking away from. That will do more than anything to undermine the jobs in Australia, in South Australia-in Kingston and, in particular, in Bonython. The employees at General Motors, Lear Corporation, GNB Technologies, Mullins Wheels and Tubalco-which between them support some 7,000 families in my electorate and pour millions of dollars into our economy-are the vital people which this government is in grave danger of ignoring in this policy debate. We have seen, throughout the history of tariffs in this country, many advocating very high levels of tariffs in production. That is appropriate. We have seen others like John Olsen, the now Premier of South Australia, when the Fightback policy was before the public, supporting a zero tariff option. That will not do overnight either. What we need is what we have had previously under the Button plan: managed reform, gradual reductions and then, in 2000, a pause while we assess the impact of this change, while we see what our neighbours are doing and while we work out a reasoned, balanced way of moving this industry forward. Under the managed reform, we have seen massive growth in exports, we have seen productivity gains and we have seen the work force cooperate actively with management through the union movement to ensure that those gains are locked in for the workers, for the companies, for the state and for Australia. That is the kind of reform I want to see continued, and I am sure that the motion before the House seeks to do just that. I commend the motion to honourable members.",65
155,Mrs GALLUS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I Cannot support this motion on the automobile industry. This is the most incredible mickey mouse motion that I have seen come before the House in a long time. It does not address the issues, and it is simply there to create a bit of fuss and to look good for the Labor Party. Let us face it: on this issue they need a lot of reason to look good. Let us have a look at what the Labor Party actually did about tariffs. Let us start in 1973. What happened? Gough Whitlam got up one morning and said, 'Today, let's drop tariffs by 25 per cent, shall we. Let's not talk to the tariff board about it, and far from discussing this with industry we'll just drop tariffs by 25 per cent. ' We all know what happened to the industry following that drop. In 1988 the next drop came. The level of tariffs had gone up in the interim under the Fraser government, but in 1988 what happened? There was a 12.5 per cent drop. Thankyou to the Labor Party-this self-same Labor Party which is putting forward this mickey mouse motion today. Have we forgotten about the 25 per cent in 1973? Have we forgotten about the 12.5 per cent in 1988? not From 1988 to 2000, there will have been a 30 per cent drop. All the drops in tariffs in the history of this country have come through the Labor Party: 25 per cent in 1973, 121/2 per cent in 1988 and 30 per cent from 1988 to 2000. Is the best the Labor Party can do to come up with an excuse for the motion that the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has done today? They are not fooling the people in the industry; they are not fooling the workers. Previously in this debate we had the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) trying to convince us that he was defending the car industry and the workers. Was not the member for Corio an assistant who worked in the office of the minister for industry in 1988? In 1993, when he was elected a member, did we hear him come into this parliament and say, 'Tariffs shouldn't come down'? No, he was saying, 'Bring them down by 21/2 per cent.' The motion from the member of Calwell, which the member for Corio supports, as does the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), is an excuse for a motion, isn't it? It is a personal attack on the head of the Productivity Commission, Bill Scales. It contains words like 'firm belief' and 'is of the view'. Isn't this the whole problem with what is going on with the industry today? We have on one side the religion of anti-tariffs, those people who are saying that tariffs are bad and who came forward with a report-as did the Productivity Commission-that was not founded on good evidence but simply came up with excuses to drop the tariff. That was not good enough. What we expect from the Productivity Commission-and any report from the government-is a report founded on fact, and good fact. What is also wrong with this motion is that it talks about belief, as if somehow on the other side of the argument there is a religion now to be followed. This parliament should not adopt one side or the other of this debate but say to the Productivity Commission and everyone else, 'Give us good arguments. Just don't give us a report that gives us your religion, what you believe. Tell us what are the advantages and disadvantages of either policy, and make sure that those arguments stand up for analysis.' The arguments of the Productivity Commission do not stand up to analysis, but nor does this mickey mouse motion from the member for Calwell.",66
156,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Once again I have the honour of following the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in a debate concerning the motor vehicle industry. It is pleasing to see this member supporting the motor vehicle industry, but it ought to be noted at the same time that the Adelaide Advertiser, as recently as this morning, reported that there was a dinner  which the members for Grey (Mr Wakelin), Makin (Mrs Draper), Boothby (Dr Southcott) and Wakefield (Mr Andrew), for example, simply would not attend. They would not go to hear their own Premier talking about the importance of the motor vehicle industry to the South Australian economy. Those members, unlike the member for Hindmarsh, are simply toeing the party line and the government line at the expense of their own electorates, and that is entirely regrettable. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting this motion as someone who, like the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), has many of my constituents working in the motor vehicle industry, directly employed by that industry by Ford or indirectly employed by that industry through automotive component manufacturers. I take the members of the government back to the coalition's pre-election employment policy which said: Coalition policies will move Australia back towards full employment: the situation where paid employment is available to anyone who seeks it ... The National Job Creation Strategy will deliver this objective. The language was clear and unequivocal. But, instead, what we have seen is unemployment growing from 8.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent under this government, long-term unemployment on the increase and the mid-term budget forecasting for unemployment revised upwards from 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. On top of that, we find the Productivity Commission inquiring into automotive tariffs and not engaging in any serious examination of the impact of their proposals on employment within the automotive industry. They did not examine, for example, the concern expressed by the National Secretary of the Vehicle Division of the Manufacturing Workautomotive ers Union that removing tariff protection could cost 30,000 jobs and threaten another 30,000 in the component industry. I would point out that in the northern region of bourne the automotive industry remains the most significant employer and that Ford and its associated suppliers and distributors count for over seven per cent of all jobs in the region. My own calculations are that, if the automotive industry were to disappear, unemployment in the north-western region would go up to 20 per cent and perhaps even beyond. It is extraordinary, against that background, that the Productivity Commission can disregard unemployment as a social issue. The majority members of that commission put up a recommendation for scenario B: a reduction in tariffs of 2.5 per cent per annumand from 15 per cent in the year 2000 to five per cent by the year 2004. Scenario B, by their own calculations at page 118, is the regime which does the most damage to unemployment, cutting it by 3.5 per cent by the year 201O! I further make the observation that motor vehicle restructuring plan has been incessantly heralded with the promise of lower real car prices. But what is the dence? We have had tariffs being reduced since 1984 but, in terms of affordability, a family six is now 1.4 times more difficult to purchase than it was then. The information that I got from the Parliamentary Librarycompetitiveness supplied by the NRMA to them-was that the price of an average car, for example the Holden Commodore Executive base model, has risen from $15,756 in 1986 to $29,510 1996, an increase of over 87 per cent, with the increase in new car prices outstripping cpr by 42 per cent! When the Productivity Commission and some of its cheer squad backbenchers amongst members opposite say this is going to give us lower motor vehicle prices, the evidence suggests the contrary. There is evidence that these tariff cuts will lead lower motor vehicle prices. r also want to point out the cumulative impact of tariff cuts and automotive industry restructuring on a region like the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It is not just the industry that has been important to us, it has been the textile, clothing and footwear industries as well. They have endured a long period of restructuring. EmployMelment in these industries has dropped from 60,000 in Victoria back in 1986 to 40,000 odd in 1996-a cut of one third. Nothing has acreplaced them. (Time expired)",67
157,Ms WORTH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"This motion provides members with the opportunity to put on the record their views on the importance of the car industry and of the people that are employed in that industry. But it is also evidence of Labor's policy backflips now that it is in opposition. This is a belated attempt to show concern for workers, but it was the workers who were so badly let down by Labor over 13 years. I agree that local car component manufacturers have met the challenge of adapting to a declining tariff regime. Exports have increased and our international standing in automotive produc.lion has improved. I have already, like other members on this side of the House, expressed my concern at the majority recommendation the of the Productivity Commission's interim report. The fact is that both sides of the economic debate on tariffs have attracted evieducated opinion since Federation. What is clear to me, as the elected representative for Adelaide, however, is that there are significant social costs involved if we do not get the balance right between international and maintaining a protected automotive industry employing many thousands of South Australians. Each one of these workers has a face, a name, a family and a in community. The public debate affecting their futures deserves more than just providing the the Labor Party an opportunity to play catch-up politics. The solidarity shown by Labor to their current leader's backflip on this issue belies a greater disloyalty to the Australian public. Only six years ago those no opposition members, now championing the to cause of protectionism, backed Bob Hawke's decision to lower protection levels. I have seen first-hand the value of Labor's record on protecting workers and their jobs. At the Australian National workshops at Islington workers are facing an uncertain future due to Labor's gross mismanagement. The rhetoric of Labor has not changed and it has the same cynical motivation, that is, say and do whatever is politically expedient at the time. Labor's policy change has not resulted from any soul searching exercise or a sudden revelation that their previous tariff policy was wrong. Remember, Labor never says sorry. Labor is just up to one more political stunt. Careful consideration must be given, not with an eye to short-term goals but long-term stability and employment in the automotive industry. That is just what the government will do when it gets the final report from the Productivity Commission. Let me remind the House again of the words of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) commenting on the closure of a car plant in his own electorate in 1992 due to the Button tariff reductions: It was always recognised that there were going to be job losses ... that has always been accepted as a necessary part of making the industry competitive. The member for Hotham' s sudden change of heart typifies Labor's hypocrisy on this issue. I would also like to oppose the implication in this motion that the membership of the committee cannot produce an objective final report. This is a rather bizarre observation given Ian Webber's contribution which is most welcome. The government has recognised the need for a pragmatic and experienced voice on the commission and Mr Webber's appointment illustrates a willingness on the part of the government to be open minded on this issue. I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has already told this House: . .. when the final report of the Productivity Commission is received by the government, it will be addressed against a number of considerations. The first of those considerations is the absolute determination of my government to preserve a viable Australian car manufacturing industry ... We will be conscious of the impact of any decision we take on regional areas of Australia. I am well aware of the importance of the car industry to South Australian economy. I unashamedly support the car industry. We were wrong in the past to have such high levels of protection, but if the goal is for a universal level playing field then let reform take place on an industry by industry basis. When car tariffs are reduced by our trading partners then we will be compelled to do likewise. But rapid reduction of tariffs to secure the high moral ground in international trading forums and to increase pressure on our trading partners exaggerates Australia's influence and underestimates the desire of our Asian trading partners to keep their automotive industries heavily protected. As I have already said in this House: We should proceed carefully and protect Australian jobs . . . central to getting the balance right is addressing the question of what will replace the car industry if tariff reduction damages it terminally.",68
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is therefore adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Government Policy,69
159,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to grieve today about the range and impact of government policies in my electorate of Melbourne Ports. Repeatedly we are told by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other ministers at question time what a great job the government is doing. In terms of government policy and the implementation of those policies, I wonder what impact they are having in an electorate like my own. For example, in the course of the last fortnight there has been an increase in attendance at my office of women who are separated, who cannot get legal aid for restraining orders, who find themselves rearing children in situations where they are separated from their husbands, the house has a mortgage, there is not sufficient money, there is no property settlement and their incapacity to get legal aid to pursue their rights in situations where the assault is common is now placing them in an impossible position. What do the proposed cutbacks in operational subsidies in child care mean? What do they mean to parents of an average Australian family? It means that all parents who have their children at community based centres will, after 1 July this year, have to pay an extra $25 per week for child care. Sole parents will possib- have to pay a total of $85 in child care out of their basic weekly benefit of $175. Again, the burden of that falls most heavily on those women who have to care for their children and who have to work to supplement the family income. So these two groups are, as a result of government policy, finding themselves in continually difficult circumstances. Then there are the changes to rent assistance. I have read some prying documents in my time; this one is from a government that prides itself on what it is doing for the age Australian family. There are many people in my electorate who live in boarding houses, in accommodation which, on no real examination, could be described as flash or indeed effective. Now they have to fiII in a government questionnaire which asks them: do you live alone-that is, no-one else shares your bathroom, bedroom or kitchen? In my community many of the people living on social service payments have never really had a home of their own. Many of them are living in boarding houses. What does this government want to do? It asks them: do you share your bathroom? Most people tend to have a bath in private. They are asked: do you live alone in a caravan, mobile home or boat in either a caravan park or a marina; do you have the right to the provision of meals on a regular basis with your accommodation costs; and do you live in a retirement home or granny flat with the sole right to use your bathroom, bedroom or kitchen? These questionnaires go on. They are directed at that group in the community who need understanding and a sense of compassion from this government. And it is a great ex-rcise. These people, many of whom have never had decent living standards in their whole lives, are now required to fill in this kind of questionnaire. Why? Because this government feels that somehow or other they might be being touched. In relation to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, there is an increased cost to lodge a sponsorship, the removal of special assistance category applications from the former USSR, and higher points needed for English. Is it not a fact that when migrants come out to Australia, particularly from countries like those in the former Soviet Union, they are endeavouring to make their way and they want to sponsor other members of their family? As part 9f this policy they find that they have to pay more when most of them are really struggling to get their families established. There have been cutbacks to schools in my electorate, with pressure on state schools. It is interesting to see what is happening in avereducation. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) in this House gets up and rants and raves. The state schools in my electorate are at peak capacity. The state government is still endeavouring to close some schools. In my electorate there is a school which the state government admits is in need of an effective toilet. They admit that it is a public health menace, that the toilet is dangerous for the children to use. Children go to the toilet as directed by teachers three at a time. What is the proposal of the Victorian government? What is good enough for these kids? A portable toilet. At the same time, any religious crank who wants to go off and buy himself a block of land in the hills around Melbourne in order to lecture a small group of children that the earth is flat can get heavy Commonwealth subsidies. I was one who lived through the state aid argument when it erupted in this society and I have never opposed grants to private schools. But we are getting an imbalance. Why is a parent not entitled to say, 'I want my kid to go to the local state school because it reflects the social milieu of the community in which the child lives and I opt for a small school. I do not want a large school'? Why is that less of a choice than the right of a parent to say, 'I want my kid to go to a church school because I want them to have the benefit of a religious education'? When you look at the policies being employed by this minister for education and complement them with the policies employed by the state government, the choices available to state school parents are being limited. Teachers are being overworked and the school system itself is under threat. If it continues this way we are going to be facing another state aid argument in perhaps three to five years from now, and that would be a disaster for this community. There is no need for it. It is time that the minister for education in this House devoted his attention to looking at what is happening in the state school system in electorate after electorate in Melbourne. In St Kilda in my electorate the break-up of or agency. the Commonwealth Employment ServicesCES-and the Department of Social Security as we know it could mean reduced services for many of the younger people in Melbourne Ports. It does not matter what the overall national average figure for unemployment is and it does not matter what government is in office, St Kilda has always been a place where younger people from dysfunctional families who have left home or have been forced to leave home gravitate. Therefore, whatever the national average of unemployment is, it will be three to four per cent higher in this area. There is a range of social problems related to that. The St Kilda Youth Access Centre, which provides some hope and some support for these younger people, is to be moved out of St Kilda to a new premises within the relocated St Kilda DSS to a destination unknown. The rumour is that it will be relocated to Windsor, in the electorate of the Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The tenure of the South Melbourne DSS office is uncertain, as is the case with the Caulfield CES office. What does a one stop shop mean to an unemployed kid who lives in Port Melbourne or St Kilda? (Time expired) Child Support Agency",69
160,Mrs JOHNSTON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Canning) (4.35 p.m.)Since becoming the elected member for the seat of Canning, I have spent more time dealing with issues relating to the Child Support Agency than with any other matter. I am continually astounded by the number of calls I receive from distraught parents who have nowhere else to turn, and I am sure that all members of this House know what I am talking about. Sad story after sad story end up in my electorate office and my staff and I grieve for the many families whose lives are affected by the trauma of marriage and family break-ups. Indeed the thickest file sitting on my desk at all times is the file dealing with matters relating to the Child Support Agency. It is no coincidence then that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has received more complaints about the Child Support Agency since 1991 than about any other federal department In preparing to speak in this grievance debate this afternoon, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at what other members of the House have said about the Child Support Agency and its roles over the past few years. Whilst I expected to see many speeches, I was totally astounded at the amount of debate this issue has raised. I have lost count of the number of adjournment debates, grievance debates, questions without notice and questions on notice on this subject. My colleague the member for Bowman (Mrs West) noted in a recent speech to this House that it has been estimated that, by the year 2000, the total number of children under the umbrella of the Child Support Agency will be in the vicinity of one million. This is a truly astounding figure. It is imperative that we on this side of the House do not stick our heads in the sand on this issue and hope that it will go away, as previous governments did. I commend my colleagues the member for Longman (Mr Brough) and the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) for their work in setting up the coalition subcommittee, of which I am a member, that is currently looking at the child support scheme. Their ongoing good work means that for the first time we are seeing real proposed solutions to the recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues in 1994. I personally support the concept of child support and I recognise that it is the responsibility of both parents to share in the financial support of their children after a separation. No-one who has phoned or visited my office has denied their responsibility for their children. Indeed, most people tell me that they want a fairer system. That word 'fair' crops up again and again. We need a system that is fair to all who are involved. We do not want to see children being used as pawns between two parents who have grown estranged. Over the past year I have been working hand in hand with officers in the Cannington office of the Child Support Agency which handles the cases for many people in my electorate of Canning. I have personally met with their staff on many occasions while trying to sort out a better arrangement for my constituents. I commend the staff of the Child Support Agency as they have an extremely difficult job to do. Perhaps they, along with the staff in the social security offices, have the most difficult jobs of all in the federal government sphere. I must add that I do not envy them as they are often placed in a total no-win situation where neither party involved is happy with the outcome proposed by the officers of the departments. Often I can solve a problem by merely making a telephone call to the Child Support Agency. But, more often than not, it is problems dealing with the act itself that create bitterness, confusion and unhappiness experienced by so many people. That means the problem cannot be solved without changes to legislation. One case that I am currently trying to assist with is typical of many other Child Support Agency cases. A gentleman came to see me recently who was at his wit's end and had absolutely nowhere else to tum. I feel for this gentleman. However, there is nothing that I or the Child Support Agency can do as his problems are tied down by legislation. This gentleman's first wife left him around six years ago, and both he and she have since remarried to other people. His ex-wife is about to have a baby to another man and he now has responsibility for his new wife and his wife's l7-year-old daughter, who is residing in his house and studying. This tangled mess might sound familiar to other members. The Child Support Agency advised him that his primary obligation is to maintain his children and that, while he has a legal obligation to maintain his new wife, that obligation exists only if she is unable to support herself. He has further been advised that he has no duty to maintain his stepdaughter, yet this advice has been given despite the fact that his stepdaughter has been refused Austudy on the grounds that she lives in a house with her stepfather, who is deemed to be earning too much. That is totally confusing. He and his new wife are struggling to keep their heads above water. Meanwhile, he is aware that his ex-wife and her new husband have had their house professionally painted throughout, had air conditioning fitted and have bought thousands of dollars worth of computer hardware. The computer is for the ex-wife who runs a bookkeeping business from home. He has just been told that her husband has taken a year off work due to stress. This gentleman outlined that when his children visit him under access rights they are forever saying how they have been to the movies, to Adventureworld, to Underwaterworld and on many other outings while he has the to continually disappoint them when they are with him. He simply cannot afford to take them to any of these places as his financial resources cannot stretch any further. He feels that his maintenance payments are subsidising the lifestyle of his ex-wife, her new husband and their baby. At the same time, he is struggling to provide for his new wife, his own home and health care. At the end of each week he is left with little, if any, money, pushing him even further into despair. Situations like this are a complete mess, no matter which way one looks at them. I am sure all members would have received correspondence from the Lone Fathers Association of Australia last week. At the National Convention on Family Law and Child Support, held earlier this month, a number of resolutions dealing with the child support scheme were discussed. One of the motions dealt with cases like the one I have just outlined. It said: The current child support formula should be amended so that in the calculation of child support the income of a new spouse (including de facto spouse) of a custodial parent be taken into account. I urge all members to read the letter and accompanying recommendations from the Lone Fathers Association, if they have not already done so. The resolutions are sensible, reasonable and fair. We should look closely at them and find some way of incorporating them into potential changes to the legislation governing the current child support scheme. There is no quick fix to the current system. Now that we are in government, the coalition has the opportunity, and indeed the responsibility and the obligation, to change the system for the better. In conclusion, I encourage all members to act on this matter with a certain degree of urgency. Child Care",71
161,Ms MACKLIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"At the time of the March 1996 federal election there were half a million children in Commonwealth supported child care and about 70,000 employees in this sector. Under Labor, there had been a 500 per cent increase in the number of Commonwealth funded long day care places made available to Australian families. Our objective had been to improve the affordability, quality and supply of childcare places in this country. This was very important because the reality of life in the 1980s and 1990s is that families increasingly include two breadwinners. In the main, for women to work, child care is essential. Commonwealth subsidised and Commonwealth regulated child care is essential in helping families to cope with the need and the desire to work. Commonwealth involvement in the provision of child care has also played an essential part in enabling women to gain access to the workplace on a more equal footing with men. By contrast we saw, in the Howard government's first budget, over $500 million taken from child care. In an attempt to conceal the severity of its attack on child care, these cuts have been applied in a number of different areas and, in my view, have been calculated to take effect over a staggered period of time to try and confuse parents about the impact of the cuts. The first of these cuts will take effect from 1 April. One of these is the reduction in child care assistance payments to a maximum of 50 hours a week. This is to be debated as a disallowable instrument in the Senate tomorrow. Labor will oppose this change in the Senate but I expect that it will go through. This is despite the repeated representations from a large number of child-care providers who have made their views very well known to the minister and to the government. The problem with the cap is that, to provide maximum flexibility to parents, most centres are open for, and charge for, 60 hours a week. Now the cost of the extra 10 hours will be added to family budgets. This will impact hard on all family budgets, but especially on those of lower income families. The minister has been provided with numerous examples of the impact of the cut but so far has refused to be moved. I would like to put a few of the examples of this cut on the record. The Woodridge child-care centre in Logan City, Queensland says that 22 families at the centre will have increases ranging from $14.40 to $31.30 per week. The Roma kindergarten and day care centre in Roma, Queensland will have fee increases in excess of $30 a week. The Alexandra Hills 'Busy Bee' child-care centre in Alexandra Hills, Queensland says that families receiving maximum assistance-in other words, those with the lowest incomes-will suffer the highest rises while families on higher incomes will experience smaller disadvantages. A woman working as a library clerk in Jagajaga, who actually resides in your electorate of Scullin, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, is a single parent working full time. Her childcare fees at the RMIT child-care centre have gone from $93.20 to $138 a fortnight. Her child is disabled and attends another centre for the rest of the time. As this is a community based centre, the fees are set to rise again in July, when operational subsidies cease. She also has to pay extra for family day care three times a month when she works at night. The Regency Road child-care centre in Adelaide gives the example of a sole parent working full time, with two children in care, who will have an extra $42.20 to pay. The centre makes the telling point that her fortnightly family tax initiative of $34.60 will not even cover one week of the increase in her child-care fees. The Sanctuary Farm centre in Penfield, South Australia, gives a similar example of a working sole parent with two children in care who will have to pay $41.70 per week more. Sanctuary Farm gives other examples of parents, one working in a shop and another a delivery driver, who cannot afford to stop working and so they take their children to work with them. This centre also makes the following point: The government promised Affordable, Quality Child Care for all, and not just affordable for the wealthy. This is an investment in the future of Australia, the early years of children are so importfalls ant, and they deserve the best whether parents work or not. These changes are going to hurt the average battler and that's NOT FAIR. These are only a sample of the many letters we have had that explain the effect of just of the government's cuts in child care from the last budget. One of the largest cuts was the removal of operational subsidies to community based long day care centres. These centres pioneered the provision of child care in many areas and the operational subsidy enabled them to provide care of a high quality. The government has provided a small amount of funding to these centres so that they can hire consultants to help them, as the government terms it, to restructure. Most of this advice could be summarised in the following way: reduce staff; make parents carry more of the costs, like bringing their own food and nappies; amalgamate; charge more; or close. All of these options involve a reduction in quality of service and usually an increase in cost. Still to make an impact-but this will come very soon-are the effects of the freeze on indexation of child care assistance payments, the abolition of the additional income allowed for dependent children when assessing eligibility for child care assistance, and the reduction of child care cut-offs for second and subsequent children. All of these changes will impact on families' capacity to afford child care from 1 April this year. It is also the case that the government proposes to make child care assistance payments direct to parents. We have available to us a survey by Roy Morgan Research for the Department of Social Security. The survey goes through all the reasons why parents oppose this change. Family day care providers, in particular, have major concerns with this scheme. The Kempsey family day care centre-I think you will see there are concerns all over Australia-said: This change will cause chaos for schemes and families using care. Yesterday's Sunday Age in Melbourne carried an article commenting on some of the effects of the cuts to child care. The report says: Child care centres have reported unprecedented in demand for hours of care, raising concerns about women being forced out of the workforce by Federal Government child care cuts. The article also mentions that: Both private and community-based centres have suggested families are either being forced to use informal child care, such as neighbours or relatives, or face reducing their work hours to avoid increasing child care costs. Now we have received copies of government documents that show that this government, in its 1997 budget, is proposing to cut another $400 million from child care. This is before childcare providers, or the families using child care, have had a chance to even absorb the cuts from the 1996 budget into their family budgets before they are confronted with cuts in this coming budget of a similar magnitude. We do not know where these cuts are going to fall, but we do know for sure that they are going to fall on families' budgets. What is very clear is that this government has no commitment to child care. It is a conservative government, in the truest sense of the word, because when they talk about family values they are talking about some sort of family that existed in the 1950s-a family that does not need two income earners. The government does not recognise that the vast majority of women these days want to work. The cuts to child care in the 1997 budget will not be the end of the matter. It is quite clear that this government's aim is to slice away at child care until there is nothing left. It is absolutely essential that all child careproviders, parents and other Australians wake up to this government's plans and make them stop before our system of family-friendly child care is lost completely.",73
162,Mr MCARTHUR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On 13 March in Melbourne, the Centre for Independent Studies hosted a tribute to the late Bert Kelly, former member for Wakefield in the Federal Parliament. Speakers on this occasion were Paul Kelly, international editor of the Australian, former Prime Minister, the honourable Gough Whitlam, the honourable David Kemp, protect Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Ray Evans, President of the H.R. Nicholls Society, John Hyde, former executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, and the meeting was chaired by the honourable Jim Carlton, former minister for health and the former member for Mackellar. Those speakers paid a tribute to the career and contribution of Bert Kelly for his lone stand against the protectionist day symbolised by the Country Party leader, Black Jack MCEwan. History records that Bert Kelly won his lonely and courageous struggle in a time when-as Australia's political are leaders have now come to recognise on a bithe partisan basis; that is, this side of the House and the Labor Party-protection, via tariffs and import quotas, was destructive, wasteful, and ultimately failed to provide security to the very industries it was supposed to assist. The present debate over the future protection for the automobile and textile, clothing and footwear industries has seen very legitimate argument about the timing speed of further reductions in tariffs. But one of the most unfortunate aspects of the present debate has been the re-emergence of protecIrrespective tionist thinking, the view that by protecting local industries through tariffs we can protect jobs, secure industries and enhance the nationsources al wealth. As Paul Kelly made the point at Bert Kelly's tribute, there is now a generation of politicians, journalists, opinion leaders policy makers, who have never heard of Alf Rattigan or Bert Kelly, and have no knowledge of Australia's long and sorry association with the protectionist experiment. The Australian Labor Party, in calling for a freeze on car tariffs at 15 per cent, claim they are not going back to the ,bad old days Tariffs of protection. Numerically, they are not-IS per cent is still a lot less than the effective rates of protection of over 100 per cent in the early 1980s. But in terms of the arguments they employ, their defence of a 15 per cent tariff is exactly the same as the arguments employed to defend the massive protection of the past. We hear the claim that a tariff freeze will jobs, that it will provide certainty, that it will lead to greater investment and that it will secure the future of the car industry. If all this were true and tariff protection really could achieve all these things, then by 1990, after 70 years of high tariff and quota protection, Australia would have had the best car industry in the world. Reducing Australia's high manufacturing tariffs was always in Australia's interest, even if it happened sentiment of the unilaterally. In the context of the present debate, there have been calls for Australia to halt tariff reduction on the grounds that other countries not reducing their levels of protection at same pace. The first point about this is that it is not entirely true. Average global tariffs have fallen from around 40 per cent in the 1940s to around 5 per cent today. Organieven sations like the GATT and the World Trade Organisation have ensured that tariffs have fallen, quotas are being phased out and trade levels of rules are made more transparent. The second point is that Australia has a always been a leader in forums like the and GATT and APEC because we realised, as a small exporting nation, there were benefits in reducing our levels of protection unilaterally. of what the rest of the world was doing, lowering protection made sense for Australia because protection diverted reaway from productive, wealth-creating industries towards less efficient sectors. The price of protection was borne by our wealthand creating exporters who paid more for their utes, harvesters, trucks and cars, as well as facing an over-priced exchange rate and inflated award wages set in the protected metal trades sector. The most heavily protected industries were shedding jobs the fastest and protection for selected sectors created the impression that the government was in the business of providing special favours to sectional interests. By lowering protection, the Hawke and Keating governments accepted the intellectual argument that tariffs were not in Australia's interests. In fact, high tariffs had damaged the very industries they were meant to protect. In 1997, we see a return to the protectionist line of argument, even if the rates of tariff are not as high as in the past. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who has sold out, has referred to further tariff reduction as 'unilateral disarmament'. Among the loudest adherents to this neo-protectionist sentiment has been former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. In his newspaper column in the Australian and a series of letters to the editor of the Financial Review, Mr Fraser has attacked the notion that Australia can reduce our levels of protection while other nations fail to reduce theirs. Mr Fraser's position is based on the mercantilist view of the world, a doctrine very much in favour in 17th century Great Britain before the time of Adam Smith. That view had it that the ideal trading position of any country was to export significant amounts and to import as little as possible. In doing so, a nation could store up enormous reserves of gold bullion which would make them, by definition, very rich. The flaw in the argument was that it failed to take account of the fact that trade is a twoway street-imports and exports go together. Mr Fraser fails to understand that fact. In one letter to the editor of the Financial Review, he asked whether supporters of free trade would still support low levels of protect10n in Australia, even if trade barriers overseas meant we could export nothing. Of course, if we could export nothing, we would have no ability to import. There would be no need for Mr Fraser's high tariff barriers then. Mr Fraser seems to think that it would be possible for Australia to export nothing yet import considerable amounts. Conversely, he believes it possible for Australia to export significantly but import nothing--an outcome he would presumably regard as a sound economic policy. That outcome would be neither feasible nor desirable. If we export nothing, we can import nothing, and vice versa. Since 1965, Australia has experienced massive growth in both imports and in exports. Moreover, during the period when Australia has lowered its trade barriers, the share of manufacturing production which has been exported has risen from 15 per cent in 1968 to 22 per cent in 1992, and continues to climb. So Australia has improved its standard of living by importing and exporting and improving both those sectors. It was Adam Smith who pointed out the mercantilist folly and championed the cause of specialisation and free trade. He said: It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to j make his own shoes but always buys them off the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither one nor the other ... What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better to buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. A family which made its own clothes, made its own food, built its own house, educated its own children and administered health care to its own members could not possibly enjoy the standard of living which most Australians enjoy simply by specialising in what they do best and buying goods and services from others. That fundamental truth has been overlooked by the Labor Party on the other side. Australia in 1997 has countless areas of expertise and comparative advantage. Our wool, wheat, gold, beef, iron ore, tourism, education, high-tech manufacturing and dairy and sugar industries are the world's most competitive. In the car industry, our sixcylinder upper medium cars, like Ford and Commodore, have maintained strong market share because of our relative expertise in this model-the market share of imports in the six-cylinder range is as low as 1.5 per cent. It would be sheer lunacy to believe that a small country like that of Australia, with a population of 18 million, could possibly be self-sufficient in the whole range of goods and services which Australians require and desire. In fact, most of our industries have massive large scale production and only small domestic markets. We are totally reliant on the export market and world trade to provide us with the income to finance our lifestyle. Those exports are significant and they continue to grow as world trade barriers fall. The suggestion that we are being swamped by low cost imports from low wage Asian nations is totally debunked by the fact that Australia runs substantial trade surpluses with virtually all our Asian trading partners like Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Taiwan. No country has more to gain from free trade than Australia, and we should be the last country on earth to believe that self-imposed trade barriers would be good for us. The Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) has done an admirable job, as the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran), who is at the table, would understand, in seeking market access for Australian exporters of wool into Mexico, beef and cars into Taiwan, wool into Korea, milk into Malaysia, sugar into Egypt, wheat into the Middle East, coal and wool into India, sugar into the US, legal services into China, beef and hides into Bulgaria and poultry into Hong Kong. Australia is a nation which relies on free trade its economic prosperity like no other nation on earth. To allow the new protectionist language to find its way into our trade policies would be sheer economic folly at a time when we can scarcely afford to hamper our productive performance. Ships of Shame  p.m.)-My grievance is the heartless treatment meted out recently to Honduran and Romanian crew members of the motor vessel Hunter by its owners, the Associated EuroAtlantic Shipping Corporation of London, and its managers, Polembros Maritime Co. Ltd, of Piraeus, Greece. Polembros Maritime Co. has a shabby record around the world for its harsh treatment of crews and its operation of aged vessels. The motor vessel Hunter is a classic case of a ship of shame, not so much as to the substandard condition of the vessel but rather as a case of the infamous mistreatment of crew. On 12 January 1997, the motor vessel Hunter arrived off Newcastle from China to load 70,000 tonnes of coal for Chile. After that arrival, the crew members made complaints to the International Transport Federation and to the Maritime Union of Australia about mistreatment and non-payment of wages. Polembros then initiated action against Port Waratah Coal Services, the International Transport Federation, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Newcastle Port Corporation when the ship was denied entry and denied access to the coal loader. The coal loader said, 'Fix your problems, whatever they are, and then we will give you a berth.' The Newcastle Port Corporation, as I understood it, recognised the decision of the coal loader. The ITF and the MUA, as they are properly entitled to do, were acting on behalf of the crew members. So the very first action initiated under section 45D of the new industrial legislation-I am shorthanding it-under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act and 45E, which has been reinstated therein by this government, was an action by a foreign for corporation out of London in respect of a ship that is really a ship of shame, a ship with a multiracial crew, a ship which is 20 years of age and a ship on which the crew were being denied proper payment and were not being accorded proper treatment. The action was by this foreign corporation against Australian unions, the Newcastle Port Corporation and the Port Waratah Coal Services in an attempt to stop the unions acting on behalf of the crew to gain their proper entitlements and to be treated properly under international conventions to which this government and this country subscribe. So, put very briefly, the first use of Australia's revised industrial legislation under this government was by a foreign corporation using it to seek to evade its international obligations in respect of sea safety and crew treatment to which obligations under international maritime conventions, international maritime regulations, this country subscribes and has been a very, very strong supporter. On 21 January at 1 a.m. one of the crew members, Rommel Salvadore Escalantedesperate because the union ashore had been refused permission to come out to the anchored ship and interview crew members about their grievances-went over the side of the ship. He took with him a life jacket, a lifebuoy and a small dinghy, and sought to reach shore. He did not reach shore. At 9.46 a.m. the following day, some 8% hours later, his disappearance was reported to shore authorities. At 10.15 a.m. he was sighted 2.5 nautical miles to the south of the ship suffering from hypothermia. As the rescuers said, another half hour and he would have been dead. Time does not permit me to go into all the detail I want to. It requires much longer to go through and detail everything that has happened in respect of this. This is an infamous case of a foreign corporation exploiting its crew members and using, as I have said, Australian law to seek to evade its international obligations in respect of crew treatment and ship safety. I called for an investigation to be made by the Panamanian government into the circumstances on board that vessel at that time which led to the crew member going over the side in that way, risking his life and almost losing his life in a desperate attempt to take information ashore on what was happening on board the ship. An investigation was carried out by the Panamanian government representative in Australia, Aubrey Wise. The investigation was a farce. He interviewed three people: Captain Georgios Kourtessis, the master; Captain Georgiadis Nikos, the chief officer or chief mate on board the Hunter; and Rommel Salvadore Escalante, the man who went over the side and who is of Honduran origin. I have the details in front of me. It is a onepage summary. That is the report-one page. Mr Wise did not ask any of the other crew members, even though they were readily available, about the conditions on board the vessel or about any of the circumstances. He gave to Escalante, the man concerned, an A4 sheet of paper with 17 questions set out upon it, leaving half a line or a line to fill in all of the circumstances. I have read that information, but I do not have time to read through all of it here. I will just give you the nature of it. In the summary, Mr Wise says: Rommel Salvadore Escalante floated around the ship until he was picked up by a Helicopter shortly before 1015 hours on the 21st. January 1997 and was taken to Newcastle HospitaL He was treated and allowed to leave. He also visited Bums Philp & Co. Ltd.'s doctor a few days later. What really happened was that he was picked up by the launch and rushed to hospital by the helicopter when he was brought ashore. As soon as he came out of hospital, he was arrested by Immigration officers as an illegal immigrant and taken to a police station. That was the ultimate farce in all of this. Fortunately, we were able to persuade Immigration-who were quite helpful-that this was not somebody trying to enter Australia illegally. He was somebody trying to have his grievances on board this hell ship addressed. We managed to fix it up. This report says he: . .. floated around the ship-The first page of the report says: At about 1015 hours on the 21st. January 1997 Harbour Control reported to the ship that the missing seaman had been picked up about 2.5 nautical miles away from the ship and was now safe ashore. Some floating around! He was 2Y2 nautical miles from the ship, almost dead and being carried south, and the report says he just 'floated around the ship'. I do not have time to go through the detail of that, as I have said, but the conditions on board that ship are an example of what we are going to see more of. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) will be reading what I am saying now. I am looking at the transcript of the minister's interview on PM on 12 March 1997. When the reporter asked him about this case, the minister said: It was fought in the courts, and of course the people on board the vessel won the day and got their back pay and got their work conditions improved as a result of it. They did not win the case. The case was settled out of court on undisclosed terms. The reporter said: - nly. really after somebody risked their life by Jumpmg overboard though. The minister said: Well certainly. I mean, dramatic action had to take place for it to be brought to the attention of authorities, there's no doubt of that. It would have better if that same person had made contact, as they could have, with the appropriate authorities and told them of their problems before they decided to jump into the water and try and swim for it. They had done that through the local authorities and the union, but the union had been denied permission to come on board and get further information to enable action to be taken in respect of it. Then the minister went on and said: The only action a union needs to take in these circumstances is not to go on strikeNobody went on strike. There was no industrial action. The minister said: The only action a union needs to take in these circumstances is not to go on strike but to inform the Australian Maritime Safety of their concerns and get the Australian Maritime Safety to take the appropriate action. You don't need a strike to solve these sorts of problems. As I said, there was no strike. The important point to make is that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority do not have the power to deal with circumstances like this. They have the power to inspect vessels. They have the power to detain vessels. They have the power to detain vessels - here crew accommodation is not up to the International standards required. But they do not have the power to act in respect of unpaid wages and denial of medical care. They do not have the power in those respects. So the minister is just plain wrong. I ask the minister to look at all the circumstances of this event and bear in mind that in this case, the issue should be taken up in the strongest possible terms with the Panamanian government with a view to ensuring that ships wearing the Panamanian flag adhere to the international obligations they have under international maritime conventions, and with a view to ensuring that the Panamanian government itself carries out its obligations by ensuring that ships registered under its flag meet the requirements and the obligations it is required to ensure they meet. So the Panamanian government has a responsibility, and the ship operators have a responsibility. (Time expired) Oceans Policy",75
163,Mrs GASH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"-I would been like to speak on the coalition government's ocean policy and the effects it will have on my electorate of Gilmore. The oceans, seas and coasts of this continent hold a special place in the hearts, history and future of all Australians, nowhere more than in the electorate of Gilmore. For too long, government activity concerning our oceans and coasts has been ad hoc and disjointed with the resulting wastage of resources and less than optimal outcomes. After one year in power the coalition will do what the ALP promised but could not do in 13 years. The promises of the previous government are perfectly illustrated by their announcement two years ago-at Kiama in my electorate--<>f a coastal care program with expenditure of $42 million. Did we ever see that? No. In contrast, this government has already spent in excess of $150,000 on coastal care programs in Gilmore, with bushland restoration at Jervis Bay, erosion control at Cudmirrah Beach, rehabilitation of the Bolong wetlands, regeneration of Rocklow Creek wetlands and bitou bush control at Lake Conjola, Narrawallee and Culburra. There have been no promises from this government; there has just been action. The government's oceans policy will give Australia an integrated and strategic platform for better management of our coasts and oceans and, in so doing, will give those in Gilmore greater reason to look towards a brighter future. It will provide us with a basis for identifying opportunities and promoting economic development of our marine resources and will give us the means to conserve the natural environment of our oceans and to develop the industries and communities that they support. The people of Gilmore are well aware of how important our coast and adjacent waters are for tourism and recreation. They are also well aware of how important tourism and recreation are to the future of Gilmore. Total direct expenditure by tourists for the year 1995-96 in the city of Shoalhaven-which contains some of our coastline-was $227 million, generating some 5,700 jobs. This was up from $157 million in 19&5-86, just 10 years previously. Tourism spending supports larger shopping centres, thereby giving residents a greater range of choice than would otherwise be possible. Tourists demand and are supplied with entertainment facilities which the local population could not support. Tourists fall in love with the area and settle there, thereby boosting the population. Tourists can also be industrialists who eventually set up businesses there, thereby creating new work opportunities. Tourists create a demand for primary products, thereby making farms more viable. The list goes on and on. So, if, through our oceans policy, we can maintain and even improve our most important tourist attractions-which are the seas and coastline-then we are certainly on the right track. I will give a brief overview of the Gilmore electorate and, as I do, the importance of the relationship between the coastline of the electorate and our future will become apparent. My considerable experience in the tourism industry permits me to comment on the incredible beauty of Gilmore's coastline. The Australian beach is one of the best known images overseas, and Gilmore has some of the most spectacular coastline in New South Wales-and, for that matter Australia. As the crow flies, we have 160 kilometres of coastfrom Kiama in the north, through the crown jewel that is Jervis Bay, down to sleepy Bawley Point and North Durras in the south. There are 109 beaches, many of which are deserted and many of which are surrounded by state forest, only accessible by four-wheel drive. Jervis Bay is-to my mind and that of many others-one of the greatest natural wonders of the nation. More and more, it is proving to be one of the greatest attractions on the New South Wales south coast. Beneath the surface of the water lies a veritable treasure trove of marine life, sustaining a fragile marine culture and providing incredible scuba diving. I recently had the pleasure of attending the launch on Jervis Bay of a new purpose-built scuba diving vessel. The vessel A valon was launched by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, and will take people scuba diving in Jervis Bay. This vessel represents another major investment in the tourism industry out of Huskisson on to Jervis Bay and is typical of the sort of investment that will take place in Gilmore as long as we can guarantee the quality and attraction of our oceans and coastline. In a delicate balance that makes up a very important ecosystem, Jervis Bay is flanked by a magnificent national park. Only if we maintain this delicate balance and protect our marine environment from pollution and pests will the full benefits from commercial development of our ocean resources be available. Eighty per cent of marine pollution comes from the land, and the oceans policy will canvass this major issue in an attempt to reduce pollutants and minimise the impact of uncoordinated coastal development. Providing we are successful in containing pollution, it is hoped that Jervis Bay will provide the basis for ocean medicine and food cultivation in future years-and even some emerging industry opportunities. The resource base of our oceans is vast. They have enormous potential for developing in ways that are only just emerging. The majority of anti-cancer drugs currently being tested are derived from marine organisms and Australia's marine biological diversity has the potential to add great value to the pharmaceutical industry. This government supports innovative and responsible industrial use of oceans, and the possibilities for Gilmore are limitless-as long as they can coexist with essential environment values. At the southern extremity of Gilmore is Ulladulla, which is the centre of its own subregion and also the centre of an important commercial fishing industry. With its oceans policy, the government recognises the importance of the commercial fishing industry and also the scale of recreational fishing: a large proportion of the population-including many people who live in or visit Gilmore-fish for pleasure every year. There are many pressures on our fish resources, and we must manage them carefully and meet our obligations to protect them. We must not fish out our stocks or irreparably damage their habitat. To meet the growing demand for fish, we must make better use of the fish we catch. To meet the growing demand from recreational fishermen, we must better manage our marine environment and preserve our magnificent coastline. The wildlife on the south coast of New South Wales is as much an attraction for tourists as it is elsewhere in Australia. ists and locals alike are often known to share a beach or a golf fairway with kangaroos, and visitation to Jervis Bay to see dolphins and penguins has increased markedly. Acknowledging the importance of our flora and fauna, the government has made a concentrated effort to protect one of the most beautiful birds in the world-the albatross. Many thousands of albatross are killed each year by fishing practices which can be modified. To protect them internationally, the government has nominated 11 species of albatross and has extended the requirements for tori poleswhich have been mandatory on domestic long-line fishing vessels-to cover foreign long-line fishing vessels as well. These tori poles reduce the incidental catch of albatross. These, in addition to regional conservation agreements, should reduce the threats faced by the albatross, saving them from becoming seriously endangered. One of the most important aspects of the Gilmore coastline is the lack of human development-and quite often a lack of humans themselves. This lack of development, in addition to the government's oceans policy, augurs well for the retention of our fragile ecosystem, thereby allowing the coastline to remain in its pristine state. If-through our own efforts and those of the government oceans policy-we can maintain the quality of our coastline, we are geographically positioned to take the greatest advantage of the major urban areas and the potential tourists that live there. At this stage, the only limiting factor to the growth and development of Gilmore is transport. If we have the product which is the attraction-that is the beaches and the coastline-it would be a terrible shame to continue to hinder the tourist's ability to visit them by not improving our infrastructure. It is imperative that our road system is capable of carrying tourists to and from destinations quickly. For Gilmore, that means the completion of Main Road 92 from Nowra to Canberra and the continued improvement of the Princes Highway south from Sydney. Currently, the coast is not easily accessible for the people of the ACT. At this stage, it is necessary to drive Tour- down the Clyde to Bateman's Bay or down the Kangaroo Valley Road, which takes in the vicinity of three hours. Those in the House who are familiar with these two roads know that Kangaroo Valley is notorious for its traffic hold-ups and is very dangerous indeed. With Main Road 92 we would see the ACT market of over 400,000 people located just lY2 hours from an area for which over the years they have already shown an affection. For everyone per cent increase in tourism visitation $3.36 million per annum is injected into the economy, creating 57 full-time jobs. The construction of Main Road 92 would allow the Kangaroo Valley Road to be reclassified as a tourist route. It would facilitate a major tourist loop including Sydney, the Southern Highlands, the ACT and the coasts and oceans of the Shoalhaven. In addition, Main Road 92 would allow the easy access required by HMAS Albatross to Canberra for embassy liaisons and to provide a strategic defence link. Most importantly, the construction of this road would provide quick, easy and safe access to all the coastal attractions that the Gilmore electorate naturally has. With Sydney only two hours north and Canberra two hours west it is up to us then to promote ourselves to get a fair share of the burgeoning tourist dollar. With 58 per cent of our tourists coming to the Shoalhaven from either Sydney or Canberra and 54 per cent coming for the beaches and waterways, it is easy to see the association between the oceans policy and these two most important roads. As I said previously, we in Gilmore are lucky to have a coastline that is almost untouched. However, this is not so for the coastline of Australia in general. Australia's coastline is one of the most dynamic parts of the landscape and is extremely fragile, yet it represents the most heavily populated portion of the continent, with most development centred on or within 100 kilometres of the coast. It therefore requires strict and ongoing management to ensure that the many conflicting demands placed upon it do not irrevocably interfere with the landscape, a challenge that is adequately met by this government's ocean policy, an ocean policy that covers transport and tourism, science and technology, and from resources and energy to fisheries and environmental management. It is of great importance to my electorate of Gilmore. Crime Syndicates",79
164,Mr CAMPBELL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This is a speech that I wish someone else would make but it is unlikely that they will. On 5 February this year I put out a press release which dealt with the Police Commissioner of New South Wales, Peter Ryan, who had made a statement saying that New South Wales had an ethnic crime problem. He was immediately confronted by politicians and told not to make statements like this. The truth quite clearly was being suppressed by the politicians for whatever reason. The commissioner has said that he has brought out a code of ethics for the behaviour of police. I think this is a very desirable element but Commissioner Ryan has to realise that allowing himself to be suppressed by politicians is probably not ethical for someone in his position. However, the situation gets a lot worse. In the Australian of 9 March Sergeant Craig made some statements. Sergeant Craig cannot be ignored. He is an FBI trained sergeant and an intelligence analyst with the Queensland Police Service. He warns that Australia will also experience a significant rise in money laundering, extortion and drug trafficking. He believes Chinese organised crime syndicates will fast become the biggest threat to law enforcement. I am sure that Sergeant Craig will also be suppressed and we are unlikely to hear any more from Sergeant Craig. He will simply be told not to make statements like this, no matter how true they are. He mentioned that the syndicates and the Fukien are organising crime throughout the world, not just in Australia. He said there is a big involvement in random kidnapping, heroin trafficking and smuggling of illegal immigrants through North America and western Europe. We have seen recently that it also occurs in Japan. I might say to this House that from time to time we get boat people impacting on my electorate. There is a great song and dance that goes up about this and I believe we should be taking much more care and having much closer surveillance of that coastline. It is unrealistic to think that we are any different from other countries. I assert that the great number of illegal immigrants are coming in through the eastern seaboard, principally through Sydney, and they are disappearing into Cabramatta. I have a Chinese friend Who tells me that the suggestion of 100,000 illegal immigrants is simply a joke; he says the situation is probably closer to 400,000. He said the government must know this and is simply powerless to act. I believe there is a lot of substance in what he is saying. When I get a chance I will be reading into the Hansard a letter he has recently written me. I think it is a letter which would interest all Australians. In organised crime sometimes the people who suffer most are the ethnic communities themselves. The small business people know they are being extorted by the organised crime of other ethnics. It is not Australians doing this; it is their own organised crime and we appear to be quite powerless to intervene. You see the sort of thing you are dealing with in political correctness gone crazy. I see in a local Victorian paper, the Yarra Leader, that Senior Detective Mark Davis, a squad member of the Asian squad, was saying how wrong it was to suggest that there was more crime in these ethnic communities than elsewhere. But there is more crime there; there is absolutely no doubt about that. I had one of my associates ring up the police to query this and was told, 'Look, you know the score; we are under a lot of pressure to make these sorts of statements.' I think the police, particularly those in Victoria and Queensland, have been warning for some time about this problem and they being ignored by the politicians. At the end of the day it is the politicians who must accept responsibility for the fact that nothing is done about this. Let me give you a little more political correctness. The Herald-Sun the 20th of this month talks about the Victorithese an police name change. It has been decided that Victorian police will now not describe the old method people who commit crimescrime.' they had I think up to 14 different categories. Now people will be described only as AboTriads riginal, Caucasian or other. Apparently, this was at the behest Arabic community, who objected to people being described as from the Middle East. They said it was unfortunate when they turned out not to be of Middle Eastern origin. I am sure it was. It does not seem to matter at that Anglo-Celtic Australia now goes under whole list of Caucasians. No matter what origin of the person committing the crime, will be indicated that it was an Anglo-Celtic Australian committing it when in fact that not the case. What is wrong with being able to define these people? If they want to put out a description, is it not better to put out an accurate description than a accurate description? There is some suggestion that they will just publish photographs. Of course they do publish photographs or identikits, and that going to tell the story. Why don't we simply say, 'Yes, you can be honest. You can dethe scribe these people with the description that best fits them'? I do not see any problem that. It is interesting to note that, in done by a newspaper, 95.3 per cent of people came out against this new political ness. The great overwhelming majority of the population felt it was unnecessary. I am concerned about this because, if nothing is done about it, it is going to reach a point where the community takes action on its own account. No-one will be able to blame the community; the fault will rest entirely with the politicians who are so politically correct and so afraid of facing up to these facts. It is quite clear that the Japanese are now being confronted with a large invasion of are illegal immigrants organised by organised crime. It is also quite clear that that is happening in Australia. Go back to the days when AI Grassby was the minister for immigration. The immigration department actually of said to Mr Grassby as minister, 'We have business migration applications here. We recommend you do not approve them as by we think they have association with organised AI Grassby approved everyone of them. I will warrant that that is how the got established in Australia. No-one can deny that they are established now. It is of the no good pussyfooting around. I have an article here which says that the Vietnamese community in Melbourne is concerned that overwhelmingly people convicted of drug offences in Victoria are Vietnaall mese. The Vietnamese community are cona cerned about this, and well they should be. the Most of them are law abiding citizens, but it they know that they are going to get caught up in this backlash. Something simply has to is be done about it, and it will not be done in the police the present system. I have said for a long time that drugs are a problem that could be fixed. They are not nonfixed simply because no-one will tackle the real problem-that is, the vast amount of money that is involved and the corruption that this ensures. We could do something about is drugs if we had the political will. The sensible thing would be to legalise and control drugs, to increase the penalty for supplying them outside the system and, therefore, in take away the profit margin. It could be a poll squeezed at both ends if you made them available at a price people could afford correctwithout robbing service stations. Let's face it: it might sound callous, but I do not particularly care if drug addicts kill themselves with drugs. That is their problem. The truth is that far more women in Australia die from analgesic overdoses than die from heroin overdoses. But who cares about that? Why don't we care? Because they do not go out and rob chemist shops and service stations; they die nice and quietly with kidney failure. If we were serious about this, we could make drugs available on prescription, which, I think, would be sanction enough. We could increase the penalties for supplying them outside; we could destroy the market. We do not catch the big drug dealers. They simply go away. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I had more time. I would give some horrific anecdotal stories, some of which are quite substantiated, in relation to the corruption involved in this trafficking. Guns: Safety Demonstrations Fosamax Banana Industry Dads Against Discrimination Cadet Units",82
165,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"At the outset, I would like to advise the parliament that, on Wednesday of this week, 26 March, in committee room 1R1 at 10.45 a.m. and 11.45 a.m., there will be safety demonstrations of a new gun safety product which has been developed in my electorate by James Griffiths and Michael Steel. They have developed the safe-tech firearm locking system, which provides a valuable enhanced system of gun control and safety for weapons through an electronic locking system operated by a PIN. I am delighted that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is in the chamber this afternoon because I am sure he will be personally very interested in the system. If the weapon is stolen, the thief cannot operate it because he has not got the PIN. I will not go through all of the valid points in favour of it, but, in terms of police safety, firearm, when activated, produces a signal which can be monitored by police radio receivers. Police in the vicinity can deactivate that weapon by a remote switcher in their possession. I encourage all members, senators and people who work in the parliament to visit committee room IRIon Wednesday at either 10.45 a.m. or 11.45 a.m. to witness this very interesting development by small business. It is fitting that today the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) launched the government's response to small business. Here is a prime example of Australian initiative and ingenuity tackling a problem. I would also like to talk about a drug called Fosamax, which is alendronate sodium. Fosamax 40-milligram tablets were listed as a pharmaceutical benefit on 1 November 1996 for the treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease of the bone. I must say I am delighted to hear that because I am probably going to end up with it because both my mother and her brother had it. The likelihood is that I might get it too. I am not talking about Paget's disease, because it has already been listed. Fosamax lO-milligram tablets were listed on 1 February this year for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients with fracture due to minimal trauma. That is excellent; that is great. But what we have is a degree of discrimination against men. Most Australians do not realise that males-not a great many but a significant number-can also suffer from osteoporosis. The situation is that they are not allowed to get it under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If you are a women, yes, you can get it. If you are a man, you cannot. I want to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to become interested in the process. Of course, it is up to Merck, Sharp and Dohme, the manufacturers, to provide more information to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, which, in tum, provides advice to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. I have a male constituent living in Nambucca Heads who has three vertebral compresthe sion fractures. Of course, he is not postmenopausal but he needs this drug and he cannot get it. He can get it by paying $100 a month for 30 Fosamax tablets. I would urge the minister, the manufacturer, the Drug Evaluation Committee and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to do what they can jointly to ensure that this very valuable drug is available to males who also suffer from osteoporosis. Cyclone Justin has today been upgraded once more, and I just wanted to mention the effect on the banana industry. The Queensland industry will suffer a 60 per cent loss from now until May and a 30 per cent loss in the six months following. It is likely that prices will rise. I would anticipate that we might get pressure from the major retail chains, Woolworths and Coles, to try to allow some imports in. I would say to Woolworths and Coles that it is strange that when banana prices to growers fall, it is very rare that banana prices fall in the supermarkets. I would like to suggest that in these coming few months, when banana prices will rise, the supermarkets might restrain themselves and not raise the prices. The major concern is that if there is pressure from the retailers to try to import bananas, which would come from Ecuador in South America, this would provide a very substantial risk for the whole of the Australian banana industry. Two absolutely devastating diseases, moko and black sigatoka, are endemic in Ecuador. We have had several attempts to have bananas imported. There is danger in relaxing our quarantine and importing bananas from Ecuador or any other place where there is disease. We also have black sigatoka coming from New Guinea into the Torres Strait; we have to very careful there as well. And remember the papaya fruit fly and the cost that that has had to the fruit growing industry, to the government and to the people of Australia, the taxpayers. I wanted to make the point that quarantine has to remain vigilant, and that we as a government must ensure that disease is not imported to destroy the banana industry, which is of such significance to New South Wales and Queensland and which is of growing significance to Carnarvon in Western Australia. Another issue I wish to speak about in this grievance debate is an organisation called DADS: Dads Against Discrimination. It started about 6Y2 years ago and is a result of the difficulties experienced following family law court settlements. Every member of this place would have many constituents coming to them and complaining bitterly about the impact. I must say that DADS is not all male. It has about a 10 per cent female membership. In other words, these are non-custodial parents. While it is impossible to generalise-there are two sides to every story; there is no doubt about that-they believe that there is a lack of equity for non-custodial parents both in child support and family law. They also make the point that the rights of the child are very important. One of those significant rights is to have an ongoing relationship with both parents. This often becomes very difficult because the custodial parent frequently decides to move far away and the non-custodial parent has almost no contact, except at great expense. They also make the point that, when considering child support, all the income of both parents, including family allowances, should be potentially assessable for child support payments. Whether that is a correct argument or not, I believe it is worth consideration. The final point I want to make is about the service cadet units of this country-the army, the navy and the air training corps. In my electorate there are, in Coffs Harbour, three excellent cadet corps with the army, TS Vendetta and the air force and in South West Rocks there is TS CuI goa. This is a very simple problem which could be solved very easily; it is an off-shoot of the gun legislation. We have these cadet units which train-and many of them go on into the armed services-and which, in my area, provide catafalque parties for ANZAC Day, for Remembrance Day and a whole range of other things. If I have time, I might even mention some more of them. I can see no reason why the service rifleseven if we went back to 303s-that were totally incapable of being fired could not be provided so that they could continue to do their drill, because it is an integral part of the community. Particularly in my electorate, all these cadet units make a major impact. They have the support of the Sawtell subsection of the Naval Association of Australia. They have the support of the whole community. All we need is for inoperative riflesincapable of being fired-to be made available to the cadet units so they can provide this community service and so they can provide catafalque parties for ANZAC Day and be a valuable part of our community. I would like to appeal to the parliament, through the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), to see whether we might be able to take some action on this so that the cadet units can still duct their ceremonial drill, which is of great value to all of the community.",84

171,Mr MCGAURAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It has been brought to my attention that there was an article in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph of 23 March at page 19, entitled 'Reactor poses serious danger'. In the course of that article, Dr Michael Selley is quoted as saying, ' Mr MCGauran had told him in June last year that Holsworthy was to be the site for the new airport and that Badgerys Creek was dead.' That is false. I have always known that the government is committed to building a second major airport for Sydney with Badgerys Creek remaining the preferred site. Whatever site is eventually selected, processes are in place the EIS team will carefully consider all the issues pertinent to the siting of an airport. NA Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee Report",86
172,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I present the committee's report entitled Environmental management of Commonwealth land: a review of audit report No. 31 1995-96-environmental management of Commonwealth land: site contamination and pollution prevention together with the minutes of proceedings and con- evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",86
173,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. This report reviews the Auditor-General's report No. 31 of 1995-96 into the environmental management of Commonwealth land. The Auditor-General's report was referred to the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on 27 June 1996 after being tabled on 24 June 1996. The audit examined the environmental management mechanisms of major Commonwealth land managers, including the departments of Defence, Administrative Services, Transport and Regional Development, and Communications and the Arts. The Auditor-General reported estimates of the number of contaminated sites in Australia ranged from 10,000 to 60,000, including unexploded ordnance in military training areas and hazardous substances. With land valued at $7.75 billion it is clearly important that the Commonwealth place sufficient priority on addressing potential health, environmental and financial risks associated with contamination. The audit report made 18 recommendations and overall the committee was pleased with the response of the land managing agencies to the recommendations. However, there were a couple of issues that the committee found needed further consideration. The major recommendation by the Auditor-General called for coordinated and clear Commonand wealth policy on contaminated land which could guide land managing entities when dealing with environmental matters such as pollution prevention and site contamination. The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency initially agreed to the recommendation of the ANAO that it should take responsibility for developing a Commonwealth policy, but its successor-the Environment Protection Group in what is now known as Environment Australia-responded that it would not undertake the task due to changes to its priorities following budget reallocation. The ANAO regarded the development of such a policy as an important first step in improving the environmental management of Commonwealth land. The committee was disappointed that the policy could not be finalised, particularly since the ANAO found that much of the work had already been completed. The committee believes that there is a requirement for an overarching national policy and recommends that the government reassess the priorities and resources of Environment Australia to develop a Commonwealth policy on the environmental management of Commonwealth land including site contamination, pollution protection and appropriate levels of public disclosure. An associated issue is that of Commonwealth-state cooperation and coordination in the environmental management of Commonwealth land. Commonwealth entities are generally not bound by state environmental legislation, although the departments examined by the audit office maintained that they observed the intent of state and territory legislation. During the inquiry, the states and territories not unexpectedly asserted that the Commonwealth should abide by their laws on the management of contaminated land. The committee did not make a recommendation on this vital issue because the Intergovernmental Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development is currently working on the resolution of problems caused by the lack of harmonisation in environmental legislation. The committee consequently recommends that the government examine the issue of a Commonwealth policy once it is known what the Commonwealth will have to do to implement the outcomes of the intergovernmental committee. Another issue of concern to the committee was the lack of resources to assess and manage sites with unexploded ordnance contamination. At the time of the audit there were 403 possible UXO contaminated sites in Queensland alone but only one person allocated in that state to assess UXO contamination. This is not adequate or responsible and the ANAO claimed that at current resource levels it will take more than 20 years to complete reports on all currently known UXO sites in Queensland. Of course, other states also have UXO contaminated sites. In fact there are over 1,000 sites in Australia. The committee recommended that the Department of Defence develop a program to identify and assess UXO contamination and allocate more resources in each state to carry out these arrangements. As a major land owner, the Commonwealth should pursue best practice in the environmental management of its land, not only to provide a safe and healthy environment but to avoid any future liabilities. This report has provided a useful assessment of the Commonwealth's management of these areas and I would like to thank the committee secretariat and committee members for their role in completing the report: Ian Dundas, Susan Hnatiuk, Helen Collins and particularly Susan Cardell, who is in the chamber and who undertook a lot of the work associated with this report. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",86
174,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"Prospect) (5.51 p.m.}--I too would like to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and, by doing so, supplement some of the remarks made by the chairman, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). This is the first time the opportunity has been provided to me to speak on a committee report in this chamber, and I would firstly like to congratulate the staff. They are a very coordinated and hard working staff, and I congratulate Susan on the report. Many members of parliament may be a little misguided when they see the report that has now been tabled, but it is only small in content. I suggest you all read it because there is a lot to say in that report. As the chairman has indicated, the ANAO report that originally began the investigation took from something like September until January-about five months-to do and then the House of Representatives passed it on to our committee. I found the report very interesting, particularly where the audit stated in the summary of its document, 'Commonwealth entities can make significant cost effective improvements in their environmental performances.' It also stated that there is 'no specific legislation that the Commonwealth has on formal policy to guide Commonwealth land management entities'. Of course, that is really the crux of the problem. The Commonwealth authorities have no overall policy for judging how they will or will not treat their contaminated sites. It became very clear, as the chairman has indicated, in the evidence supplied to us by both local governments and state governments that that is a prime concern across Australia. When we questioned some of those from the Commonwealth area, whether from Defence or wherever, about this, some said, 'We are working on it.' I found in the report that even DAS said they have commenced to develop a database on the contaminated sites. Every department we either questioned or spoke to was about to, was commencing, had it under consideration or yes, was in the process of doing that. I think it is really a bit risky from the Commonwealth level to say, 'Yes, we are going to look at that in the future,' particularly as the state governments all have in place, whether it is what we would desire to put in practice from the Commonwealth level or not, state planning legislation and environmental protection legislation. As we know, the Commonwealth under section 52 of our constitution is not necessarily guided by what the states tell it to do or not do. That is another problem that we found during the investigation. I think it is necessary that all Commonwealth departments, including GBEs, should be guided by the Commonwealth legislation that is put together, whether by Environment Australia or whoever else the Commonwealth decides will implement the policy. People will tell you through the departments that there are a number of investigations going on at moment. What worries me is that most of those guidelines that are in place are not strictly guidelines; they are just guidelines for organisations to follow. That is a bit of a worry. The chairman has indicated in the report the number of estimated contaminated sites. If we were talking about this 50 years, I would say, 'Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of us.' The trouble is that we have been talking about it for over 50 years and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. That is my primary concern. We have to do at the Commonwealth level a lot more than just talk about it. Departments have to acknowledge their responsibilities and, in acknowledging their responsibilities, have also got to be aware that policies and standards need to be implemented which it is an obligation for all departments to follow. In terms of the UXOs, which has also been referred to by the chairman, I thought we put very polite language into the report, particularly when we assessed very politely those particular contaminated sites and the one officer, who, the army said, is a major and who has been allocated full time to assess those sites. The audit office claimed in their report that at those current levels it would take more than 20 years to complete reports on the currently known UXO sites in Queensland. If people would like to read about this, I refer them to point 2.65 on page 22 of the report. As indicated, the Local Government Association of Queensland was very concerned about this, but so were the Victorian, New South Wales and Northern Territory governments. Defence is saying that they are providing adequate information, and they keep on saying that. If you remember, the audit office did a report on this in 1986. It has been shown 10 years later, when this report was commenced and completed, that the Department of Defence has only actually assessed something like two sites so far as unexploded ordnance is concerned. I think we should be very aware of that and we should continue to put pressure on the department to comply. I was very interested that we could not go on further into some of the areas we would like to regarding mechanisms and environmental systems, because we have been told that a report is going to come down on that. I wait with bated breath for that report. (Time expired)",87
175,Mr BILLS ON,COMMITTEES,"May I start by congratulating and thanking the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), and my colleagues on the committee for the work that has gone into this report and also the diligent work carried out by the committee secretariat, including the committee secretary, Ian Dundas, administrative officer, Helen Collins, and-as was mentioned earlier-Ms Susan Cardell, who is with us today. This was her first report as lead research officer. Our congratulations should go to Ms Cardell. The inquiry arose out of the Auditor General's report No. 31 of 1996 entitled Environmental Management of Commonwealth Land: Site Contamination and Pollution Prevention, which was tabled in this place on 24 June. The issues that arose out of it largely come as a result of the committee inquiring into how to improve the environmental management of Commonwealth land and at least bringing the Commonwealth more into line with international best practice in terms of land management. I would like to compliment the government departments and the government business enterprises on their willingness to participate in the inquiry. I will talk about some of their contributions later. There was a criticism levelled at the ANAO by the Department of Defence for some of the photographic material included in the report. In effect, the facts were that those photographic items were provided by Defence's own internal audit function and perhaps it shows the considerable opportunity for improved coordination within Defence. They are obviously identifying problem areas and reporting on them, but not always acting upon them. I guess that is something that leads me to comment on the submissions we received from a number of departments. We heard a range of adjectives and 'actionspeak', if I could put it that way, that show that departments and government business enterprises are aware of their responsibilities and the need for action. But not all of them were signalling a very genuine commitment to those responsibilities. There are some opportunities there to more formally record those responsibilities through corporate plans and annual reports. I believe that employees and management do take their lead from what the organisation is seen to value through those strategic planning documents and report mechanisms and that more should be done to tangibly express the importance of environmental management of Commonwealth land in those plans so that they flow through into the operational plans of the organisations and so that genuine responsibility is assigned to senior people within those organisations and that their performance is evaluated on whether they are actually achieving things in those areas. I believe there should be some explicit statements included about environmental and land management responsibilities in the ministerial oversight arrangements for government business enterprises. The genesis of that would be through the Commonwealth policy that the report advocates as recommendation 1. Environment Australia should take the lead in developing such a whole of government framework policy, given its expertise and experience. Environment Australia has shown an ability to be a full contributor when it comes to the land management regimes that it insists upon the private sector and others introducing where Commonwealth land is perhaps threatened or there is a Commonwealth interest, perhaps through world heritage listing or the like. Clearly they have got some talent in that area, and I would be a strong advocate for them applying it in this respect so that we look after our own house as well as we require those around us to look after theirs. This previous work and learnings is a very good starting position and in fact they have already made some progress, as the committee chairman has mentioned. That work can be quite easily built upon. Environment Australia is well positioned to be informed of what best practice in land management is and then to apply that information to the Commonwealth in managing its own land. I do not believe it is too much of an onerous task, given that progress has already been made and that data and information is available. As a result, I think Environment Australia should be readily able to incorporate that and act upon that committee recommendation. That policy may well include the applicability of state and local government laws to the Commonwealth and its business enterprises. The evidence provided to the committee suggests that Commonwealth departments and GBEs are fairly relaxed and happy about meeting the ordinary land use planning requirements that others need to comply with. Therefore, I would say: why not make that a requirement and then have the Commonwealth argue its case as to why it should be exempted from those requirements from time to time? There is an important part of recommendation No. 1 that relates to the disclosure of information to the public. The theme seems to be buyer beware--caveat emptor. That is fine, but if you are not aware that your area was a testing ground for our allies during the Second World War, it is pretty difficult to know to look for unexploded ordnance. I commend the report to the House.",89

179,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the following reports entitled The Oakey Agreement: Australia and Singapore-6th report and Australia's withdrawal from UN/DO and Treaties tabled on 11 February 1997-7th report, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the reports be printed.",90
180,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"The two committee reports, Nos. 6 and 7, which I have presented today have both domestic and international importance. Report No. 6 deals with the agreement between Australia and Singapore to locate a helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey in Queensland. We recommend early ratification of this agreement. Report No. 7 is an omnibus report that examined a number of matters, the most significant being Australia's withdrawal from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation-UNIDO-and a double-taxation agreement with Vietnam. The Oakey agreement covers the location of a Singaporean helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre to conduct helicopter flying training activities, supported by approximately 250 Republic of Singapore Air Force personnel and their dependants, and will include the establishment of purpose built on-base facilities at a cost to Singapore of approximately $30 million. Australia regards Singapore as an important regional partner, maintaining a strong bilateral relationship that draws on long standing shared strategic interests. This relationship also conveys vital strategic, commercial and political benefits. Australia's interest in the security of Singapore and the region as a whole is formally reflected in our membership of the five-power defence arrangement. Furthermore, Singapore's defence forces have already made a substantial investment in the construction of facilities at RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia and have made a significant commitment to the conduct of training at the Shoal water Bay training area near RockhampReport ton in Queensland. There is widespread support for this agreement amongst the local communities of Toowoomba and Oakey. Both local councils believe that the presence of the Singaporeans will provide significant economic benefits to the local communities. In addition to the $30 million capital investment, ongoing annual maintenance requirements will be in the vicinity of $5 million per year. The Department of Defence also estimates that a further $9 million per annum will be injected into the local economy through the expenditure of Singaporean salaries in the Oakey-Toowoomba area. While local organisations voiced their support for the agreement, the committee was concerned that the provision and coordination of essential services to the Singaporeans, such as housing, health and education, lacked a central focus. We have therefore recommended that a coordinating group, established by the Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet, facilitate the provision of a single housing coordinating agency and that a plan be developed outlining the provision of essential services. Evidence presented to the committee by three individuals opposed the agreement. We noted, however, that this opposition came from outside the Toowoomba-Oakey region and issues raised included concerns over religious allegiance and the stationing and training of foreign troops in Australia. The committee rejects completely any suggestion that the Singaporeans would not be welcome on the basis of race or religious affiliations. We concluded that the evidence presented by the local communities supporting the agreement and the benefits in general to Australia far outweighed these objections. The first issue dealt with in report No. 7 was Australia's withdrawal from UNIDO, initiated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in December 1996. Binding treaty action was taken by the minister in this case before a full 15 sitting days had elapsed for parliamentary review of the proposal. We note that, given the time constraints, it was not possible to consult fully with all interested organisations and firms before the decision was made. However, in the report we stressed that consultation ought to have been undertaken before the decision was announced. The committee also acknowledged the significant reforms that have taken place within UNIDO, particularly in the areas of management processes and the reduction of administrative overheads. However, apart from a relatively small number of firms benefiting from our membership of UNIDO, there would be very few other tangible procurement benefits from membership. The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) opposite will present a dissenting view on this issue shortly. In the limited time remaining I would like to comment briefly on the double-taxation agreement with Vietnam. While the committee supports early ratification of this agreement, I wish to stress that we were concerned over a number of issues. In particular, we were concerned that the consultation between the Australian Taxation Office and professional accounting bodies and the quality of the national interest analysis that accompanied the agreement were less than satisfactory. We were particularly concerned that the NIA not only omitted necessary information but it was also unduly complex and difficult to understand. We made some other comments about banking, insurance, accounting, auditing and commercial services. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) will expand on this and other matters shortly. I commend these reports to the House.",90
181,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"I wish to support the agreement to be signed with Singapore to locate a helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey in Queensland, as covered in report No.6 from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Because Singapore is a small place, there is very little flying area to allow any training activities to take place, particularly those with helicopters. The agreement gives Singapore an opportunity to get into the training in a much broader way. There will be about 250 air force personnel and their dependants. It will mean the establishment of a purpose built facility alongside the Oakey base. It will cost the Singaporeans about $A30 million and will be a great plus for the local economy. Singapore is an important partner and has strong historical strategic, commercial and political links to Australia. Australia has a strong interest in the security of Singapore because of its position in the region as a whole. This is reflected in our membership of the five-power defence arrangements. Singapore has already made a contribution in Australia with its substantial investment in the construction of facilities at the RAAF base at Pearce in Western Australia and also at the Shoal water Bay training area in Rockhampton in Queensland. I visited the site during the public hearing to hear first-hand what people in the local region thought about the base. The hearing showed very strong support from the local community, who believe that the investment would be extremely beneficial to their local economy. Local government, in particular, saw that it would be an important addition to help the growth of the region around Oakey, as well as Toowoomba. Apart from the $30 million capital investment, there will be an estimated $5 million a year in maintenance and an estimated $9 million a year will come to the people from being spent in the region. There is strong support for this additional input into the local economy. One or two concerns were raised about the provision and coordination of essential services for the Singaporeans, such as housing, health and education. The committ-e has recommended that the Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet set up a coordinating committee to overcome problems that may come into being. There were three representatives against the proposal, but they appeared to come from outside the local region. They raised a number of issues, including what religion the Singaporeans may be and a concern about stationing and training foreign troops in Australia. This may have been a result of certain murmurings in the community that have been fanned by certain Independent politicians in this place. However, the committee rejected completely any suggestions that the Singaporeans would be unwelcome within Australia because of race or religious affiliations. The dissenting report in report No. 7 was brought down by the Labor members of the standing committee and the Democrat senator. We believe that the government acted hastily in relation to abandoning the $2.7 million to the UN. The government had set up the Simons review and has not even waited for that to come down before pulling this money out of the budget to this UN development authority. I must add that Australian companies were doing very well out of being able to do very good work overseas, which was adding much to the Australian economy as well. It was very a immature way of doing it. We also had good evidence that any concerns that people had about this agency, as far as being bureaucratic in process, were certainly overcome in recent years. (Time expired)",91
182,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEES,"-These reports tabled today demonstrate something of the diversity of the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This one package includes an agreement between Australia and Singapore in relation to training helicopter pilots, Australia's withdrawal from UNIDO, a double-tax agreement with Vietnam and a mutual legal assistance agreement with Hong Kong. The variety of this work encourages my great admiration for the chair and the committee secretariat for their versatility in dealing with the wide range of treaty agreements that Australia is engaged in. I would particularly like to compliment Peter Stephens and the secretariat and Lieutenant Colonel Craig Evans, who is the first Chief of Army fellow to be seconded to the parliament and who worked on the Oakey agreement regarding training of helicopter pilots from Singapore. This committee was established because of community concerns about lack of consultation with the parliament and with the community at large before Australia undertook international treaty agreements. The committee has therefore filled a very useful role in that regard. The very fact that dissidents were able to appear on the Oakey agreement and present their views makes the processes of the committee worthwhile. But there is still evidence to suggest that some Commonwealth government departments have failed to adequately undertake consultation with communities before making recommendations that we should be engaged in treaties. An example was the Australian-Vietnam tax agreement, which was considered by the committee on this occasion. There had seemingly been no discussion with the professional bodies in Australia who could have provided expert advice. This was a very complex issue, and it was only when the committee drew attention to the fact that there had been this lack of consultation that there was able to be a resolution of some of the issues of concern. The consultation should not be left to the time when the Treaties Committee makes these reviews. It should be a part of the whole development process of drawing up a treaty and coming to a conclusion about whether it is in Australia's interest. I note that there was a minority report in relation to the UNIDO document. It needs to be said that the majority supporters are not claiming that UNIDO is without merit, but the majority of the committee was not persuaded that the government's action in withdrawing from UNIDO was not a reasonable decision in view of the need to prioritise scarce resources. At some stage in the future the matter could be reviewed, but the committee felt that the government's actions in this regard were reasonable. In relation to the Oakey agreement, there was obviously consultation with the local councils. But, again, I think not enough has been done in dealing with some of the day-today arrangements associated with housing this significant group of Singaporeans who will be living in Australia on a rotational basiscoming to and fro and staying here for a short period. Issues such as health seem to have been addressed and schooling in a general sense. But there will be no contribution by the Singaporeans towards the cost of education of their children in Australia and I think that is an issue that should be addressed in the future. In addition, the arrival of these large numbers of people will add to the infrastructure needs, particularly of the 10ndaryan Shire Council and Toowoomba City. There have never been any significant infrastructure contributions by the Australian defence forces in acknowledgment of the presence of the Oakey base. Whilst the Oakey community warmly appreciates having the base in their community, it does place a cost burden on the ratepayers. Other industries that become established in a community are expected to make infrastructure contributions. I think the Commonwealth should regard itself as having an obligation in that regard. For instance, 10ndaryan shire is apparently no longer going to be able to have a power station constructed in significant parts of the shire because of the risk that the flight paths associated with the Oakey base could be affected by power station stacks. There is a potential loss of industry and I think that the 10ndaryan shire is entitled to expect some degree of compensation for that loss. Nonetheless, the community at large is obviously welcoming the arrival of the Singaporeans. I think this agreement is an example of excellent cooperation between us and one of our fellow Commonwealth members and can greatly improve relations between our countries. (Time expired)",92

Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Paper",93
185,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs I present the following paper, Constitutional change, subtitled; Select sources on constitutional change in Australia 1901-1997. In recent times there has been an increased interest in constitutional matters, particularly with the approach of the people's convention which is scheduled to be held later this year. As we approach the centenary of Federation, each month and year represent a centennial anniversary of one or other significant constitutionallandmarks in our history. At present, it is just 100 years since the inaugural meeting of the 1897-98 Australasian Federal Convention. The object of that convention was to draft the constitution bill to be put to the people at a referendum and then to be presented to the British Parliament for passage as imperial legislation. The Adelaide session of the Australasian Federal Convention met from 22 March to 23 April in 1897. The convention later met in Sydney and in Melbourne. The people's convention to be held this year will be the first large scale popular convention since the 1896 Bathurst People's Federal Convention. While the centenaries of these events to heighten our sense of history and our pride in the achievements of the past 100 years, should not imagine that the constitution itself has been left in peace for the duration. From the time the Commonwealth parliament first met the machinery provisions relating to the establishment of the federation were already outdated. Much work has gone into analysing and reconsidering the work of the founding fathers. The committee believes that this is relevant to preparations for further constitupolitical tional review. Accordingly, it has compiled a collection of these sources on constitutional change. This document originated as a private committee document. We sought to undertake vention. an inquiry on a constitutional matter, but at the same time wanted to avoid duplicating the work of others. Accordingly, we analysed over 300 recommendations made by the reviews of the constitution over the past years. In particular, we analysed the recomoriginal mendations of the 1959 report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Review which met in various capital cities, the reports of the Australian Constitutional Convention which met in various capital cities between 1973 and 1985, and the report of the the House. Constitutional Commission which met between 1985 and 1988. In order to make sense of the large of recommendations, we inserted them into the constitution itself, thereby creating an annotated constitution, with reference to each of these major reviews. The committee then concluded that the resulting document would be of some value to others with an interest in the Australian constitution. The decision was taken to publish the document and to add value to it by including a history of referenda conducted over the life of the federation. Referenda are a practical result of recommendations for constitutional reform. Forty-two separate proposals have been put to the people on 18 occasions since 1901. Only eight of the 42 proposals have received sufficient support to satisfy the requirements of section 128 of the constitution. We believe that part 2, therefore, of this document, which summarises the arguments serve and outcomes relevant to each referendum since 1901, is one of the most comprehensive we collections of information on the history of referenda in Australia. The document was then further enhanced by adding a bibliogra.phy on constitutional change. For this we are indebted to the Parliamentary Library staff who played a major part in compiling it. The committee hopes that this collection of sources will be useful to the public in general work and to students of constitutional law and science in secondary schools and universities in particular. It should also be of interest to those who wish to contribute to the 1997 people's convention and to those who want to follow the proceedings of that conI wish to thank the members of the committee for their support for this project, particularly the father of the House, the right honmajor ourable member for New England (Mr 40 Sinclair), whose idea it was to add to the document and to put it into the public arena. The committee's thanks also go to members of the secretariat, particularly to the secretary, Judy Middlebrook, and to Claressa Surtees, Natalie James, Kathryn Cole and Laura Gillies. I commend this document to",93
186,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"As deputy chair of the Standing number Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am pleased to be able to support the remarks of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). This document, Select sources on Constitutional change in Australia 19011997, sounds a bit dry, but it is not. For anyone interested in constitutional history or interested in changing our constitution, it is a very valuable work and will certainly repay reading. It is in three parts. The first is the annotated constitution, which includes an excellent detailed history of the consideration of constitutional change by official bodies. For example, in the preamble the constitution says: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: The 1988 Constitutional Commission recommended that the enacting clause be repealed because it could give the reader the impression that Australia is still subject to the will of the legislature of the United Kingdom. The report has further references for people who are interested in further pursuing issues like that. Secondly, it has a history of referendums. I particularly want to commend this part of the document to the Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, who is threatening to replace Senator Mal Colston, if he were to resign, with an Independent. Premier Borbidge needs to read the history of referendums and, in particular, note the new section 15, which was inserted into the constitution on 21 May 1977 and which, in fact, was passed by over 73 per cent of the electorate who voted for that proposition concerning changes to Senate casual vacancies. That particular provision states that where a senator resigns: ... at the time he was so chosen, he was publicly recognised by a particular political party as being an endorsed candidate of that party and publicly represented himself to be such a candidate, a personhas to be a member of that party. So in endorsing the yes case, those 73-odd per cent of the electorate said 'It is the fundamental right of voters that the Senate should reflect the wishes of the electorate.' This section was inserted precisely to prevent skulduggery of the kind engaged in by Premier Borbidge' s predecessor, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I experienced a certain amount of nostalgia reading this because one of the provisions relates to the referendum to outlaw the Communist Party. Some 20 years ago at Melbourne University, I did my honours thesis on this referendum. It was in excess of 10,000 words. Most readers will find that the 1V2 pages in this document will suffice, rather than needing to read the whole of the 10,000 words. The third part of the document is a first class bibliography setting out the many places where a student or anyone interested in the constitution can derive further information. This document will be most useful in debate concerning constitutional change, which is gathering momentum as we near the end of the century and celebrate the centenary of Federation. Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition regards the issue of Australia obtaining its own head of state and becoming a republic as the most pressing issue, but there are, of course, others. We believe that there ought to be a vote-not a referendum which would actually generate a republic itself, but a vote of the Australian people to tell both the government and the opposition the direction in which they want our energies directed so far as the constitution is concerned. Like the chair of the committee, I would also wish to thank the staff-Judy Middlebrook, Claressa Surtees, Natalie James, Kathryn Cole and Laura Gillies-for their work. Also, I acknowledge that it was the suggestion of the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) which played an important role in having this valuable document published.",94
187,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Cook (Mr Mutch) for allowing me a little of his time. I really want to say three things. The first is to say thanks to those who mentioned my contribution in initiating this annotated constitution and, secondly, to say to Judy Middlebrook, Claressa Surtees and the committee congratulations yet again on an excellent report. Thirdly, I think it is terribly important, as we move into the constitutional convention, that there is an opportunity for people to know where we are up to in constitutional change. Being the only continuing member of the parliament who has actually sat at each of the modem conventions from 1973 to 1985, I believe there is a great deal of confusion about where we are in constitutional change. This volume helps to elucidate where we are, where we have been and what recommendations are made. While it will mean that there can be now more lucid debate, it shows that that final question-the drafting of a bill for a referendum which needs to be considered and passed by this parliament-is something that cannot be taken lightly. While one goes through the whole process of constitutional reform, it needs to be recognised that reform itself is only possible after a bill for referendum has been passed, and that debate is often more substantial, and the questions that the parliament and the government need to pursue in order to introduce that bill are often more substantial, than perhaps many realise. It is not easy in our system to intrude on the ordinary electoral processes in order to achieve what demonstrably, from this volume, are a number of quite significantly agreed positions in terms of constitutional change. I believe this volume will help to expose many of those areas where change is desirable and, hopefully, to elucidate generally a better understanding of the Australian constitution than many have had to date.",95
188,Mr MUTCH,COMMITTEES,"As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am pleased to speak to the tabling of this publication entitled Constitutional Change-Select sources on Constitutional change in Australia 1901-1997. This book is a gem. It brings together in a timely way essential information on the history of official attempts at constitutional change since the inauguration of our Commonwealth. These attempts have been mostly unsuccessful. Despite four wide-ranging official reviews of the constitution by four different methodsroyal commission, joint committee, convention and commission-producing hundreds of recommendations, very few have been acted upon and ultimately, out of 42 proposals put to referendum on 18 occasions since 1901, only eight have satisfied section 128 of the constitution and passed at referendum. On this basis, a statistician might rate the official attempts a failure and one might give long odds on our proposed people's convention achieving what many would call reform. I would like to say two things about that. The first is that our constitution has proved to be durable. It has endured stubbornly many concerted attempts at change. Some may see this intractability as mulish behaviour by the Australian people who respond negatively to the entreaties of politicians and respond negatively to the proposed assumption of more power by the central government. Those a critics should bear in mind that the carrot is a more effective tool than the stick and that mules kick those who attempt to push them too far. Secondly, the advent of a new millennium, which quite auspiciously links our federal centenary with the dawning of a new century, gives us literally a once in 100 years opportunity to focus on the document upon which our federation rests and gives us the opportunity, if it is needed, to breath new life and vigour into our constitution. I commend the committee secretariat for this publication. It came out of background work undertaken by the secretariat. Claressa Surtees is to be specially commended and Natalie James singled out for her work on the referenda section. I believe it was the idea of the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) to annotate the constitution and the encouragement of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that led to publication. I commend this book to students of our constitution and, indeed, to all Australians.",96

Upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: to the Main (1) condemns the Government for: (a) breaking solemn commitments made before the election not to raise the rate of existing taxes nor introduce new taxes; (b) attempting to deceive the Australian public by not admitting that this measure is a tax; (c) deliberately inflicting on the superannuation Report industry an impossibly cumbersome, inefficient and expensive collection method; (d) ensuring by that collection method that superannuation providers incur enormous administrative expenses which will in tum be borne by their members, the great majority of whom are low and middle income earners; (e) ensuring by that method, and in particular the requirements for notification of Tax File Numbers, that over one million Australians, the overwhelming majority being low and middle income earners, will become liable for the full 15 per cent tax; (f) creating major new compliance burdens for small business, at the same time that the Government has been promising to dramatically reduce red tape; and (2) urges the Government to withdraw and re-draft this legislative package, and re-introduce a new package that will meet the objective of imposing an additional 15 per cent tax on the superannuation contributions of higher income earners, without the adverse consequences identified here.",97
194,Mr FILING,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"The matters legislation in this package of superannuation bil 5 seeks to apply a surcharge to those whose income is in excess of $70,000, phased in at one per cent for every $1,000 earned above $70,000 up to a maximum 15 per cent for those earning $85,000 or more. I advised that the procedure for collection the surcharge requires it to be collected by the super fund managers. They will be required to do this by first notifying the Australian Taxation Office of the details of contributions they have received from their fund members by the end of October each year. The ATO will then collate this information against each taxpayer's statement of taxable income to determine how much each taxpayer owes. This is notified to the super fund manager, who debits that amount from the taxpayer's superannuation account. From 1998, a provisional surcharge will be paid advance of 50 per cent of the amount of surcharge paid by the same taxpayer in previous financial year. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, the fund operators, the states, the businesses, investment and economics media and the fund members all oppose it. Almost everyone who is affected by the surcharge opposes it for variety of reasons-some weIl argued and presented, others less so. Who is not opposed to it? Clearly, it is Australian Taxation Office and policy makers. I cannot think of anyone else. There are even many members of the coaliof tion who I now know oppose this measure but, unfortunately, not many of them are willing to state this publicly. I would, however, like to commend one of my former colleagues in the Liberal Party, the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), for the leadership he has shown on this matter. He has stated publicly that he legislation because the surcharge sent the wrong message to people trying to save for retirement. He also thinks that the surcharge is a tax, regardless of how you dress it up, and that the very people it is supposed to tax are opting out in their droves. The member for Stirling is developing a record for standing up for his constituents on of principle, and I am sure they will recognise his courage even in the face of some intimidation by the Treasurer (Mr CosteIlo) and reward him for it. They will know that they are getting the type of issue based representation from the member for am Stirling that normally only Independent of members can provide for them. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has made a series of complaints about how the superannuation surcharge will work and the principle behind it. The ICA believes that the surcharge will not collect the $450 million in revenue projected in the last 1996 budget. It claims that administrative complexities related to coIlecting the surcharge are enormous. Government has agreed by default in stating that the super funds will be better able to shoulder the compliance burden than small business employers. This may be in consolain tion for the unwanted added compliance burden placed on small business earlier with the the implementation of the government's family tax initiative. Even though the government has said that the small business will be free of compliance burden, this view is not shared by all. Mr Mark Paterson, Chief Executive of the Ausa tralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has been reported as saying that 'they have come up with a highly complex structure that the won't avoid cost burdens and responsibilities the coalition's on small business'. The ICA has made an estimate that a cost $30 million will be attracted just to communicate with the 15.7 million fund members. A further cost estimated at $100 million annually will be required to maintain the surcharge. With the national disillusionment with lack of reform to the small business environment, it is no wonder that the government has maintained that this burden will be is against this borne by the funds. The actual end financial cost, however, will be borne by the contributors to super funds. You do not have to be an accountant to recognise that this will mean that the administrative cost for the surcharge will be borne by all members of funds and by employers who pay contributions on behalf of their staff. By imposing a levy, surcharge or tax in this way, the government will be reducing the capital available for investment and be directly responsible for a fund member's lower return on their investment or on their contributions. To compound that effect, government then will increase the administrative costs to the fund operator which must be borne by the fund's only source of income-it will be taken from investors' expected dividends. Employers may get hit twice. Many of them are in superannuation funds themselves and suffer simply because they are a fund member who has worked hard, performed to his or her potential and earned over $70,000 per annum. But there is also the superannuation employer contribution that they pay on behalf of their workers, some of whom may also fall into the target area for income. These staff members have probably negotiated wage and salary packages based on current and projected values that will now be devalued from one to 15 per cent. Eventually, employers will have to make up that gap. A loss of superannuation investment of one to 15 per cent in today's values may seem reasonable, but consider the potential capital return of that money when taken at a reasonable market rate of, say, 10, 15, 20 years or more. I believe that this will be a significant attack on people who have actually shown themselves to be traditional coalition supporters. The government will claim no doubt that this surcharge is an impost forced on it by Labor's financial mismanagement. This will not wash in this case, as people know there are other better alternatives. They will consider this a disincentive to investment in superannuation and, yes, they are going to have to move money to other forms of investment. But I do not think they will forgive the coalition government for this measure. The ICA points out that taxpayers who do not fall into the target income bracket will be asked to bear the government cost, which is estimated to be millions of dollars, to administer the new regime. Staff will have to be employed or redeployed, and organisations and procedures will have to be developed and implemented to monitor and maintain collection of the surcharge. Another effect the ICA has identified the surcharge will have on small business is that it will act in a detrimental fashion. The owners of a small company might struggle with costs and operations until they reach profitability and then find, as they put money away for retirement, they are stuck with this surcharge with no account for previous losses. This is equally so for primary producers and women who have incomes that are not cyclic or stable. They generally have a shorter period of high income which may pay off for years of hard work, but then they will be hard hit by a reduction in their expected superannuation benefit. People who take redundancies and lump sum superannuation will also be targeted in the year they take payouts. Many are likely to be slugged the full 15 per cent on rollovers and the like that should more properly have been used to make them independent of government benefits in their retirement. Again, I believe this is highly counterproductive in terms of our national investment psyche. The Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that government has underestimated the number of people to be affected. It claims it is not 355,000 superannuation fund members but up to 700,000. This is obviously a substantial variation and, if true, would represent a significant number of the most financially successful and probably productive people in the country. In reality, though, whether these figures are accurate or not, may be irrelevant in terms of the damage done to the psyche of investors in Australia. Even if the number of people in Australia earning more than $70,000 annually is less than 355,000, there are many people who aspire to, or intend to, earn that level of income during their working life. They will be making the decisions which determine their investments for their retirement well before that time. This surcharge will be seen as an attack on the investments of a small and responsible group of people because they have had the sense to plan for their financial future. For them, the surcharge is a positive disincentive and is bad fiscal policy and bad politics generally. If the government is seeking to justify an attack on the potential livelihood of a group as reasonable as this because they are a small group, then it is an immoral decision. Investment for the future is usually a long term proposition. If people expect they can attract a significant tax liability on their investment part way through their working life, they will seek alternatives. This will mean a general reduction in superannuation investment and a resultant loss of money in infrastructure and other typical forms of fund investment to other types of financial speculation. What will be the effect on our economy? I think there is a more serious underlying problem that we are tinkering at the fringes of our taxation system while mouthing an intention to reform it. How much more difficult to achieve substantial reform will this tinkering make it? Government must come up with an integrated approach to taxation, the economy and our national savings and stop messing around with people's lives. Having communicated its views to government, there has been an astounding silence in reply. Interestingly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants' members are trusted to advise the investing public and run the financial interests of most small, medium and even large businesses in Australia, but when they seek to advise government of what may be a flawed financial approach they are dismissed as partisan philistines. Mr Rocher-So much for consultation.",98
195,Mr FILING,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Exactly. The government has taken an equally intransigent stance with the states. Western Australia, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria have all voiced concerns about the surcharge. Further, there is a sustainable view that, in its application the surcharge, the Commonwealth is exceeding its powers which are constrained under section 114 of the constitution. Western Australia's finance minister, Mr Max Evans-whom the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) would well know and whose record of sound fiscal management and advice has been instrumental in bringing Western Australia's economy back from the brink of bankruptcy after the Labor WA Inc. yearshas serious concerns. He called the surcharge: ... inequitable in its application, expensive to administer and not without serious questiolls about its Constitutional validity ... State employees would be treated differently from other employees ... (and) ... In addition to all its other problems, the proposal is alienating the public from the whole concept of superannuation. Let me read a letter I received recently from a constituent. It illustrates the effects that changes to superannuation, which are typified by today's debate, have on the community attitude to saving. This letter is typical of hundreds and thousands of opinions that are being expressed across the country, as I am sure many coalition backbenchers will testify. It reads: Dear Mr Filing, Recent reports, both from newspapers and television, regarding changes proposed by the Government to legislation regarding superannuation is of great concern to my wife and to me. The report that superannuation payouts will not be available until individuals reach 60 years of age and that lump sum payments will not be available is of particular concern. My wife and I are both members of the State Government Employees Superannuation Fund. I have been teaching for thirty years now and my wife for 25 years and we have faithfully paid into our superannuation fund believing we would have the option of retiring at 55. Over the years, we have planned our investment strategies and modified our lifestyle so that we could retire somewhere between 55 to 57 and enjoy our remaining years. It came as a very rude shock to read that the Government is now considering denying us the option. Our superannuation payments will not make us rich, however wisely invested they should allow us to live comfortably with no need to calIon the Government for any form of support in our retireof ment years. My wife and I have both worked diligently and saved hard to allow us to take advantage of retirement near the age of 55. To be told that our plans for retirement could be put on hold for almost 5 years filled us with dismay. This is also of major concern to many of my colleagues and we ask that you vigorously oppose the implementation of such legislation and help prevent the Government from tampering with our superannuation. It is not often that] write about contentious issues but we are so incensed about this injustice that I feel the need to express our feelings in the hope that something can be done to prevent these changes taking place. I seek your thoughts and support on this issue. The sentiment expressed here is quite commonly held. The amazing thing is that these are the very types of people who probably voted Liberal in the last election. Messing around with people's financial future is a dangerous thing. Maybe they will look at the end of the day at Labor's record and vote Liberal any way. Maybe they are people who no longer have dental or pharmaceutical cover and are faced with reduced superannuation earnings with an increased deeming liability and will say, 'Who took the comfortable retirement that I had worked and planned so hard for away from me?' Mr Rocher-They'll vote Independent.",100
196,Mr FILING,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Hopefully they will vote Independent because that is where they get some sense. The AMP Society published an interesting article in its November 1996 issue of the Super Trends magazine, which examined the issues of national and household savings. It noted: ... a deterioration in public savings since the mid 1970s has been a major contributor to Australia's national savings deterioration, the problem looks primarily to be due to low private savings ... (especially evident in) ... the declining trend in the net private saving rate along with Australia's low household saving ratio, by international standards. This package of bills will directly contribute to lower national savings, which is directly related to our high national debt. The AMP article also identified that: ... there are essentially three main motivations for individuals to save: to fund retirement; to fund major items of expenditure (for instance, a home deposit, car, future education expenses, travel); and, to build up wealth as a precaution against events such as future loss of income/unemployment or health costs. Of the several factors driving household savings, three of the key drivers were the real after-tax return to savings; expectation about government provision of social security, health care, et cetera; and community attitudes to saving. The most important point about real aftertax return to savings made here is that the Australian taxation system is significantly distorting the pattern of post-tax returns being faced by investors for different assets. Without a simplified and reformed taxation system all forms of investment, and particularly superannuation, will become so complicated that, as intimated by Rob Sitch in the Business Review Weekly, it will become the exclusive domain of members of Mensa. Anybody who has been in the industry or had anything to do with it would know that it requires extraordinary intellectual effort to be able to get on top of legislative changes in the superannuation industry. Mr Rocher-Like writing the Tax Pack.",101
197,Mr FILING,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Exactly-the Tax Pack, which has now swollen to almost War and Peace proportions. I read a report of statements by a leading Australian actuary in the Australian Financial Review recently which called the plan for the surcharge 'ill conceived and inequitable'. Mr Lockery indicated that there needed to be an adequate tax concession to encourage people to accept the disadvantage of saving through superannuation. This legislation would reduce the tax concession for surcharge affected contributions to seven per cent. This was not enough to encourage people to save, given that super savings were locked away-perhaps for 35 to 40 years-could not be borrowed against and were now subject to a substantial perceived legislative risk. People were concerned that the government could change the rules, such as to compel benefits to be taken as a pension, and that people could not exit the super system to avoid adverse changes. You are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. You are between a rock and a hard place. Let's look at expectation about government provision of social security, health care, et cetera. In the post-World War II period there has been a steady increase in government provision for such things as retirement, unemployment benefits, education and medical care, not just for low income groups but also for middle-income families. The community has also become aware of the enormous costs facing government in regard to care for an ageing population, which will absorb more and more of our resources. Given that the volume of funds for this purpose is likely to remain limited, many people have seen that, in order to be relatively comfortable in retirement, they will have to provide some form of nest egg for the future. This has seen a steady and responsible move by large numbers of people into investments like superannuation which, until now, have been actively supported by government. Community attitudes to saving: I think I have made it particularly clear that this is the area which has been most severely and detrimentally affected by this surcharge legislation. I do not think I need to elaborate other than to say that the loss of public support for superannuation savings alone will have a deleterious effect on the existing financial structures in our economy in which many Australians have invested for their future. At this stage I must reiterate some of my comments from the retirement savings accounts debate as I fear that in this legislation package the government is going to reinforce some of the errors in judgment that I believe it made there. There can be no doubt that there is a real need in Australia to improve savings and that our national economic well-being is directly linked to savings. It has been a long standing policy from both sides of politics that we need to convince people that money should be invested in super funds. The proportion of their income has often been the area where the divergence of opinion has occurred. In this case we are going to place a tax or surcharge on the money that they have available and proportionately reduce their expected return. Equally, however, it must be accepted that there is a finite money supply for application to public savings. The question is: how much of it can be or should be invested in superannmition? I would be interested to find what the government's research shows concerning this. What will be the effects on the national economy if the government can achieve a significant relocation of investment from, say, stock market or commercial real estate into banks through superannuation accounts? This legislation is going to move more than 15 per cent of the superannuation capital available for private investment out of that function and into government debt reduction. What is the government's evaluation of the effect of this? It is an active government policy, supported by statements by the Treasurer, that the single most important thing that this government has been doing for average workers, taxpayers and, therefore, superannuation contributors is to create an environment where mortgage interest rates are low, thereby giving people more disposable income. This surcharge will mean that they will have to invest significantly more of this disposable income to get the same return. This does not create an environment for government to convince people that part of this increased disposable income should be invested in superannuation. I regard this bill as a bad piece of legislation based on a flawed concept. I would like to see it defeated in this place, with as many coalition members as are able to draw on the example of the member for Stirling joining into vote it down. The government and its policy makers have been presented with a range of alternatives from a variety of sources, largely from the stakeholders in this issue-those most closely affected. They have included alternatives which do not stifle investment or act as a disincentive to people in the community to strive to do well. Unfortunately, we have seen an intransigent inability to meet these demands. What I would like to see is a more clearly integrated approach by the government to the whole question of superannuation and its place in public savings, taxation and the national economy. I do not believe that such a strategy has been well enough demonstrated as yet. What we in this country need is a complete package of tax reform to provide an integrated framework that takes into account all forms of investment and revenue generation and that is easily understood and managed by those it serves. It should precede this bill package. Until we have such an approach, government will continue to be tinkering at the margin with, I believe, an inadequate understanding of or proper concern for the consequences. As a consequence, I will be voting against this bill and will be calling for a division at the proper time.",101
198,Mr OCONNOR,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"The position of the opposition on the government's new superannuation tax legislation, now before the House, has already been outlined by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). We do not oppose the principles behind this legislation. However, we do have grave reservations about the way the government intends to implement its legislation and collect the new tax. Our greatest condemnation is reserved for the Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who continues to arrogantly deceive the Australian people by attempting to portray this new tax as a surcharge. The Treasurer has made a bit of a habit of deceiving the Australian people since his first budget, but he cannot really keep that arrogant smirk off his face when he tells the Australian people that his new superannuation tax is really just an ordinary old surcharge. As late as 12 March on Radio National, as the shadow Treasurer pointed out in his speech to this House, the Treasurer was referring to this additional impost as a tax, in presenting this legislation to this House the government continues with the fiction that its new measure constitutes a surcharge. But none of us ought to forget that the architect of this new tax is none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the man who lives in the land of broken electoral promises. As I said in my initial remarks, the opposition does not intend to oppose this legislation. However, we would like a couple of small concessions from the Prime Minister. We would like him to come into this House and concede to the Australian people two simple things: yes, this is a new tax, it is not a surcharge; and, yes, this does constitute another broken promise of this embattled government. This particular broken promise is but the latest in a lexicon of broken promises from this deceitful and, as I have said, embattled government. The Prime Minister's broken promises are rapidly acquiring legendary status in Australia's political history. If you go into regional Australia, there is a deep sense of betrayal at the first Howard budget. If you go and talk to small business, no matter how much the Prime Minister wants to put a gloss on the coin, the tills just are not rattling. It is a story of electoral betrayal in that sector of the Australian economy. As far as working parents are concerned, they have been betrayed by the industrial relations legislation and by the child-care provisions of the previous budget. As far as the aged constituency of this country are concerned-and they are particularly relevant to the debate we are having in this House tonight on superannuation-the introduction of the nursing home fee has been a cynical betrayal by the Prime Minister. So when it comes to superannuation and the Howard government's new superannuation tax let no contributor to a superannuation fund be under any illusion that this constitutes anything more than just another broken promise by this Prime Minister. I reiterate the fact that as an opposition we do not contest any objective the government might have in promoting greater equity in the superannuayet tion area, but the simple fact is this: this legislation violates even the most fundamental principles that should underpin the introduction of any new taxation measure in the Australian economy. These fundamental principles are very easy even for a failed past Liberal Treasurer to understand. The first is that any tax that is introduced should be equitable, and clearly this new superannuation tax is not. The second is that any new taxation measure ought not be complex. This legislation clearly is very complex. The third is that any new taxation measure should be easy to collect. This tax certainly is not. And any new taxation measure that is proposed by any government ought to have reasonable costs of collection. We now know from industry sources that the cost of collecting this new superannuation tax will be quite exorbitant. On every test that you might apply to this new tax, this measure of the Howard government fails miserably. That is why the opposition is proposing a series of amendments as this legislation moves through this chamber. Let me deal separately with each of the criteria I have just enunciated so that this House and the Australian people can get a better appreciation of just how flawed this new superannuation tax legislation really is. As I stated earlier, this legislation fails the test of equity. It seeks to increase the superannuation contributions of high income earners, starting at $70,000 and phasing up to $85,000 and beyond. However, there is legal advice to suggest that the application of this tax to High Court judges, for example, might be unconstitutional because it reduces their income during their tenure in the High Court. In addition, the legislation is likely to be challenged by many high income state public servants across the nation, again on constitutional grounds relating to the Commonwealth's taxing of state property. Moving out of the public sector to the private sector, there is the very real danger that the response of high income earners will be to structure their salary arrangements to reduce the impact of the Howard government's new superannuation tax. Such high income earners may be encouraged to opt for non-cash remuneration such as cars and school fees or they may well split their income through trusts or, indeed, invest more in negatively geared assets. So in both the public and the private sectors many high income earners may for legal and other reasons avoid paying this new superannuation tax. But the equity impact is not only when you look at high income earners in this country. The most insidious effects on low and middle income earners will be if they do not provide their tax file numbers to superannuation funds. As the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) so eloquently pointed out in his speech to the House, if only 10 per cent of superannuation contributors failed to put in their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds, then over three-quarters of a million people will be penalised by this measure. The equity implications of this for low income earners who are caught in this new superannuation tax net are substantial. In addition to failing the basic test of equity, the legislation fails the administrative efficiency test as well. This aspect was most eloquently explained by the shadow Treasurer in his contribution to this debate in this House. If the government were to come clean with the Australian people and call it what it is, a new tax, then there would be four simple steps to calculate the liability of the taxpayer. But, by denying the reality and calling it a surcharge and structuring a collection mechanism around its own deceit, it will take eight discrete steps to implement this new tax. The cost of this unnecessary and complex collection procedure will have to be borne by the super fund and the ordinary superannuation contributor. Just to communicate with their 15.7 million contributors, the super funds will have to spend in the region of $30 million. Some industry analysts have put this cost at up to $100 million per year. So not only is the legislation complex and administratively inefficient but it is costly as well. The effect on small business is going to be substantial as well. This is a government that has come into this House today and browbeaten us all about how they are the government for small business. When they are put to the simple acid test in a piece of legislation such as this, they increase the paper burden and the red tape on small business enormously. My advice to small business across this nation is simply this: do not look to what the government says they are going to do; look to what they actually do in their legislation. Let me quote from a letter from LBW Chartered Accountants in my electorate which had this to say about the impact of this legislation on small business: Small business will be badly affected. For years, small business people take big risks struggling to make reasonable incomes. When they do, those incomes are often limited to only a five to ten year period. For the few years they can contribute to superannuation in a meaningful way they will be penalised by high taxes on that saving. The conclusion of one of the firms that deals with small business in my electorate is that small business will be badly affected by this new tax. The previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), eloquently stated the impact this particular legislation will have on the national savings effort. The Treasurer has already conceded that the revenue shortfall in 1997-98 will be $46 million less than the budgeted outcome in the first budget delivered by this government. Even more disturbing are reports by the Institute of Chartered Accountants that 60 per cent of the clients of chartered accountants are currently being advised to restructure their retirement arrangements in the face of this new Liberal tax. This is likely to exacerbate the revenue shortfall that the Treasurer has already conceded in this debate thus far. While I have referred here to the direct impact on the budget outcome in future years, when one contemplates the long-term effect on the national savings effort the impact is even more severe, but it is much more difficult to quantify. The simple fact is that high income earners will change their retirement income strategy in response to the tax. This along with other measures announced in the first Howard budget will certainly dilute the national savings pool. It will deliver a severe blow to the confidence of ordinary taxpayers in the superannuation arrangements that are currently in force in this country. The administrative complexity and the cost of this proposal will even further still dilute the confidence of the community in superannuation as a savings and retirement incomes vehicle. In government, the Labor Party sought to expand the range of income security measures to provide' older Australians with a better standard of living in their retirement. One of the great achievements of Labor in power for 13 years was the way in which more working Australians gained access to the benefits of superannuation. Under previous Liberal governments, superannuation was merely a tax perk for the rich and for well-off workers. Ordinary working Australians were not able to access this sort of retirement income program that would deliver them a better income and standard of living in their retirement. That all changed under Labor in power. Labor literally transformed the role of superannuation in Australia, making it a central pillar in the retirement incomes policy framework of the nation. The statistics on employees accessing superannuation really speak for themselves. In 1983, only 40 per cent of employees had access to superannuation. By 1995, nearly 90 per cent had super coverage. But these overall statistics mask an even greater achievement as far as the women of Australia are concerned. In 1983, only 24 per cent of women had superannuation coverage. In 1993, that figure had increased to some 85 per cent. We hear a lot from the present coalition government about the record of the previous Labor government. The previous Labor government had one thing that this present tory government clearly does not possess: an understanding of the challenges facing Australia beyond the year 2000, a vision of what Australia might be 10 to 15 years out and the political will to initiate the sorts of changes that preserve the essential social fabric of the nation as well as progressing it in an economic sense. We understood quite clearly in government that superannuation held the key to securing better retirement incomes for working Australians. We also understood its role in boosting the national savings effort, reducing our overseas debt and dependence on foreign borrowings and securing a domestic source of investment in our own future. As at March 1996, when Labor left power, those superannuation funds assets stood at $243 billion and are projected to exceed $600 billion by the year 2005. The centrepiece of Labor's last budget in power was a series of initiatives in the superannuation area designed to dramatically boost national savings. That budget did two things. It provided for the phased introduction through industrial awards and agreements of an employee contribution to superannuation by the year 2000. It also provided payments of the second round of One Nation cuts directly into super accounts, matching the three per cent contribution of employees and the self-employed. The goal of this policy was to have employees direct some 15 per cent of their earnings to superannuation by the year 2000 to the benefit of this nation. In practical terms, it meant an increase in national savings by two per cent of GDP by the year 2000 and by up to four per cent by the year 2020. The very simple reality of Australia's ageing population and its national debt dictated a dramatic and visionary response from the national government. That is why I am absolutely amazed and disappointed at the lack of vision being displayed by this government in this area in the weakening of the national savings effort. They have provided the opportunity for workers to opt out of super, and they will put that burden on the public purse in future. Through the ambit of this legislation before the House, there is a direct incentive now for high income earners to restructure their affairs and opt out of superannuation as well. What about the $4.5 billion of One Nation tax cuts? This arrogant Treasurer has once again ratted on a promise to the Australian people. Let us call it for what it is. It is a ratting on a promise that he and his Prime Minister made to the Australian people before the election. That promise was made in the context that the then opposition clearly understood that, if there was a budget deficit, they would hold fast to the promises they had made. I say this to the Treasurer: you can easily rat on a promise that you made to the Australian people in 1996 in the face of a $9 billion to $10 billion budget deficit, but Labor never ratted on the commitments it made to the Australian people in the face of a current dollar $25 billion deficit that was left to it by John Howard when he was Treasurer of this nation. This is a severely flawed piece of legislation. It fails the administrative efficiency It is very costly to implement and, at the end of the day, it is a most inequitable measure. That is why the opposition is proposing a series of amendments to the legislation before this House. We simply say to the government: this is your measure now; you are now governing this country. You have put this legislation before the Australian people-this flawed, inequitable new super tax. At the end of the day, if we fail in the attempts to amend it, as oppositions should, and if we fail to convince you that you ought to amend this legislation in the interests of the superannuation community and in the interests of working Australians, then it will be on your head. You will have to wear the political consequences of one of the most stupid pieces of legislation to come before this House in this session.",103
199,Mr KERR,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"It is an extraordinary situation when a government presented with the hard way or the easy way of achieving an end chooses what is not only the hard way but also-if the view of senior constitutional lawyer Dennis Rose is correctthe impossible way of achieving its end. Why is it that this government is committed to an outcome and a process that overlooks what would have been a simple method of achieving an impost of the kind that it wishes to make on high income earners to increase their tax liability? It is because they do not want to be fingered with the words 'a broken promise'. They do not want to be fingered with a broken promise, but they are quite happy to break the promise nonetheless. They are quite happy to implement through weasel words an outcome which effectively increases the tax liability on every person in the higher income bands in a way which is totally inconsistent with their pre-election commitments. As an equity measure, the Labor Party says, a higher impost on those particular taxpayers is not, in principle, to be objected to, but we do object to being taken, and to the community being taken, as fools. We want it to be plainly understood that what is being done is a complex and administratively stupid way of achieving that which would be administrativetest. ly simple if it was struck as a tax. It is highly probable that whatever outcome emerges from this parliament will be held to be unconstitutional if it passes in the form the government proposes. That is the outcome of senior constitutional advice by Dennis Rose, whom I, as Attorney-General for a short period and Minister for Justice, had the pleasure of working closely with. I would have thought that those who know Dennis would take the view that an opinion expressed with the confidence that he has expressed it is unlikely to be little regarded by the High Court of Australia. Nonetheless, this government is prepared to put forward legislation knowing that it is potentially flawed in that way and knowing that it has strong objections to overcome in terms of the cost of the implementation and the fact that the friction caused by the red tape and administration will be expensive to the funds. What does that mean? Funds are not profit making institutions in the main; they are holding in trust moneys on behalf of contributors. So it means that the ultimate payouts of people putting into superannuation are reduced-all this so that the government avoids having to face the obvious truth, that it is imposing a significant new tax, a tax which the opposition in principle is prepared to support. I think it is important, however, to realise that all this has to be seen in a larger context. We are in danger of becoming obsessed with the detail of this legislation, appalling though it be, to the detriment of seeing the wider scheme. The wider scheme is that, over a very long period, the Australian people have been party to a series of agreements with their government which have seen increasing funding of national superannuation. Over a series of elections, the community has agreed with government that there would be a national commitment towards building a retirement policy framework which would be able to be sustained throughout the period when our population will be ageing. This is not an insubstantial issue. One of the things we are able to do in opposition is to be a little reflective. In the first year period in opposition, my particular shadow responsibilities have been changed to include overall interest in the area of population policy issues. So the title I now hold is shadow minister for population issues, as well as shadow minister for immigration and assistant to the Leader of the Opposition on multicultural affairs. What is the significance of population in this debate? The significance is this: for the foreseeable future, Australia will continue to have-as it presently has-a demographic profile which means that we are not producing a replacement level for the future. The short-term effects do not mean that population declines-for the next 30 or 40 years, until the present phalanx of women of child-bearing age passes through that group, Australia's population will continue to increase. The actual population outcomes will depend-in part-on minor variations in birth rates but also on decisions to be made by this and future governments about immigration levels. Whatever those decisions are, there is no doubt that we will be a significantly more aged population by the time we reach the year 2030 and, absent a significant increase through immigration at that time, our population will be not only aged but aged and declining. So we face the prospect of a narrower base of taxpayers meeting the forward costs of health and aged care into the future. In that framework, it was very important that we develop a national system of savings which would in part militate against the cost to public revenues of ageing. There is no doubt that this issue should be squarely on the public policy agenda across the board. It was drawn attention to. The government has no excuse for not knowing of its significance. The Commission of Audit reported on this matter in very alarming terms-too alarming, I think. Some of its projections in terms of the costs it anticipated as the population aged-particularly in the health care sectorgo beyond the expectations of what is a rational and prudent set of numbers. Nonetheless, it is correct to identify this as an issue which requires significant and proof our longed policy attention. Other governments are starting to address the issue too. The British people are now going to an election, and one of the issues in contest is Prime Minister John Major's proposal to privatise the pension-to require all British workers to make a personal contribution to long-term arrangements towards their retirement. In Labor's approach there is no suggestion of privatising pensions. It was designed to make sure the retirement income of those who went through the work force would be greater than it otherwise would have been if all that was available to them was a pension benefit. Building such a system means that there will be less strain on public revenues, and it increases national savings. You have a significant pool of investment funds availablethrough the accumulated retirement savings of Australians, held in managed funds-for infrastructure investment and other investment in Australia. Now we discover two things are happening. Firstly, about 60 per cent of those in a position to provide for themselves in superannuation type schemes are being advised not to do so by accountants and actuaries, who-because of the kind of measures that this new government is bringing into place-are saying to them, 'There are better ways to provide for your future than through the superannuation scheme.' That means that the superannuation investment structures are-for the first time-going to be significantly less beneficial to Australia in terms of the savings they contribute than they would otherwise have been. It also knocks on the head some of the revenue projections that this government has made. Secondly, this government is backing off the promise to pay the $4.5 billion of contributions the government pledged itself tounder the provisions the Keating government had first anticipated-to match additional contributions from the workers. During the election campaign the shadow Treasurer committed the coalition to that. What this means is that, instead of there being a structure in place that will continue to expand the growth in superannuation and make greater public and private provision for people's retirements through superannuation, we are knocking a national strategic vehicle to :1ddress long-term savings on the head and not providing an appropriate vehicle for addressing the structural ageing that our society faces-and we are doing so for short-term narrow political gain. This is not very good policy making; it is very ugly policy making. When they confront this legislation, members of this House-and the Senate-ought to reflect very carefully before they allow it through in the form that is proposed. There is nothing wrong with a government genuinely putting forward an additional impost to increase taxation of high income earners in the superannuation system. Of course, if the impost is too high, it will kill the golden goose. But, assuming that the level at which it is set is one which will still give some advantage to people investing in superannuation, we do not object to that kind of approach. But we do say that it is terribly silly for a government to go through enormously complicated processes which will catch up unintended victims-all those people who do not provide tax file numbers, lowincome earners, people who are getting payouts from work when they have been made redundant, all those people being caught up in a quite unnecessary and unanticipated way. Why do it in that form? We suggest the government think again and do it in a much more straightforward way. One thing that I guess would be of concern to many of those who are in the Public Service, if indeed the states come along and adopt this system and legislate to enable it to be implemented in the states, and all those in unfunded superannuation schemes, including all members of this parliament, is that he government is still not able to say what the actuarial principles will be upon which unfunded schemes will be taxed. I am told by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) that those actuarial principles will not be known for some two months after the legislation has been passed. What we are being asked to do in relation to these matters, which affect many hundreds of thousands of Australians, is to buy a pig in a poke-to adopt a principle of taxation where the authors of the policy are not able to say how it will have an impact. Essentially, the incidence and circumstances where this will fall and the way in which it will affect individual members of such funds is completely unknown. That seems to be a very odd way to make tax policy, a very odd way to make superannuation policy and not a way which this House ought to be extremely comfortable with. Many of these difficulties could be dealt with if the government simply had the straightforward initiative to say, 'Yes, we are in breach of one of our election commitments.' It would not be the first-they are in breach of many of their election commitments-and it will not be the last. If they were prepared to simply accept that, on this occasion, they are in breach of their prior commitment not to increase taxation and not try to do this through a backdoor mechanism which is too complex and gives rise to greater problems than the device needs to generate, many of those problems would be worked out and overcome. We have an unnecessarily complicated piece of legislation to achieve a relatively simple policy objective. And at the same time it is contained within a framework of indifference to the overall superannuation objective. This really does concern the opposition and ought to concern members of the government. At the very least, there ought to be a strategic statement of objectives about how this government seeks to address the kinds of demographic and social issues that successive governments in the past have dealt with through superannuation policy. The kinds of mutual commitments that were, until recently, the subject of bipartisan support need to be reviewed because the government simply does not support those matters any more. It had been, until recently, a matter of common ground across the chamber that both the opposition and the government saw the need for there to be such structural saving mechanisms built into the way in which Australia did its business. If that is the case, the government needs to tell us what it will do to deal with the sorts of issues the Commission of Audit raised. The government needs to say, 'If we did tell lies to the Australian public at the last election and say we would pay the $4.5 billion superannuation contributions that Labor had committed to previously and now we will not, this is what we will put in its place.' They need to say what kind of structural mechanisms they will build into our financial system to ensure that national savings objectives are generated and that we deal with generational costs which will otherwise become acute. It is not plausible to say that we can enable the present generation to avoid thinking about the future given the fact that when this generation, my generation-and even Martin Ferguson's generation-is old we will be old in a communityMr Martin Ferguson-There is a gap between me and you.",106
200,Mr KERR,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"That is right. But when we are old we will be old in a community in which we are a much larger proportion than the elderly are presently. We need to make sure that structural arrangements are put in place and we need to make sure that we do not allow this government to slide away from articulating what it will do in the future, because these issues are far too large and significant to get lost in party politics and arguments about technical details. We object on technical grounds to the way this legislation is constructed and who it will impose burdens on and we say that this is silly legislation, it is over complex, it imposes additional costs on the least well off in the community who will get accidentally caught up because they do not provide tax file numbers or because they take redundancy payouts. We also say that this government really has to articulate what kinds of savings strategies it is going to pursue and what kinds of long-term investment strategies it believes are appropriate for Australia, it needs to come clean on whether it believes Australia needs a population policy and say where it expects Australia to go and have some outlines of the expected demographics for where we will not stand in 50 years time so that we can do some long-term strategic planning and long-term that physical economic modelling of the way in which we have to provide for our citizens into the future. These issues require that kind of long-term thinking. That was the kind of long-term thinking that we committed ourselves to through the superannuation initiatives built on over a series of elections and which the current government committed itself to maintain and continue when it was in opposition and when it went to the people and now is retreating from but without any clear sense of identifying what alternatives they are seeking to put in its place. That is why the greatest betrayal of public policy is not the shonkiness of the deal, not the fact that the government is trying to impose a tax without using the language of tax but the fact that they are walking away from a public policy initiative of such significance without giving any hint of what they would put in its place.  tonight having a cognate debate on seven superannuation bills that impose a superannuation surcharge. It is really disappointing that in the area of superannuation we seem to have history repeating itself. I say that because it was the Menzies government in 1950 that destroyed the National Welfare Fund. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, that you go to a lot of senior citizens' functions. People will often raise with members the fact that they contributed to their own pensions because when Australia had a fully funded national superannuation scheme called the National Welfare Fund, they were in it. Every pound of earnings required a contribution into that fund towards your old age. That fund was emasculated by the conservatives. When Labor came to government in 1983 only 40 per cent of the work force was covered by superannuation. When the highest marginal rate was 60 cents in the dollar, the rate of taxation on superannuation was three cents, because only five per cent of it was taxable. We get lectured by this government that they are introducing equity reforms into superannuation. I think you need to put it in the context of what we did. As I said, in 1983 only 40 per cent were covered. Now 90 per cent are covered. In 1983 only 24 per cent of women in the work force had superannuation. Now I think that figure is 85 per cent. So one thing that we did over 13 years was try to give superannuation coverage to the majority of the population, so that they would not be totally dependent on an old age pension. Much has been said by the Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), particularly during question time, about the 1993 election promises relating to taxation. The first thing that needs to be said is that we did introduce the reduction in the taxation scales, as we promised. In other words, the first part of it was delivered. For example, the 38 per cent rate went to 34 per cent and the 46 per cent rate went to 43 per cent. It is true that we undertook in 1996 to introduce the second phase. But we did not do that. What we said we would do, and in fact undertook to do was, rather than giving people a further tax cut, to match dollar for dollar the contribution of those earning up to $46,000 by paying up to $1,000 per annum each and every year into their superannuation accounts. That payment phased out when earnings reached $65,000. I am staggered that the Treasurer and government members can get up in this parliament and say that they are quite comfortable with the idea that the Prime Minister, John Howard, is going to renege on that. What he is going to do is rip it out of their superannuation accounts and not give it back as tax cuts but put it in the government coffers. Looking at the legislation they have been bringing in, we see that they have paid off the banks. One election promise-core or noncore-which has not been deviated from one millimetre is to establish retirement savings accounts. This means windfall profits to the banks and minimum returns for workers. They have made that electoral payment. We now learn that they are going .to confiscate the second phase of Labor's proposed $4.5 billion worth of superannuation benefits; they are going to renege on that. Tonight we are considering a further proposal that sounds really good in theory; that is, we are going to put a surcharge on those high income earners-everyone earning more than $70,000. Regrettably, a number of people who are not earning $70,000 a year are going to be caught up in that. That includes people who get redundancy packages and termination packages. These people are going to be affected, as are those whom the superannuation funds cannot contact. Assuming that 10 per cent of people cannot be contacted by their super funds, the industry estimates that over ome million people will be affected. The mechanism for dealing with the 355,000 people who earn more than $70,000 is that superannuation funds have to provide the Taxation Office with details of 16 million separate accounts that they hold. Today in this parliament we heard the Prime Minister announce all these marvellous improvements designed to cut red tape. I cannot understand how you are possibly cutting red tape when, to be able to find accurate information on 355,000 people paying superannuation, you have to access 16 million accounts. In its first year, for people who are contributing superannuation, it doesn't matter whether you are at $70,000, $20,000 or $30,000, the impact is $100 million. All contributors are going to be required to pay that. The ongoing cost of that is estimated at $30 million each year. Over a period of time, a significant amount of money that would have been going to benefit people in their old age is not going to benefit them. It is going to be eaten up in administrative charges. There is a decent and honest way to deal with the government's shortfall of revenue. That is not to adopt this chicanery of saying, This surcharge is a surcharge; it is not a tax.' Of course, it is a tax. The cleaner, more effective and efficient way would have been to increase marginal rates of taxation to collect that measure. But the government is not going to do it. It is taking seven bills just to ment this bit of government legislation. It has claimed that it is equitable, but a whole raft of people are going to be affected by that, not just those on $70,000. It is going to be people on termination payments, redundancy packages and golden handshakes. They will all be caught up with it, as well as those who have notified merely their employer about their tax file number and not their superannuation fund. I regret that conservative history is that they destroyed the National Welfare Fund, a fully funded superannuation scheme, in the 1950s. And they are doing the very same thing now with the superannuation system that we have left in place that was going to add significantly to peoples' retirements. It was going to add $500 billion in national savings in the year 2000 and much more in the years to come. It is being strangled by this government by each and every successive measure.",109
201,Mr BEAZLEY,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"I want to speak on this superannuation legislation because it starts the process of dismantling what was one of the fairest and most decent initiatives to improve savings and the retirement possibilities of the ordinary Australian that a government in this country has ever introduced. After a series of fits and starts over the years, and incorporating at different points of time in the history of its processes such luminaries as Bob Menzies, the government finally had the guts and almost sufficient longevity to leave it in place. This proposition starts the process of dismantling. Given what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said over the weekend, it is completed in the next budget when the co-payment, which the previous government promised when in office and the incoming government promised to implement when running for election, is put in place. This effective package for superannuation arrangements and increasing national savings and providing a decent retirement then disappears. This is a government without creativity but with prejudices. It has no creativity but it has a load of prejudices. It is as though they were Rip Van Winkles of the last 13 years. They understood nothing. They forgot nothing of imple- the slights directed towards them. They learned the words but they never learned the music. They never internalised any of the intellectual arguments accepted by the community-generated from the community in some circumstances-that caused this country to be regarded as an interesting example of effective social experimentation by many other countries in the OECD, and by many people in the United States, on a whole variety of issues. They came out with the words they committed themselves to. Nothing is more appalling than to watch the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) parade around the country now as though he has accepted his election undertakings. Part of that process that he knocked over was child care. They committed to the arrangements that we had put in place with child care; he annihilated them in the last budget. Part of the process was with the universal health care system. Not a single decision that they have taken since they have been in office enhances that, and they have bungled the $1.5 billion rebate which could have transformed public hospitals. They committed to opportunity and access to higher education by putting in place a system of arrangements inviting the universities to charge Australians full-cost recovery a variety of degrees, which in some cases will be well over $100,000. They put that out there as an example of what the cost actually is, creating a sense of unfairness in a proportion of the student body that is paying that amount, while at the same time increasing HECS to the point where students feel constrained from entering particular courses. On Friday evening I was talking to a very bright kid who has just entered university. He got a 99.5 rating in the New South Wales system, which easily qualifies him for medicine. He said simply, 'I can't afford the uncertainty. I can't afford the HECS. I am going to be a lawyer.' God help us. He is going to be a lawyer. In this instance, we have taken one of the brightest kids you could imagine, who was not unenthusiastic about doing a university degree, and we are going to educate him towards malevolence on a grand scale as far as the rest of the community is concerned. What a shame. This Rip Van Winkle government, having wrecked a whole range of social initiatives that produced decent public investment-real investment in the development of our nation and the quality of our citizens-by reintroducing privilege as the basis of access to goods and services and educational opportunities in this country, have now joined issue on a matter about which one would have thought the Liberal Party would have been prepared to lift its bat and allow to pass through to the keeper and say, 'Okay. You produced a cure on the savings front to the chronic problem which has afflicted this nation since the 1960s, that is, our inability to save. You have just put through a set of propositions which will produce that.' Their response to that has been, like a bunch of vandals, 'Let's go in and wreck this as well.' They are a very lucky government; they are an extraordinarily lucky government. They have out there a jaded public that is switched off politics and a press which is operating on a 24-hour memory as far as these things are concerned. If we sit down and look through a proposition like the work for the dole scheme that we will be debating later in this week, we see that it was introduced into the in public arena, poll driven, chucked into the middle of it, and everybody operates, revolves and dances around it with a 24-hour memory. It is as though Working Nation was based on reciprocal obligation. The Prime Minister even gets away with describing his system as reciprocal obligation. Where did he get those words from? He got them from Simon Crean, that is where he got those words from. The Prime Minister even has the temerity to talk about reciprocal obligation to that and everybody who calls themselves a social analyst, at least in the media, is prepared to allow him to get away with it. They are prepared to ignore what was one of the most effectively developed schemes of social support and one of the most effectively developed schemes of educational and training support for the long-term unemployed who had no hope without it and now have, in most instances, no hope at all. They allowed him to get away with that paltry, tawdry scheme thrown into the middle. All these things are recoverable. Elected to office in I Yz years time, we can cure--or start to cure-the reintroduction of the notion of privilege, eliminate it and go back to education as a public investment. We can go down that course again. We can put in place decent mechanisms to ensure that the long-term unemployed are kept job ready and have an opportunity to get in, and a decent reciprocal obligation put in place with them so that there is an array of opportunities made available but a reasonable expectation by the community that one of them will be accepted. We can do that. We can fix up the mess that has been made of research and development in industry . We can fix up a lot of the mess that has been made in a whole range of other industry assistance programs. But, when we sit down and contemplate the consequences of what they have done here, I very much fear that it is going to be extraordinarily difficult to fix. They are driving people out of the upper end of superannuation and annihilating the benefits at the bottom. What is going to be the effect of that? The effect of that on the nation overall is that the net increase in private savings that would have come through as a result of these schemesimproving and lifting our private savings ratios by some two percentage points of GDP in net terms just after the tum of this century-is gone. That simply will not happen without that copayment going through. That proposition, which would have lifted us, if you want to put it in dollar terms, to the trillion dollar mark by around that time-compare that trillion dollar mark with the $200 billion that we owe foreigners, if you want to put things that way, and you would see that we deal very comfortably with that problem we have to generate sufficient internal savings to be basically responsible for our own development-is gone, all gone, as a result of the decisions that this government is about to make and is in the process of making. We got the cutest possible explanation of all that by the Treasurer at question time today. He had the hide to get up and repeat again that canard of his that somehow or other he was not obliged to keep our promises. Treasurer, we do not oblige you to keep one of our promises-not one. The government is not responsible for keeping the Labor Party's promises-not one of them. The government is, however, responsible for keeping its own. What makes the private savings of the nation a non-core promise? What makes it so insignificant? The problem of dealing with our current account deficit, the problem of dealing with ownership of Australian industry, the problem of dealing with a decent retirement package for everybody now in their 30s and 40s-why is this so trivial that it is a non-core promise? We say black means white when we see a proposition like this put forward by the Treasurer in February 1996: 'A coalition government will provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 budget to match compulsory contributions according to the proposed schedule.' The other cute part of his explanation today was to say, 'Aha, a revelation! What you did not tell the Australian people was that there would be a one per cent compulsory contribution from the wage earners-and then two and then three as the years go by.' You didn't tell them! The previous Prime Minister used to dance across the airwaves day after day telling them precisely that. The union leadership which took an interest in these matters used to dance across the airwaves day after day telling them precisely that. And that stately dance was joined by none other than the now Treasurer back then in February 1996 when he made amply clear that a coalition government would 'match compulsory contributions according to the proposed schedule'. That was not our promise, not some promise put out there in the ether that descended unfortunately on the head of this new government as it came in. It was their promise, their undertaking to the Australian people. This was a promise as core as anything else that they delivered or said that they would deliver after the election. What have they produced? They have produced a rebate of $1.5 billion-completely wasted. How are they going to pay for that shenanigan? To kill the savings of the nation, to kill the retirement of 30and 40-year-olds now who looked at the prospect of a retirement with an income more or less around the average weekly earnings that they now enjoy-whacking off the average 30-year old now some $100,000 on the point of retirement and hoping to skate through this one by saying, 'Well, it is not terribly relevant to them because it doesn't happen for another 30 years.' They are going to need a very quiet press on this one because as this becomes more generally known this government will stand monumentally condemned for this piece of electoral chicanery. Today we saw the Treasurer in probably his worse question time that I have seen for some considerable time. But the other little piece of chicanery on the Treasurer's part was to try to claim that, with this particular exercise-I have already gone through the fact that he claimed it was an exercise-their savings vehicle would match it. Let us go through an analysis of what we know of their savings vehicle-their savings vehicle that will partly pay for it. He was saying that they could only afford to do that because they had to deal with the black hole that was left by us. Let us reflect upon their last budget. Whatever claims they might make about the financial system they inherited, they announced to the Australian people proudly at the last budget that they had left sufficient way in the budget for the implementation of this promise in full. So the first cute explanation was, 'We didn't make it, the dog ate our homework, we lost the promise. The second cute little explanation for the breaking of that particular promise was that it was somebody else's promise and they were not obliged to commit l-a-w law. The third cute little explanation for this exercise was that somehow or other they had a budgetary situation of our doing, not the budgetary situation that they have themselves confronted since the budget which they brought down last time. It was a point of pride for the Treasurer. He does want us to operate on a 24-hour memory, but I can recollect him getting up there offering his blandishments to the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters. He used to do it far more forcibly in those days than he does now. He would lean across the dispatch box and say, 'Not only have we fixed up the budget deficit, but we are going to put in place your l-a-w law tax arrangements. That's what we're going to do.' This was not even before the last election; this was after the last budget. Up he got and said precisely that. So the third cute little explanation that he had here today for what it was that he was up to is out the window as well. Now we tum to the matters that are contained within this bill. These matters, of course, are not so serious in their impact on the nation's savings, nor on the opportunity for retirement for the average Australian, as are the propositions that they have foreshadowed for the next budget, but they are just as serious in their impact on the credibility of superannuation as a mechanism for saving. It is the first step in the subversive process, the first step in undermining the proposition. This step drives high income earners out of the superannuation arrangements. They are the ones who can make alternative arrangements available for them. Therefore the savings are not going to be there in the public saving sense, but what will be there, for those who remain, is a whole set of arrangementsenormously costly to put in place-that will be recovered from the other members of the superannuation funds and diminish their benefit. All the battlers-all 15 million, or whatever it is-who are signed up now to these superannuation funds, one after another over the last few years, will be impacted upon. Secondly, of course, they are massively impacted upon by the practical activity associated with these measures which means that, when they do not put in their tax file numbers or if they are just an ordinary battler and they tot up a final payment that comes to over $70,000, on both those fronts, the so-called wealthy, who are in fact the Australian battlers, will be the ones who are soaked. In other words, exactly the same people who are going to be skinned alive when it comes to this next budget are also the people who are going to bear the brunt of this. The superannuation funds, and others associated with the industry, have pointed out that there is virtually no response from individual fund members, from copious correspondence with them, because superannuation is not a system that they readily understand, they consider themselves to be in receipt of rote letters to which you never respond, and their lives are too busy anyway. They are going to be royally punished for that lack of attention when this particular bill goes through. What will happen to them at a minimum is going to be the loss of earnings that would have been there on that proportion of their income, which will be illegitimately taxed as a result. That may actually last for a very long time indeed in the case of a number of members and, even when they discover it, what they will not get back is the loss of earnings from the fund when that occurs. Various estimates have been placed on this but reasonable ones are that some one million Australian battlers are going to be the people who are worse off as a result of that. Finally, there is a point that ought to be made about this which goes to the competence of this particular Treasurer. I do not want to describe this fellow as a bloke completely without ability. He has some, but he is not a Treasurer. Maybe in another 10 or 15 years he would be a Treasurer. He is not one now. He is going to find over the next few days, as he has already found at the hands of Rose QC, at the hands of the premiers, at the hands of those who actually know something about this, that this is monumentally botched legislation, completely botched legislation. Not only is he destroying part of the nation's savings; he is destroying it incompetently. There is absolutely no clothing left on this particular emperor. This particular emperor has no clothes at all when he tries to claim a degree of expertise in this field. He will get through this legislation. The nation will be the poorer for it and it even poorer still when the rest of his shenaniAustralia, gans as far as superannuation is concerned come to fruition. This particular part of it is going to bring him down 18 months from now as people come to understand what he has done to them and the superannuation funds descend in chaos. (Time expired)",111
202,Mr ANDREN,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"I must say it was with much interest I observed the debate in the media over the past few weeks regarding the government's proposed superannuation surcharge for high income earners. I was especially glad to hear the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on Radio National a week or so back finally stating that it was time to call a spade a spade and concede that his proposed surcharge was in fact a new tax. Unfortunately, this concession appears to have been the only concession made by the government in relation to this matter, even though the proposal has been widely criticised by media commentators, the Association of Superannuation Funds, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, peak accounting bodies and various state governments to name but a few. It was particularly interesting to see Dennis Rose QC, an eminent constitutional authority, join the debate and state that he viewed the proposed legislation as unconstitutional and likely to be found wholly invalid if subjected to legal challenge. Yet, rather than consider the various alternatives available with a view to implementing this measure in the most efficient and practical manner, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is adamant that his government will not back down on the surcharge and will press ahead with it regardless of the criticism. The irony is that criticism of the surcharge proposal is focused on perceived inefficiencies and ramifications with the way it is to be implemented and not upon the legislation's worthy objectives of making superannuation fairer by reducing the considerable advantage very high income earners receive by contributing to superannuation funds, but this law will drive those high-fliers into fringe benefits. Susan Ryan, the Executive Director of the will be Association of Superannuation Funds of stated on 12 March that her organisation does not: 'argue with the government's right to raise extra revenue, nor with their intention to tax high-income people more in relation to superannuation, we are just saying: let's have a system of collection which doesn't create expensive chaos in the industry . . .' Furthermore, on the same day, the Executive Director of the Business Council, David Buckingham, stated his organisation is not opposed to the surcharge as such. His concern is that the administrative arrangements proposed, in his words, represent 'an administrative nightmare and will be very costly, very inefficient.' From my independent perspective, it worries me to see the government once again going down the path of putting into ,place legislation which will fail to achieve a worthy goal because of poor design and implementation. While the government may have clearly identifiable policies and objectives, it really does seem to be falling short on the implementation side of good government. One need only look at the example of the Austudy actual means test debacle; its admirable objective was to catch the rorters of the system and ensure only those families who deserve the benefit receive assistance. However, because the system was ineptly implemented and administered, the system backfired and ended up catching the very people the government should have protected. Similarly, recently in this House, I spoke on the government's proposed changes to the taxation laws to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for small business which would not benefit many small businesses and farmers who chose, like many do, to run and sell family companies with shares. Finally the government heard the message and announced the concession in today's small business package but, unless that legislation is amended, many thousands of genuine small businesses, whom the government undoubtedly intended to help, will not be helped at all. It is Clayton's legislation. Clearly, there are many people who view the government as making the same mistakes with this current piece of legislation as it did with these others. For example, last week Robert Brown from the Institute of Chartered Accountants said the proposed legislation reflected the knee-jerk way in which the government brought this in. He said: 'It seems to be an ill-thought out, last-minute initiative of the last budget which is just a grab for revenue.' Clearly, the legal ramifications have not been thought through. The argument I raised in the capital gains tax rollover debate is of equal relevance to this one. If a government is going to legislate, it makes sense that it does everything within its power to ensure the measures it introduces are capable of achieving its objectives in the most efficient manner and, of course, are constitutional. With these measures, the government aims to claim a further $500 million in tax revenue by slicing up the 15 per cent extra off the super of those people who earn over $70,000 and who currently only pay 15 per cent tax on superannuation contributions. As the member for Moore (Mr Filing) said, it is a 15 per cent shift from savings to revenue. The proposal is justified on the basis that it reduces the generosity of tax concessions available to the better off. Its obvious political purpose, however, is to deliver a quick revenue fix while maintaining an illusion that no new taxes are being introduced. The proposal, which technically has been operating since 20 August last year, aims to levy super funds rather than the individual contributors by asking the funds to provide the ATO with details of the money paid into the nation's 15.7 million superannuation accounts. The Taxation Office will then send the funds a list of the accounts from which the tax should be deducted. The super funds would then deduct the tax and hand the money over to the government. The government's rationale for implementing the tax in this way seems based on two factors. Firstly, because the government is treating the levy as a surcharge and not a conventional tax, it could not collect it through conventional taxation mechanisms. Secondly, because the government feels the superannuation funds owe their very existence to government legislation and they already administer the 15.7 million superannuation accounts in Australia, they are, the government says, the logical mechanism through which to collect the revenue. Throughout this public debate, the government has argued that the super funds are the demons in this equation. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself has said that: 'The superannuation funds are talking out of their pockets on this issue. There is nothing high and mighty or altruistic about that. Let's call a spade a spade: the funds are trying to destroy this because it affects them.' With all respect, the problem is that the Prime Minister and his government do not seem to recognise the inherent connection between super funds and their members. The fact is that the cost to a fund of administering such a levy-and the cost, estimated at $100 million a year, is considerable, to say the least--could not be incurred by the super funds without hurting their members. It is my understanding that super funds do not have independent sources of income to dip into. All of their profits and losses are ultimately linked to the value of their members' accounts. Accordingly, any expenses incurred by the fund would have to be paid for by the fund members-and that would mean all fund members, not only those at whom this new tax is aimed. In effect, the government will be asking the ordinary fund users to subsidise the collection of the surcharge. Why? Simply because the government could not bring itself to call a a tax and collect it as such. Besides burdening all members of the fund with the expense of administering the collection of the tax, another likely consequence of the proposal is that it will deter people from investing in superannuation funds. Apparently, this has already started happening, with a majority of chartered accountants advising their affected clients to move out of voluntary superannuation because of the surcharge. According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, 35 per cent of accountants said they would be telling their wealthy clients to divert their funds to negatively geared property or shares, or into investment in equities. Twenty-six per cent would be recommending their clients set up trust structures. Thirteen per cent would advise clients to pay off their mortgages, and 19 per cent would advise clients to limit themselves solely to compulsory superannuation contributions. A voidance reactions such as these are undesirable and maybe they are unavoidable regardless of how the tax is implemented, but surely they cast doubt on the ability of the surcharge scheme to achieve the government's target of $500 million this financial year, more in future years. While collecting the tax through the superannuation funds may be politically correct, it does appear to be an inefficient way to do it from an administrative point of view. Although I do not claim, by any means, to be a superannuation expert, some of the alternatives suggested by the superannuation funds and the Institute of Chartered Accountants-which would have the collection administered through group certificate systems-do appear preferable. I now return briefly to deal with some broader issues raised by this legislation. In particular, I want to look at the message this type of change sends out to people about superannuation. I also want to look at the issue of education about superannuation. From my perspective, superannuation exists so that when people retire they will be able to maintain a standard of living above that achievable on the pension, until they die. In the long run, tax superannuation should benefit both the individual, by providing them with a higher standard of living, and the rest of society by not burdening society with the responsibility of supporting retired people. In a country with an economy such as Australia's and an ageing population, it makes sense to have as attractive a superannuation system as possible. From what I see in my electorate, there is already a worrying degree of cynicism in relation to superannuation. Workers tell me that if only they could use the superannuation money they earned to pay off their mortgage, in the long run it would save them thousands of dollars-savings which could then be directed towards superannuation at a later date. Let me explain the situation of a small business operator in my electorate who is now over 60 and approaching retirement. He is about to see a large slice of his retirement savings creamed off. Let me read from a letter that he wrote, and in fact a copy was sent to Senator Rod Kemp: May I suggest you seriously look at making further exceptions in the case of people over 60 years of age. My reasons for making this suggestion are: (l) Because I was self-employed for the vast and majority of my working life, I was unable to adequately superannuate myself. (2) In recent years, having formed a service company so I became an employee of that company, I have been superannuating myself at a rate higher than normal in order to compensate for the previous shortfall. (3) Because my retirement is now imminent and because I have been working to a fixed plan, I consider your proposed surcharge, which I consider to be a tax, to be unfair to those people who, like myself, are not using superannuation as a taxation hedge but are genuinely trying to consolidate their lifestyle in their retirement. There is a lot more, but that bit says it all. Here we have a tax not only on those who could and should pay more, but on the hard working and thrifty people who want to look after themselves in old age because this government is too gutless to tackle the other areas of the economy where revenue is staring them in the face. I refer to the massive taxminimised profits shifted offshore by companies masquerading as serious investors in this country. This is no crazy, anti-multinational rhetoric. It comes from no less an authority than one of the government's business advisers on APEC, Mr Michael Crouch, who warns that foreign control of key industries is leading to massive profit shifting; that our beef is being bought by vertically integrated Japanese companies here at $15 a tonne and being sold at home for ten times that, with absolutely minimal tax paid here on their operations. Thirty-three per cent of our listed shares are foreign owned and $13 billion exits this country in dividends each year, as well as $11 billion to foreign banks. Why aren't imports taxed? Why aren't our financial screen jockeys taxed? Why are some of our own most powerful businesses paying such low tax? These are the questions of the so-called battlers which both sides of politics seem to want to represent. These are the questions the battlers and the small business operators are asking of this government. And the only reason the polls are so favourable for the government is that there is nowhere else to turn, apart from Independents, because Keating looked after his mates, too. You talk about savings on the government side. The Prime Minister talks about the need for foreign investment to sustain our standard of living and to provide jobs. What rot! How can you talk about the need for savings on the one hand and then tax the very savings that should sustain people in retirement, at their expense? If we were really serious about Australians investing in Australia, we would be looking at directed superannuation investment to restore the infrastructure in this country that has been wantonly and criminally run down over the past 20 years. Some funds, like the Rural Supervision in country New South Wales, are planning to target rural infrastructure. There are thousands of people out there prepared to put their money where their country is. Economically targeted investment in this country would work, for if we don't restore our national infrastructure and assets, or invest in our own value adding industrywool, meat, export marketing enterprises, inland export airports, our own mineral resources-then someone else will. And that someone will come from overseas and those profits and that forgone tax will go overseas. This government, and the one before, and probably the one after, will run around picking up little PA YE or small business stones and squeezing a little more tax blood out of them, while ignoring the fat juicy coconuts bobbing off across the sea to some far distant shore. This bill and this lack of revenue focus, this squeezing of ordinary Australians and ignoring of fat Australians and foreign leeches, would be the stuff of a banana republic Bgrade movie plot were it not so serious. And, to top off this stupidity, the government is now talking about changing the rules by increasing the age at which you can access your superannuation. As far as I know, the average age of death for Australian males is somewhere in the mid-70s and it is a bit higher for women. You do not have to be an actuary to work out that there will be many people who will die before they enjoy their money, or what is left of it. While this new tax will apply to many wealthy people-to whom a 15 per cent tax might be neither here nor there and they will fringe benefit their way out of it anyway-its cost will be indirectly borne across the board. Therefore, such a change sends a worrying message out to all fund users, and not just the rich, that money put aside for retirement is now fair game for this and subsequent governments. How are workers to know that the goal posts will not be shifted again, and again, and again? Indeed, it is hard to imagine that by the year 2020, when there will be an estimated $2,000 billion under the management of super funds, whichever government is in power will not be trying to get its hands on a proportion of such a perceived goldmine. But I suggest it is a fool's gold because taxing retirees-not the big end of town as the Treasurer suggests; I am talking about the small business operator whose letter I quoted-will erode their self-sufficiency at the very time they will constitute a huge fraction of our population: 24 per cent of our population over 60 by the year 2020. Such uncertainty could only make voluntary contributions to superannuation a less attractive alternative, which is worrying because the current levels of compulsory super are inadequate in themselves. Rather than implementing measures which create uncertainty and make voluntary superannuation a less attractive alternative, the government should be looking at ways of making it more certain and more attractive. The level of awareness in superannuation in the general community is also worrying. I believe there is a real need for the government to assist in educating the public about the need for superannuation and why it is compulsory. As I commenced my comments with reference to the Treasurer and his recent admission that what he had called a surcharge was in fact a tax, I think it is appropriate to end with that, because from my perspective that is the foundation of all the problems. If the surcharge is simply an additional tax, the government should swallow its pride and admit it has broken its election promise of no new taxes. If the Treasury or the Treasurer want more taxes, let them look elsewhere because that source of income is there. It just takes a bit of courage to go after it. Incidentally, as these bills also apply to Commonwealth and thus parliamentary superannuation, let me make it clear that I have no problem with a reduction in my parliamentary superannuation benefits, should I survive the period required to derive any substantial benefit from them. I firmly believe the current arrangements for politicians, the size of payouts and the ability to access them before retirement age, like the travel allowance payment system, send the wrong message to the tax paying public and are morally wrong. I hope the message from the Senate to this House tonight seeking a tabling of House of Representatives allowances is treated with the respect it deserves and is put on the Notice Paper. As I applaud any taxing regime that will restore equity to the tax system and ensure everyone pays their fair share of taxes, I find for the reasons outlined this proposed legislation is full of contradictions and in need of revision or it will lead to a mass exodus from superannuation at a time when Australia needs more, not less, national savings-savings that can and should be targeted at national investment projects.",115
203,Mr ROBERT BROWN,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Like most members of the opposition, I find it quite disturbing to be involved in this debate on superannuation. Let me say that there are a number of points just made by the member for Calare (Mr Andren) with which I very much agree. We are dealing now essentially with the core bill, the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997, and of course another half a dozen items of legislation which are related to that bill and form a necessary part of the introduction of this package. The member for Calare suggested that by the year 2020 it is possible that acquisitive governments will look at the very large sums of superannuation funds that will be available and perhaps expropriate those funds for their own purpose. Let me say it has already happened because the provision of the former Labor government-the method of adopting that second tranche of the proposed tax cutswas going to ensure that the second tranche of the proposed tax cuts would find its way the into the superannuation entitlements of workers at the time they retired. Of course, the present government has now indicated, despite the fact that it gave a very firm indication that it would honour and pursue that particular proposal of the former Labor government, that it will not do that. So those funds, to which the member for Cal are made reference, are funds which the present government has its greedy eyes on already and is taking advantage of them. The member for Calare also said that this surcharge is a tax, that it should be recognised as a tax, that it should be treated as a tax and that, if it were, it could be dealt with a lot more efficiently. He was perfectly correct in that observation as well. If there is any item of public policy about which the present government will become more and more discredited, it is quite clearly in this area of superannuation. This government has become a government of gimmicks: work for the dole and the Green Corps and the comments that were made during that farcical exercise earlier today that we call question time when increasingly we are getting government members acting like clowns. I know there was sometimes cntIclsm before about the number of questions asked during question time when Labor was in government, but at least the questions were answered. The former Prime Minister took advantage of the opportunity as well to make some justified comments about members of the front bench of the then opposition, the coalition opposition, but when he answered those questions he answered them with substance. We did not have him acting the clown. In fact, I am not going to dwell too much on this, but I am starting to wonder whether I will continue to come to question time-and I have been here for 17 years. When the present Treasurer (Mr Costello) answers a question seriously and sensiblyand I hope he or his advisers are listeninghe can answer it well; but with this buffoonery, that he is hoping will masquerade as an effective presentation of public policy, he does himself no credit. I urge him to become a little more serious and not act the clown. This approach of the present government to superannuation, which is represented by this collection of bills, reflects as well the coalition's lack of commitment to superannuation. We know that when the Labor government came in in 1983, for example, there were only about 40 per cent of all Australian employees covered by superannuation. It is now over 90 per cent. There were about 24 per cent of women employees covered by superannuation; it is now 85 per cent. That did not come about just fortuitously; it came about as a result of deliberate, intelligent, sensible public policy being introduced by the government over those years in order to ensure that two things eventuated. The first one was that there would be adequate provision made for retirement incomes of people in a country which demographically was growing older and in which there was an increasing proportion of people finding themselves in the retirement age group. The second objective was to use the superannuation system and the sensible provision for retirement incomes of Australians as a means by which Australia's national savings could be increased. There are three ways in which that has already been attacked by this present government. The first one was the one I have just referred to in reference to some comments by the member for Cal are, the fact that the government has abandoned its own undertaking to pursue the second tranche of the former Labor government's tax reductions which were to be fed into superannuation. The second one was to allow low income earners in Australia to opt out completely from the superannuation arrangements and the third one was this present one, this tax provision which is masquerading as a surcharge. There have been other attacks as well made on superannuation including the fact that the government now will be requiring people to start drawing on their superannuation retirement entitlement from about the age of 55. Superannuation now and in future will be substituting for sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and disability payments as well. So superannuation is not being used by this government as a form of retirement income; it is being used by this government not only, as the member for Cal are suggested may be happening at some time in the next century, as a source of revenue and as a budget balancing device but, increasingly, superannuation is being used to replace other forms of welfare payments for people over 55. This government also is going to allow low income employees to opt out of superannuation arrangements. Instead, those low income employees are going to be encouraged to pocket the money, upon which they will be taxed. So those low income employees who at the invitation of the government may opt out, will not be better off; they will be worse off. Not only will they be worse off today; they will be worse off in the future as well in that period of time in their later lives when they are retired and for which there should be increasing provision made now by them, by government and by employers. The government is using superannuation as a vehicle to enable it to increase tax on higher income earners-and that is the purpose of this package of bills we are considering at the present time. It is also using superannuation for other types of purposes like ingratiating itself with the banking industry by allowing banks to provide low growth, low return retirement savings accounts so that employees can be up to $200,000 worse off with their accumulated retirement entitlements over their working lives. We know now that there will be increasing attacks on superannuation in the May budget. There is a great deal of justified apprehension on the part of the community generally about the possibilities. All of this represents a lack of commitment on the part of the present government towards superannuation and towards the encouragement of national savings. There are a number of very serious individual things which are wrong with this legislation. The first deficiency-and people have repeatedly made this point-in this legislation is that the legislation has been designed as complex as it is simply because the government refuses to go back on an ironclad guarantee that it gave that it would not increase tax. The government is increasing tax; it is increasing tax on those people whose taxable income is in excess of $70,000 a year. I simply ask: why doesn't the government own up to it? Who does the government really think it is fooling? It has not fooled itself; it has not fooled the opposition. I will present two comments that have been made. The Australian Financial Review on 13 March, in an editorial, said: The justification for the Government's superannuation 'surcharge' - to reduce the generosity of tax concessions to the better-off-is commendable. The editorial goes on: But the real motive-to deliver a quick revenueraising fix on the Budget deficit without appearing to tax anyone-inevitably has led to a cock-eyed compromise. The Australian Financial Review identifies it as a tax. The government knows it is a tax. The community knows it is a tax. We know it is a tax. The Australian on 11 March this year said: The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has offered to consider changes to the $500 million-a-year Budget taxemphasis on the word 'tax'on the superannuation of high-income earners as pressure builds on the Government to recast the entire policy. Everyone knows it is a tax. If the government acknowledged it was a tax, it would have been able to introduce it in a much less complex way, a much more efficient way, a much less costly way and it would not find itself in the position where it is in effect launching an attack on superannuation to achieve objectives which have nothing particularly to do with superannuation. If we need any evidence that it is a tax, let us examine the following factors. It will be assessed by the Australian Taxation Office. It will be collected by the superannuation provider and remitted to the Australian Taxation Office. It will not be hypothecated for any reason; it will simply flow like any other tax into consolidated revenue. In the first year it is going to raise $434 million. That is going to rise in the third year to over $500 million. That is almost $1.5 billion in ordinary government taxation revenue over the three years. But the government claims it is not a tax. That itself impinges on and defects the government's credibility that it believes it can continue to claim this is simply a surcharge and not a tax when everyone knows that it is a tax and everyone knows it is being introduced for tax purposes. The simple reason it is being introduced is to increase the tax on higher income earners in order to raise about $500 million a year to feed directly into the government budget. As I indicated, the chief reason for that was simply that the government had given an ironclad guarantee that it would not increase tax. It fools no-one. Obviously, all it intends to do is to supplement its revenue and to cover its outlays in any way possible. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will recall recently that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was at least honest enough to admit that, as far as the government was concerned, the Medicare levy has nothing to do with health. He said that the Medicare levy is simply a revenue raising device. That is not the way we saw it, but that is the way they see it, and the minister for health was sufficiently honest to recognise that and to admit to it. In an unguarded moment on the John Laws program on 26 February the Treasurer, in reference to this so-called surcharge that he denies now is a tax, said: ... the tax that is collected on employer contributions will be 30% rather than 15%. In another unguarded moment, he responded to Pru Goward on Radio National on 12 March with these words: So this is nothing new that we're introducing in the sense of the contributions taxagain with emphasis on the word 'tax'. He said: It's been operating for quite some time. Today during question time the Treasurer, in connection with the former government's proposal for the payment of that second tranche of the proposed tax concessions to be paid into superannuation, gave an example of what he considered to be a very complex arrangement for that process to be carried out. The complexity of this proposal, which this government has adopted simply because it insists on calling a tax a surcharge, is very similar. People who examine what the Treasurer said at question time today, with the necessary processes which are built into these arrangements, will recognise the point that I am making at the present time. If they were prepared to admit that this so called surcharge is in fact a tax, all they would need to do would be to have the employer place all the superannuation contributions on the employee's group certificate, which is a very simple process. Secondly, the Taxation Office would match the superannuation contributions against the employee's taxable income and determine the superannuation tax liability. Thirdly, and finally, the taxpayer would be advised of the superannuation tax liability and could decide then how he or she would pay that liability. The advantage of that is that it would be transparent, it would be less costly, it would be more efficient, it would be simpler and it would apply only to those employees at whom this tax impost is directed-that is, those employees who earn $70,000 or more in taxable income. It is a tax. If it were treated as a tax, the superannuation fund would not have to collect the liability from the contributor's account and thus reduce his or her cover. The contributor could opt to pay the tax themselves and retain the higher value of their cover rather than have it just debited against their entitlement. Thus, the advantage to national savings would also be retained. This government is prepared to sacrifice all of those things simply because it wants to claim that the tax it is imposing is not a tax, because it said before the election that it would not introduce any new taxes or increase taxes. As I said, it is unnecessarily complex, it is cumbersome, it is inefficient and it is costly. In addition to that, it is estimated that it will cost about $100 million to set up the cumbersome reporting system, and then the annual ongoing operating costs are estimated to be another $30 million every year. Those costs will represent a charge against every fund member of every retirement income arrangement. It is estimated that only about 350,000 high income superannuation contributors will be caught by this proposal350,000 who earn $70,000 or more in taxable income a year. But how many accounts will have to be separately assessed to determine who those 350,000 are? About 16 million accounts will have to be assessed to see whether or not the people against whom those accounts act as a credit are people who are caught in this net. As I say, there will only be 350,000 of them. So, in effect, all of them will have to be assessed to see whether or not they are included. The incredible thing about this is that it is simply not necessary. If the purpose is to collect more revenue from high income earners-and it clearly is, and I have no concerns about that it would be easier, more efficient, more equitable and less stupid to build it into the existing tax arrangements. There is also the need to supply a tax file number to a superannuation fund. That is a serious invasion of privacy. It should not be necessary, and would not be necessary, if this so-called surcharge were treated as a tax, which it is. All of those matters to which I have made reference, and others, simply reflect an appalling approach on the part of this coalition government to social policy, to public policy. It represents, as far as superannuation is concerned, another vandalistic attack on the whole principle and structure, purpose and arrangements, of superannuation. This government is becoming a government of gimmicks. The Australian people will increasingly become aware of that. The Australian people will be particularly concerned about this government's approach to superannuation, because not only is it relevant and of enormous importance to Australia's capacity to generate savings but also it is relevant to Australia's capacity to generate appropriate retirement income arrangements for Australian employees.

204,Mr WILTON,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"The assertion of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that Labor will vote against these measures relating to superannuation in this chamber or in the other place is false. We will not vote against these measures either here or in the other place. They are cumbersome, they are inefficient and they are indeed costly. That not to say that in voting for them overall we will agree with the method chosen by the government. Nor do we rule out moving some amendments in the other place to improve the administrative arrangements, in particular, by which this tax will be imposed and applied. In summary, those whose taxable income plus deductible superannuation contributions less deductions is more than $70,000 per year will pay a tax on their deductible superannuation contributions of one percentage point for each $1,000 over $70,000. The maximum surcharge will be some 15 per cent for those earning more than $85,000. As well, people who do not provide their tax file number to their super fund may also be hit with a surcharge. Dr George Collins, the general manager of investments at the financial planner Retirelnvest, outlined this tax in the Weekend Review supplement to the Financial Review of March 21 1997: ""You could be sailing along thinking you will be exempt from the surcharge until you find yourself in a position where other bits and pieces you might get during the year-some of which are expected, some of which are unexpected-might push you over the limit,"" he says. If employees switch jobs, resign or retire late in the financial year, they may mind that payments for annual leave, long service and any withdrawals of superannuation which contain a significant postJune 1983 component may cause their adjusted taxable income to rise above $70,000 per annum. Dr Collins goes on to say: If your adjusted taxable income is above the threshold, there is nothing you can do about it. You can't use imputation credits or anything similar which you can use with contribution tax, because it isn't a tax but a surcharge. Certainly, you will find some people will look at mechanisms by which they can legitimately claim significant tax deductions to bring their income below the level. The industry is already working on investment opportunities to provide this. The Australian Financial Review, in an editorial which was submitted to the House by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) a moment ago, has quite clearly defined this surcharge as a tax. In fact that editorial, of 13 March, said that the government have been caught with 'their pants down over their is poorly designed efforts to squeeze $500 million from the $7 billion in tax concessions that are weighted towards high income individuals.' The editorial says: They will remain uncomfortably exposed because of the demands to balance the Budget and their self-imposed inertia. This proposed 15 per cent tax on high income earners and, indeed, low income earners as it turns out, is set to be one of a growing list of dismal policy failures proffered by this government. It is also believed by those on this side that the new tax is likely to raise perhaps something like less than half of the projected $500 million a year. On top of that, it will still fail to deliver anything like a fair and equitable superannuation system. The contention of those on this side of the House is that this surcharge is set up to be an absolute flop. The state governments will not collect it, and accountancy firms, as I have just mentioned, are already examining methods for high income earners to get around it. The Institute of Chartered Accountants indicates in its survey that nearly 75 per cent of its member accountants will advise their clients to move away from superannuation into other more lucrative forms of investment. The indications are that the tax, even if it is constitutionally valid-and many speakers before me this evening have raised the question of the contentions of Rose QC-would probably collect less than half of the projected $500 million. After taking away an exorbitant $100 million in administration costs annually, as the member for Charlton again has said, the tax looks extremely inefficient, cumbersome and costly. The 15 per cent tax fails to deliver anything like a fair and equitable superannuation system because it does not reduce the extremely excessive tax burden faced by low income earners with superannuation. Under the government's superannuation tax proposals, an employee earning $60,000 per annum will still receive a 33c in the dollar tax break on superannuation while an employee earning considerably less, say $20,000, will get just 6c in the dollar. That will be on top of a reduction in the investment income of their superannuation accounts as the funds absorb the $100 million cost of collecting this 15 per cent superannuation tax. These measures are simply bad policy. They are an absolute disaster for all members of superannuation funds and for the industry itself. Mr Costello, the Treasurer, pretends that only high income earners will be adversely affected by these bills. Nothing could be further from the truth. All members of superannuation funds will, inevitably, be confronted with higher fees and charges and, hence, have their final superannuation benefits slashed. So the general claim of the government about insulating middle and low income earners is an absolute furphy. It is simply a farce. Ironically these measures, as proposed, will significantly increase the complexity of calculations for tax payable by superannuation funds while simultaneously boosting the income of unrelated professions, notably actuaries, accountants and financial advisers, especially in the area of remuneration packaging advice. Those who would be hit are notably, as I have said, high, middle and low income earners. It was announced in the last budget that some 355,000 high income earners would be affected, this being the biggest revenue raiser in the budget, which was projected to return some $1.5 billion over the next three years commencing this financial year. Collection is purposely via superannuation funds rather than, as it should be and as the member for Charlton has again quite correctly said, via the existing tax system through an administratively efficient group certificate mechanism. Opposing this particular surcharge-or tax, more to the point-are a range of financial industry and industrial heavyweights. Numbered among those are the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Business Council, the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. All believe that the collection method for this tax will be inefficient and expensive. This is compounded by the fact that states such as New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia say that they will be unlikely to collect the surcharge on behalf of public servants, judges and politicians, claiming it will either be in breach of the constitution or will cost them additional money to collect which, again, will come off the final benefit received by the potential recipients. Superannuation giants such as Jacques Martin and AMP have warned that failure by low income earners to provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds could result in as many as two million people being unfairly walloped by this tax. The government has already had to exempt Federal Court judges from this new 15 per cent tax due to constitutional issues that arise out of section 72. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer made no mention at all of that in his budget speech of last year. Recently, during deliberations by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on this tax, the states made it known that they continued to hold a number of constitutional doubts relating to the way the Commonwealth can levy taxes on the states. The situation may well arise where public sector employees would not be required to pay the surcharge. Up to, and possibly in excess of, 25,000 state public sector employees may be allowed to avoid the superannuation surcharge while Commonwealth employees, their counterparts within the federal jurisdiction, and private sector employees would be required to pay the 15 per cent tax. Even if the Commonwealth were able to somehow convince the states, by convoluted and contorted legal argument, to legislate in their own houses of parliament to collect this 15 per cent tax, it would be very doubtful to say the least. The constitutional questions relating to both sections 114 and 51(ii) would, no doubt, prevail. The design of this surcharge is intended to levy a tax on the individual on the basis, as I have said before, of annual adjustable taxable income and then to collect the tax through a third party, notably the superannuation fund itself. During the aforementioned hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, evidence was presented from the Business Council of Australia by Dennis Rose QC, a name that has been mentioned on several occasions in this place during this debate. Rose QC is the former Chief Counsel for the Attorney-General's Department. The advice that he presented to the committee related to section 51 (ii). Whilst he was in broad agreement with the states regarding the issue of tax discrimination he presented an argument to suggest that the entire superannuation tax transcended the parameters of the existing taxation powers. He believed that it is beyond the parameters of the Commonwealth's powers and the tax is different from the 50 per cent contribution tax which currently applies to contributions made by employers on behalf of employees to their superannuation funds. This contribution tax is levied against the fund and is on a different plain paid for by that fund. The QC's opinion perhaps best described as buttressed by the Attorney-General's Department where, as I have said, he was the former Chief General Counsel has completely altered the public's perception of this surcharge. In fact no longer does the public debate go to the question of the surcharge. The debate now goes to the question of the complex and costly collection arrangements for this tax. This debate is perhaps only understood by relatively few people in the superannuation industry. It is now simply a matter of: is it law or is it not? Those of us on this side of the House would contend that it is now not valid law. If the advice of Rose QC turns out to be correct, as we on this side suggest it may, and the whole scheme is found to be unconstitutional then no revenue will have been collected, but the enormous implementation costs will have been spent by the industry by that time. On that basis, we in the opposition would contend that the Treasurer would be duty bound to resign. That brings me to the question of the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this fairly scandalous exercise. His role is one of ongoing dishonesty. He is refusing to be honest with the electorate and confront the electorate at large with the views proffered by the Financial Review and other notable journals in this country which quite clearly have in their editorial submitted that it is a tax and not a surcharge. The Prime Minister does not want to tell the electorate that he has broken one of his cherished core promises not to introduce any new taxes. That is something, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said earlier this evening, he pounded the opposition with earlier this year that postbudget he would not break this core promise by introducing a new tax. That is what this 15 per cent so-called surcharge is. It is a new tax. It is a tax on individuals which is calculated on the basis of their taxable income and their superannuation contributions. The government do not want it to be transparent and therefore they are requiring superannuation funds to pay it on behalf of individuals. If the funds paid it on behalf of individuals then it is my understanding that the government believe that people will not notice this new tax-a new tax described as a tax by stealth. It is a surcharge masquerading as nothing more or less than a tax. Due to the government's dishonesty, arrogance, incompetence and a range of other adjectives that have been used this evening in describing the handling of this policy program, it has placed its entire $1.5 billion worth of estimated revenue in doubt. As the member for Moore (Mr Filing) quite simply said, this is a transfer from savings to revenue. On that basis, it is certainly unwise and unsound economics. It could potentially create an additional new Costello crater in the budget bottom line, already widening that which he has exposed in recent months. In concluding, can I say that this legislation is perhaps unique in the political history our country. It combines an absolute, blatant repudiation of a cast iron election promise, which was not to introduce any new tax, with a steadfast refusal to, in any reasonable acknowledge this breach. It imposes on the government and superannuation funds massive blow-outs and increases in compliance It imposes upon superannuation members a reduction in benefits and it completely alienates the superannuation industry, many members of which are members of ASFA. It also alienates accountants, financial advisers and actuaries. It is with a view to keeping these people side that the opposition will look to move this government. amendments in the Senate not only in their interests but also in the interests of low and middle income earners who have been parwiII ticularly slugged by this iniquitous, some, costly and inefficient charge. I urge those in the other place when confronted with any amendments that are proposed by the opposition to support them wholeheartedly. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived. Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (10.29 p.m.)I think it is fair to say that any quick browse of the newspapers over recent weeks will available show that this budget initiative of this governand ment has proved to be a bit of a disaster. the hour is late and as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has very effectively blown out of the water any credibility that might have been contained within this packnuation? age of bilIs or any credibility it enjoyed, I think it is only necessary for me to be very brief. This package of superannuation surcharge bills is really an extraordinary one and has attracted the anger and ire of all those in this country that know anything at all about superannuation and taxation, including a few people from the government's own back bench. The government's package is extraordinary because I think it breaks just about every rule of good public policy. I want to run through just a few of those. First of all, the package seeks to deceiveof something the Australian people, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, do not appreciate very much at all. Secondly, its constitutionality is, at very best, doubtful. The way, member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) and a number of speakers before him have made reference to that constitutional advice, and I do not costs. need to go over it again now. Thirdly, the package clearly and blatantly ""breaks a number of pre-election and postelection promises, including one that is postbudget. The biggest promise of all that it breaks is that ironclad commitment from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no new on taxes will be introduced in the first year of Fourthly, the package is inequitable and hit many more people than it purports to cumbertarget-those people earning more than $70,000 per annum. Finally, it undermines one of the most critical strategies for overcoming this balance of payments problemthat is, the strategy to boost national savings. Already tax experts are advising their clients, as the member for Isaacs has pointed out, to seek alternatives to superannuation as an investment strategy. Superannuation was once something only to those working in the public sector those chosen few in the private sector on As very high incomes. That was the situation when the now Prime Minister was Treasurer of this nation. We ask: what were those chosen few paying in terms of tax on superanIt was around a maximum of three might have per cent on lump sum payouts. The former Labor government, in contrast, successfully turned all of that around. Through the award and the superannuation guarantee systems it made superannuation available to all working Australians and, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, was about to do much more. But at the same time the former Labor government turned the tax arrangements for superannuation on their head leaving in place sufficient incentive to invest in superannuation, to invest in our public infrastructure, to invest in our nation and in our nation's children, while at the same time making or leaving the system equitable. The former Treasurer, now dressed in PM's clothing. wants to tum all that around and vandalise the system for basically two reasons: firstly, because he can claim no credit for a very good system; and, secondly, because he has some budgetary problems and some promises he is unable to keep. This package of bills will ensure that while coalminers in my electorate, who work long and hard on unusual and difficult shifts and often in dangerous conditions, will have no choice but to pay the superannuation charge---or the superannuation tax, which I should call itwhite-collared workers with the capacity to access the right advice will simply avoid the tax by rearranging their superannuation or remuneration package circumstances. Make no mistake about it: we are not just talking about high fliers. Many of my constituents who work those long hours in coal mines under difficult circumstances earn well in excess of $70,000. Do not let us delude ourselves that these people are well off. They are ordinary working Australians who put in a hard day's work for decent reward. They do not deserve this extra tax slug, particularly they were promised prior to the election that they would be safe or quarantined from any future new taxes. It will mean tens of thousands of ordinary Australians who earn less than $70,000 but do not appreciate the importance of submitting their tax file number to their fund manager will also be hit by the superannuation tax. That will mean that all fund members, regardless of their means, will be hit by this tax due to the fact that they will all share the burden of the astronomical administrative cost that is attached to the scheme. The legislation represents a new red tape burden on Australia's small business operators-another broken promise. The package of bills and all the rhetoric from the other side that has accompanied it epitomise the dishonesty of this Prime Minister and his government. I want to say something about that. While I do not like to admit it or recognise it, it is a simple fact that within a large section of the Australian community there is a very strong perception that this Prime Minister is a very honest man when it comes to public policy. I do not doubt that perception exists. But I also want to say this: any popularity this government enjoys is underpinned by that perception. That perception is the only thing holding this government together. I want to assure the Prime Minister that that perception is changing very, very quickly and it will continue to change. As I move around my electorate I feel the change and it will continue to change as all these budget initiatives begin to bite. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, many of these budget initiatives have not even taken effect yet and therefore have not come close to biting out there in the Australian electorate. I can assure the Prime Minister that, when the initiatives begin to bite, those polls, which are causing him to be so cocksure at the moment, are going to change very quickly. This package of bills before the House tonight I think epitomises that public policy dishonesty. I commend to the House the amendments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr as Gareth Evans), which I think very adequately highlight that point. Debate (on motion by Mr Warwick Smith) adjourned. NEW BUSINESS AFTER 11 P.M. Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith)-by leave-agreed to: That standing order 103 (new business) be suspended for this sitting.

205,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (10.38 p.m.)-I would like to conclude this superannuation debate and go over some of the issues which have been raised during the debate. First of all, in regard to the application to the states of the constitutionally protected schemes, the current surcharge bills cannot apply to constitutionally protected schemes operating in some states. The government is consulting with the states to achieve a fair and workable outcome in respect of these schemes. We are confident about the constitutionality of this legislation. Secondly, in regard to alternate collection mechanisms, the proposed mechanism, outlined best in detail in chapter 6 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, is as follows: superannuation contribution details would be provided via group certificates prepared by Employers; contribution details would be included in annual income tax returns lodged; the ATO would levy surcharge as part of the annual assessment; the employees would meet the surcharge by- offsetting the surcharge against any tax refund due; - paying the surcharge directly; or - passing the liability to the superannuation funds to make the payment. I note that this proposal has a number of serious problems, indicating that the proposal has not been adequately considered. Employers are not in possession of all the data necessary to be given to employees in their group certificate. Employers would need to get information from the superannuation fund, for example, the exact details of the superannuation fund-its name and tax file numbertogether with the member's superannuation account number. If the employer does not have the details of the contributions, the funds would have to supply these details. Under current law, employers must give group certificates to employees by 14 July to avoid interfering with income tax lodgement cycles. However, funds asked for extension of time to report to the Australian Taxation Office beyond 31 August, as originally envisaged, as this date was claimed to be difficult to meet. The funds now have until 15 December to report to the Australian Taxation Office-in the first year of operation. How are employers supposed to meet an earlier date? In addition, employers using defined benefit funds would be unlikely to have an actuary calculate the surchargeable contributions prior to 14 July each year. The employer's group certificate would need to include the amount of the superannuation contributions. Funds will have to report surcharge information to the Australian Taxation Office for compliance purposes. This means that the mechanism would not remove the superannuation funds from the reporting requirements. The costs of changing employer payroll systems and tax agent systems would be significant. Proponents of the alternative measure claim that it would be cheaper. How can that be so when it will involve 900,000 employers and 10 million taxpayers? The third point raised was in regard to advance instalment. The advance instalment is raised in advance of the actual surcharge assessment, not in advance of the contributions being made. For example, contributions received from 20 August 1996 to 30 June 1997 will have surcharge assessment raised in the 1997-98 financial year. The advance instalment payment on 15 June 1998-only 15 days before the end of the financial yearrelates to contributions received in the 199798 financial year. Credit of the advance instalment is applied against the actual surcharge assessments, which will arise in the 1998-99 financial year. The fourth point raised was in regard to revenue concerns. Revenue aspects of the bill are as follows: 1997-98, $480 million; 199899, $470 million, and 1999-2000, $530 million. These figures were reflected in the budget statements. There is no missing revenue. The figure of $434 million in the financial impact statement of the explanatory memoranda refers to the estimated surcharge liability in respect of contributions for the 1997-98 financial year rather than the estimated budget receipts, which I have just reiterated. The fifth point raised was tax file numbers. Superannuation funds are now collecting tax file numbers from members. They have been doing this under a new law which came into effect on 16 February 1997. The Australian Taxation Office will be undertaking a range of measures to minimise the number of people who will have the surcharge imposed just because they did not quote their tax file number to their fund. These include: data matching, direct communication to people who have not quoted a tax file number, notices in Tax Pack and information which will be provided by the Australian Taxation Office for inclusion with annual superannuation fund statements, reminders on income tax assessment notices, assessments delayed until 15 May 1998; and, lastly, superannuation providers will be allowed to advise the Australian Taxation Office of tax file numbers received after the 15 December reporting date. This means that members will have until May 1998 to provide their tax file number to avoid a surcharge assessment. Where the taxpayer subsequently quotes their tax file number, the surcharge will be refunded. The surcharge bill allows funds to obtain tax file numbers through an 'opt-out' method. If an employer has a person's tax file number for superannuation purposes, the employer can advise the employee that they will pass on their tax file unless the employee objects. The employee has 30 days to make this decision. Lastly, the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised a question towards the end of his speech. He asked whether the proposed legislation suggests that the super tax will be applied to the proceeds of the sale of a small business if it exceeds the threshold amount. The answer to that is no. 10 finalising this summary, I makes these the points about this legislation: this is an equity measure; it is about a surcharge on people with incomes of $70,000-plus. As a government, we believe that this is an important measure to bring about increased equity within the superannuation and taxation systems. Not only that: it is still a very attractive investment-contrary to what people have said-and we believe that people will continue to invest in superannuation. It is not, as some people have indicated, now an unattractive way to invest. I would like to conclude on that and to thank those members who participated in this debate.

206,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.12 p.m.)-There are quite a significant number of government amendments to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997.

I present the explanatory memorandum. Amendments agreed to. Clauses, as amended, agreed to. Clause 34. Amendment (by Mr Miles) proposed: (26) Clause 34, page 38 (lines 21 to 28), omit the clause.",131
208,Mr GARETH EVANS,AYES,"I would like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has to say on the subject of clause 34, which is now being omitted from the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill. The only explanation being given is that this amendment to omit the particular clause removes any doubt about the constitutional validity of the bill. I make the point that an explanation is required from the government in this respect because this, of course, is the clause that led Dennis Rose QC to put into the public domain his legal opinion saying that as a consequence of the existence of this particular clause the whole bill was in fact unconstitutional. Without going into the detail of his opinion, the gist of it was that clause 34 as it is presently drafted operates in the context of a bill which imposes the tax on the provider, that is, the superannuation fund, but clause 34 makes it possible for the provider to reduce any benefits accruing to or for the member by way of recompensing itself, in effect, from the member. It is probably easier simply to read clause 34: Superannuation provider may reduce member's benefits on account of payment of surcharge or advance payment If a superannuation provider makes a payment under this Act in discharge of a liability of the provider for surcharge or advance payment on a member's surchargeable contributions, then, despite anything in any trust instrument, contract or other document or any legislation, the provider may reduce any benefits accruing to or for the member after 20 August 1996 by the amount paid. What clause 34 is doing is thus conferring an authority upon the provider to reduce the benefits accruing to the member-in other words, conferring an authority on the provider to recompense itself for the payment of the surcharge by way of collection from the individual member. What Mr Rose QC says is that this is beyond the taxation power of the Commonwealth because what you've got in the bill as a whole is the imposition of tax on person A, that is, the provider, but a requirement in clause 34 for another person, person B, that is, the contributing member, to actually pay the amount of the tax to the Commonwealth. What the government has done, confronted with this particular constitutional opinion of Mr Rose, is to purport to solve the problem by removing the clause altogether from the bill. I cannot forbear from making the point that in doing so, of course, the government is spectacularly at odds with the Treasurer's own assertions when this matter was first raised that there was no problem at all constitutionally with the bill. When the point was raised by Mr Rose in public and this proposition was put to the Treasurer he said, for example, on ABC radio AM on 12 March: It's certainly not the advice that we've been Our own lawyers have obviously had a look at this. They were aware of the point that's been raised by Mr Rose. They drafted the Bill to come within the terms of the constitutional power. So they're not surprised by this; it's not the view they take. Mr Costello would not then or subsequently release his own purported advice on this subject. The truth of the matter is that this amounts to ""a concession-a confession, if you like-by the government that they were in error on this, as in so many other things in the drafting of this particular bill. What we have in this particular clause is a confession of that error of a most humiliating kind, albeit tucked away in an otherwise fairly impenetrable list of amendments and with an utterly non-helpful explanatory memorandum just making the point that there is a constitutional issue here. I finally make the point, however, that I have real doubts and the opposition has real doubts as to what the workability of the bill will now be in the absence of clause 34. Can the parliamentary secretary advise us how many trust deeds around the place at the moment do in fact make provision in the absence of a clause like clause 34 for recompense to the fund from the member's contributions? Is it the case that that is a universal state of affairs, in which case clause 34 is genuinely redundant and the bill can do without it? Or is it the case that in the absence of clause 34 there will be quite a number of superannuation funds around the place in respect of which the trustees will not be able to recompense themselves from the individual members, in which case presumably either the trustees individually will bear the pain of this particular tax impost or, alternatively, the fund membership as a whole will somehow, by virtue of its being charged to the fund itself rather than the individual members, have to bear the pain of it, notwithstanding that the tax is only to be imposed on higher income earners? We need some explanation. (Time expired)",132
209,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.19 p.m.)-We have sought the advice of the Attorney-General's Department in regard to the views which Mr Rose has put in regard given. to these matters which have been raised by the opposition spokesman. Our view is that the amended bill cannot be invalidated on the grounds which he has raised. We are confident about that. We are very confident that the amended legislation, with the removal of clause 34 together with other amendments, does cover any concerns about the constitutionality of this legislation. I also make the point that Mr Rose's views as to the effect of clause 34, though, are not conceded, but in any event we believe the alleged problems are removed by the deletion of clause 34. I do not have the exact number of trustees or superannuation providers, but we are confident that the changes that have been made here will make sure that there are no constitutional problems. There are, of course, other legislative instruments available to deal with some of the other issues which the opposition spokesman has raised.",133
210,Mr GARETH EVANS,AYES,"The government says that there are no and were no constitutional problems associated with the existence of clause 34. However, actions speak louder than words and the fact that the government has chosen to delete this clause in its entirety is a fairly spectacular concession, as I said earlier, that there were, in fact, constitutional problems, that they were of considerable magnitude, and that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was misleading this place and the public in suggesting otherwise. This is a rather humiliating retreat we are seeing from the government. That point has been made. Given the lateness of the hour, I am not going to repeat it endlessly but it ought to be noted for the record. But the real point of my intervention-and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is focusing on this now because I am going to ask him again-was to say, 'Setting aside the constitutional problem, is there a practical problem in the workability of the legislation or in the fairness or equity in the operation of the legislation in the absence of clause 34? Can you simply rely on the existence of provisions in trust deeds allowing the superannuation providers to reduce the contributions of the individual contributors? Can you rely on provisions in practice in those trust bills? Are they universal? Are they the case in all existing funds? If you cannot rely on that being the case, will it not be the case that there are another whole set of problems that arise in the operation of the legislation, namely problems arising from the inability of the trust deedsthe inability of the funds themselves, if you like-to recoup from the individual members? Given that you are not talking about an even, across-the-board impost upon contributing members, but that you are talking about an impost that varies with the individual income of the members, it does therefore raise a quite serious practical problem in the fairness, equity and practical working of the funds if, indeed, it is the case in the absence of proposed section 34 that that matter can be attended to. If you say other legislative instruments somewhere will enable the individual members' contributions in effect to be docked in this way to cover the cost of the tax, those other individual legislative provisions would presumably themselves raise constitutional problems. It does not much matter where in the legislation the provision for recompense comes, whether it is in clause 34 or somewhere else in this bill, or whether it is in some other bill. The question is whether the scheme as a whole involves the imposition of a tax on person A but provision for recovery on person B. I think we do need an explanation of whether or not there will be practical problems of this kind. Until we get such an explanation-I won't further pursue the debate tonight-we will certainly be indicating our opposition to the passage of this clause.",134
211,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.24 p.m.)-Very briefly, we do believe it will be able to be applied equitably. We do not have any doubts about that. I can understand the opposition spokesman raising these issues but the advice we have is that it can be applied equitably. We do not believe there will be any problems in that. For your information, there is nothing to stop trust deeds from amending their trusts, which is another aspect to that. Can I just say, coming back to the main point, that we believe it can be applied equitably with the changes and also with the exclusion of clause 34. That is our advice.",134
212,Mr GARETH EVANS,AYES,"One last word on this question: I am not particularly happy with the position that the poor old parliamentary secretary finds himself in. Once again, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has failed to come into this place to argue through the provisions of his own bill. He leaves it to his poor benighted junior to confront the questions that are raised. I make the point that if the government is going to want this measure passed in this form in the Senate it had better come up with a rather better explanation, with the utmost respect to the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), than the one we have heard so far, not just a bland and airy assertion that, yes, it is equitable. We had some bland and airy assertions about the constitutionality of all this from his master, the Treasurer. That was proven to be a totally fraudulent gambit and now, I suspect, there are some undiscovered problems that exist here. We are merely saying that if there is nothing in the trust deed to enable it the trust deed can be fixed. I would like to know how many trust deeds will require that attention before this legislation is practically workable, along with all the other elements of this which make it so obviously and manifestly impracticable and unworkable. In the absence of a satisfactory explanation we indicate that we will be voting against this but, given the lateness of the hour--everyone has probably shot through by now-we will not divide. Clause omitted. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Amendments (by Mr Miles)-by leaveagreed to: (27) Clause 42, page 45 (line 6), omit ""or subsection 8(3), as the case requires"".

NA SURCHARGE IMPOSITION BILL 1997 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 13 February, sector superanon motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Amendment (by Mr Miles) proposed: (1) Page 5 (after line 16), at the end of the Bill, add: 7 Severability If, apart from this section, section 4 would impose in relation to a State, or an authority or officer of a State, a superannuation contributions surcharge the imposition of which in relation to the State, authority or officer would exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, section 4 has effect as if it did not impose that surcharge in relation to the State, authority or officer, as the case may be. 8 Act does not impose tax on property of State (1) Without limiting section 7, this Act impose a tax on property of any kind belonging to a State. (2) In this section: property of any kind belonging to a State has the same meaning as in section 114 of the Constitution. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11.31 p.m.)-After that edifying explanation of what the amendment is all about, might I just rise and say that what it is about-we are told in the explanatory memo and on the face of the clauses-is that there is provision here to ensure that the bill does not impose a tax on any property of a state or impose a superannuation contribution surcharge on a state where this would exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth. What we have here is a situation of the Commonwealth, forced again by constitutional necessity, which was denied again by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his public statements on this when the issue was first raised by the states, retreating and putting in a provision to ensure that a bill which was constitutionally doubtful as written would, in fact, survive constitutional scrutiny. The particular constitutional issue in this case is the applicability of this surcharge legislation to state public servants earning above the $70,000 statutory minimum threshold that has been identified for this policy, of whom it appears there are some 25,000 in the state public sectors. The reason the constitutional problem arises, as this amendment acknowledges, is that it is a source of constitutional difficulty for a piece of taxation legislation to purport to directly tax state property. Here the state property is in the form of superannuation funds. If the legislation was simply left to bite directly upon those superannuation funds without some exemption of provision or without that application being severable, the bill would indeed be unconstitutional. Thus the necessity for this particular amendment. That necessity was not acknowledged by the Treasurer when this matter was first raised publicly. Again, this particular amendment involves something of a humiliating retreat does not for the government in acknowledging that there is yet another problem with this legislation. Here, as elsewhere, this problem only arises because the legislation is constructed in the manic, obsessively complex way that it is-as a tax basically directly on the funds rather than on individuals collected in the ordinary way through individuals' tax returns. If the legislation was constructed in this way-if this surcharge was frankly acknowledged to be a tax on individuals and collected as such through individuals' tax returns-the problem simply would not arise so far as the state public servants or state public sector fund members are concerned. The constitutional problem would not arise any more than it does with any other form of Commonwealth income tax biting on state public servants. That is perfectly constitutional if you are taxing individuals. The problem arises when you tax property-that is, the superannuation funds. We were told by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his wrap-up second reading speech earlier on this evening that the government is consulting with the states to achieve a fair and workable outcome in respect of these schemes. In other words, the Commonwealth is bypassing the legislative route here and is engaged in a familiar exercise in negotiating with the states to try to get them to cough up by other means the amount·of the tax that will be owing if this legislation is passed on the state funds. The likely response of the states to this so far was well articulated by Mr Max Evans, the Minister for Finance in Western Australia, who was reported on 12 March as saying, 'The surcharge is a bad idea. The federal Treasurer should tear it up and start again.' He said that in so far as Western Australia was concerned it was not going to cooperate in raising the super surcharge in the Commonwealth government's scheme. I do not know whether there has been any further advance on that degree of lack of enthusiasm so far as the states in general are concerned, particularly Western Australia. I simply make the point that this is yet another muddle the Commonwealth has got itself into by virtue of this manic insistence on imposing this legislative obligation on the funds rather than on individuals because it wants to pretend that it is not a tax. In the process, you may have the result of 25,000 or so senior state public servants around the country being, in effect, exempted from the operation of the surcharge and thus another level of manifest inequity introduced in this along with the other remaining constitutional problem-that is, the immunisation of Federal Court judges from the application of the tax, again because of the crazy way the thing has been established. There are a number of constitutional problems here which remain to be resolved in negotiation. It is very much up to the Commonwealth to sort that out with the states. There are no particular signs so far of them being able to do that. (Time expired)",134
213,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.36 p.m.)-My understanding is that the discussions with the states are proceeding in an amicable fashion. As people are aware, these clauses will ensure that the bill does not impose a tax on any property of a state or impose a superannuation contribution surcharge on a state where this would exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.

216,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a measure of a democratic society that access to the law is equally available to both the richest and poorest in the land. It is clear from the decision of this government on legal aid that access to the law will be available only to the wealthy. Today I delivered to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams )-and there is a copy of it here-a cheque for $12.56. This cheque was the proceeds of a lamington drive conducted in the IIlawarra by the IIlawarra Friends of Legal Aid. I congratulate all associated with the lamington drive and the thousands of Illawarra residents who signed the petition that I have also presented. It will be a sad day in Australia when we need to conduct lamington drives to protect access to justice for all Australians. It will be an even sadder day when, through this government's stubbornness and its desire to cut and hack into funding for vital community programs, a lamington drive is the only way that Australians, especially the poor and disadvantaged, will be able to protect their interests. The funding cut to legal aid is yet another example of this government's punishment of the poor and disadvantaged and a rewarding of the wealthy in our society. The legal aid funding cut is just another in a very long line of funding cuts in child care, health, education, labour market programs, migrant assistance, public housing and social security. There will have to be many hundreds of thousands of lamington drives conducted in Australia to help save these essential community programs. I have attended two public rallies over the last few weeks in the Illawarra to protest against the legal aid funding cuts which the government, through the Attorney General, stubbornly refuses to reverse. Mr Bob Baldwin-How many larningtons?",138
217,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I have eaten a lot of larningtons and very, very good lamingtons they were too, I might say, hence the weight. The Attorney-General has been placed under pressure from the states and territories. These governments have sought consistently to have this government change its mind and restore the funding for legal aid. But the cuts themselves are misleading because they have been determined by using the 1994-95 figures instead of the 1995-96 figures which ripped $100 million from the legal aid system. The Howard government made a promise at the election that it would maintain funding in real terms. It should be held to account for this promise. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his Attorney-General did not go into the last election saying that to try to save health, education, housing, labour market programs and social security you had to go out and organise the community to hold lamington drives. That was never a promise in the platform. The promises were not made on the ability of people to make and sell, and indeed to eat, lamingtons. The continuation of legal aid funding represents a paltry percentage of total government outlays in the defence of Australia's democratic principles: access to justice, equality before the law, the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair and impartial hearing and the capacity to enforce and uphold civil liberties. Three hundred thousand people in New South Wales have been offered assistance by Legal Aid in community legal centres. I have one excellent centre located at Warrawong in my electorate. If these cuts proceed, 70,000 people will have no access to justice this year, nor the next. On an annual basis, 70,000 people-the weakest people in the community: children, women, the aged, the mentally ill, the disabled and the isolated-in New South Wales alone will all suffer because of this government's stubborn resolve not to ditch an unjustifiable decision. The Attorney General has publicly expressed the opinion that legal aid funding is about Rolls Royce treatment of just a few people. Let us have a look at this view. Of more than 82,000 applications for legal aid in respect to crime charges, only 4,503 proceeded to hearing, 4,001 cases were finalised for less than $5,000, with less than one per cent of cases costing more than $30,000 at trial or hearing. It is time that the lamington drive platform of the Howard government is put to rest. The community should not have to sell these items at the local stall on a weekend to help save vital community services. I should not have to present a cheque, symbolic or not, to the Attorney-General in a campaign to try to get him to change his mind to reverse the legal aid funding cuts. Once again, like so many others before me, I call on the Attorney General to reverse these savage cuts. Aboriginal Heritage Protection",139
218,Mrs STONE,ADJOURNMENT,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 very properly aims to protect significant Aboriginal places and items that could be endangered. For example, perhaps a bulldozer might be inadvertently about to push down a tree with a carving on it or it could be that some items are going to be sold outside of Australia. It is a very important act. In 1987 there was an amendment to the act which brought in a Victorian section: part I1A. This contains provisions quite different from those applying to the other states. For example, it includes inspectors who are given delegated authority under the act, as well as a three-part protection process. The intention of the act is that there be an emergency declaration made for up to 30 days. That is followed up by a temporary declaration if the problem persists and, finally, a permanent protection is put in place. Under stages 2 and 3, the permanent and temporary declarations, there is a right for the affected parties to have arbitration and appeal-and of course that is only right and proper. If it is a permanent declaration, compensation is available for the affected parties because it could involve some loss of property or amenity to them. All of that is absolutely reasonable, and the act is, as I said before, significant and very important for Australian Aboriginal heritage protection. The trouble is that there is a drafting glitch. There is a time bomb buried in section 21C(3)(a) of part IIA, the Victorian section. It is totally unintended, but it allows the Aboriginal inspectors who declare an emergency situation to in fact spin over that emergency declaration stage 1 time and time again, making it so that those affected cannot appeal. There is no arbitration mechanism. The affected parties are stopped from carrying out any activities or planning over the area placed under the emergency declaration. This is of extreme importance to me at the moment in the electorate of Murray. At Kow Swamp a local cheese factory, Kraft, intended to build a pipeline to dispose of some of their wash water. They doubled the size of their factory recently and invested many millions of dollars. That factory employs some 250 people. It is the only industry in the area. A big irrigation area is dependent on the manufacturing carried out by that factory. It exports most of its product. It is of great significance in my local area. There are also many farmers in that area, of course. On 2 August, Kraft received an emergency declaration under this act from a local Aboriginal inspector representing the Yorta Yorta people saying that they were to stop any plans to build this pipeline to a property that they had acquired at the other end of Kow Swamp. At the same time, some farmers received the same declaration saying that they were to remove their cattle from areas of their properti-s and leasehold areas around the lake turthwith or be fined or imprisoned. They were, of course, quite stunned by these moves. They immediately tried to negotiate with the inspector and the Aboriginal community that was represented by the inspector. In fact, so concerned were they that the Victorian state government, who administers this act, conducted a special audit of the heritage values of the area under the emergency declaration, and it has brought down a report which says there are no items of heritage value, no places at risk, in these areas that are under emergency declaration. However, the act is silent on what to do when you have a vexatious situation like this. This emergency declaration can simply be replaced again and again every 30 days or so or at will. We have to amend this act. It is essential because, in the hands of vexatious people, it is a time bomb. It is a weapon to be used against people who are powerless. I am not talking about all Aboriginal people, just a very small number of people who are acting vexatiously at this time. I believe we need to amend this act urgently, and I will be looking at a private member's bill to do that shortly. An urgent solution is of enormous significance to the Australian people because this act is now being brought into disrepute by the actions of one or two people. East Perth Redevelopment Project",139
219,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to make some brief remarks about a Better Cities project in my electorate of Perth-the East Perth redevelopment project. Better Cities was a program instituted and implemented by the previous government and, unfortunately, in the run-up to last year's budget the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicated that no further funds would be made available for that program. The East Perth redevelopment project is an inner city redevelopment project. East Perth is perhaps most famous for the presence of the W ACA-where a travesty of justice is currently occurring-but other than that has in more recent years largely been an inner city semi-industrialised area. The East Perth redevelopment project seeks to tum East Perth into a residential area. The Commonwealth contributed $32 million and the state of Western Australia $68 million to this project. Whilst the state contribution was significant, it was clear from the outset that the project would never have gone ahead but for the Commonwealth's commitment and the Better Cities program. The contract between the state and the Commonwealth, which was signed in the early 1990s, had a clause for the provision of affordable housing in East Perth. People interested in the East Perth project, including members of the state government at the time, were concerned that there was a danger if no provision for affordable housing was made in the agreement that East Perth might become an enclave for the rich-a Nedlands or Dalkeith equivalent in the inner city on the river. The agreement between the state and the Commonwealth provided that a key objective of the East Perth redevelopment was to increase housing choice and affordability. It provided that dwellings for public and special needs housing be purchased and developed and that a program be initiated to establish a mechanism for the provision of affordable housing. Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to get the state government, the current Court coalition government, to meet its affordable housing obligation. Since early 1995, my state parliamentary colleague, the state member for Perth, Diana Warnock, and I have been pressing the state government to meet its affordable housing obligation under that contract. The approach and attitude of the state government has been one of avoidance and denial-the usual defence lawyers trick. The avoidance was first to say that the state was happy to provide affordable housing provided the Commonwealth paid for it under the Commonwealth's social housing subsidy program. When that approach was rejected by the former minister for regional development, the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, the state adopted the approach of denial. Mr Howe was successful, with urging from me and Diana Warnock, in extracting a commitment from the state Premier Richard Court that a 15 per cent affordable housing component would be provided in East Perth. That comes in at roughly a couple of hundred houses. Unfortunately, the current planning minister, Graham Kierath, has said in respect of East Perth in a letter which I have obtained through a publicly interested member of my electorate: The Authority is not obliged to provide any affordable housing under Building Better Cities Agreement with the Commonwealth. A separate draft agreement was negotiated in 1995 between the State and Commonwealth to provide shared equity, rental and community housing. This agreement required Commonwealth funding, however this funding was cut in the 1996/97 budget. Despite this the Authority will provide land for up to 50 dwellings to providers of affordable housing or housing for people with special needs. A nonmarket mechanism will be used at considerable ""opportunity cost"" to the Authority. That is in stark contrast to the commitment given publicly by the Premier of Western Australia in 1995 at the opening of Claisebrook Cove that a 15 per cent affordable housing component would be provided. Some $100 million of taxpayers' funds for a capital development project! That ain't bad for 50 houses. The view of the current state minister that the state government has no obligation to meet its affordable housing obligation to East Perth and to the Commonwealth is legally wrong, morally wrong and ethically wrong. Together with my state parliamentary colleague, I will be taking whatever steps I can to ensure that the state government meets its affordable housing contractual and policy obligations to the East Perth redevelopment. Defence",140
220,Mr BROUGH,ADJOURNMENT,"Longman) (11.59 p.m.)The events in Papua New Guinea in recent weeks highlight the importance Australia that must continue to accord its defence forces. It has shown just how tumultuous and how changeable our region is and that our defence forces must not only be well trained bQt well equipped and be ready at any time to respond to our defence needs. It is not enough to quarantine defence, as we have done in our 1996 budget and will continue to do, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, in the 1997 budget to be delivered in May. It is also important that Australian taxpayers and the Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen all get the very best that they can from every dollar we spend on defence. I question that this really is the case today. The Channel 9 program Sunday highlighted last weekend some deficiency in the defence procurement process and project management. In particular, it drew to the attention of the public the JORN project and the purchase of two ships which, having been purchased, were found subsequently to have considerable rust which had been undetected, costing some tens of millions of dollars to the Australian taxpayer which we had not considered. But it is not only major projects that Defence has struggled with. Like yourself, Mr Speaker, I too spent a good deal of time in the defence forces and one of my duties was as a trials and evaluations officer. That was back in 1984. At that time one of the projects being worked on by the infantry development staff at the infantry centre in Singleton was the general purpose boot, not exactly the most highly technical piece of equipment but, as they say, an army marches on its feet. The sad reality is that after 15 years of research and development we still do not have a boot suitable for Australian soldiers. It certainly looks good on a parade ground and it works very efficiently around the barracks but, after all, our defence forces are meant to be able to work in all terrain and all weather conditions. We saw that in the recent exercise Tandem Thrust. This boot does not meet those conditions. It is hard for the soldiers operate in. It is not suitable for long distance marching. The point I wish to make is that the GP boot is something which can be found on any army's feet throughout the world, yet we have spent 15 years developing something which is readily available off the market shelf and still we have not yet perfected it! It seems that the defence forces are very good at not only reinventing the wheel but then going on to further trial and evaluate that wheel to determine that, yes, the wheel will go round and be efficient. Then we will decide whether we will purchase it. I believe that we have wasted a great deal of money and have hindered the equipment that our soldiers have as a result of this procurement process. There are another two other issues I would like to mention about Defence at this time. One is our level of command structure. In 1986 we had some 26,423 other ranks, privates through to warrant officer class one. That compared to officers from second lieutenant through to our senior office of 4,362, about a 14 to one ratio of officer to other ranks. Today we have 19,316 other ranks as at 30 June 1996 and some 4,360, just two fewer, officers. That is now a ratio of one to five. So why do we need such a high structure of officers to other ranks? Here in Canberra there are literally thousands of Defence personnel, yet only 60 of those people are directly involved with operational command. We now see that the Defence Force is moving towards a new command structure, Headquarters Australian Theatre. I believe the principal oncosting of that is to ensure that the defence cost is no greater than the combined cost of the land, air and maritime commands. All that would seem a logical step but only if we then downgrade or scrap the role of land, air and maritime command, but I do not see that happening. It seems to me that we have a very small defence force with a very big command structure, an unwarrantedly large command structure. To bring that parallel into focus I draw on some figures from Great Britain. Understandably, they have a much greater defence budget than us, some four times to greater. They also have four times the overall manpower-that would be a logical conclusion. But when it comes down to line battalions, we have four and they have ll-a structure of more than 10 to one. It is the same for armed regiments. We have less than one armed regiment and they have 11. (Time expired) Tuesday, 25 March 1997 Australian Capital Territory",141
221,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Namadgi) (12.04 a.m.)Tonight I take the opportunity to talk about a couple of aspects of life in the ACT which I would like to bring to the attention of this House. Things are pretty tough, as I have said on numerous occasions in this place, in the ACT. We saw again in newspaper reports that house prices are remaining down and in fact dropping against the national trend. The economy here is in a pretty tough state at the moment. But there is a positive side to our community which I think we need to recognise and pay tribute to, despite the difficulties they find themselves in. We have in the ACT an excellent licensed club industry. They are employers of large numbers of people. They run excellent training programs for young people and all of the clubs in the ACT, big or small, contribute very generously back to their community. They, along with a lot of other industries in the ACT at the moment, are finding it extremely difficult to continue with that sort of work because of the economic pressure they find themselves under. However, I would like to bring to the attention of the House tonight an example of how, despite those difficulties, when something unpredictable occurs in our community the club industry is very quick to respond with the community in which they operate. We had a very tragic event in my electorate a few weeks ago when a young woman in her early 20s, I think she is 22, suffered a very violent attack. As a result of this violent assault, she received bums to 45 per cent of her body on her upper torso and face. She was in fact set alight by her assailant. She now in the bums unit at Concord Hospital in Sydney. She is from the Laotian community-a community which celebrates a very good lifestyle in the ACT. Needless to say, the impact on her family, as well as the community of which this young lass is a member, was immense. But it was very quickly recognised that some assistance was needed to help Monia in her treatment and recovery and to help her family through this very difficult time. So one of the large clubs in my electorate the Tuggeranong Valley Rugby Union and Amateur Sports Club got together with leaders from the Laotian community which I might add, even though it is a reasonable size, is not one of our biggest ethnic communities here, and in a matter of days arranged a very large fundraising effort. The reason for this was quite simple and quite evident-that is, because of the length of time Monia is going to be in Sydney, her family basically closed up the house and moved there to try to support her and do what they could to help. It was recognised that some financial assistance was needed. Hundreds of people attended this function. They came from the Laotian community primarily. They came from near and far, from Sydney and from all around the region and from the ACT. It was a pleasure to walk into that room that evening and see not only a thousand or more people gathering to help out, but also the ethnic mix in that room. The club, and particularly Mr Barry Masters, organised and sponsored the event. Many thousands of dollars were raised. The last I knew the amount was just under $9,000, but I have not heard the most recent tally. The community wish Monia a speedy and full recovery and, to her family, all the support and encouragement they need in getting through this difficult time. The main thing that we need to note is that, despite things like economic downturns and difficulties in getting through tragedies like this, we in the ACT-as I am sure elsewhere in the country--enjoy a wonderful community spirit, which at the time that it needs to demonstrate itself has no difficulty in doing is so. It is a good thing to ponder and to take time to recognise the efforts of people like Mr Masters and the staff, particularly at that club, and the organisers on the Laotian committee executive here in the ACT, and to congratulate them on having the initiative to get together so quickly to organise something so difficult so successfully. I notice in my calendar that we will be celebrating Laotian new year on 12 April in the ACT. I don't think we could wish Monia a better Laotian new year than a successful, speedy and full recovery. My congratulations to everybody concerned in this community effort. Stanwell Tops Hanging Swamp",142
222,Mrs VALE,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring to the attention of this parliament a threat to a unique wetland area in my electorate of Hughes at the northern end of the Illawarra escarpment, midway between Sydney and Wollongong. It is known as the Stanwell Tops hanging swamp and is an area of outstanding scenic beauty. It is a relatively small but regionally significant wetland, recognised as a botanical, educational and scientific resource, and mainly under the ownership of about two landholders. It falls within the Stanwell Park coastal conservation area classified by the National Trust and, as such, is relevant to the coastcare program. Briefly described, Hargraves Creek rises about two kilometres west of the rim of the Illawarra escarpment at Stanwell Tops, drains through the hanging swamp to the scenic and historic mineral pool on the rim and then plunges over the cliff waterfall, down the escarpment through littoral rainforest gullies, through to the Stanwell Park beach northern lagoon. The lagoon and beach are popular visitor destinations, surrounded by an amphitheatre of lush green hills and Bald Hill, a venue for world championship hang-gliding events. These spectacular areas will doubtless be on display to the world during the Sydney Olympic Games as scenic drawcards. A world-class walking trail is being constructed linking the Royal National Park southwards to the Illawarra escarpment and ultimately to Ulladulla. This trail passes the hanging swamp, which is therefore a vital link in the chain. Valiant efforts have been made over the years to safeguard the Illawarra escarpment and this wetland. Wollongong City Council commendably pioneered a fair trade policy for that purpose. This policy allows some development entitlements for trading of other lands to the Illawarra State Recreation Area but, in this case, it has been inadequate. Despite all the good intentions, this wetland is now under imminent threat from an unsewered development application for six lots only a few metres from the swamp. This would inevitably lead to ribbon development along most of the northern edge of the wetland. It not only makes good ecological sense to preserve this wetland from more unsewered development, but it makes economic sense due to the concerns over increased hard surface stormwater run-off affecting the stability of the Illawarra railway line below the escarpment in an area renowned for landslip problems. This is the most expensive section of railway line in Australia, consuming enormous amounts of taxpayers' money to protect it from landslip. State Rail has had deep concerns about impacts on the stability of the rail line below the escarpment through altered water flows from extra hard surface areas and diversions from this high rainfall area. This section of the rail line is notoriously unstable and costly to maintain, thus the resources of other state departments should be involved. The small Hargraves Creek catchment is within the Stanwell Park coastal conservation area and is classified by the National Trust. Thus, coastcare federal and state wetlands policies should reasonably apply. It would be a massive blunder not to initiate negotiations to acquire the handful of lots involved to protect this precious swamp, the walking trail, the railway line and the Stanwell Park beach. In accordance with Senator Hill's statement that it is time for the federal government and the states to work together to save what is left of our wetlands, I urge our government to immediately commence negotiations to preserve this wetland to a complete creek catchment basis as a loop walk of the walking trail through public acquisition. Otherwise, it will become another wetland lost. It would be a sad day for Australia when the combined resources of the federal and state governments could not acquire a mere handful of lots to preserve this very small but very precious wetland. Following on from Senator Hill's welcome announcements, and before it is too late, our government should take up that relatively low cost pledge and safeguard the significant stretches of spectacular Illawarra escarpment for the benefit and enjoyment of all Australians and future generations. I look forward to some positive and urgent action on these important issues. One of my constituents, Mr Maurie Dowson of Stanwell Tops, has worked tirelessly and hard for many years to protect this excellent and unique wetland of high regional significance and has worked with other dedicated local identities as the Illawarra Escarpment Coalition. To date, they have been successful in their efforts to preserve this delightful area. I look forward to some positive and urgent action from our government on these important issues.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Search and Rescue (SAR) Pty Ltd (Question No. 802) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice on 8 October 1996: (1) What sum (a) was originally quoted by Search and Rescue (SAR) Pty Ltd for the sale of search and rescue equipment to Airservices Australia and (b) will Airservices pay for the equipment. (2) Is Airservices Australia conducting a normal tendering process for the purchase of the equipment. (3) Has the training program for the operation of the Precision Aerial Deployment System (PADS) been contracted to the person who chaired the committee charged with evaluating the merits of PADS; if so, was the contract put out to tender. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) I am advised by Airservices Australia that in the tender process for purchase of equipment in 1995, SAR Pty Ltd tendered a per unit price ranging from $4,500 to $3,600 (depending on volume) for precision Aerial Delivery Systems (PADS) equipment, $1,250 for storpedos, plus $435 for each static line. On 6 August 1996 the Chief Executive Officer of SAR Pty Ltd confirmed orally to the Chairman of Airservices Australia that the PADS unit prices would remain the same as the rates contained in the 12 May SAR Pty Ltd tender proposal. (b) In a contract concluded on 18 September 1996, a price of $4,950 per unit including the static line and $ J ,550 per unit for storpedos was settled. (2) No. The Airservices Australia board resolved that in the event it is determined by an independent panel of experts that the Airservices Search and Rescue delivery system should be replaced partially or in full by equipment available from SAR Pty Ltd or a third party, then the replacement system shall be purchased within a financial limit of not more than $1 million. The decision was based on safety and public interest consideration. Airservices was already aware of the capability of alternative suppliers of search and rescue equipment from a previous tendering process and NA made this information available to the independent panel of experts. (3) No. The independent panel which evaluated the merits of search and rescue equipment, including the PADS equipment, was chaired by Mr Frank Young. Training of Civil SAR Units (CSUs) was to be conducted by Airservices, using three teams comprising Airservices dropmasters and pilot instructors contracted from the industry. Mr Young was contracted as a consultant to Airservices to coordinate and manage the delivery of the equipment and training to Airservices. Airservices Australia have advised me that they did not obtain competitive quotes for the consultancy because safety and public interest considerations necessitated urgent action. Government and Non-Government Schools Funding: Electoral Divsions of Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay (Question No. 854) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) What sums were granted (a) in 1990-91, (b) in 1991-92, (c) in 1992-93, (d) in 1993-94 (e) in 1994-95 and (f) between 1 July 1995 and 1 October 1996 to (i) government and (ii) non government schools in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay. (2) With respect to each grant referred to in part (1), what (a) sum was granted, (b) was the location of the recipient and (c) purpose for which grant was made. Dr Kemp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Commonwealth assistance is provided on a calendar year basis and the following are the identifiable grants to schools in the electorates since 1990. General recurrent grants to government schools are distributed by State and Territory Governments and details are not held by the Commonwealth. Information on the Disadvantaged Schools and Country Areas elements of National Equity Programs for schools in 1995 and 1996 for the above electorates are not yet available.

Prior to 1 January 1994 Commonwealth funding for T AFE colleges was allocated under the State Grants (T AFE Assistance) Act 1992 and paid directly to State and Territory Governments, who then determined the amount of recurrent funding to each individual college. Since 1 January 1994 Commonwealth funding has been allocated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1994 and has been paid to the Australian National Training Authority (ANT A). Recurrent funding is then disbursed by ANTA to each State and Territory which then determines the payment to each individual TAFE college. Currently the Commonwealth provides approximately 25.3% of the total funding for the TAFE system throughout Australia. However, the Commonwealth is not responsible for disbursement of funds to individual T AFE colleges and has no record relating to that funding. Commonwealth capital funding (approximately 63.5% of total funding) is determined individual T AFE colleges by ANTA in consultation with State and Territory Governments. Capital funding for TAFE colleges in the electorate of SWAN; South East Metropolitan College of TAFEBentley Campus In 1995 approval was given for a $650,000 child care centre. There are problems with this project and it may not proceed. No other Commonwealth capital funding has been provided in recent years. South East Metropolitan College of T AFECarlisle Campus No Commonwealth funding for capital projects has been provided in recent years. Capital funding for TAFE colleges of BRAND; South Metropolitan College of TAFERockingham Campus In 1990 and 1991 $533,100 was provided to construct a 45 place child care centre. No other Commonwealth capital funding has been provided in recent years. South Metropolitan College of TAFE-Peel Campus The Commonwealth has provided $6.46 million over 1994-96 for the construction of Stage 1 of a new campus at Peel. NB Percentages figures obtained from Summary of planned expenditure for 1996 (ANTA's Directions and Resource Allocations for 1996).

Australian Defence Industries, St Marys: Accident (Question No. 1033)  Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 4 December 1996: (1) Has her attention been drawn to an accident that occurred at the Australian Defence Industries Shell filling factory at St Marys in the last week of its operation, where four workers were injured whilst dismantling a defective grenade. (2) Is it a fact that such factories should operate at the highest world standards of safety. (3) Has her attention been drawn to reports that there will not be a coronial inquiry into the accident. (4) Is it a fact that more than the prescribed number of workers were around the table at the time of the accident and that other safety standards were breached. (5) Will she have a coronial inquiry into the accident. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, I am aware of the incident. (2) AD! has written to me advising that safety is accorded the highest priority by AD!' s board, management and workforce. The Company has also advised me that it follows the highest possible safety standards. (3) In accordance with Section 15 of the New South Wales Coroners Act 1980, the coroner must hold an inquiry where a fire or explosion has destroyed or damaged any property. If, however, the coroner is of the opinion that the circumstances do not warrant an inquiry, a formal inquiry may be dispensed with. In this case, I am advised that the State Coroner made an order dispensing with the holding of an inquiry but did not give a reason. (4) I am advised that although seven employees were present in the area at the time of the incident, there were not seven employees at the table. Only four people were working at the table, in accordance with recognised procedure. The remaining three employees were engaged in other activities, remote from the work table. (5) See (3). Royal Australian Navy: Australian Defence Industries, Lithgow (Question No. 1087) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 11 December 1996: (1) Has her attention been drawn to a Department of Defence advertisement appearing in the Cumberland Classifieds on 26 November 1996 stating that the Naval Support Command of the Royal Australian Navy is building a machine shop at the defence facility in Orchard Hills, NSW and calling for applications for workshop staff. (2) Will this facility manufacture weapon components, fixtures, tooling and material handling gear. (3) Can this type of manufacturing be carried out by the Australian Defence Industries (ADI) small arms factory in Lithgow, NSW; if not, why not. (4) If this type of manufacturing can be carried out by AD! Lithgow, why is the Government establishing a new plant while downsizing a Government-owned factory in Lithgow. (5) Did she bring to the attention of the Department of Defence the ability of AD! Lithgow to complete this type of work when the proposal to build the new workshop at Orchard Hills was in the planning stage; if so, why was AD! Lithgow rejected; if not, why not. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The capability of ADI Lithgow, or any other company, to undertake the type of work intended for the Orchard Hills workshop was not investigated. I am advised the circumstances were as follows: After conducting a cost benefit analysis, the decision to manufacture in-house was a value for money decision balanced against the ongoing need for the equipment to remain in-service and to be operationally available. The unique qualities of the nature of the work formerly undertaken by the Royal Australian Navy Torpedo Maintenance Establishment, and now intended for the relocated workshop at Orchard Hills, ultimately has an effect on the cost of the final product to Navy. The manufacturing jobs which are undertaken cover a very wide variety of items which are nearly always required in small quantities and involve unusual and expensive materials which are not required in commercial quantities. (4) The workshop at Orchard Hills is a new building, however, the actual manufacturing activity is an existing activity which is being relocated due to restructuring within the Department. The manufacturing workshop capability has existed as an essential element of the Naval Support Command's armaments logistics support infrastructure since 1942 when the RAN Torpedo Maintenance Establishment was constructed to manufacture torpedoes and replacement spare parts. (5) As outlined in my response to part 3, the capability of commercial firms was not investigated so the situation did not arise. Overseas Property Transactions (Question No. 1089)  Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: Is he able to provide details on the procedures which must be followed by Australian nationals and corporations who wish to (a) purchase or (b) lease (i) residential land, (ii) residential property, (iii) commercial land or (iv) commercial property in (A) the USA, (B) Japan, (C) Hong Kong, (D) Singapore, (E) Malaysia, (F) Taiwan, (G) Thailand and (H) the United Kingdom. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information in respect of the matters referred to in the honourable member's question is not readily available. It would be a major task, both in Australia and overseas, to collect this information and I am not prepared to authorise the time and staff resources which would be required to do so. Private Health Insurers (Question No. 1228) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) Does current legislation governing private health insurers require them to assist with the payment of medical expenses while a compensation payment is pending, by making a provisional payment subject to repayment on settlement of the compensation claim; if not, will he consider making provisional payments compUlsory. (2) Do some health funds do so voluntarily; if so, which funds.",143
223,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,OF BRAND,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no legislative requirement for private health insurers to pay benefits for cases which are likely to be covered by compensation claims. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 was introduced to ensure that the Commonwealth is reimbursed where people receive Medicare or nursing home benefits for an injury and then subsequently receive a compensation judgement or settlement that includes the cost of treatment for the injury. The Government has given Parliament an undertaking to review the scheme after July 1997. The matter of making provisional payments compulsory will be considered as part of the review of this program. (2) In general, as there is no simple route for health funds to be reimbursed in the event that a person is successful in a compensation claim, the funds have adopted rules that expressly provide that benefits are not payable in respect of a condition, injury or ailment covered by a compensation claim. Air Service to Norfolk Island: Cessation (Question No. 1246) Mr MCMullan asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 5 February 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a decision announced by Ansett that it is to cease regular air services to Norfolk Island from 1 July 1997. (2) Has he held discussions with the Norfolk Island Government on this matter; if so, what discussions. (3) Has he held discussion with (a) Ansett, (b) Qantas and (c) other potential air service providers to seek adequate access to the Australian mainland for Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island, if so, what discussions. (4) What plans does the Government have to ensure access to the mainland for residents of Norfolk Island. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes. I met with the Norfolk Island Minister for Tourism and Finance, Mr Mike King. Advisers from my office were also involved in separate discussions with Mr King organised by the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer. (3) Advisers from my office have held discussions with Hight West, National Jet System and Qantas about air services to Norfolk Island. (4) The level of air services is a commercial matter for the airlines concerned and potential new entrants. Following Ansett's announcement of its withdrawal from the Sydney-Norfolk Island route, effective from 1 July, a number of airlines have expressed an interest in providing services to Norfolk Island, and are talking with Norfolk Island officials. My Office has facilitated these discussions and I have instructed my Department to process without delay approvals required by any operator intending to operate scheduled services to Norfolk Island. This should minimise the impact of Ansett's decision on the Norfolk Island community. International Court of Justice (Question No. 1260) Mr Melham asked to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 February 1997: (1) What are the names, nationalities and personal qualifications of the five members of the International Court of Justice who have been elected for a nine year term beginning on 6 February 1997. (2) By and from which countries were nominations made for the five vacancies. (3) Who were the members of the Australian National Group which made recommendations and whom did they nominate. (4) Have any states made or terminated declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court since the answer to question No. 1392 (Hansard, 19 October 1994, page 2431). Mr Downer-the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The five members elected to the Intemational Court of Justice for the term beginning 5 February 1997 were: BEDJAOUI, Mohammed (Algeria): Judge of the International Court of Justice since 1982 (President of the Court 1994-1997); VERESHCHETIN, Vladlen S.

(Russian Federation): Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Spain, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America; (3) The members of the Australian National group were: Sir Anthony Mason, KBE, National Fellow, Australian National University; The Right Honourable Sir Ninian Stephen, AK, GCMG, GCOV, KBE, Judge International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Somalia; Dr Gavan Griffith, AO QC, Solicitor-General of Australia; Professor Ivan Shearer AM, Challis Professor of International Law, Faculty of Law, University of Sydney. The Australian National Group nominated Pieter Kooijmans (Netherlands) and Stephen Schwebel (United States of America). (4) The states which have made declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction on the Court since 19 October 1994 are: Georgia (20 June 1995); Poland (25 March 1996); and Paraguay (25 September 1996). Poland's declaration replaced an earlier declaration, which was thereby terminated. Public Dental Services (Question No. 1274) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports that (a) Victorian families will be charged up to $100 each year from March 1997 to have their children provided with dental treatment in schools and (b) pensioners will be charged at least $20 each visit from April 1997 for dental work. (2) If so, have the charges been introduced by the Victorian Government as a result of federal Government funding cuts. (3) Has his attention been drawn to payments being introduced in other States to offset the abolition of federal funding of the Dental Health Program.",188
224,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,OF BRAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There has been some press comment on the introduction, or re-introduction, of charges for public dental services in some States. (2) From 1 January 1997, States and Territories resumed full responsibility for public dental services for their residents. States will determine, always, what services they provide and the basis for that provision. (3) See (1) and (2) above. Rosebud Hospital, Victoria (Question No. 1275) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the appointment of a company associated with Dr G. Edelsten to operate services at Rosebud Hospital in Victoria. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to reports that private operators at Rosebud Hospital are charging up to double the previous rate for non pensioners and health care card holders treated in the casualty section. (3) Is he able to state whether the Victorian Premier has plans to expand the role of private operators into other Victorian public hospitals; if so, does he support those plans.",190
225,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,OF BRAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of media reports to this effect. (2) Yes. My Department has written to the Secretary of the Victorian Department of Human Services: - advising that, under the Medicare Agreement with Victoria, all residents are entitled to a comprehensive range of hospital services free of charge; and - requesting investigation of the charging for accident and emergency services at Rosebud Hospital, including what action will be taken to ensure compliance with the Medicare Agreement. (3) No. Greenslopes Private Hospital, Brisbane (Question No. 1283) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (I) Is he able to say (a) what palliative care services are provided at the Greenslopes Private Hospital, Brisbane, (b) what changes have occurred in the provision of palliative care since the Commonwealth Government relinquished ownership and control of Greenslopes Hospital and (c) how many specialists in palliative care (i) are and (ii) were engaged at the hospital. (2) Is he also able to say whether the Royal College of Surgeons or other bodies provided advice concerning the relevant number of palliative as care specialists required at Greenslopes Hospital; if so, what was that advice.",190
226,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,OF BRAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Greenslopes Private Hospital is a privately owned and operated hospital. Therefore the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction over its operations. However, I have been informed that: (1) (a) Palliative care at Greenslopes Private Hospital is provided within the specific speciality unit relevant for the patient, with the support of a wide range of other specialists. Some patients are managed within the Pain Management Unit and are under the care of Anaesthetists who specialise in Pain Management. Specialist nursing and allied health care is provided in this unit for both inpatients and outpatients. Many patients are managed within the Haematology/Oncology Unit where the doctors and staff have expertise in this area. The hospital also has close links with a Radiation Oncologist who regularly visits the hospital. The Cancer Care Group provides education and support to patients with cancer. This group comprises an Oncologist, Psychologist, Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist, Speech Therapist, Dietitian, Pharmacist and specialised nursing staff. (b) Palliative care services are provided now in the same way as they were prior to privatisation in January 1995. (c) There are 212 specialists working at Greenslopes Private Hospital, more than there were prior to privatisation. An additional Pain Management Consultant and an additional Oncologist have been appointed. Some of these specialists have palliative care knowledge. (2) As no major changes were made, it has not been considered necessary to obtain outside advice. However, the Royal Australian College of Anaesthetists have inspected the hospital and granted accreditation for a training position in Anaesthetics. The position includes Pain Management Training. The hospital has also been awarded full accreditation status by the Australian Council on Healthcare standards. In addition, a 12-member Hospital Advisory Committee provides advice on medical matters including services and the appointment of specialists. The Committee was closely involved in the setting up of the current hospital structure and services. Many Greenslopes' doctors are members of college committees and professional bodies. Ross River Fever (Question No. 1292) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 11 February 1997: (1) How many cases of Ross River Fever have been diagnosed (a) in total and (b) each )m'sim: it was first diagnosed. (2) What sums have been spent on research into the fever (a) in total and (b) each year since it was first diagnosed, and what has been the nature of the research. (3) What future plans are there for research and vaccine development.",190
227,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,OF BRAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the period 1971-1990, a total of 10,870 cases of arbovirus infection were notified to the States and Territories. In some States and Territories, however, the condition was notifiable during only a few of those years. It is highly likely that the vast majority of the 10,870 cases were due to Ross River Virus (RRV), and that most of the remainder were due to infection with the closely related virus Barrnah Forest Virus (BFV), which causes similar symptoms. Ross River Virus (RRV) was first isolated and named in Queensland in 1963. Epidemics of disease, now recognised as probably being due to the virus, have been recorded since the 1880s and have occurred in all parts of Australia. The condition was named ""epidemic polyarthritis"" in the 1940s. No national statistics on RRV (or on other arbovirus infections of the types causing polyarthritis) are available prior to 1971. Between 1991 and 1996, the States and Territories progressively distinguished RRV and BFV as separate categories in communicable disease statistics. Notifications of (RRV) infection in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) for the period 1991 to the present are as follows:2. 1991 3532 cases 1992 5630 1993 5428 1994 3960 1995 2602 1996 7782 1997 452 cases (to 4 February 1997) Total between 1990 to February 1997: 29386 In addition, 1635 cases of BFV infection were notified during this period; and also 1883 cases of ""arbovirus infection"", most of which would have been due to either BFV or RRV. (2) The National Health and Medical Research Council is the main source of Government funding for health and medical research. The Council's records of research grants prior to 1979 are not computerised making searching very difficult. However a search of records since that time shows that research into aspects of RRV and the disease it causes has been funded each year. (a) A total of $1.736 million has been allocated to this research to date. (b) The expenditure on Ross River Virus research for each year is as follows: 1979-$14,659 1980-$16,217 1981-$34,286 1982-$22,587 1983-$48,026 1984-$88,059 1985-$87,156 1986-$102,185 1987-$58,642 1988-$29,951 1989-$77,858 1990-$82,263 1991-$90,783 1992-$63,348 1993-$102,772 1994-$184,073 1995-$238,671 1996-242,721 1997-$151,879 The nature of the research may be determined from the titles of the supported research projects as follows: 1979-81 An examination of immunity to Ross River Virus infection 1982-84 An examination of immunity to Ross River Virus infection 1981 Molecular biology and molecular epidemiology of Ross River Viruses 1983-85 Virulence determinants and genetic variation in Ross River Virus 1984-86 Ross River Virus and human disease 1985-87 A study of how Ross River Virus causes arthritis 1986-88 Ross River Virus virulence determinants 1989-92 Causation and diagnosis of Ross River Virus disease 1989-91 A study of the Ross River Virus receptor binding domain and cell receptor 1992-96 Molecular studies on mosquito-borne viruses 1993-96 Growth of Ross River Virus in mosquitoes 1994-96 More Ross River transmission with global warming? 1994-96 The role of immune cells in Ross River disease 1995-97 A study of structure and function of genes and proteins of viruses causing polyarthritis 1996-98 Ecology and control of arbovirus disease in South East Queensland 1996-98 The ecology of Ross River Virus in tropical Queensland 1997-99 How Ross River Virus causes arthritis (3) The NHMRC has funded these research projects through its competitive system of investigator initiated research proposals and will continue to fund research proposals in this area which meet its criteria for scientific excellence. The NHMRC is about to commence a new Triennium. The Principal Committee structure is to change in this Triennium with a Strategic Research Development Committee to be responsible for targeted research. One of the major tasks will be to identify public health issues that require urgent research. It is intended that the process for setting priorities for targeted research will be evidence based and transparent. This process will involve analysis of quantifiable information, such as morbidity and mortality data, and information that would enable assessment of the likely cost-effectiveness of the research in reducing morbidity and mortality. Infectious diseases would be included in this analysis. Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Consultancies (Question No. 1313) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 February 1997: (l) How many consultancies valued at $5000 or more have been commissioned by the Minister's Department since 1 April 1996.

(2) Are other services of AUSLIG to be contracted out; if so, what progress has been made. (3) What effect will these initiatives have on the community service obligations of AUSLIG. (4) Will full funding be maintained for AUSLIG's community service obligations. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable Member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Over forty organisations responded to an Invitation to Register Interest in the purchase of AUSLIG's commercial activities. Of these, eleven are being invited to lodge tenders. It is expected that the sale process will be completed by the end of this financial year. (2) Operational work related to AUSLIG's community service obligation program is being market tested for outsourcing where appropriate. A request for tender for topographic map and data production has been distributed for industry comment and requests for proposals for laser ranging and product distribution are being prepared. It is expected that contracts for map and data production will be finalised by July 1997 and that contracts for laser ranging and product distribution will be finalised bY October 1997. (3) AUSLIG's community service obligations comprise responsibility for co-ordination of Commonwealth land information programs and advice to Government on land information issues; policy, co-ordination and standards for Australia's National Spatial Data Infrastructure; and management of national mapping, geodesy, remote sensing and maritime boundaries programs. By outsourcing operational aspects of these essential programs, the Government if focusing AUSLIG on their management with a view to improving service delivery. (4) It is expected that, within the context of preparations for the 1997-98 Budget, funding will be maintained at current levels. Land Mine Detector (Question No. 1352) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 February 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the development by a New Zealand inventor of a land mine detector which uses microwave techniques to detect plastic-based land mines. (2) Is the Government taking steps to support the further development and use of this technique; if so, what. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) The Department of Defence, through the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), is conducting research through a variety of techniques, into ways to counter plastic-based landmines. As part of this research, DSTO has investigated microwave radiation as a method both of detecting and of clearing these types of landmines. I understand that the research indicates only some types of landmines, in particular mines which contain electronic circuitry or large amounts of microwave conducting material, can be detected and/or neutralised with microwave radiation. The majority of plastic mines, however, contain no electronics and little or no conducting material remain unaffected by microwaves, particularly when buried. On the other hand, the use of radar at some microwave frequencies shows more promise. Nevertheless, I have asked DSTO to investigate whether the particular New Zealand development should be followed up. Ross River Fever (Question No. 1356) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 26 February 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports detailing the increased danger mosquitoes pose to the health of Australians by transporting Ross River Fever and other debilitating viruses; if so, what action is the Government taking to combat the spread of mosquito-borne viruses in Australia. (2) Has he received any advice or information forecasting the future dangers mosquito-borne viruses pose to Australians; if so, is he able to say whether (a) problems related to mosquito-borne viruses in Australia will worsen and (b) Australia is expected to suffer outbreaks of malaria and other tropical diseases in future.",192
229,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,KPMG,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of press reports that the combination of a wet winter, high river levels and late summer rains and flooding in some parts of Australia have resulted in a high number of mosquitoes responsible for transmitting Ross River virus. I am advised that such increases in mosquito populations are known to occur from time to time and do not necessarily represent an effect of long-term climate change. Responsibility for action in the control of mosquito and mosquito-borne disease control lies primarily with the States and Territories. I am advised that, in the areas currently at risk of Ross River Virus and other serious mosquito-borne infections, State and Territory health authorities are undertaking action to clean up breeding sites for mosquitoes and to inform the public about how to reduce the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes through the use of mosquito avoidance and selfprotection measures. The Commonwealth role in the area of mosquitoborne disease control is in monitoring and coordination and in the support of appropriate research. Surveillance and coordination are undertaken through the Communicable Disease Network of Australia and New Zealand (CDNANZ), which includes representatives of the Commonwealth, the State and Territory health authorities and other and relevant bodies. The funding of research into mosquito-borne diseases has been provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). For research on Ross River Virus funds totalling $1,156,510.00 have been allocated over the past 8 years. (2) I am advised that the issue of forecasting the future dangers to Australians of mosquito-borne viruses was addressed by the NHMRC in their 1991 report, ""Health implications of long-term climate change"". This report notes that it is difficult to predict the effects of climate change on the incidence of mosquito-borne disease, particularly as infection with many of the viruses may not result in clinically detectable illness or symptoms. Although there is a theoretical potential for outbreaks of malaria and increased incidence of other vectorborne diseases resulting from climate change, surveillance to date has not shown such a trend. The Commonwealth and State and Territory Health authorities are continuing to monitor the situation closely through the CDNANZ. Health Insurance Commission, Tuggeranong ACT: Staff (Question No. 1394) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: (1) How many (a) full-time, (b) part-time permanent and (c) temporary staff were employed under the Public Service Act in the Tuggeranong, ACT, office of the Health Insurance Commission on 2 March (i) 1996 and (ii) 1997.",196
230,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,KPMG,"the answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) Nil Methadone Drug Rehabilitation Program (Question No. 1403) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: Does the Commonwealth have a role in providing (a) funding, (b) equipment, (c) administrative support, (d) drugs and pharmaceuticals or (e) other assistance for the methadone drug rehabilitation program in NSW; if so, what.",197
231,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,KPMG,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Commonwealth contributes to the funding of methadone treatment programs in NSW (and other jurisdictions) through allocations appropriated under the National Drug Strategy special purpose payments; funding of the supply of concentrated methadone syrup; and the payment of Medicare benefits for private sector methadone consultations and urinalysis. In 1996/97, NSW will receive $6.891m under the National Drug Strategy special purpose payments. This allocation is designed to contribute to a broad range of drug activities including prevention, education, treatment as well as rehabilitation, research and training. Under these arrangements, States and Territories determine local needs and priorities for the actual allocation of funds. (b) No equipment is provided by the Commonwealth to NSW for methadone services. (c) No administrative support is provided by the Commonwealth for methadone services in NSW beyond the administration of Medicare claims by the Health Insurance Commission for services relating to private methadone treatment. (d) The Commonwealth funds the supply of concentrated methadone syrup to wholesale distributors through Section 100 payments (under the National Health Act 1953). The cost of dispensing methadone in NSW is met by the NSW Government (for clients treated in the public sector) or by methadone clients themselves (if they are treated by private practitioners). (e) The Commonwealth also funds research into new treatment options and the development of standards for best practice, encouraging the development of policies that are consistent in all States and Territories. Department of Primary Industries and Energy Paper Supplies: Australian Fibre Content (Question No. 1446) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 5 March, 1997: Have samples 0f the paper products purchased by the Minister's Department been examined by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories or private sector alternatives to establish or verify the Australian fibre content. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, however the recycled paper used by the Department is 100% recycled fibre which is taken from waste office paper gathered from the capital cities through the Australian Paper Chase programme. Woods, Senator Bob (Question No. 1462) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 5 March 1997: Was an office at 314 Church Street, Parramatta, NSW, leased by his Department on behalf of Senator Woods; if so, (a) what area was leased, (b) did the area leased remain constant throughout the tenure, (c) what was the period of the lease, (d) what was the rental price, (e) was the area leased inclusive of ground and first floors and (f) who was the lessor. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. It was occupied by Dr Woods until 30 March 1996. It is now occupied by Mr Ross Cameron MP, Member for Parramatta. Details sought are: (a) 140 m2 (b) Yes (c) 15 August 1994 to 14 August 1997 (d) $49,000 p.a. (e) Ground floor only (0 William Chi Kwan and Chi Kei Kwan",197
